THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Crédit Suisse.
Please proceed with your question.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And obviously, really great results. I just wanted to get a little more color on your gross margin
expectations for the year. You talked about transitory reasons for why gross margin would be down in first
quarter. And I think -- are you still guiding to gross margin expansion? And to what extent do you need
like the incremental pricing to get that gross margin to turn the other way? And I would think some of
these higher costs that you're talking about, like freight, co-packing, it sounds like you'll need to keep
doing those things beyond just first quarter, maybe a little more color there.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So let me have Steve take that one.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Happy to. So yes, we are still calling for modest gross margin expansion on a full year basis. As
you noted and we had in the remarks, there were some transitory impacts in the first quarter, some
lapping from last year, some also cost in response to the higher volume. As we look forward for the rest
of the year, some of the things that are strengths for us, the productivity gains, the additional volume,
the pricing that you referenced, all of that will be part of building that gross margin. So far, for the first
quarter and even as we look out for the year, I would say our inflation assumptions are largely tracking
to what we had in plan, and the one exception that we noted was packaging. And I think that is one
we'll watch. Our expectation is that inflation will moderate some as the year plays out, impacted a bit by
weather in Texas for the first quarter. So that's one we're watching.

And then in any carryforward of incremental cost to support the higher volume. And with more runway
here in the balance of the year, we'll have more opportunities to optimize between customer service and
manufacturing capacity and the cost of support. So we're keeping a close watch on all those. But yes, at
this point, we still see some gross margin expansion over the course of the year.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And one follow-up. The new price increase on grocery and nonchocolate, can you give us a sense of
what it presents both in absolute terms and also on an annualized basis once it fully flows through?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So we see it total pricing for this year across all the price increases, order of magnitude about 100
basis points, about half of that is the nonchocolate piece. And again, reference there is we haven't priced
that part of the portfolio since 2014. So this is in line with our broader strategy. We've talked about of
rotating and refreshing pricing in parts of the portfolio.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. So on an annualized basis, does that mean it's 1%, 2% to the total business? Or...

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, annualized, it's about 1 point for this year. It's about 50 basis points.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just following on pricing a little bit. You said the 1 point to 1.5 on expectations for the year. And I
mentioned that a lot of that reflects the pricing you just took and some of the promotional benefit in
the first quarter. You also just mentioned that the packaging inflation should moderate. You've got some
relatively benign things like cocoa costs and dairy at least so far.

But if you were to look for more pricing, say, if packaging didn't come in the way you're expecting, how
nimble can you be? And what sort of timing does it take to flow some of this through? How much upside to
the 1 to 1.5, could we end up seeing?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It depends on which parts of the portfolio that we would price. Obviously, the seasonal part takes a
pretty long lead time. And so really, that's not something that would be in the card for this year. On an
everyday basis, we probably need at least 3 to 4 months of lead time. And so you could say there's still
some optionality there. If we were to see some worst-case scenarios from a cost standpoint. Right now,
that's not in the plan. I think we feel good about the plan that we have for pricing. But as I said, we'll
monitor what's happening from a cost standpoint.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. That's great. And just a follow-up on the e-commerce side. I believe you've said that those margins
might be somewhere around 100 to 150 basis points lower, but as it scales, that should improve. How
have you seen that change over this past year with the benefit of the surge and obviously, a bigger scale
base now?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. From a dilution standpoint, given you're in the right ZIP code. It's a bit dilutive to the overall margin.
Obviously, that piece of the business, as we've talked about in prior calls, has gotten bigger. But at the
same time, we continue to look for ways to drive efficiency there and optimize inside that business to
bring those margins closer in line with the rest of the portfolio.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Do you have a sense of just the timing for what that might take? Is that a multiyear process? Or would
some of this surge that's kind of still sticking now would be a big help towards narrowing that gap?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. It's a multiyear process for sure. I mean the scale does help. We get more scale across some of the
investments and capabilities that we put there. So there is some benefit there in the present, but really to
address the full dilution, it's going to be a multiyear process.

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Our next question is coming from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I had 2 questions. First is on just shelf space. So clearly, Hershey has done a phenomenal job on
execution, gains in 2020, gains in early 2021. I'm just curious given how your momentum continues, if
you would expect to see or have discussions with retailers, regarding more space later this year, but also
in 2022? That's the first question.

And then the second question is just on -- given the online momentum that you've been seeing and the
clear stickiness that we've seen, how are you thinking about the supply chain and kind of reorienting the
supply chain to make sure that you can continue to effectively execute as the online business continues to
grow?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So let me first go to the space question. As we started out for the year, we always have a focused plan,
focused on balanced growth across all levers, driving base velocity, using media to accelerate growth,
growth in seasons, distribution gains. So that's always a focus for us. And we are fortunate that we have
been able, given the strength of our performance of our supply chain, particularly overall, but also during
COVID and some of the needs of our customers to be able to provide some incremental SKUs that were
very viable, that our customers were looking for, and we gained about 5 incremental SKUs for the year.
And so certainly, with that comes some shelf space gains. So that's something we've been focused on.
As we get that distribution and we get shelf space now, that certainly has some staying power as long as
those SKUs perform, which we anticipate that they will.

So we are continuing to be focused on that. And as we look throughout the year, believe, we feel pretty
good about our ability to continue to drive distribution as well as shelf space gains. And certainly, that kind
of coincides with some of the share gains that we have seen on the business have been driven by that.

As we look at online momentum as it relates to our supply chain, we've talked before about Supply Chain
2.0, a big initiative that we have to really prepare our business and enable our manufacturing and supply
chain for the future. And certainly, as we build that program and that initiative, one of the key legs that we
were focused on was the agility to enable us to adapt to the changing retail environment and specifically,
e-commerce being one of those areas because a lot of the packs sold in e-commerce are slightly different
than those sold across the business.

So some of those investments that we're making there enable us to more efficiently at a better margin,
develop the right packs that enable us to win in e-commerce. So big focus in Supply Chain 2.0 against
that and in all of our new capacity builds.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I want to come back to the question on pricing, but from a slightly different angle. Michele, if we look back
in history, usually, you move Mars follows or Mars moves, you follow, and you follow on similar order of
magnitude on similar products. And that consistency has obviously helped investors build confidence in the
pricing architecture, the pricing discipline or the pricing power in the category.

We're in a bit of a unique circumstance right now where Mars is moving one direction with a higher
magnitude, and you're moving in a different direction with a much lower magnitude. And it strikes me
as quite a unique moment in time where you guys are diverging. I guess I love a little more clarity to try
to understand the motivation for you to go in a different direction? And what if any implications this may
have in terms of that pricing discipline we've historically seen in the category?

7

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I continue to feel really good about this being a very rational category from a pricing perspective
and there being strong discipline from that perspective. Our recent announcements regarding increasing
price on seasons and also non-chocolate and grocery are very consistent with the strategy we've been
executing over the past couple of years of realizing price through different levers and on different parts of
the portfolio. And we think that, that's proven effective for us to drive profitable growth and also be able
to reinvest in the business, both for us and also for our retailers. But we do know that across competitors
in the category, we each do have unique portfolios with different SKUs to our business across pack types
and across brands.

We have some different capabilities in terms of what we are good at executing and perhaps even different
business needs at different points in time. And so while all the pricing isn't exactly pack-to-pack, exactly
the same, what we think is important is while those tactics and products might differ, overall, category
price realization is pretty consistent. And so if you look at us and you look at the largest player in the --
the second largest player in the category, the magnitude and difference in terms of what we each are
getting from price is probably a point or in that range. So it's a significant -- it's not a significant difference
between.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman, JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You highlighted some recurring headwinds to your gross margin. I think there were some incentive
payments, some comment on warehousing costs. Is there any color, Steve, that you can provide on how
much these may have added to your COGS or just took away from your margin? And do any of those
incentive payments bleed into 2Q?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So maybe just taking the incentive piece. So yes, we will see some additional incentives that I go
versus prior in second quarter as well. As we get to the back half of the year, it's going to get a little bit
narrower year-on-year. And so -- but we'll definitely see some impact in the second quarter. We also have
some year-over-year investments in capabilities. I think we touched on these a little bit in our last call,
still some costs going through OpEx to support Supply Chain 2.0 that Michele mentioned and also the ERP
program. So those would be, if I kind of look between the lines, some of the pieces year-over-year, that
will be different.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then as my follow-up, I may be pushing you a little harder than what you're willing to talk
about, but it's hard not to notice that cocoa, it was of the only commodities that hasn't retired lately, has
come down actually sequentially in the last couple of months. So I know you don't talk about your specific
commodity buys. But can you just walk us through a little bit about how you're looking to lock in maybe
some of your favorable inputs a bit longer than you otherwise might have, just given how everything else
has risen so much higher? It really could help you in terms of protecting your 2022 numbers at this point?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. I mean you're right, Ken, we're not going to get too specific. Our hedging horizons vary. We
kind of said in the past 3 months up to 2 years, depending on what's available on the market, liquidity,
pricing, and I will say our commodities team is very good at interpreting the signals and trying to make
smart moves with respect to that hedging program. Beyond that, we're probably not going to comment

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

and I said cocoa's moved around. It's down a little bit. All people -- you might interpret that as some
opportunity if you were to be a little bit longer from a hedging standpoint, but we really don't want to say
any more than that yet about '22.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Hope you can hear me okay?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we can.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Perfect. Okay. So I guess my first question is, I wonder if you can give us a little bit more detail and
granularity around the away-from-home recovery, particularly in North America. Which regions, which
channels, what exactly is playing out there that you're seeing that's so encouraging?

And then my second follow-up question, I know you're not giving quarterly guidance, but obviously, 2020
was such an unusual year. And we're going to be lapping some interesting developments in the year ago
period as we go into Q2. I think you mentioned the ad spend was going to be up materially in the second
quarter. I'm just wondering whether you can give us any other pointers on how the top and the bottom
line might be expected to develop? Or what the pluses and minuses are as we think about next quarter?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So relative to the away-from-home strength, I would say it is across the board. So first of all, we did
see stronger foot traffic and consumer mobility in North America, and that was really, I believe, from the
accelerated vaccine distribution as well as from the stimulus funds that were allocated and that not only
drove strength in what we would call our core channels, kind of the more traditional channel, food, drug,
masks and even some pickup in convenience in Q1. It also had -- there was also a very strong positive
impact on our non-measured channels as well. So food service, our own retail stores, world travel retail,
some of those businesses that were really big decliners for us last year came back faster than we had
anticipated. So I would say it was pretty much across the board in terms of all of those venues improving
a bit more than we had anticipated.

So some of it was due to the consumer traffic. And then, of course, we were able to also capture
incremental distribution and merchandising in our U.S. confection business. And given the strong sell-
through that we saw, driven by mobility and foot traffic, strong sell-through Easter then led to accelerated
shipments of some of our summer programs, which also helped us across the board. And then even
beyond North America, we actually saw increased mobility in the international markets as well, a bit more
than we had expected.

So with that, I think those were unplanned for us in Q1. We certainly had planned to see those mobility
improvement later in the year and have that in our plan, but not in Q1.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the quarters.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. From a quarterly standpoint, as we look at Q2, building on what Michele said, we've got a lot of
momentum on the top line coming into Q2. We're able to merchandise early some of the summer season,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

that will get us off to a to a strong start. As we go forward from there on the top line, you're going to see
sales growth moderate. The laps get tougher. You'll see pricing start to make a contribution more in the
back half. And as Michele said, our plan assumed mobility would begin to recover as we got to the back
half. So that's less of a new piece in the story as we turn the corner on the midyear. And then we'll see
some margin improvement as the year progresses.

You mentioned ad spending for Q2, it's going to be up pretty big. Year-over-year, that was -- the quarter
last year where we made some adjustments, some pricing advantage because it was cheaper to buy and
some pricing or some adjustments in how much we spent just in response to COVID. So hopefully, that
gives you a little bit of color on the balance of the quarter.

Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Michele, I know this can be a little hard to parse out sometimes. But as you think about how much of the
gains that you've made the last couple of quarters, right, in distribution and shelf space, merchandising
gains you've talked about, how do you think about like how much of those might be structural, right,
based on a lot of the good stuff that you're doing around innovation and everything else versus a product
of what's been clearly a more accommodative sort of competitive environment from a perspective of some
others, whether it be supply chain missteps and things of that nature?

So I'm just trying to get a sense, it's a hard one to answer, I know, but how sticky do you think some of
those gains in market, right, that you've seen can be over time?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I think you're right. It is a little bit tough to parse all of that out. So I would say we came into the
year feeling really good about our strategies. And many of those we have laid out pre-COVID relative to
really focused on we got to win at the top line with balanced growth, which is driving against distribution,
the core, innovation, seasons, pricing and volume growth. And I think what we're seeing on the business
is that we are delivering on each of those elements. And so certainly, that is a piece that I think has
staying power that some of the strategies we put in place relative to pre-COVID optimizing our balanced
focus on the core and on innovation, not over rotating on innovation too much. Not over rotating on any
one factor. Balancing price is only one of those things. So I think that there is some underlying strength
there as well as a lot of the investments that we've made in our core capabilities in our manufacturing and
our supply chain over the year that have enabled us to deliver perhaps at stronger levels than perhaps
some others in the marketplace.

And so some of that strength that we're seeing in terms of impact of media, those types of things, they're
there without the COVID impact. We tend to always, as you know, strong category managers. So we do
tend to do well when it comes to winning at retail. We have our proprietary retail sales force that enable
us to do that.

At the same time, I say, I guess, if I was going to parse out some places where some of the current
dynamics may be a little bit more transitory. Certainly, we have won more distribution than, I would say
it's probably at the historic level in terms of number of new items because of our strength in being able
to operate in this environment and our agility. We have won some incremental merch associated with the
competitive situation as well.

So for me, I guess I kind of -- I narrow into probably those 2 factors being probably the biggest ones
that are the most unique. And of course, the other one is that right now in Q1, you asked more about a
couple of quarters, in Q1, in particular, we've kind of got that unique duality where we're seeing that we're
benefiting both from away-from-home and from at-home behaviors, both being strong. And certainly, I

10

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

think that, that can't sustain at the level that it did in Q1. So we do think that, that's going to moderate a
bit.

Does that help?

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's very helpful. It will be really interesting to see how much of the at-home moderates as mobility
does return. For the industry as a whole, obviously, it will be really interesting. But I hear your point about
how strong both of those really were at the same time in Q1. So yes, that's very helpful.

Operator

The next question is coming from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. I just wanted to touch on the international segment for a minute. I mean, obviously, performance
in Q1 was extremely strong. I think originally, right, the expectation was essentially for somewhat modest
growth. Guidance now is up for the full year for the total company. And then I know you had comments
in your prepared remarks just around basically playing it safe, right? There's some incremental lockdowns
occurring, the visibility is that strong. But I guess kind of overall, the question is, could it be actually a
lot stronger, right, than we would expect as we go through the year? Because it would seem as if kind of
relative to what we're thinking about for North America, if that international piece does continue to play
out. And obviously, given those compares are so much easier, it would seem as if the volume-driven year
could actually be even more volume-driven off of that international piece as we progress through the year.

So kind of simplistically, I'm just asking, I realize you don't have the visibility, but if things were to kind of
self-correct and momentum were to continue in international, I mean could you just not do much better
on the top line than you're already currently guiding?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, first of all, I'd say, hey, we feel great that we are seeing strength across every piece of our business,
in North America, in every component of North America, including U.S. confection and Amplify as well as
in international. So that's great to see. And certainly, we did have a strong first quarter in international
that was significantly ahead of our expectation. I think what was interesting for us was that despite this
fact that COVID cases were high in many of those markets, consumer mobility still increased, and that
drove demand for our category that was stronger than we anticipated.

I think the potential concern and certainly, as you look at the news, you see this everywhere is there
certainly are some pretty dire situations, especially in some of the markets that we're in, but certainly,
India being one of those, where case counts are rising. There are other markets where the vaccination
dissemination is going quite slowly. And as new lockdowns are implemented, we expect that those could
hamper mobility and that these trends could moderate. So we know international, things are always
volatile, but they certainly are even more volatile during this time. And those markets are not going to
have linear behavior. So we expect that we'll see continued volatility.

What we're trying to do is to drive what's within our control, and our teams are responding with
tremendous agility in adapting the plans based on the stages and the status in each market. So we feel
good that all of our key initiatives, whether it's our China transition to the new business model, a restart
or upping again our focus in India on our chocolate initiative, all of those things are going well. But there's
just a lot outside of our control, and we'll have to see how the year plays out.

If things are positive, certainly, there could be upside. And -- however, we also know that there could be
downside as well.

Our next question is from the line of Morgan Fletcher with Bank of America.

Morgan S. Fletcher
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I guess, my question is on how COVID may have changed your perspective on the portfolio maybe
in organic, but also an inorganic way? We touched on e-commerce and supply chain earlier, but maybe
if we could just go through more how you're looking at categories differently? Like baking mix has had
very strong growth, while refreshments have seen decline. So just how you may be thinking about your
portfolio on a category basis going forward?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think one of the things that we feel good about that COVID just reinforced
was the strength of the breadth of our portfolio to be able to participate in different occasions. And
so I would start first within core confections and say, we have a -- our business splits 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.
Instant consumables, which are all about people being out and about on the go; take home, which is
all about people being at home and consuming the products there; and then seasons, which is all about
celebrations. And so within confection, what we saw was, wow, normally, we might focus a bit more of
our efforts on instant consumable. And when COVID hit, we were able to immediately shift media, in
store merchandising, et cetera, more to our take-home portfolio. And we also saw that during a time like
COVID, consumers were just hungry for connection. And so the roles that our brands played during season
to create that connectivity and traditions and rituals with something consumers just were so hungry for.
So really leveraging the full breadth of that within confection was important.

You raised baking and certainly, consumers were baking more, and we were able to leverage that as part
of our portfolio. So I think what it really taught us was this ability to pivot to follow the consumer and
to focus on the parts of our portfolio that were most relevant to them at that time. And as I think -- if
we think organic and inorganic likewise, we were able to take advantage of SkinnyPop which has done
incredibly well during COVID. And certainly, we know that category like nutrition bars haven't done quite
as well.

So it's really playing on the pieces of your portfolio at the right piece of time, but having the options and
the breadth across the portfolio to be able to meet those needs.
