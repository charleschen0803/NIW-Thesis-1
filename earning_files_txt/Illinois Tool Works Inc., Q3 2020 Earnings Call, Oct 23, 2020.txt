Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Julianne, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would
like to welcome everyone to the conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.

Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.

Karen A. Fletcher
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's Third Quarter 2020
Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO,
Michael Larsen.

During today's call, we will discuss ITW's third quarter 2020 financial results and provide an update on our
strategy for managing through the global pandemic.

Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the
company's 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important
risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the ongoing
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business.

This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most
comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.

Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott
Santi.

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. We saw solid recovery progress in many of the end
markets that we serve in the third quarter as evidenced by our revenue being up 29% sequentially versus
the second quarter. In fact, demand levels returned to rates approximating year ago levels in 5 of our 7
segments with 2 of those, Construction and Polymers & Fluids, delivering meaningful growth in the third
quarter. On the flip side, demand levels in our Food Equipment and Welding segments continue to be
materially impacted by the effects of the pandemic, although we did see good sequential improvement in
both in Q3 versus Q2.

We talk often about the flexibility and responsiveness inherent in our 80/20 front-to-back operating
system, and those attributes were clearly on display in our Q3 performance. Supported by our decision
early on as the pandemic unfolded to refrain from initiating staffing reductions and to focus on positioning
the company to fully participate in the recovery, our people around the world responded to a rapid
acceleration in demand by leveraging the ITW business model to provide excellent service to our
customers while keeping themselves and their coworkers safe. Perhaps the most pronounced example is
our Auto OEM segment, where our team executed flawlessly from both a quality and delivery standpoint
and responding to demand levels that essentially doubled in Q3 versus Q2 and with a demand -- a very
demanding customer base. Across all 7 of our segments, our teams can cite numerous examples of
how our ability to sustain high levels of service in the face of rapidly accelerating demand resulted in
incremental business for the company in Q3.

In addition to leveraging our best-in-class delivery capabilities, our divisions remained laser-focused on
leveraging our strengths to capture sustainable share gain opportunities that are aligned with our long-
term enterprise strategy. These efforts are just beginning to take hold, and I am confident that they will
contribute meaningfully to accelerating our progress towards our long-term organic growth goals.

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2020

The operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 front-to-back operating system also applies to our cost
structure which showed through in our operating margin performance in Q3. Operating margin of 23.8% in
the quarter included meaningfully higher restructuring expenses versus a year ago and 2 segment-specific
onetime items, which Michael will provide more detail on in a few minutes. Excluding these factors,
operating margin was 25.3% in Q3, the second highest in the history of the company.

Overall, the pace of recovery in the third quarter exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter as
we delivered revenue of $3.3 billion, operating income of $789 million, free cash flow of $631 million and
GAAP EPS of $1.83. In addition, after-tax return on invested capital improved to 29.6%, an all-time high
for the company.

It goes without saying that I could not be more proud of how the ITW team is managing through this
challenging period, and I want to sincerely thank my 45,000-plus ITW colleagues around the world for
their continued exceptional efforts and dedication in serving our customers and executing our strategy
with excellence.

In the face of unprecedented challenges and circumstances, our operational and financial performance
over the last few quarters supports our decision to remain fully invested in the key initiatives supporting
the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy and provides further evidence that ITW is a company
that has both the enduring competitive advantages and the resilience necessary to deliver consistent
upper-tier performance in any economic environment.

Moving forward, we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-
term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.

I'll now turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q3 performance. Michael?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Since the beginning of the pandemic, maintaining ITW's
considerable financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality has been a priority. Our objective was to
fully leverage the strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile that we have built over the
last 7 years to position ITW for maximum participation in the recovery. And as the recovery progressed
ahead of our expectations going into the quarter, we were ready to meet customer demand, and we
delivered strong financial results.

Q3 revenue was up 29% or almost $750 million sequentially versus Q2. And on a year-over-year
basis, organic revenue declined only 4.6% compared to a 27% decline in Q2. The impact of last year's
divestitures was 1% and was essentially offset by 0.7% of favorable currency impact. Product line
simplification was 30 basis points in the quarter.

Despite the negative volume leverage and our decision to stay invested in our key strategic priorities, Q3
operating margin was 23.8%, down only 120 basis points compared to prior year. If you set aside the
impact of higher restructuring expenses and 2 onetime segment items that I will describe in a moment,
operating margin would actually have increased year-over-year to 25.3%. Strong execution on our
enterprise initiatives was a big contributor once again at 120 basis points as all segments delivered
benefits in the range of 70 to 190 basis points.

As expected, our decremental margins were a little higher than normal at 46% in the third quarter.
Excluding the 2 onetime items that I just mentioned and the higher restructuring expense, our
decremental margins would have been about 20%, significantly better than our historical decrementals of
35% to 40%.

Operating income was $789 million, and GAAP EPS was $1.83 with an effective tax rate of 21.3%, in line
with last year's 21.6%. Solid working capital performance contributed to free cash flow of $631 million
and a conversion rate of 108% of net income. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $1.9 billion
with a conversion rate of 127% compared to 105% last year. We now expect free cash flow to end the
year significantly above $2 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong. At quarter end, we had $2.2 billion

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2020

of cash on hand, no commercial paper and a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier 1 credit
ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.7 billion.

In terms of our debt structure, you can see an increase of $350 million in the short-term debt, which is
simply a reclassification from long term to short term as our 2021 bonds are coming due in less than 12
months.

So in summary, a very good quarter operationally and financially as the recovery progressed well ahead of
our previous expectations.

Moving on to Slide 4 for a closer look at the third quarter recovery and response by each segment. You
can see that every segment responded effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved
sequentially on both revenues and operating margin. I would highlight just a few things that Scott
mentioned, including the fact that our Automotive OEM segment was able to essentially double their
volumes in a quarter or just 90 days as operating margins went from negative to 20% plus. In addition,
6 of 7 segments had operating margins, not segment margins, operating margins above 20%. FEG, Food
Equipment, was just below 20%, but we expect them to get above 20% in Q4 despite the fact they are
operating in a pretty challenging environment.

Next to Slide 5, starting with a quick look at organic revenue by geography. As you can see, customer
demand improved in every region. North America declined by only 5% in Q3 compared to down 26% in
Q2. Europe also improved significantly, down only 8%, a sequential improvement of almost 30 percentage
points. Asia Pacific turned positive this quarter, up 3%, and China was the standout, up 10% as the
recovery continues to take hold. In China, specifically Automotive OEM, Polymers & Fluids, and Specialty
Products all grew double digits. So in summary, broad-based geographic recovery in the quarter.

Now let's walk through each segment, starting with the one that experienced the most pronounced
recovery: Automotive OEM. In a matter of weeks, our customers went from being shut down to operating
close to full capacity, and the team responded by leveraging their experienced workforce, local supply
chains and flexible operating system to quickly ramp up and meet customer demand. Overall, organic
revenue was still down 5% year-over-year with North America, down 10%; and Europe, down 5%. China,
which had already turned positive last quarter at 6% also improved sequentially and was up 15% this
quarter. Lastly, as discussed on our last call, we did initiate a few restructuring projects that were part of
our 2020 plan pre-pandemic, which led to a reduction in operating margins of 150 basis points to 20.8%.

Turn to Slide 6. As expected, Food Equipment was the hardest-hit segment in the quarter as organic
revenue declined 20%, a significant improvement, though, from being down 38% in Q2. North America
and international organic revenue were both down about 20%. Equipment sales were down 21%, and
service was down 17%. Institutional demand was down about 30%; and restaurants, including QSR,
were down a little bit more than that. On a positive note, retail, which includes grocery stores, grew more
than 30% supported by the rollout of new products. Despite the significant negative volume leverage and
higher restructuring expense, operating margin was still 19.6%. Excluding the higher restructuring impact,
margins would have been 21.4%. And I think it's worth noting that in this most challenging environment,
the segment generated almost $19 million in operating income.

In Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue declined only 2% with Test & Measurement, down
6%; and Electronics, up 2%. While demand for capital equipment remained soft, the segment benefited
from considerable strength in a number of end markets, including semiconductor, health care and clean
room technology. As you can see from the footnote, the reported operating margin of 23.7% included 350
basis points of unfavorable impact from the removing a potential divestiture from assets held for sale.
Excluding this impact, the operating margin would have been 27.2%, which is a much more accurate
representation of the underlying profitability of this segment. Given the current environment, we simply
decided to defer this divestiture for now.

Speaking of divestitures, let me make a broader comment on our portfolio management efforts and
specifically the 2018 decision to divest 7 businesses that we determined no longer fit our enterprise
strategy framework with revenue of approximately $1 billion. We expect that the completion of these
divestitures will improve our overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level by approximately 50

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2020

basis points and increase enterprise operating margins by 100 basis points. In 2019, we made good
progress completing 4 divestitures with revenues of approximately $150 million, and we are seeing
the benefits in our financials this year, including 20 basis points of operating margin impact. While
the pandemic put a hold on our efforts this year, our view regarding the long-term strategy fit of the
remaining divestitures has not changed. Accordingly, we will resume the sale process for these businesses
when market conditions normalize.

Okay. Turning to Slide 7. In Welding, demand for capital equipment was down year-over-year as organic
revenue declined 10%. However, the commercial business, which accounts for about 35% of revenue
and serves primarily smaller businesses and individual users, was up 11%. In industrial, customers were
holding back on capital spending, and organic revenue was down more than 20% this quarter. Operating
margin, though, was remarkably resilient at 27.9%.

On a positive note, Polymers & Fluids reported record organic growth of 6% in the quarter. The automotive
aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales to grow 10% with double-digit growth in tire and
engine repair products. Fluids was up 6%, with strong sales in health care and hygiene end markets. As a
result of the volume leverage and strong incremental margins of 78%, operating margin expanded by 250
basis points to a record 26.6%.

Moving to Slide 8. Construction had a remarkable quarter, benefiting from continued strong demand in
the home center channel to deliver record organic growth of 8%. All geographies were positive with North
America up 12% with double-digit growth in the residential and renovation market, offset by commercial
construction, down 10%. Europe was up 6% with double-digit growth in the Nordic region, and Australia
and New Zealand revenues grew 3% and were positive for the first time in more than 2 years. As a result
of the volume leverage and strong incremental margins of 59%, operating margin expanded by 300 basis
points to a record 28.1%.

And some of you may remember that when we launched the enterprise strategy in 2012, Construction
had the lowest operating margins in the company, seemingly stuck right around 12%, certainly good
performance in the industry but not really ITW caliber. The fact that the Construction segment delivered
the highest margins inside of ITW in Q3 at more than 28% is therefore pretty remarkable.

Specialty organic revenue was down 5% with North America, down 4%; and international revenue, down
7%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid but was offset by lower demand in the capital
equipment businesses. Operating margin was 25.2% and included a onetime customer cost-sharing
settlement. Excluding the impact of this onetime item, operating margins would have been 28%.

Let's move to Slide 9 for an updated look at our full year 2020. As I mentioned earlier, the demand
recovery in Q3 exceeded the high end of our expectations going into the quarter. And as a result, we're
updating our financial outlook for the year. As we sit here today, we expect organic revenue for the full
year to be down 11% to 11.5%, operating margin to be in the range of 22% to 22.5% and operating
income in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. As I mentioned, free cash flow performance continues to
be strong, and we expect to end the year well above $2 billion. As you think about Q4, keep in mind the
typical seasonality from Q3 to Q4 and that Q4 has 2 less shipping days. Also, please note that we expect
a slightly higher tax rate in Q4 versus Q3, and our full year tax rate is expected to be in the 22% to 23%
range. With respect to our outlook for 2021, we expect to reinstate annual guidance when we release full
year 2020 results early next year.

With that, Karen, back to you.

Karen A. Fletcher
Vice President of Investor Relations
Okay. Thanks, Michael. Julianne. let's open up the lines for questions, please.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jamie Cook from Crédit Suisse.

Jamie Lyn Cook
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I guess 2 questions, sort of one strategically as we're getting through COVID. Can you sort of speak
to where you've had a good opportunity to grow faster than the market or where you see -- which
markets do you see best positioned to grow faster than the market as you sort of take advantage of the
opportunity right now and an update on how the M&A is trending?

And then I guess my second question. As we think about 2021, understanding you don't want to talk
about incrementals yet outside of volumes, is there anything that you can help us with headwinds versus
tailwinds? I guess you don't have some of the salary cuts that other people will be comping, restructuring.
I'm just trying to think of the puts and takes and your ability to put up outsized incrementals.

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Well, maybe I'll -- let me take the sort of strategic questions and then ask Michael to comment on your
second question. What I would say overall is this is very much a dynamic situation that's still playing its
way out. We are certainly responding from a tactical standpoint pretty well at this point. Our ability to
remain invested is certainly -- and with a mission of focusing on, making sure we serve our customers
extremely well through this period and also that we are in position to seize opportunities that come our
way. We are -- we remain focused on that.

I think at this point, it's way too early to sort out the sort of priorities of the rank order of opportunities,
other than -- I'll refer back to the comment I made in my opening remarks that every one of our
segments can point to solid examples in the third quarter of where their ability to have immediate
availability to respond to a customer need resulted in incremental business for the company. It remains a
priority, but I think the situation in the near term is just too dynamic in terms of having any real view at
this point of what parts of the company have more opportunity than others. But I think the thing we want
to be clear about is we are focused on it and expect those opportunities to continue to play out as we go
forward.

From an M&A perspective, all I would really say at this point is what we've said in the past is from the
standpoint of the long-term strategy of the company, we remain very open to the good opportunities
that come our way, but I would also marry that up with the fact that, in this environment, sort of the flip
side of our own experience on the divestitures, this is not a particularly good time for quality business to
sell. We're not in the market for -- discuss assets we're interested in bringing quality companies into the
company, into ITW that we think we can -- that share our strategy and ultimately that we can help even
better companies. And in this kind of environment, this is not necessarily a great time to sell.

So on a medium- to long-term basis, as we have said repeatedly in prior forums, it remains a core part of
the overall growth strategy and profile of the company. But from a tactical standpoint, short term, not a
big -- it's not a big focus right now.

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

All right. Thanks, Scott And then on your second question, Jamie, as we've talked about before, the
planning process inside of ITW is very much a bottoms-up planning process, and we simply haven't gotten
through that process yet with our businesses. And so I can't really comment in great detail. I will promise
that when we provide guidance on our next earnings call, I'll be able to address your specific questions in
a lot of detail.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2020

And then I'll just point to the obvious ones at this point that the comparisons in terms of year-over-
year growth are obviously what they are, which is fairly easy. And then specific to your question around
incrementals, our long-term incrementals are still in that 35% to 40% range. I will say that, as you saw
this quarter in both Polymers & Fluids and Construction that when we get a reasonable amount of organic
growth, the incremental margins tend to be significantly higher. It's certainly in the near term, and so you
may see some of that when we get into detail for 2021.

Operator

Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Scott, what are you and your auto team saying toward the prospects to return to sustainable growth in
North America and Europe? In other words, how much pent-up demand cyclically is creating for a runway,
do you think, beyond sort of a quarter or 2 of what the pent-up stuff for kind of backtracking? And I'm just
wondering if you also think -- a couple of companies have commented on this, and it seems intuitive. The
public is avoiding mass transit in big cities and driving more as they did in China during their experience.
Do you think that adds some juice to the potential recovery in auto next year?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Certainly potential. I would say our thinking on that is not yet particularly deep. We're still in the tactical
mode. I think beyond what you -- the situation that you just talked about or the shift in demand related to
this COVID experience on a medium basis that might result from what you talked about there. We also are
looking at dealer inventories that remain at 5-year plus lows. There's certainly -- so I don't know that in
our own thinking, we're sort of out -- yet long term, we'll do some of that as part of our planning process
and as we think about how to -- we want to adjust our positioning around that sort of trend, long term.
But I do think that based on just the sort of more current conditions in the marketplace that certainly
Q4, we expect to be solid and into Q1 at this point. And then -- and we'll have a better view when we
announce our results and have our 2022 plans -- 2021 and '22 plans baked in early January.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

That's fair. I just wanted to also just follow that up and stick with the auto theme. I've got a couple of
contacts of OEs, and what they tell me is, right now, there's pretty substantial problems with supplier
quality. And a lot of it may have actually to do with the fact that a lot of workers are booking off time, and
they're just not coming into work. And it's creating a lot of stress in the system for requirements for the
OEs to work over time and do rework and stuff like that.

Is this -- firstly, are you seeing quality issues with respect to your own supply chain who feed ITW's plans?
And secondly, is this actually, I'm wondering, creating an opportunity because you guys can leverage
80/20 to drive some incremental share, just based on the fact that you can fulfill with quality versus
perhaps what others are doing? I realize your business is kind of program by program so that's why I'm
kind of asking the question. You're not Delphi or whatever, just if there's something going on there.

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

No. It's program by program, but we are not sole-sourced in a lot of the programs that we participate
in. So certainly, the -- some of the issues that you talked about were absolutely present, and we're
part of our overall results in auto in the third quarter, and we expect that to certainly continue to be
an incremental opportunity. There are certainly lots of parts of the auto OE supply chain that we don't
participate in, so we're not going to solve the problem. But certainly, in the areas that we serve our
customers, we are laser-focused on making sure they're aware that we stay in -- that we remain in a

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2020

very strong supply position, that we're there to help them to the best of our ability, deal with some of the
issues that you've talked about.

And from a quality standpoint, we've talked in the past about the fact that this company operates with
localized supply chains, strong commitments to long-term relationships with our key suppliers. And going
back to the second quarter, our plan throughout has been to make sure that we -- that supply chain for us
remains in position, robust and ready to flex with us. That's not a new thing for us. That's inherent in our
business model and the way we operate. And so far, I actually should have probably also thank our supply
base in my opening comments because they've been remarkable to date.

Operator

Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe a question first for Michael, just around the free cash flow outlook. I think you've mentioned on
the previous call that you should have a big step-down in second half free cash, $600 million or so. But in
Q3, certainly, the free cash flow looking pretty robust. So just wondered if you had any updated thoughts
around sort of working capital management and what kind of pressures that could put on the cash flow
and how well do you think you're managing that working capital now as the sales are starting to improve.

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's a good question, Julian. I mean I think as a result of the fact that the recovery progressed ahead
of our expectations into the quarter, our free cash flow performance was also significantly better than what
we expected going into the quarter. And we expect something similar here in the fourth quarter. Like I
said, year-to-date, we're at $1.9 billion, and we should end the year significantly above $2 billion.

I will say this. I think the working capital performance inside the company, given the recovery here in Q3,
was pretty remarkable. The teams did an excellent job, focusing on -- particularly on the receivables side.
Early on, we put some focus on our credit and collection efforts. And as a result of that, if you look at our
-- you can see that from the outside.

But inside the company, when you look at our past due performance, we are right in line with where we
are historically, which, given the pressures here during the pandemic, is quite remarkable. So you should
expect continued strong free cash flow performance, and we expect to, in the year, well above 100% as
we -- if things stay the way they are here in the fourth quarter.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then just a quick follow-up, perhaps for Scott. You've mentioned the very low inventories in the Auto
OEM vertical. Just wondered, looking across the disparate portfolio at ITW, how do you characterize the
state of inventories at channel partners and customers when you're looking at the other businesses? Are
you seeing much restocking, for example, in general?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We've talked about this in the past. We have very little visibility there. The auto comment I made
was more around dealer inventories, which is obviously a step or move. And their approaches there are
certainly their own, and it's a number that's reported and is obviously very visible.

In terms of most of our other channel partners, given the fact that you order from us today, we ship it to
you tomorrow, there's very little buffer in terms of inventory. So I think from the standpoint of destock/
restock, it's not a big factor for us, really, ever.

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2020

Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo.

Andrew Millard Casey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

A question on the outlook. If I take the midpoint of the numbers that you provided, it seems to imply Q4
revenue kind of flattish with both Q3 and last year. But the margins are expected, if I'm doing the math
right, to decline to about 22% to 23% from Q3 to adjust to $25.3 million, and then last year is 23.8%. Is
that entirely mixed? Or should we consider something else?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think in the major driver of the guidance we're providing or the framework we're planning for Q4 is
really the fact that if you go back and look historically, Q4 is -- tends to be lower than Q3 from a revenue
and margin standpoint, really primarily as a result of the fact that there are 2 less shipping days in the
fourth quarter.

What I can tell you in terms of the underlying sales trends that we -- obviously significant sequential
improvement here in -- as we went through the third quarter. Those have remained on trend as we sit
here in October. So that's certainly encouraging.

And then the margin performance, again, it's -- you should -- there's nothing unusual here in the fourth
quarter. I will say that I pointed to some onetime items here in the third quarter. Obviously, we don't
expect those to repeat in the fourth quarter.

So hopefully, we've provided enough information here for you to put together your own view of what the
fourth quarter might look like with your own assumptions. But what's reflected on the page, in the deck is
really our current view as we sit here today for the full year.

Andrew Millard Casey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then, if I may, last quarter, you gave us some information about market share win benefit to
annualized revenue. Would you be willing to share where the company stands on that metric, meaning did
it increase this past quarter? And if so, by magnitude, about how much?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think what we gave you last quarter was just a couple of 2 or 3 real examples that had already
started to play out as we were reporting our results. This is not a list that we're keeping inside the
company. This is certainly a major focus across all 7 of our segments. I'm -- I guarantee that our
segments are tracking it very diligently. But at this point, I would assume that's certainly continuing to
broaden out. And it would just be impossible given the thousands and thousands of customers that we
have that if we were keeping a running tab of all this stuff and reporting on, it just wouldn't -- it wouldn't
be practical nor would it be accurate probably.

Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Scott or Michael, if you look at a couple of your segments in the quarter, such as Construction or Polymers
& Fluids, these growth rates, we rarely ever see in these segments. We know much of the growth is
coming from your strength, for instance, in construction and renovation or auto aftermarket. But you've
also done a lot of PLS in these segments which you mentioned are helping the margin side. So are we
also seeing the fruits of the labor on the revenue side, too? Or is this just pandemic-related recovery? And
what could that mean for the sustainability of growth in these particular segments in 2021?

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2020

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Yes. My answer there, Andy, is it's some of both. There are certainly certain market sectors or product
categories within both of those segments that are benefiting from some pandemic-related demand. We
actually talked about that very question with the leaders of both of those businesses. And beyond those
sort of pandemic-related benefits in the near term, both of their results also reflect a solid progress in
terms of improving the overall growth posture and profile in those 2 segments.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Scott, that's helpful. And then maybe about Food Equipment, could you give us more color in the sense
you mentioned institutional was up there -- was down 30% with restaurant down a little more than
that, but grocery stores were up 30%. As you look out over the next few quarters, do you see continued
recovery in institutional and sustained strength in grocery? And can you see your Food Equipment sales
continue to recover if the restaurant-facing portion of the business stays weak?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Andy, so we think that the recovery will probably be on the slow side of things. It will take a while.
As you look across the portfolio, Food Equipment is probably the segment where the recovery, for obvious
reasons, will take a little bit longer.

Yes. I can give you a little bit of detail maybe on the quarter in terms of the end markets. The institutional
side, down about 30%, which was the same as in the second quarter. Within that, health care is doing
slightly better. And the drag really is on the lodging side, as you might expect. Restaurants, QSR did
improve sequentially versus the second quarter. And then obviously, a big improvement here on the retail
side, supported -- part of that was market and part of it was new product rollout, share gain. And so that's
why that business was up almost 40% on the retail side.

But to answer your question, this will be -- as we sit here today, we think this will be a fairly slow recovery
in Food Equipment in the near term. I think in the long term, our view hasn't changed in terms of how
attractive this business is, both in terms of our ability to grow above market and our ability to do so at
very attractive margins. And I think you saw in the quarter here for this business to already be back at
20% operating margin and generating $90 million of income. Given the environment that they're dealing
with, it's a pretty remarkable accomplishment. So near term, slow. But long term, we are very bullish on
this business.

Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.

Ann P. Duignan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Most of the short-term questions have been answered at this point. I thought maybe I could ask
about the automotive business in terms of what you're seeing out there for future programs. I know you
bid on platforms many years in advance. And are you beginning to see more RFQs or RFPs coming out
for electric vehicles and electric platforms? And how does that change the dynamics within the team,
especially maybe in Europe ahead of the U.S.?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'd say a couple of things. In terms of new program activity, generally, things certainly got pushed
out as the -- just based on the pandemic impact. And so a lot of that activity in the second quarter pretty
much disappeared as you would expect but that in the third quarter has picked up nicely in terms of

our engagement with our customers around their future platforms and areas of opportunity for us to
participate.

And we've talked about the -- on the EV question, we've talked about that a lot. We remain pretty agnostic
from the standpoint of internal combustion versus EV from the standpoint of the overall opportunity profile
for ITW in terms of the types of solutions where we can add value. In fact, it's still slightly higher on EV on
a per-vehicle basis. And as you would expect, on a relative basis, it's not as big as the volume of projects
on the internal combustion side at this point. But certainly from the standpoint of the growth and in the
number of projects that we're engaging on in EV is for all the reasons you would expect, that is certainly
coming up the curve fast.

Ann P. Duignan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful color. I appreciate that. And then could you talk about China and what you're seeing
there beyond just automotive? We read a lot about what's going on in automotive in China, but maybe you
could talk us through what you're seeing in the other segments in China specifically.

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So maybe just to take a step back. So if you go back to the first quarter, our sales in China were
down 24%. In the second quarter here, flat, positive 1%. And then in Q3, as the recovery continued
to take hold, that business actually grew 10% year-over-year. Auto is actually not the fastest-growing
business in China, but auto was up 15% and so as was specialty. And then our Polymers & Fluids
business,was up 30% here in the third quarter in China. And then as you'd expect, there's still a slower
recovery on the Food Equipment side, down, kind of in the mid-single-digit range. So -- but certainly
encouraging trends as the recovery continues to take hold in China.

Operator

Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Great. The results -- obviously Construction were really amazing overall. Can you give us a little bit
of color on whether you put up those numbers despite maybe some product shortages? Were there
product shortages? What -- and I guess kind of a natural follow-up is that what role did price play in the
strong results? I assume you might have been able to get a little bit of price given the supply/demand
environment.

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And the results in Construction were driven by our ability to supply some of the most demanding
customers that we deal with, so there were no shortages. And as Scott said earlier, I mean, I think a lot of
credit to the operating team and a lot of credit to our own supply chain, our local supply chains and their
ability to respond and meet some really strong activity at the -- in the home centers.

The -- if you look at the residential and renovation business was up almost 20% in Q3 after a strong
Q2, and so -- but like I said, this was -- it goes all the way back to our decision, I think, to not initiate
aggressive headcount reductions in Q2 and focus instead of winning the recovery, and that's what you're
seeing here in Construction, our ability to supply and take care of customers and do so at record margins,
which, by the way, are not driven by price. They're driven by a range of things in this quarter. And
particularly, the volume leverage was certainly helpful. The enterprise initiatives continue to contribute in a
big way, and price was really not a factor in this.

Is price something that you generally put through towards kind of the end of the year, regular cycle on
price? Or is it more opportunistic?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Well, it's more a planned process. It's an annual cycle -- yes. It's certainly not something that you -- that
we are in a position to be very tactical about. The goal is to, Scott, offset any raw material cost inflation,
and there is very little of that in the current environment. And so price was really not, to answer your
question, a significant factor here.

Operator

Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe just starting off from just on kind of the near term and thinking about that 4Q implied growth
number. Michael, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that there's going to be 2 less
shipping days. I just want to be clear. In the 2 less shipping days, is that on a year-over-year basis? Or is
that versus 3Q? And does that account really for the deceleration?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's versus the third quarter. I think there's 64 days in Q3. There are 62 in Q4, and that is exactly
the same setup as last year. So on a year-over-year basis, there's no -- and I would add, and it's very
technical. But some of those shipping days between Christmas and the New Year holiday are typically, let's
just say, not very robust. So I think a lot more than 2.

And maybe, Joe, what you're really asking is are you seeing -- are you implying that things are
decelerating, and I think that's certainly not the case. I think we have not seen anything to suggest that
things are slowing here in the fourth quarter.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I want to dig into the Food Equipment segment for a second. You
mentioned the retail part of your business was up 30%, and some of that was driven by product rollouts.
I'd love a little bit more color on what you're doing there specifically and whether there was any benefit
that you saw from just pent-up demand for not being able to potentially shift in 2Q. I'm just trying to
understand that 30% number in Food Equipment.

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We had some of that. I think in Q2, it was a little difficult to get in there with the product rollouts. But
this is part of the annual cycle in Food Equipment where we roll out new products with added features.
And so I also think it's -- if you were to ask our team, they would certainly suggest that there were some
pretty significant share gains here in the third quarter as a result of these new products being rolled out.
So hopefully, that answers your question.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Maybe just one more around the kind of short-term tempo. So it looks like you didn't really see any like
inventory whipsaw effect. And Scott, you've explained clearly how your business operates. But did you

get a sense that everybody was caught off guard here in Q3, and there's just a fair amount of catch-up
from Q2 and Q3? So it may not be an inventory effect per se, but it's just kind of a snapback that does,
in fact, create -- somewhat down as we move into Q4. It sounds like you're not seeing that yet. But just
wondering your kind of antenna on the ground, is there any sense that there's that kind of dynamic at
play here?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

This is not going to be a helpful answer, but it's really hard to tell, Jeff. I think at this point, this is
obviously a fairly unprecedented situation on so many respects. All we can do is stay in position --
somebody better pet the dog. That's not here. Some of it may very well be a factor. It's just impossible to
tell. All we can do is what's within our control, which is to stay in position to serve our customers.

We're -- third quarter was certainly the first part of the recovery from a completely unprecedented
complete shutdown of wide swaths of our customer base and the economy, and so I wouldn't certainly rule
out any and all of the above in terms of impacting the conditions right now, and we'll see how they play
out from here. But all we can tell you is what, I'll go back to what Michael said earlier, is at least through
-- obviously through the third quarter and through October, we've seen no pulling back.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Great. Yes. I'm doing my part here to help the economy. You've got a construction guy showing up, and
dog is barking at him. So can you also just give us an update on your thinking on share repurchase here?
It sounds like M&A is probably sliding to the right. The cash is obviously gushing. Doesn't look like you did
anything in the quarter, maybe I'm wrong. But what's your current thinking?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So at this point, our primary focus is really on running the business and getting our plans together
for next year, and so we suspended the buyback back in Q1. We've done -- we spent $706 million,
somewhere around $167 a share, and we're essentially done for the year. And our focus, really, is on
running the business and getting our plans together. And then when we give you our thoughts on what
2021 might look like, we'll give you an update at that point also on share repurchases.

Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just a couple of quick follow-ups, if I could. In terms of the strategy to sort of win the recovery, it seems
like maybe automotive might be amongst the most fertile ground as you're able to fill orders that maybe
competitors can't. And I'm just curious, maybe it's way too early for this, but is it potentially possible to
think about your historical wins relative to the auto build increasing? Is it too early to think about that?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think it would be -- I think what I would say, Jeff, is this gives us an opportunity to demonstrate to
our customers the value equation -- I'm sorry, Steve, because Jeff was the last one here. Sorry, steve. The
dog is still throwing me. The -- my apologies.

The -- what I was saying is that I think this is a phenomenal opportunity for us to demonstrate the value
equation around ITW's role in the Auto OEM supply chain from the standpoint of a comprehensive, our
ability to serve you through thick and through thin. And so I would expect that our customers experience
with us through this particular period will certainly be contributing to our ability as we go forward to

secure more business based on the sort of full range of the value-add that we can bring, including our
ability to supply when things are dicey.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then just quickly on Specialty Product. I think, Michael, you mentioned
something about cost sharing. I'm just curious if there's any detail there, anything we should be thinking
about going forward.

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

This is a onetime item, and it relates to an agreement with a customer like -- for obvious reasons, I can't
give you a ton of detail on. But I think the important thing, this was a onetime item, and you're not going
to see it again.

Operator

Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. So maybe we can start with just the cadence of the quarter. Did you see continued improvement
throughout the quarter? Or was the organic growth kind of similar across each month?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think the sales trends in Q3 were pretty strong right out of the gate in July. I think we talked about
that on our last earnings call and really remain that way through August, September and so far what
we've seen of October.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, okay. Got it. And then just an update on the restructuring. I know that, on the last call, you guys
kind of noted that you expected to spend around $60 million in the back half. But given that top line is
kind of coming in probably better than you would have expected, is $60 million still the plan for the second
half? And if so, can you maybe parse out what was done in 3Q and what you expect to do in the fourth
quarter?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Yes. You're right, Nicole. It's -- we now expect it to be a little bit lower than the $60 million that we talked
about on the last call. Let me just start, first, just a reminder that the projects that we're doing this year
are essentially the projects that were in the pre-pandemic plan, if you like. And there's very little specific
tied to the pandemic from a restructuring standpoint. And part of the reason for that is, obviously, the
recovery is now progressing, at least in the third quarter, at a pace that exceeded our expectations. So we
have done $37 million year-to-date, and we expect to end up somewhere around $50 million for the full
year.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And that probably means then that you guys were kind of expecting 1:1 payback as we think about
the impact to 2021. So I also suspect then that the stock is more like $50 million for next year. Is that
fair?

Yes. I mean as I -- yes. I mean I think the payback, as we've talked about before on these projects, these
are really the projects that are coming out of our front-to-back process are typically less than 12 months.
So that would be a reasonable assumption.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird.

Mircea Dobre
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Just a quick question on margin here, especially sort of the margin algorithm going forward. As I'm
looking at gross margins, it was very nice to see them above 42% again. And I'm wondering here, just
conceptually, as volumes -- we get back to volume growth at a point in time, do you see opportunity to
continue to expand to drive gross margin? Or is this mostly an exercise of leverage on SG&A in terms of
driving incremental margin?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think we've demonstrated over the last 7 years that we have a pretty good track record in terms
of continuing to drive improvement in our cost structure, both on the variable side as well as on the SG&A
side. So we would expect both.

And I should have said this upfront. As we begin to think about 2021, I mean -- and that is -- and the
enterprise initiative specifically, they didn't -- we didn't talk a lot about that, but they contributed 120
basis points of margin expansion here in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're above 100 basis points,
and we're 7 years into this. And so I think it's certainly a lot of positive momentum going into, not just
fourth quarter, but also into next year, as these enterprise initiatives continue to contribute to our margin
improvement in a meaningful way, both variable and on the SG&A side, on the fixed cost side.

Mircea Dobre
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up, going back to Welding, and I appreciate the color that you guys
gave there. I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more in terms of kind of what you're seeing going
forward. Arguably speaking, some of your customers in areas like heavy equipment and such might be
seeing some of these production schedules bottom out. Do you have any sense for how demand might
progress here? And at what point in time we could be seeing this segment return back to growth?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Well, I think, Mig, as you look at Q4, I think Q4 will -- if that's your question, will look a lot like Q3
probably. I think we haven't done the plans yet for next year. And when we get together, next year, we'll
give you a little more color by segment, including Welding. But it's really a little too early to tell at this
point. So I mean, as I said upfront, the comparisons year-over-year are going to be relatively easy. So
just on that basis, that's certainly helpful as we think about next year. But we'll give you a better answer,
Mig, when we provide guidance for 2021, okay?

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 23, 2020

Obviously, you've covered a lot of ground here. I did want to go back to restructuring. That $50 million
this year, does that support the 100 basis points for next year? Or does that provide some upside potential
to that number?

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Well, I'm not going to let you pin me down on the number yet for next year because we haven't gone
through the specific projects and activities that support that number for next year, but I think it's
reasonable to assume a meaningful contribution again next year from our enterprise initiatives and
which includes 80/20 work as well as the work that's being done on the strategic sourcing side. So that's
probably the best I can do right now is expect another meaningful contribution from the enterprise
initiatives next year.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's fair. And then a quick one on tools. Obviously, very impressive performance. And I was
surprised because I think I'm right in saying that you have exclusively a pro channel that there's very
limited exposure there. So it seems like this is all driven by new residential construction. Renovation would
have been -- seem still quite anemic. Is that the case? And what are you seeing in terms of new build
versus renovation trends?

E. Scott Santi
Chairman & CEO

I think your view -- let's change your assumptions. So renovation, we've got a lot of exposure. And so
our residential construction exposure is both on new and remodel, and the remodel is really where the
strength -- a lot of the strength was in Q3.

Michael M. Larsen
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. That's exactly right. Just maybe a little more color, Nigel, since you had to wait until the end to
get your question in. We did see some builder activity also picking up in other parts of the business. So
hopefully, that's helpful.

Oh, it is. Yes. No. Just the challenge that suggests pro demand remains quite anemic, so I was a little bit
surprised, but that's helpful color.
