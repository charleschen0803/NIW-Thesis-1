Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla Q2 2020 Financial Results
Q&A and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2020 Q&A
Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q2
results were announced at about 1:15 p.m. Pacific time in the update deck we published at the same link
as this webcast.

During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These
comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and results could
differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent
filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]

But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Thank you. First of all, I'd like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional execution in the second quarter
despite tremendous difficulties. They've done an incredible job, and it's an honor to work with such a great
team. I mean there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they got it done. And just what
a great group to work with, like I said, it's just an honor to work with such a great team.

So -- and as a result, we were able to achieve our fourth consecutive profitable quarter. And although the
automotive industry was down about 30% year-over-year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow
deliveries in the first half of the year. So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up.

We're also very excited to announce that we're going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas. It's
going to be right near Austin. It will be about -- I'll just go into a bit of detail on this, and then I'm sure
there'll be a lot of questions. But the location is 5 minutes from Austin International Airport and 15
minutes from Downtown Austin, and it's about 2,000 acres, and we're going to make it a factory that
is going to be stunning. It's right on the Colorado River. So we're actually going to have a boardwalk
where there'll be a hiking/biking trail. It's going to basically be an ecological paradise. Birds in the trees,
butterflies, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well. So not closed and only Tesla. So
if anyone is interested in working at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be,
please let us know. This is -- we're going to be doing a major factory there. And it's also where we'll be
doing -- we'll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi, and we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern
half of North America.

Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California. So -- but we expect California
to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half of North America. And
then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California. So
I think this is a nice split between Texas and California. And just to emphasize, we'll continue to grow in
California, but we'll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck and Semi programs in Texas.

So -- and I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much for -- to the Tulsa
team, the economic development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed. The whole Tesla

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

team was super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of Tesla
down the road.

Let's see. Is there anything more we want to say about? There's a lot of information. So anything, guys?
All right. Well, I'm sure there'll be lots of questions.

We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work. So it's already underway,
started this weekend. Let's see, moving on to other subjects.

Solar. We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar. So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar in the
United States. And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee. So we're very
confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the solar retrofit or Solar Roof. Our solar
is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per
watt. And it's a very simple, highly automated single-click experience. So definitely, think about Tesla
whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want solar on your existing roof, either way, we're
the company to go to. And then you could also get a Powerwall and have energy independence and be
your own utility. So I think that product is really coming together, and it's only going to get better later
this year. So just very excited about that business potential.

On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 miles range.
So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of 402 miles. I mean you basically can drive
from L.A. to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you arrive. And this is at
highway speed. So you don't have to do anything, drive slowly or anything, drive -- you can just drive
normally and go very long distances.

And then for Full Self-Driving, we launched traffic lights and stop signs, and we continue to improve that
to make them more robust. And we're currently testing Full Self-Driving software for intersections and city
streets and narrow streets. So I personally tested the latest alpha build of the Full Self-Driving software
when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better than people realize. Yes, really profoundly
better. It's like amazing. So it's almost getting to a point where I can go from my house to work with no
interventions, despite going through construction and widely varying situations. So this is why I'm very
confident about Full Self-Driving functionality being complete by the end of this year. It's because I'm
literally driving it.

In conclusion, I'd like to again say thanks for all the hard work of the Tesla team, achieving our first full
year of profitability in the company history. It was incredibly difficult. And just as a result of the hard
work of a lot of people from Tesla worldwide. And yes, just think about the next 12 to 18 months, we'll
have 3 new factories in place. Things are looking great with Giga Berlin, and we'll have Cybertruck, Semi,
Roadster, Full Self-Driving. There's so much to be excited about. It's really hard to kind of fit into this
call. But the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing
engineering front, is mind-blowing. And then, of course, there's Battery Day, which is coming up pretty
soon. And I think that's really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see.

So with that, thanks again for your support on our long-term mission, and we're looking forward to having
a great journey with you to create amazing products and continue scaling it. And yes, this is -- I think I've
never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla and the history of the company. Thank
you.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

Thank you very much. And I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some remarks as well.

Zachary J. Kirkhorn
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Martin. I want to start by thanking our employees, customers and suppliers for your support
over the last quarter. In particular to the Tesla team, I couldn't be more impressed with the hard work and
the resiliency that you all have shown.

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability. This
is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories
and field operations around the world. To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action
to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and noncritical patent projects. The direct cost
savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost savings
actions, although the costs were concentrated in COGS, and the cost reductions were in both COGS and
operating expenses.

On automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, this reduced sequentially from 20% to 18.7%.
This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency due
to the various shutdowns. Despite these charges, we continue to make progress reducing our costs,
particularly on Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. Given the global macroeconomic context, we
made the decision in Q2 to pass through savings to customers around the world on some of our products.

With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million of
deferred revenue in the period. The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this due to costs
associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.

Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million. While difficult to forecast precisely, our
best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.

Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement. In
the energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit. We remain production-
constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additional capacity. And our solar
installation business was impacted by permit office closures limiting installation volume.

Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2. This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the
next tranche of the CEO grant as well as early vesting of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&A
within operating expenses.

On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 billion, which included free
cash flows of over $400 million. This is a strong result on its own despite an increase in capital expenses
associated with Shanghai and Berlin as well as movements in working capital.

A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables. While our AR balance is usually
about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors. First, overall, less than
30% of our receivables is associated with new car sales. Second, due to payment terms associated with
financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain methods of cash payments and
geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted significantly
by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter. Third, roughly 40% of the
balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV incentive programs,
both of which have been increasing. Customer deposits reduced slightly as well. Note that as we transition
to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to reduce, driving down
this balance.
As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture. We will
continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital
management. This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and
preparing for the launch of 3 new factories over the next 1.5 years.

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Question and Answer

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

Thank you very much.

Let's go to questions from institutional investors first. The question #1 is, as Tesla continues its journey
towards the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle
programs that will drive volume growth over the next 3 to 5 years beyond Model 3, Y and the Cybertruck:
cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y or region-specific vehicles or anything else?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, I don't think we can comment on our detailed product road map beyond what's announced because
I think we want to reserve that for product launches. But it would be reasonable to assume that we would
make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity vehicle of some kind. These are
likely things at some point. But I do think there's a long way to go with 3 and Y and with Cybertruck and
Semi. So it's a long way to go with those. I think we'll do the obvious things.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

Okay. The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla? What
opportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than via FSD?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Right now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I think the upgrading of the fleet
to Full-Self Driving, especially with an over-the-air software update, I mean, may go down as the biggest
asset value increase in history as a step change. Maybe there's something bigger, but it certainly would
be one of the biggest -- I can't think of anything bigger. So overnight, 1 million -- depending exactly on
when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions, you'd have like, I don't know,
at least a few million cars suddenly becoming 5x more valuable or something like that, something like 5x
higher utility. They go from like 12 hours a week of utility, something like that, that's hours of use, to 60,
something like that. So everything else is pretty small by comparison.

Now when things do become Full-Self Driving, so what are people going to do in the car? Well, I guess
they're probably going to want to do productivity and entertainment of some kind. Watch movies, play
games and do work. That's in the future. Yes. We're already putting some games and stuff on the car, just
for fun.

Zachary J. Kirkhorn
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, we have been experimenting on that. And so FSD remains, by far and away, the biggest opportunity
in the near term. But we're putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the
time is right. So premium connectivity subscription is something that we've put in place. And the ability
to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost, or upgrading a Standard
Range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats. So these are things that we have, and we're
continuing to get feedback from the field and other things that we can launch, and we'll trickle those in
with time.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

7

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Yes. But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to Full Self-Driving, depending upon how
you calculate it, is probably worth at least $100,000 per car. So that's a lot of software you have to sell in
the App Store or whatever, yes.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

The third question is also about Autopilot. What are the most important upcoming self-driving milestones?
And how do you think about timing?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, the actual major milestone that's happening right now is really a transition of the autonomy system
of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in, I call it like, 2.5D. It's like -- think of taking
like isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are harshly correlated in time but not
very well and transitioning to kind of a 4D where it's like -- which is video essentially. You're thinking
about the world in 3 dimensions, and the fourth dimension being time. So that architectural change, which
has been underway for some time but has not really been rolled out to anyone in the production fleet is
what really matters for Full Self-Driving.

So what we've been doing thus far has really just been with like 2D -- mostly 2D. And like I said, not
well correlated in time. So it's just hard to convey just how much better a fully 4D system would work
-- does work. It's capable of things that if you just look -- looking at things as individual pictures as
opposed to video like -- basically, like you could go from like individual pictures to surround video. So it's
fundamental. So the car will seem to have just like a giant improvement. We'll probably roll it out later this
year. But we'll be able to do traffic lights, stop, turns, troughs, everything pretty much. And then it will
be a long march of 9s, essentially, how many 9s of reliability are okay. So it's definitely way better than
human, but how much better than human does it need to be. So that's actually going to be the real work.
There's just a massive amount of work with each kind of order of magnitude of reliability. But you'll see it
happen. And if you plot the points on the curve, it would be kind of obvious where it's headed.

AI, in general, I think, is something -- I've been saying this famous AI drum for a decade, we should be
concerned about where AI is going. And the people I see being the most wrong about AI are the ones who
are very smart because they can't imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them. That's the
flaw in their logic. They're just way dumber than they think they are.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

And the next question from institutional investor is please may you update us on Alien Dreadnought. How
has your thinking evolved? And what is needed in order to get closer to fundamental physical limits?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, we bring a massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, the machine that makes the
machine. There's probably 1,000%, maybe 10,000% more engineering required for the factory than for
the product itself. So we're certainly making progress. I mean battery and powertrain factory, Gigafactory
in Nevada is, I don't know, Alien Dreadnought version 0.5, something like that, starting to approach
version 1.

We're getting way better at making cars. You can see that in Giga Shanghai. You'll see that even more
with Berlin. And we're really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable. The
fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin. It may look the same, but the internals will
be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we've done to date. Drew,
would you like to add to that?

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Yes. I was going to expand on that. I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not just automation
but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which
involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from like when the raw materials enter the
factory to the finished goods exit. And we're learning so much through doing that.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Vertical integration is extremely important for this. But the supply chain -- if you put like a GPS
tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it would look insane. It
would be like, wow, it went around the world like 6 times. So with vertical integration, maybe you can only
go around the world once. It would be a huge improvement, or not even, like half of -- I think a half of -- I
think if we get vertical integration, probably get you an order of magnitude improvement. So yes. Jerome,
do you want to...

Jerome Guillen
President of Automotive Division

Yes. I think the focus for us is increasing CapEx efficiency. This is something that we've been working very
hard for the past 3 years. And you can see that we can build new factories for less amount of money and
much faster. Those things go together.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a better factory for less money and less time.

Jerome Guillen
President of Automotive Division

Yes. Less money means less time. So that's a great advantage. And we're also reducing, and there still is
a lot, the amount of inefficiencies. We want every operation to add value to the vehicle. Value, meaning
moving the items closer to their final state. So we do not want any robot that just moves things or adding
parts.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Or a person. In fact, it's like we want to be super respectful of people's labor. If we're asking somebody to
do something, are we sure it's useful? Are we asking them to spend their time in a way that is respectful
of their time? But it's like, wow, the potential for improvement is tremendous. And like, I just want to be
clear. Here at Tesla, we love manufacturing. It's awesome. And I really think more smart people should be
working on manufacturing.

Jerome Guillen
President of Automotive Division

And we want more people. We can't find enough people. If people are interested in designing new lines
and trying to do things different, Tesla's got a job for you. And now we've got jobs everywhere. It's not
only in California. Now we've got jobs in China; in Berlin; in Austin, Texas; and in California. So there's
plenty of exciting places. And all these places will do original work and challenging, meaningful work.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Absolutely. It's actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new production systems. And I
think that for some reason, I kind of got a bad rap, especially in the U.S., for a long time. And I think
people didn't think that manufacture -- they sort of -- they thought of manufacturing it's like, oh, it's just
some boring -- just making copies or whatever. But actually, there's far more opportunity for innovation
in manufacturing than in the product itself, order of magnitude. So like if there's one thing that comes
out of this call, it's like, hey, if you want to help us invent amazing, new manufacturing techniques and

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

have input into the product itself, it's not like you just get tossed the product and say, "Hey, make this
product," and it's kind of a lousy design, you get -- if you're in manufacturing, you get to change the
product design. And say, "Hey, this product you're asking me to manufacture is dumb." Like, "Great, let's
fix it."

So it has a -- if you work on manufacturing engineering, you don't just get force-fed a turd sandwich. You
get to change the product design. So it's super exciting. And we evolve the lines even after they're built.
There's rapid evolution of the production system. So...

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

And there's nothing more rewarding than going from 0 cars an hour to 5,000 cars a week or 1,000 cars a
day.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, right now, 0. But long term, a lot.

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

It's our biggest property.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes, it's our biggest property, true.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

Okay. And now we can shift to retail investor questions on say.com. The first one is, Tesla Energy seems
widely ignored by Wall Street despite Elon comments about growth rate exceeding automotive. Could Tesla
share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors better understand the business outlook?
How disruptive is Tesla's Autobidder technology?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. I can't emphasize enough, I think long term, Tesla Energy will be of roughly the same size as Tesla
Automotive. So I mean the energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business. So it's like
how big is the energy sector? Bigger than automotive. So -- and in order to achieve a sustainable energy
future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is going to be primarily solar and
followed by wind. And those are intermittent. So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the energy
because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine.

So there's like 3 elements of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable energy generation;
battery storage; and electric transport. Those 3 things. And the mission of Tesla is to accelerate
sustainable energy.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

So I can't emphasize enough. The -- like yes, the battery and solar will both be enormous. And they kind
of have to be in order for us to have a sustainable future. And we've got a great product road map on that
front as well. So we're going to ship in the Megapack. It's very well received. Yes. Drew, do you want to
talk about that?

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

Yes. I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated, rapidly deployable grid-tied storage
battery of megawatt-hour scale. We're working with utilities, large and small, not just utilities, but also
just like microgrid and project developers of all type, and building our own projects where it makes sense.
And there's a lot of demand for the product, and we're growing the production rates as fast as we can for
that product.

And then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid-tied batteries. It's an autonomous energy
market participation system that does high-frequency trading and ensure...

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

That's a bad word.

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

Sorry. Sorry.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

High-frequency trading is called front running. We're not doing that.

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

No, we're not doing anything like that. No. It's ensuring that the battery is doing everything it can to
manage the container dependency of the renewals -- renewables and just grid intermittency of all kinds.
I mean people turn their lights on and off, power plants turn on and off, factories ramp up and down, and
batteries are great to solve those problems.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. It does grid stabilization at the millisecond level.

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

Exactly.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

So it just ensures that things are super smooth. It's like a UPS, an uninterruptible power supply, of a
normal size. But it just ensures that the grid has smooth sailing. And then the batteries, the computers
like all interact with each other and make sure that they're working together to make the grid smooth.
And this can be done with the Powerwalls and the Megapacks and the Powerpacks all working together and
interacting with third-party systems as well.

I mean it's just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

Yes. You can't plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world. You need a plant -- you need to
optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that's what we're doing.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at an affordable price. That's the real limit. So
that's why we're going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental
scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
So whatever it may be, anywhere from mining to refining, there's many steps for refining; to cathode and
anode formation, cell formation. Whatever the choke point is, that will set the growth rate. And so we
expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others. And there's a lot
more to say on that front on Battery Day.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

And the second question is, now that it's time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share
more detail on production plans? What weekly production rate is considered volume production? And when
does Tesla expect to reach that rate?

Jerome Guillen
President of Automotive Division

Yes. So we'll start production next year, as we announced before. I'm personally very excited about the
project. I can't wait. We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and likely delivering cars. But we're
going to accelerate that.

I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla, to carry our own freight, probably
mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route. We're going to prove that we have very
good reliability. I mean so far, the early units do have it, but we'll do that at a larger scale. And we have
also promised some early units to some long term, very patient and supportive customers, and we'll do
that.

Now we have more sales coming up in next year, as Elon just pointed out. So we can increase the diversity
of the portfolio. It didn't make sense up to now to do it. But we'll be ready. And that's -- I may be a
little biased. I'm very excited about this. And we have a lot of very unique technology that we're always
dreaming about that we will be putting into that Semi. It will be just awesome.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. And just there's like 2 general classes of cell. There's like the iron phosphate and then the nickel-
based. Nickel-based cells have higher energy density, so longer range. Obviously, those are needed for
something like a Semi, where every unit of mass that you add in battery pack, you have to subtract in
cargo. So it's very important to have a mass-efficient and long-range pack for full batteries. However,
what we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and sort of tire efficiency,
drag coefficient, like basically, all of the things that -- our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total
vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable

having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China. And that will be in volume production later this
year.

So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200s, basically -- but we think you probably get a
range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain
and other vehicle efficiencies. And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the
other projects that require higher energy density. So -- yes. So that's like 2 supply chains that you can
tap into, iron phosphate or nickel. We use very little cobalt in our system already, and that's -- -- that may
trend to 0 along -- especially when we got nickel.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard Range version of Model Y. No longer
office -- offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi. Does this shift
from smaller pack vehicles suggests that Tesla is not battery-constrained as in the past? What are the
biggest constraints now?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel, okay?
Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some
long -- some high point that you experienced some 5 years ago or whatever. Go for efficient, also
environmentally friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period
of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. So hopefully, this message
goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.

With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for range is going to be, just in U.S. EPA terms,
approximately 300 miles. So I think people will really come to expect that as some number close to
300 miles as normal. That's a standard expectation because you do need to take into account, like, is it
very hot outside or very cold? Or are you driving up into a mountain with a full load? And it's -- people
don't want to have a -- get to their destination with like a 10 miles range. They want some reasonable
margins. So I think 300 is going to be really -- or close to 300 is going to be the new normal, close to 500
kilometers basically roughly.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

The next question on insurance. What is the holdup for Tesla insurance outside of California? Will you
release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the Tesla
ride-hailing network as a driver?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Sure.

Zachary J. Kirkhorn
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We're joking before the call that we get the quarterly insurance question that -- from say.com here.
We are working super hard on insurance. I'll go into a little bit more detail here than I have in the past.

Currently, we have a product in California. As I've described before, it's been quite well received. And I
would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that are unique to our
cars. So you can think of it as a version 1 of Tesla Insurance.

Elon R. Musk

13

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Yes. Version 0.9 is it getting at least.

Zachary J. Kirkhorn
Chief Financial Officer

0.9. What we're working on now is we can call it version 2, or we can call it the first version of our
telematics product. And so really, ultimately, where we want to get to with Tesla Insurance is to be able to
use the data that's captured in the car, in the driving profile of the person in the car, to be able to assess
correlations and probabilities of crash and be able then to assess a premium on a monthly basis for that
customer.

And what makes this very exciting for us is the amount of data that is available, with the customer's
permission to use, is not available on any other product or any other vehicle in the world. So this gives us
a unique advantage in terms of information. And we have a decision point here where we could take the
California product and replicate that into other states, or we could delay going into additional states and
instead put more effort into the telematics side of this. And we chose the latter.

And where we are now is nearly complete with the risk and cost analysis associated with the first version
of the telematics product. We hope to be filing that in a handful of states with regulators very shortly. And
assuming that regulatory approvals go smoothly, we hope to have this in a handful of states by the end of
the year. And then we'll continue to file for approval in additional states. With regulatory approval there,
we'll continue to roll this out nationwide as quickly as we can. And then that product, as we continue to
collect more data and reiterate on it, there'll be version 2, version 3, et cetera, as we continue to refine
that.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean at the heart of being competitive with insurance is what is the accuracy of your information.
Like are you dealing with -- are you forced to assess people statistically looking in the rear-view mirror? Or
can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections, and inform the driver that -- of
how they may reduce their -- what actions they can take to reduce their insurance. As Zach was alluding
to, it's like, okay, you're driving too fast, you're doing this or that or the other thing, it's like if you want to
pay more for insurance, you can. But if you want to pay less, then please don't drive so crazy. Then people
can make a choice. Like, okay, they want to drive aggressively, in that case, it'll be higher insurance, or if
they want -- they're more careful in their driving, they pay less.

This was actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insurance expense.
A lot of it is just -- it's like a little fender bender and the net fender bender because of the way that the
body collision repairs being done cost like $15,000 or something crazy, and like, well -- and then we can
actually adjust the design of the car and adjust how the repair is done to actually have the fundamental
cost of solving that problem would be less.

So this has helped us unearth a whole bunch of silly things that we were doing basically without realizing
it. But this is a problem, in general, with insurance, is like if the insurance is like all you can eat, then the
feedback loop for improvement is sweet. So this gives us a great feedback loop for improvement because
it's basically a fundamentally better insurance product.

I'd also like to say, in the spurt of recruiting because if there's one thing I'd like to come out of this call,
it's that a lot of great people want to join Tesla. That's the #1 thing I'd like on this call.

And on the insurance front, I want to be clear. We're building a great, like a major insurance company.
If you're interested in revolutionary insurance, please join Tesla. I would love to have some high energy
actuaries, especially. I have great respect for the actuarial profession. Your guys are great at math. Please
join Tesla, especially if you want to change things and you're annoyed by how slow the industry is. This is
the place to be. We want revolutionary actuaries.

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Okay. Thank you very much. And...

Zachary J. Kirkhorn
Chief Financial Officer

Sorry. So there was a second part of this question. Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the
Tesla ride-hailing network? And so I think I've answered this before in prior calls, but by the time the ride-
hailing network is available, we will -- Tesla Insurance coverage will be provided to folks who are in this
network. It's a different type of insurance because of the use of the car. It's not decided whether third-
party insurance versus Tesla Insurance will be required. There might be some things we need to think
through there. But Tesla Insurance, at least, will be working, working for the ride-hailing network.

Martin Viecha
Senior Director for Investor Relations

Thank you very much. And in the interest of time, let's go to the Q&A of analysts on the line.

Operator

Our first question will come from Dan Levy with Crédit Suisse.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I'll ask a question on the quarter and then just a question more broadly on strategy. Just on the quarter, if
you could give us an update on gross margin. Was China accretive to gross margin in the second quarter?
And give us an idea of how far off Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model 3?

And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region.
You're in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you're relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai.
What do you expect your approach to be on insourcing when you eventually open up Berlin and what your
Texas factory is going to be?

Zachary J. Kirkhorn
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Just to start with the gross margin questions. We did see progress on gross margins in China, and
that was despite pricing action that was taken. The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it
continues to ramp. So we think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.

Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production. And despite the
inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see a pretty substantial improvement in the Model
Y margin. And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge.
They're not quite there. Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full
production. And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math
there on the relative gross margins.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. But -- and it's continuing to do more and more
internally. But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that
were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle. And I
mean the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5% to 10% a month. From 40 -- it
was like 40% at the beginning of this year, something like that. It will be like 80% by the end of this year,
maybe more.

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

There is also a lot of very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in
Shanghai.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say it like this. The suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the most
competitive in the world.

Jerome Guillen
President of Automotive Division

And so far, we're in negotiations with -- for Berlin, and we've awarded a lot of business. Also a lot of
suppliers in Germany or the rest of Europe, they are eager to support the factory in Berlin.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, obviously, Germany has a great automotive industry and supply chain. So actually, a ton of our
suppliers are in Germany within like a few hundred kilometers of the factory.

Operator

Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.

A.M. Sacconaghi
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

You mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times that you were pleased with gross margin, with PTI
margin progress and you expect it to achieve industry-leading operating margins over time. Maybe you
could shed a little light on that. Industry-leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI. For Porsche,
smaller, at 17%. For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%. What do we think about? And how much,
ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because I know your margin has
been 5% over the last 12 months, but it's actually less than 1% excluding EV credits. So it's a 4-point
contribution right now. How do we think about ultimately what industry-leading margins are? And how
much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatory credits? And I have a follow-up, please.

Zachary J. Kirkhorn
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit. We manage the business -- or said
differently, we don't manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contribute in a
significant way to the future. I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to 2019, and
it will continue for some period of time. But eventually, the stream of regulatory credits will reduce.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean it's worth noting that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit.
Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 fed tax credit. And yet our sales have
continued to do well. Yes.

Zachary J. Kirkhorn
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce, manufacture and distribute our
cars. That cost curve even for mature products like the S and the X continues to come down, as we work
on that, Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down. You then layer
on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-based revenue, particularly Full
Self-Driving. There's the revenue recognition portion of that, that we have today. That will expand as we

16

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

release more features. And then you can layer on top of that in the future our revenue from the ride-
hailing network.

Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.
There's still incredible opportunity there that we're working on, particularly on how customers interact
with the company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them. So we
continue to see efficiencies there. So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low-
teens operating margin level. And I think there continues to drive -- the opportunity to drive that up.

So I hear your point on the 5% and the 1%. We're on a bit of a journey here, and we're continuing to be
[ partners ].

A.M. Sacconaghi
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

And if I could just follow up, Elon, you've talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- and really
trying to drive EV adoption globally. So how do you think about that trade-off between driving towards
industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make your cars more affordable and broader? It feels like,
historically, you've always picked the path of, I'd rather drive more growth and more adoption because
ultimately, that's the mission of the company. And we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price
reductions. You could have probably kept price where it is, sold some units and had better profits, but
that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company, has made. So how do you personally think about
that trade-off between -- even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, wouldn't you be inclined to
give more of that back to drive greater adoption more quickly?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go way beyond
industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially almost everyone
when you're factoring in autonomy. That was really a mega game changer, giga game changer. Yes. But I
mean it is important for people to distinguish between 2 things. There's value for money that our product
has, and then there's affordability. And even if you rail value for money and have value for money like
infinite, if people don't have enough -- if people do not have enough money in their bank accounts to buy
the car, they simply cannot. So then you used -- have this like awesome thing that nobody can buy.

So it is important to make the car affordable. I think we will not succeed in our mission if we do not make
cars affordable. Like the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are
not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we are making progress in that regard, just sort of steadily
gaining progress. So yes, we need to not go bankrupt. Obviously, that's important because we'll fail in our
mission. But we're not trying to be super profitable either. Obviously, we're like -- profitability is like 1% or
something, 1% or 2%. It's not crazy.

Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slightly
profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible. That's what we're trying to
achieve.

Operator

Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Could you please characterize the current near-term demand environment for your vehicles? These are
obviously unusual times. I think back in Q1, you had indicated record backlog, I guess, at the beginning of
this past quarter. I haven't seen any specific comments about new orders or backlog in the release today.
So can you give us some color?

TESLA, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Demand is not our problem. Definitely not. We do have some production supply chain challenges we're
trying to solve right now. For example, the Model Y rear body casting, obviously, because it's new
technology, it's been tricky to maintain rates and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting, which is --
it's a 2-piece casting with a bunch -- and there's about half a dozen other parts that are added on. That
will transition to a 1-piece casting. In fact, I'm super excited about this. We're going to have a -- the
world's biggest casting press is getting assembled right now actually in Fremont for the Model Y rear body
casting. It's enormous and looks awesome. So it's -- look, the things that are troubling us right now are
not demand, but they are just a bunch of firefighting on supply chain and production issues.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. So to put it...

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. Don't worry about demand. That's not the issue.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. So when you're saying you're achieving 500,000 deliveries has become more difficult, was it really
just a function of the recent shutdowns and some of these supply dynamics?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. It's not an issue with demand. It's really just a production issue. It's been pretty hard when you've
got like a global supply chain. And it's kind of whatever the most effective part of that global supply chain
is, that sets your rate. The -- I mean the number of rabbits we've had to pull out of a hat for supply chain
is insane. The team has done an amazing job. So I think also -- so yes, some of our costs were related to
having to use a lot of airplanes to get parts around because of part shortages. So we'll hopefully use fewer
airplanes. That will improve our costs. But it's -- demand exceeds supply right now. That's where we are
right now.

Operator

Our last question today will come from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies.

Philippe Jean Houchois
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

You mentioned a few times that the constraint to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping
you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you're building right now, will there be battery capacity
consistent with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And if not, will you be
able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Or will you have to import batteries from outside
Europe to ensure production in Berlin?

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Okay. We can't say too much about this except that there will be local cell production and that will serve
the needs of the Berlin factory. Drew, is there anything that...

Andrew D. Baglino
Senior Vice President of Powertrain & Energy Engineering

I mean, no, that's straightforward enough. I think just adding to what you said earlier about talent and
people, like the same goes in all areas of cell, supply chain, manufacturing materials, design, we are

solving this problem. And we -- we're treating it like any other problem that we have solved. We will solve
this problem, and we want talented people to join us as we solve this problem.

Elon R. Musk
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. And like so my biggest concern for getting our talented people is probably Berlin because the labor
mobility in Europe is not -- is low. I would recommend changing this. Like somebody who wants to leave
and join another company, sometimes they have to spend 6 months on garden leave. It's called garden,
hanging out in the garden basically. And like this is not a good use of people's time. I mean if they want us
to hang out in the garden, that's fine, but they shouldn't have to.

I mean those who know Europe will know what I'm talking about.
