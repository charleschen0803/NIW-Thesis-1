THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. And welcome to the 2020 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon.
[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of
copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.

I'll now turn the conference over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon's Global Head of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Magda Palczynska
Global Head of Investor Relations

Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the first quarter of 2020. The earnings press
release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website
at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon's CEO will lead the call. Then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO,
will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A
session. [Operator Instructions].

Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual
results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result
of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release,
the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website.
Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 16, 2020, and will not be
updated.

With that, I will hand over to Todd.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Thank you, Magda. And good morning, everyone. Before getting into our results, I want to call out the
heroic efforts of medical professionals and first responders in the U.S. and abroad. I have doctors in my
immediate family, so I'm acutely aware of the risks and what they're dealing with. We're also grateful for
the extraordinary actions taken by central banks, regulators and governments to minimize to the extent
possible, the financial fallout as we all face this unprecedented crisis.

Now let's shift to our financial results. I'll briefly highlight our first quarter performance and then focus on
how we're navigating the current realities, discuss what the immediate impact has been on our business
and then look at how we think about the potential impact going forward. Mike will then go through the
financials in more details.

For the first quarter, we reported earnings of $944 million and earnings per share of $1.05. That's up 12%
over the first quarter of 2019, with revenue up 5% and expenses flat as we benefited from heightened
levels of market activity and volatility, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. All of our
investment services business showed solid growth.

Clearly, we have entered an unprecedented environment where things are changing quickly, and it's going
to be a very challenging time for everyone. As -- the situation has evolved quickly, but from the start,
our focus was on the health and well-being of our people and the continuity of service to our clients. We
quickly transitioned the vast majority of our people to working from home, which opened up space for us
to create social distancing for the small number of essential and office staff. Fewer than 5% of our global
employees remain in the office. These essential in-office staff are primarily performing roles that cannot
be done remotely. The investments we've made in our infrastructure, operating platforms and cyber and
information security have clearly benefited us, enabling us to support this broad scale of remote working
arrangement. All of the controls and security oversight that govern us when working inside the office are
in full effect when we're working remotely.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

The response from our people has been exceptional. You couldn't ask for greater professionalism or
dedication to our clients, at a time when we're also dealing with unprecedented levels of market activity
and personal challenges. Please note that while our people are caring for our clients, we're caring for
them. We've made available to them a host of health and well-being resources including access to
telehealth services, free testing for COVID-19 in the U.S., along with us covering all costs related to
outpatient, urgent care or emergency room visits for the evaluation and treatment related to COVID-19.
Recognizing the mental health challenges during these uncertain times, we made available a stress
management program and emotional support services and resources to help our people cope and deal
with the social isolation. And we're supporting our colleagues who are unwell or may have been exposed
by guaranteeing full pay for absences for those who have tested positive or are self-quarantined. We're
also providing paid time off to care for immediate family members with COVID-19 or COVID-19-like
symptoms.

Finally, to support our people, we made the decision that we will not do any additional layoffs during
2020. It's absolutely the right thing to do at a time when the pandemic is creating so many personal
uncertainties for our people. Since the crisis began, we've remained fully operational and open for
business. And we've been there for our clients during this unprecedented period of market disruption.
We engaged early with thousands of clients globally to discuss their own continuity plans and work with
them to ensure minimal disruption to their operational processes and transaction settlements. We stood
up client command centers for our operations and client-facing staff to centralize, escalate and quickly
resolve client inquiries. We accelerated training on our digital tools to help clients reduce their physical and
manual process footprint, minimizing their operational risk profile.

We've also taken a series of humanitarian actions in an effort to and help those negatively affected by the
virus. That has included making philanthropic commitments to import and support organizations in regions
where our employees live and work. Including organizations working in the front lines in the U.S., EMEA
and Mainland China and other affected areas in Asia and India. Announcing a [ 2:1 ] matching program
for employee donations, we've also donated hundreds of video-capable tablets to public hospitals in New
York to help patients and medical staff communicate with their loved ones. And partnering with nonprofit
organizations to provide aid to first responders, health care, transit and other first frontline workers as
well as serve some of the most vulnerable populations for the provision of critical items, such as meals,
shelter, medical equipment, educational supplies and financial support as well as 50,000 facemasks we
donated to 2 New York City hospitals dealing with shortages. We'll also continue to look for opportunities
to do more.

Lastly, we are focused on maintaining the strength, liquidity and lower risk profile of our balance sheet
while using it to support our clients' end markets. We have been in regular dialogue with the regulators
and key market participants to ensure we're coordinated and see how we can help bring stability to
markets. When the markets first came under pressure last month, the Federal Reserve activated a Primary
Dealer Credit Facility to provide funding to primary dealers. They achieve that through our tri-party repo
services. That's something we're uniquely positioned to do, and it's been a privilege to help.

Given our strong capital and liquidity position, we have used our balance sheet to support our clients.
That means accommodating their elevated deposits and funding about $3 billion in incremental draws
on committed facilities. In March, we also purchased more than $3 billion in assets from money market
funds, including our own, to help create liquidity for fundholders and we have continued to do so in April.

Looking ahead, we and our clients face extreme market and economic uncertainty. While it's too early
to predict the impact, we have a well-diversified and financial-resilient franchise that is relatively well
positioned to withstand what's to come. In terms of the immediate impact on our business, March had
extremely high levels of volatility and market stresses. We experienced much higher client volumes than
normal and activity is up across all of our business lines.

Let me just share a few data points that bear this out. In foreign exchange, we saw higher volumes
across all parts of our business, up approximately 50% in March and large spikes in volatility. In U.S.
dollar payments, Treasury Service on average processed $2.5 trillion payments per day in March, peaking
1 day at over $3 trillion in mid-March compared to $1.7 trillion in recent quarters. At times, Pershing

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

saw elevated trading volumes 2.5 to 3x normal levels. In Clearance and Collateral Management, U.S.
government securities clearance volumes in March were up more than 20% from February levels, driven
by the heavy U.S. treasury issuance, coupled with increased market volatility. In Asset Servicing, during
March, we experienced an increase in U.S. accounting trade volumes of more than 50% versus the first
2 months of 2020, and global security settlement volumes were up approximately 40% over the same
period. We've also experienced substantial deposit inflows. In Asset Management, we experienced net
inflows driven by cash inflows of $43 billion, and our performance fees were up due to solid performance
across our largest strategies.

As you think about our company's performance over the rest of the year, I would caution against
extrapolating these results for the full year. The full ramifications of the lower rates and the moves in
the capital markets are not yet being fully felt. The decline in our capital ratios this quarter reflects large
deposit inflows, mostly due to the flight to safety from current market conditions and Fed balance sheet
expansion. Share repurchases of $985 million were completed prior to deciding, along with the other big
banks, to temporarily suspend further buybacks so that we can use our significant capital and liquidity
to provide maximum support to our clients. We believe that we will have the ability in a wide range of
scenarios to continue to pay our dividend and to support our clients.

Looking ahead to the remainder of 2020, it is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus on our
results with certainty because so much depends on how the health crisis evolves, its impact to the
economy and issues -- actions taken by central banks and governments to support the economy. We have
a lower risk fee-based business model that positions us relatively well in an environment like this. We
perform stress tests regularly as do our regulators. In CCAR, we consistently perform well. We have a
highly diversified business model with a conservative risk profile and fees in general are skewed towards
recurring revenue streams.

We should benefit from increased activity in Clearance and Collateral Management from increased issuance
of U.S. treasuries and U.S. tri-party collateral management, although the latter somewhat depends on
Federal Reserve Bank and New York operations. Monetary policy turned signs of uncertainty, tends to have
a positive effect for us through lower -- excuse me, through higher deposit volumes, and we will continue
to manage our expenses tightly.

All that having been said, the lower interest rate environment, which impacts us both through net interest
revenue and through money market fee waivers and Pershing, asset management and corporate trust, as
well as the market decline in certain industries being under pressure, will have an impact, and Mike will
cover those items in more detail later. Still, we believe we have the capital and liquidity to withstand a
multiple of scenarios, pay our dividends and continue to support our clients.

Finally, I wanted to take a moment to convey how deeply honored I am to be CEO of this great company.
While my near-term focus is on safeguarding the well-being of our employees, supporting our clients
through this period and maintaining our balance sheet, we are looking ahead to ways to build on our
solid foundation with a strong business model and balance sheet, to drive improved performance and
capabilities across our company.

With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. First, let me echo Todd's opening comments. There are an
incredible number of people in our communities who are either out there on the front lines or providing
essential services to help the rest of us and our families, not to mention all the people in government and
our industry who are working together to help the economy, help people pay their bills and ensure the
smooth functioning of the global markets, we're thankful to all of them.

With that said, let me run through the details of our results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a
year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Beginning on Page 5 of the financial highlights document. In the first quarter of 2020, we had earnings
of $944 million and earnings per share of $1.05, up 4% and 12%, respectively. Comparisons versus
the fourth quarter of 2019 are impacted by the notable items we incurred last quarter, specifically the
gain on sale of the equity investment, which was partially offset by severance and litigation expenses
and net security losses. Total revenue was $4.1 billion or up 5%. Fee revenue increased 10%, primarily
driven by higher foreign exchange and other trading revenue, higher transaction volumes and increased
activity from existing clients across investment services and higher performance fees in investment
management, which were partially offset by equity investment losses and losses from consolidated
investment management funds.

Net interest revenue declined 3% to $814 million year-over-year and was flat to the fourth quarter.
We increased our provision for credit losses by $169 million in the quarter. This was driven by the
macroeconomic outlook in conjunction with the application of the new CECL accounting standard. Our
actual losses or net charge-offs were $1 million during the quarter.

Expenses were essentially flat, driven by continued investment in technology and the higher pension
expenses we spoke about last quarter, partially offset by lower staff expense and the favorable impact of
a stronger U.S. dollar. We had a solid return on tangible equity of 20% and maintained a pretax margin
of 30%. In terms of shareholder capital returns, we repurchased 21.7 million shares for $985 million. The
majority of the repurchases were completed in January and were all completed ahead of the March 15
announcement by the Financial Services Forum member banks regarding the temporary suspension of
repurchases. We also paid $282 million in common stock dividends in the first quarter.

Now moving to capital and liquidity on Page 6. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well
above internal targets in regulatory minimums. The declines versus the prior quarter primarily reflect this
quarter's very strong deposit growth that increased the size of the balance sheet. Common equity Tier 1
capital totaled $18.5 billion as of March 31, and our CET1 ratio was 11.4% under the advanced approach
and 11.3% under the standardized approach. Our average LCR in the first quarter was 115%, and our
SLR was 5.6%. And a reminder that effective April 1, the revised rules will allow us to deduct central bank
deposits and U.S. treasuries from the SLR denominator. Under the new rules, the SLR would have been
approximately 7.6%.

Turning to Page 7. My comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest
revenue was $814 million, flat to the fourth quarter. Despite lower rates in the quarter, the results were
better than what we had expected, driven by the elevated deposit levels, particularly in the last 3 weeks
of March. We also benefited from higher securities and loan balances and the widening of LIBOR to Fed
fund spreads. This was offset with the negative impact of hedging activities, which are mostly offset in
trading and other revenue. The increase in loan balances in March was primarily driven by clients drawing
approximately $3 billion from their committed credit facilities and elevated overdrafts. Higher overdrafts
are normal when there is an increase in market volatility and the overdrafts are generally well secured.
The net interest margin of 101 basis points was down 8 basis points versus the fourth quarter.

Page 8 describes how deposit balances trended over the course of the quarter. Deposit balances were
close to flat to the fourth quarter average through the first 2 months. And if you recall, we had some
episodic activity last quarter, so balances were running a little ahead of where we modeled before the
increased market volatility in March. In March, deposits increased over $300 billion on average and $337
billion on March 31, which you can see in our supplement. All of the businesses saw increases with the
largest dollar increase in Asset Servicing. Through the first 2 weeks of April, deposit balances are down
from the March 31 levels, but remain elevated.

Moving to Page 9. Our average interest-earning assets increased to $324 billion. Approximately 41% of
these assets are held in cash or reverse repos, while 42% are in our securities portfolio and 17% are in
the loan portfolio. In addition to the funded loans in the page, we also have unfunded committed lines.
The details can be found in our annual report and will be updated in the 10-Q. I will give you an overview
of the funded loan exposures. 26% of the portfolio is related to high-quality mortgages and well-secured
investment credit lines provided to our high net worth Wealth Management and Pershing clients. To date,
we have received a limited number of forbearance requests related to the mortgage loans and are working

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

through them with clients. The investment credit lines performed well during the market volatility. 21%
are margin loans, primarily in Pershing. These loans are well secured and have performed well during
the recent volatility as well. 23% are to financial institutions and are composed primarily of short-term
trade-related loans to investment-grade banks with tenors less than 1 year and secured loans to clients,
including asset managers, who often borrow against marketable securities held in custody. 10% of the
portfolio is in commercial real estate. Approximately 70% of the loans that are secured with moderate
leverage and solid loan-to-value ratios. Roughly 10% of this exposure is related to hotels and retail. There
are predominantly -- these are predominantly with clients with whom we have long-standing relationships,
many over multigenerations. The remaining exposure is primarily to REITs, the majority of which are
investment-grade and are well diversified across industries. And the remaining 6% is commercial lending.
These borrowers are primarily investment grade.

Now turning to the securities portfolio. We have a high-quality liquid portfolio, much of it is in U.S.
government agency securities, U.S. treasuries and sovereign debt. The portfolio increased as we deployed
more cash into securities, including the commercial paper and CDs we purchased from our affiliated and
third-party money market funds. The $4 billion of CLOs are highly rated, with 94% AAA and the remainder
AA or better. 97% of the non-Agency CMBs are AAA and have solid subordination. The rest of the ratings
breakdown can be found in the supplement.

Page 10 provides an overview on expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.7 billion were up
slightly, driven by higher technology expenses and pension costs, offset by lower incentive expenses.

Now turning to Page 11. Total investment services revenue was up 9%. Assets under custody and/or
administration increased 2% year-over-year to $35.2 trillion as higher client inflows were partially offset
by lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a strong U.S. dollar. Within Asset Servicing, revenue
was up 8% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher volatility and higher client-driven volumes in our
foreign exchange service, higher transaction activity, higher deposits and new business growth with
existing clients.

In Pershing, revenue was up 16% to $653 million, primarily reflecting higher clearance volumes,
particularly in March. It was also driven by a onetime breakage fee related to a potential client that
will not affect the run rate and higher client assets and accounts from new business onboarded as well
as existing clients. Issuer Services was up 6% to $419 million, with growth in both Corporate Trust
and Depositary Receipts revenue. Depositary Receipts revenue was driven by cross-border settlement
activity, while Corporate Trust reflected net new business and higher deposit volumes. Treasury Services
revenue was up 7% to $339 million, driven by higher deposit balances and higher payment volumes.
Deposit balances increased year-on-year by 22%, reflecting the environment and our investments in new
capabilities and increased focus on deposit gathering. Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was
up 9% to $300 million, reflecting elevated volumes and balances across clearance, tri-party repo and
collateral management -- global collateral management. Average tri-party collateral management balances
in the U.S. and globally were up 15% and 11%, respectively.

Page 12 summarizes the key drivers that effected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of the
investment services businesses.

Now turning to Page 13 for Investment Management. Total Investment Management revenue was down
4%. Asset Management revenue was down 3% year-over-year to $620 million, primarily reflecting equity
investment losses, including seed capital as well as unfavorable change in the mix of AUM since the first
quarter of '19, partially offset by higher performance fees and the positive market impact. Performance
fees of $50 million were up $31 million a year -- from $31 million a year ago due to good performance
in some of our international active equity portfolios. As a reminder, our performance fees tended to be
the highest in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters. We had inflows of
$38 billion in the quarter, most of which was in cash. Overall assets under management of $1.8 trillion
are down 2% year-over-year due to the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Wealth Management
revenue was down 6% year-over-year to $278 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue due
to lower interest rates.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Now turning to our other segment on Page 14. Revenues were roughly flat year-over-year, while expenses
declined by $19 million, primarily due to lower staff expense.

Now finally, a few comments about the second quarter. I'll walk you through a number of variables that
we're watching closely. Having said that, I would encourage you not to put too much emphasis on a
point-in-time view as the variables are changing quickly. As for net interest revenue, as I mentioned,
deposit balances continue to be elevated but lower than the March 31 levels. We are expecting balances to
stabilize above the February average, but below the March 31 surge. We will see the full run rate of lower
interest rates on our funding costs and asset yields, including the securities portfolio. We would expect
between 25% to 30% of the securities portfolio to reprice in the second quarter. The forward curve for
LIBOR Fed fund spread shows a narrowing from today's levels. And in the portfolio, we are monitoring
prepayment speeds of the mortgage-backed securities as they may be volatile in the current environment.
So using the forward market curves and our best estimates right now, we would expect net interest
revenue to be down sequentially between 2% to 5%. Changes to any of the variables mentioned could
both positively or negatively impact the estimate. We also expect that the low interest rates will begin to
impact money market fee waivers. This impact will be felt more encouraging initially but will also impact
other parts of the firm. The total impact is difficult to estimate but could be between $50 million to $75
million in the second quarter, net of lower distribution expense. Higher yields and short-term instruments
may help reduce the impact in the second quarter.

The first quarter foreign exchange and trading revenue was impacted by the significant increase in market
volatility and associated client volumes, primarily in March. Levels have subsided somewhat in April, but
still remain elevated compared to the recent historical lows in 2019. Additionally, the substantial increase
in transactional activity in March across many of the businesses, which Todd noted, was exceptional and
not likely to reoccur. We will also see the full impact of lower equity markets, although some have begun
to recover.

On expenses, we're continuing to focus on driving down discretionary expense while protecting our most
important investments and continue to reprioritize spending given the environment. We would now expect
full year expenses to be approximately flat year-on-year including the expected 50 basis point increase
from the increase in expansion expense. Credit costs will be highly dependent on individual credits and
how the economic forecast change by the time we get to the end of the second quarter. And in terms of
our tax rate, we would expect the full year 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%.

Now before we go to Q&A, I just want to congratulate Todd on behalf of the management team on being
named CEO. It's well-deserved and really good news for us and the company.
And with that, operator, can you please open up the lines for questions?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard S. Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

We can, Gerard.

Gerard S. Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Congratulations, Todd, on the new role. You certainly deserve this, so congratulations.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Thanks, Gerard.

Gerard S. Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can you give us a big picture answer? Obviously, you guys are one of the chief plumbers of the financial
system. And we saw, as you pointed out, extraordinary volumes in so many different areas. Can you give
us a read from the inside how the system handled all the surge? It appears to have ended it well, but
maybe you can give us some firsthand examples of how well the macro system worked to the surge in
activity?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. I'll take that, Gerard. So it's Todd. I think it was impressive how well the system did handle the
huge increases in activity. I mean, there were a couple of glitches, but not many. And for example, in our
Clearing and Collateral Management business, we went to 100% work from home very early on. And all of
that worked quite smoothly. And so we saw volumes increased 50% overnight. But we had the technology
and the capacity to manage it. So I think I'm pretty impressed across the board where we saw resiliency
and disaster recovery plans. That had to change a bit, too, because typically, a disaster recovery plan
would be focused on a region, but this was obviously global. And so the move to work from home was
wherever it could be executed was executed. So a couple of occasional glitches, constant conversations
between the clearing counterparties as well as our clients. We had many thousands of conversations to
make sure that we were connected and that they knew how they could connect with us. We -- there was
a lot of mobilization to the use of our portal and electronic means of communication, which made things
much simpler. So I mean -- I think it was an impressive reflection of the strength of our financial system
and the infrastructure of it.

Gerard S. Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And then a more specific question. Obviously, CECL hit your provision for the quarter, similar to other
banks. Two parts. First, what kind of economic assumptions were used to come up with that provision
that you put into the first quarter results? And then second, if you could identify where most of that was

allocated, was it to, you mentioned some hotel exposure or to financial customers would be helpful as
well.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Mike, do you want to take that one?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Yes, sure. Gerard, I'll take that. So I'd say, first, as you sort of think about the reserve that we built,
a very small piece of it was due to individual either borrower downgrades or the incremental loans that
we saw drawn. And most of it was really reflective of the changing economic environment and the new
accounting standard. And as we sort of think about the outlook that was in there, the outlook takes into
account multiple scenarios, and we sort of use that changing environment to sort of inform what we did
and as you sort of look at it, it was a meaningful waiting towards a very -- a prolonged recessionary
scenario that doesn't fully recover until you get into 2021. So I think that's the way I would sort of think
about it.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

We can.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

We can, Brennan. There's a little noise in the background.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Sorry, it's another earnings call that's overlapping, but I've got to have to do myself from here. Apologies.
First off, Todd, congratulations on getting the role of CEO. They kept us in suspense for a while, but glad
to see we got to the right choice. Quick one on deposit cost trends. So they came in better than expected.
It was probably helped by some of the timing of deposit growth. But is there a way you could help us think
about that line in 2Q? Maybe how much was averaging? And then what you expect to continue to see as
far as some relief on the deposit cost front would be great.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Okay. Mike, you want to take that one as well? And thanks, Brennan.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Sorry about that. Yes. So Brennan, as you sort of think about it. So as you know, the Fed moved
pretty substantially in the latter -- or the middle of March, I guess. And we adjusted our pricing there. And
so you only saw really a couple of weeks of that sort of embedded in the first quarter averages. And so as
you sort of look at the full run rate impact of that, it's going to be a pretty substantial increase down for

the cost of interest-bearing deposits. And so in the beta, obviously changes, as you sort of get close to 0,
but I think you'll see a pretty significant decline as you get down for the rest of the quarter.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. All right. And then when we think about the servicing lines, I believe, Mike, that you talked about
how there was some strength from volumes which aided the line, which you guys flagged during 1Q
as well in early March, and it was great to see it come through. But it seemed as though you sort of
cautioned about that sustaining. Is that because you have seen some of those volumes already subside?
And can you help us think about maybe how much of a contributing factor that was so we could maybe
calibrate for how to adjust in our forecast?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

So Mike, you want to start, and maybe I'll add a little color.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, I think if you sort of think about what we saw, as Todd mentioned in his script, Brennan, is,
is the volumes we saw in the latter part of March were exceptional. And they went from -- for lack of a
better way to describe it, sort of 0 to 100 overnight. And as we sort of look at what we're seeing post
quarter end, the volumes are still higher than they were before the surge, but certainly off the peaks that
we had in the latter part of March. And I think as you sort of look at the go-forward expectation, it's really
hard to predict with a high degree of certainty, how long they'll stay elevated and come down back to
normal.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. Yes. I'd add a little color. I mean, in some of the businesses like clearing and collateral management,
so if you think about our government clearing business, that's continuing to sustain itself at a very high
level because the government is issuing a lot of debt, and there's a lot of trading going on around that.
The collateral management business is probably a little bit off from where we saw it at the peak. But I
think secured lending will become more and more -- it will continue to be important in the industry, and
we're likely to see growth there. But the very high volumes, for example, that we would have seen at
Pershing, the transaction volumes are going to fall back to what we think more normalized levels, which
they've begun -- we've begun to do, and we've seen that in the Asset Servicing to a certain extent as well.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Okay. Mike, I'll turn that one over to you.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Look, obviously, Betsy, as you know, we're in the middle of CCAR. So we're not going to talk much
about sort of what our capital plan looks like at this point. But as you sort of think about where -- given
the increase in the balance sheet, where we're most constrained right now is Tier 1 leverage. And I think
as you sort of think about, perhaps, that could be a good -- depending on how long we sort of remain
constrained there, that could be a good way to continue to fund that. I think we're going to continue to
look at opportunities to either refi, perhaps if that comes back in the market and pricing comes back to
where it was just 4, 5, 6 weeks ago. So we're continuing to look at the capital stack, and we'll give you
more once CCAR is done.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then when I'm thinking about the funding mix, there's room for your funding cost to come down,
obviously, with not only deposits, but in looking at the long-term debt, is there some opportunity there as
well in this environment to reduce the funding costs?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Mike?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

To reduce long-term debt? Is that what you're suggesting, Betsy?

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. Yes, well, just looking at the yield on the long-term debt, is there room there to bring that down in
addition to the deposit cost of funds here over the long term?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

I think lower rates are going to impact our funding costs overall, right? And I think you're going to see
that come through in the second quarter. So I think you will see that.

Operator

Next, move to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Mike, can you talk a little bit about -- more about just helping us understand because it's been a while
now on the fee waiver side. So the $50 million to $75 million, can you just help us understand what that
means when you say net of distribution expense, where it shows up in the income statement? And then
would there be logically, just because rates are going down, a bigger potential impact as you move past
2Q, just on the direction of rates?

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Yes. I think I'll try to give you a little bit of the things that we're sort of thinking about related to that. But
-- so first and foremost, this is going to have an impact on government funds first, right, as you sort of
think about where yields are. And one of the variables that makes it pretty hard to estimate right now is
just where T-bill yields are. So a week -- over the last 3 weeks, they've gone from negative to a 20-plus
basis points, back down a bit now over the last day or so. And so that's going to be a big driver of the
-- when they start -- when fee waivers start to kick in and the depth of them as well. And so you sort of
have to keep that in mind. And as you sort of think about the funds in our Asset Management business
that may get impacted by it, that may be distributed through other parts of the company. Some of those
fee waivers will be offset by lower distribution expenses in those businesses. So you'll see the fee waivers
come through the fee line. And then you'll see distribution expenses lower as they start to impact those
funds.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it...

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

And I'll add a little bit. Ken, I'll add a little bit to that. It's important to note the difference between prime
and government funds. So the yield in prime funds is, it can certainly support the fees. Initially, there
was avoidance of prime funds. So -- and we're starting to see some investors come back to them. So that
could have an impact that would neutralize some of it. And Mike's point is there going to be enough yield
in assets and government funds to generate the fees. And the huge amount of issuance in T-bills has kind
of surprised us a little bit and put a little bit of yield into that. But that can't be certain that could come
down again.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just a follow-up on the cost side. Obviously, you're adjusting to try to keep costs flat in this
environment. Can you just talk a little bit more about what do you shift? Is it -- do you push out some
investment spend? Is it an incentive comp adjustment? What are the ins and outs of your ability to hold
the line there that you're attempting to do?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Okay. Thank you. Mike, do you want to take that?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We haven't seen -- so first, we haven't really seen any impact on our most important investments.
And as you sort of look at the investment portfolio, and you get deeper into the list, there's always
opportunity to sort of reprioritize the timing of some of those things. And so we're doing that. You're going
to see -- I'll state the obvious, but you're going to see lower travel and business development costs that
will be part of it. Although Todd said, we're not going to have any restructuring or layoffs through the
rest of the year, we're also putting a lot of discipline around new hires that we're bringing in -- during this
environment. So I think it's a multitude of factors that you highlighted that help us have the confidence to
get there.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

And also, congrats, Todd. It's good to see that you get the frontline role. Let me just start with maybe,
Todd -- thanks, Mike, for giving us a pretty good outlook for the activity levels coming into the second
quarter. But Todd, maybe you can give us some perspective on what you kind of see for the rest of the
year. Obviously, extremely difficult to predict. But with the government intervention and the uncertainty
about the path to recovery, how are you seeing that potentially impact some of the key business lines in
activity? And also including comments on the backstop on the Fed on prime money funds, to the extent,
do you get much more confidence in people investing in prime funds versus government.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. Well, first of all, as I had mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of that. So we are seeing a little bit of
positive flows into the prime funds. But if you look at activity levels, we would expect them to, obviously,
come down from the surge that we saw toward the end of March, but probably be elevated. And again,
anything we say, there's just so much uncertainty to the environment and the situation that we face. And
it's really hard for us to look out long-term until we get on the other side of this -- of the health crisis. But
that being said, we wouldn't expect to stay at the extraordinarily high levels that we saw in March, with
the exception perhaps of our clearing and collateral management business just because there is going
to be so much debt issuance. But in the rest of our businesses, the transaction volumes component of
Pershing business, the same thing in Asset Servicing, we would expect that to moderate just about under
any circumstances, unless we just saw another couple of blips and more of, what I call, a seesaw activity
that could take place over the remainder of the year.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And then the organic growth efforts that you're doing as well, like in deposit gathering and then collateral
management, is that on track? Or is that sort of a bit suspended in its environment?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. I would say if you look at the organic growth, especially around the deposits, I mean we had -- we
have seen some positives there. Obviously, there were surge deposits that are just going to be associated
with this interest rate environment in this financial environment. But when we look out at our other
businesses, we have room to gain some market share. I think we've done that in our payments business.
We had some good wins in the first quarter in our Asset Servicing business. I would expect under this
environment, people are probably going to slow down, making a whole lot of transitions. We've got a
healthy pipeline, both in our asset servicing and Pershing business. I'm not sure a lot of people are going
to make a whole lot of change. We are seeing some new fund complexes come on, but we're also seeing
some being deferred.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then Mike, just real quick on NII outlook in the second quarter. Does that
exclude FX hedging activity?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, FX -- not FX hedge, but the hedging activity is hard to predict because it's at a point in time
at the end of the quarter. So we're not making an assumption either way on that at this point.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Congrats, Todd. Quick question on Pershing and kind of what you've been seeing with all the changes
going on in the industry and kind of what that means for the pipeline in that business. Has it helped? Or is
it too early to say at this point in time?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and Mike can add some color. First of all, I think it's a little early
to say. Pershing has a different model. And I think clients are quite interested in seeing a more open
architected approach to what some of their competitors are doing. So I think the conversations are quite
healthy there. I think the pipeline continues to be strong. They've come out with a very competitive
subscription priced alternative to meet whatever the demand of that client base is. We're continuing to
invest in our advisory services business. So I don't think it's -- I don't think there's any significant impact
that we're seeing from some of the consolidation elsewhere in the business, other than it's making us
a little bit more of a differentiated alternative. And I'd also -- I mentioned that Pershing did quite well
through the crisis. So it was able to keep its technology up and running and accommodate the surge in
the growth, which, in some instances, as we point out, it was 3 to 4x. I don't know, Mike, do you have
anything to add to that?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. And I would just say, probably more broadly outside of just Pershing, I think we're seeing the benefits
of a lot of the investments we've been making over the last couple of years. And I think clients are seeing
that as well. I know anecdotally, we heard from a client that just we brought on to our middle office
service late last year, saying, "I'm not sure how I could have done this without you and couldn't have
dealt with all of the increase in the volatility on my own." And so I think we're seeing that sentiment really
across -- more broadly across the client base.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just separate question. On those deposits that you saw come in, in surge in March, they're
rolling off the balance sheet now. Are those now just going more so into your own liquidity products and
that's been factored into the few waivers that you gave in the second quarter? Are they just rolling off
completely?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Well, why don't I take that one, and then Mike, you can jump in. If you think about what happened in the
ecosystem, so when there was a lot of draws, for example, under these commitments around the country,
a lot of that cash had to go somewhere. Some of it was deposited back in banks, and a lot of it went into
government funds. Initially, government funds had nowhere to invest. So a lot of that ended up in the
money market funds where we were the custodian. So we saw that big spike. That's now -- a lot of that
spike has normalized itself out as there are other alternative investments for those government funds.
Some of those were our own money market funds and some of them were competitor money market
funds. I think that's the biggest, the biggest most volatile component of the cash that we saw move.

Our next question goes to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

CEO & Director

Mike?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Mike, as I said earlier, we're -- we use a multiple -- many scenarios that sort of go into sort of
thinking about what the ultimate reserving looks like. But it's a scenario where you don't see a meaningful
sort of uplift or doesn't fully recover until you're into the middle of next year. So you start a recovery in
the latter part of the year, and you -- it doesn't fully recover until later in 2021. As I said earlier as well,
only a small portion of the reserve is related to either actual borrower downgrades or the increase in the
loan portfolio. The remainder of it is related to the changing economic environment and the way that flows
through the new accounting standard.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess so what I'm getting to is, it's not just unique to you, it's the industry. So it seems like you're
planning for kind of a "U" recovery. But you have an infrastructure for a "V" recovery, like you're retaining
your employees, your expenses should be kind of flat this year. I'm going to guess you're not changing
tech spending, but I'm not sure if that's correct. So help me reconcile keeping in infrastructure for a "V"
recovery, while your underlying premise is for a "U" recovery?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Do you want to take that, Mike, or do you want me take it?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Do you want to start?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Okay. Yes. Well, why don't I start? So we did give a guidance or Mike gave guidance that we do expect
expenses, Mike, to be lower than they otherwise would have been. We think that having the human
resources here is the right thing to do, not only for them, but also to position ourselves well to service
our clients through this kind of an environment and trying to make any significant changes just wouldn't
be particularly prudent on our part. That being said, we are controlling other components of our cost.
We want to continue to make the investments in technology that we can. I'm sure some of that will be
delayed and could be somewhat different prioritization. But we're going to keep a very close eye on our
expenses. We think we can do a little bit better than the guidance that we had previously given for a
number of reasons. And we are talking about a U-shape type of recovery, which means you do need those
resources to continue to support our people in this kind of an environment.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And just last follow-up then, just on the tech spending. So you expect some delay? Or like, what was your
tech spending going to be? What will it be now? Or how should we think about that part?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. We are committed to continue with the spend that we've gotten, and that's what we've indicated. I'm
certain that a couple of things might end up being delayed a bit. But I'm not going to pull that out of our
plans at this point in time by any means.

We'll next go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

To echo everybody's comments, congratulations to Todd. Question for you guys with respect to just
broader liquidity in the system. Clearly, there's been a tremendous amount of cash flows coming to the
sidelines, and that's both the Fed action as well as the general risk of backdrop. How should we think
about BK's ability to sort of absorb these deposits? So changes to spot SLR definitely helped, but there's
lots of other considerations. So kind of help us think through the ramifications of this a little bit longer
term and how the balance sheet could ultimately be in terms of size beyond the first quarter?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Okay. Mike, do you want to take that?

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I think the SLR change is sort of helpful that's out there. But I think as you sort of look at our
constraints on the balance sheet, it's been Tier 1 leverage based on the overall size of the balance sheet.
And I think we have been able to sort of work through that with our clients pretty effectively so far. And
as Todd said, as the environment normalizes a bit for the money funds and the rate environment sort of
settles down, we've seen those real surge balances come off. And so our expectation as things normalize
more is that the balance sheet will either sort of hold steady or sort of come down from where we are
right now. And so we feel like we can sort of work through that pretty effectively at -- with the current
capital that we've got.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just a couple of cleanups around NIR. Can you help quantify the hedging benefits in
the quarter? I know it hits NIR and shows up in FX. So just to, to clean that up. And also any sense of
new money yield on the fixed portion of the securities portfolio as that matures and gets reinvested?
Just trying to get a sense of the headwind to NIR beyond the second quarter on that fixed scale of the
portfolio.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. Sure. So I'll take the first piece on the hedging benefit. So this is kind of really sort of simple. We
have interest rate swaps in the portfolio. And the way they're valued every day sort of creates some basis
risk between OIS and LIBOR. And really, all we're doing is sort of hedging that basis risk that's created
from interest rate swaps. And that impact for the quarter is based on where it all ends up on the day -- at
the end of -- 1 day at the end of the quarter. So there's really nothing else sort of happening there. And
you can kind of see the relative impact on the slide in the presentation. And so that's a hard thing to sort
of predict in terms of where it's going to end up at the end of the quarter. As you sort of think about the
securities portfolio, I mean, you can kind of see where rates are right now as you sort of think about both
the fixed rate and the floating rate piece of the portfolio. And I think as we sort of look at our investment
strategy going forward, we're doing whatever we can to try to get some yield out of it. And I think the
reinvestment rates are down from what you saw, obviously, in the second quarter. But just a reminder,
the overall duration of the portfolio is just a couple of years, right? So we're not buying a lot of 30-year
treasuries as we sort of think about this portfolio. And I think we're doing our best to try to keep that
spread up as best we can while -- within the risk appetite we're in.
