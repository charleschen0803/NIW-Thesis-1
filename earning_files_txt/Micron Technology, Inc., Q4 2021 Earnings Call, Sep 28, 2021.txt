Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri of SMBC Nikko Securities.

Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions. First, on the mobile in the quarter that you reported, I think revenues were down
mid-single digits. Given the strong demand commentary and the seasonal strength, I was surprised to see
that mobile was down sequentially. So if you can talk about that.

And then on the outlook for the November quarter for bits going down little bit. I understand the PC
market is going through an inventory correction, but PC is a relatively small portion of the overall DRAM
market. And it looks like the cloud market is pretty strong and mobile is strong. So I'm just trying to
reconcile that comment with your demand commentary in other segments. If you can maybe talk about
how the other segments are faring sequentially as we go from August to the November quarter in terms of
bits, I think that would be helpful.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Sorry, what was that second question again? I didn't get pass the second question.

Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Yes. The second question, your guidance for bits sequentially declining. I think you attributed that to the
PC market. I believe the PC market is about 10% of the overall DRAM bits. So I'm surprised to see that PC
is having such a big impact to move the entire, I mean, bits down sequentially. So if you can talk about
what's your assumption for cloud bits sequentially and also the mobile bits sequentially, I think that would
be helpful.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Okay. All right. Understood. Yes, I can address that. So the first question about mobile. So I just wanted
to mention that part of what we see in terms of the specific business unit performance is also driven by
how we decide to allocate bits for shipment into various customers and to various segments. So it's not
only the dynamics of the segment itself that's at play, but also our own allocation strategy internally that's
at play.

So one important thing I just wanted to call your attention to is our company inventory at the end of FY
Q4 was below our target level, which means we practically shipped everything that we could ship that was
not nailed down and then some. So we have unsustainably low level of inventory right now, not enough
inventory to service adequately customer demand and manage the mix change. So we have to improve
our own internal inventory position. And that is one of the reasons why we had a decline in sequential bits
in mobile, not related to end market demand. End market demand is strong.

And also, I'd like to mention that we did have very strong shipments in our storage business. If you look
at our storage business results, our NAND shipments were very strong there. So overall, I would say that
our inventories are at very low levels and our mobile end market demand, to your first question, remains
very robust.

So now to your second question about why is F Q1 bit shipments forecasted to decline modestly. PCs are
more than just 10% of the DRAM market, and they are definitely higher level, significantly higher mix for
us than that 10% number you mentioned. So it is an impact to that portion of the market.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

And when -- you can appreciate when some of these purchase slowdown occurs in any one of these
segments, the overall goal for some of these customers is to make those corrections very quick so that
they can move on to more normal ordering patterns in future quarters. And so typically, most of these
things end up being sharp and short when they have those kind of collections. So that's one aspect of it.

And the other aspect is, again, we have very low inventory. So that's another thing that's impacting our
sequential bit shipments.

And the last aspect, as we have already mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are seeing some
constraints in our own supply chain to be able to meet all of the demand that is placed on us by our
customers. And those are things we have done a really good job over the last many quarters of avoiding
some of those constraints, whereas the rest of the industry had to struggle with some of those constraints.
But we are having some impact, nevertheless. So that's also showing up in some of our ships.

Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And if I can maybe follow up on the same topic. So you're guiding for bit growth to resume, I think,
in the second half of the fiscal year. And you said that your fiscal year bit supply growth will be somewhat
below the industry growth. But I think just looking at my model, I have to make pretty aggressive
assumptions in the second half even to get to 10% bit growth. And I know you're guiding for like mid-
teens, maybe somewhat below mid-teens. Just curious, what will get you to that aggressive second half
ramp in terms of volume, is it just 1-alpha? Are you thinking about building inventory in the first half? I'm
just curious as to how you get to that level.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Yes. I think...

David Zinsner

I can handle it. I think that your question, Srini, was mainly about DRAM, but I can answer both for DRAM
and NAND. And the inventory levels are very lean for both of them right now. And so as Sumit was saying
in the previous question, it's just difficult for us to be able to adjust the mix when they're -- when our
customers have shortages on components, they want to -- they change where they want the mix of supply
to be and we have to adjust that. And with lower levels of inventory, we're not able to do that in the near
term.

We think that the component shortages will get better for everyone, for customers and for us as we go
through the next several quarters. And that gradual improvement will release more demand across all
segments. And then we'll be able to align our limited supply better with the supply -- with the demand
requirements of the broader market as we go through the year.

In terms of what the key drivers are. The key drivers for both DRAM and NAND are the leading
technologies, 1-alpha for DRAM and 176 layer for NAND. Both of those are ramping very well. Sanjay
mentioned some statistics about how well the yield is going, how well the shipments are going on the prior
call. And so those really are still going to be the workhorses for us through the year, and we do still expect
a record year in terms of revenue for the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets.

Unknown Analyst

This is Jitendra for Ambrish. Dave, your office guide for fiscal first quarter is up around 3% on a lower
sequential revenue guide. Are there any onetime costs that we should be thinking of from the beginning of
the fiscal year? And how should we think about OpEx trajectory for the rest of the fiscal year?

David Zinsner

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

I'm totally sorry, I totally missed the first part. Is the whole question around OpEx?

Unknown Analyst

Yes.

David Zinsner

Okay. Well, let me try to -- I'll talk about OpEx and then let me know if I answered your question. So OpEx
will be up sequentially this quarter. Some of that -- we had a relatively light year last year for fiscal '21 for
pre-qual expenses, and those are starting to come back as we work on the next node. So that's driving
some of it. And we also have salary increases in the first quarter, which will impact the first quarter and
actually have a bigger impact in the second quarter.

We're also making investments in R&D and in SG&A to bring -- to invest on the product side and the
process technology side and make more investments in each of those areas, which is likely to increase
our headcount, and we feel it's prudent. Nevertheless, we think OpEx as a percent of revenue will be
at a fairly low level, barely low as it compares to not only our memory peers but also our -- the overall
semiconductor business.

So we feel like we're still prudent to investment on the CapEx side, even though we're growing CapEx
at 15%. And as Sanjay mentioned, also, we expect a record year in terms of revenue. So that will help
fund obviously the OpEx increase. After that, I mean, hard to say beyond fiscal '22 what we think on the
OpEx side, but I think that this OpEx as a percent of revenue roughly in the low double-digit to low teens
is roughly where we'd like to operate.

Unknown Analyst

Great. As a quick follow-up. We just wanted to check if there is any impact from the latest power
restrictions in China. That has any impact on the manufacturing for Micron?

David Zinsner

So yes, we're tracking that closely, and we do have some component supply that is coming from regions
that are impacted -- and the -- that is -- as we mentioned, we do have some areas of our component
supply chain as well as some of our silicon supply chain that is starting to have some impact on our ability
to ship products this quarter, and that's baked into our guidance there. So we're tracking that very closely
and making sure that we can recover and meet demand for our customers. But that is one of the things
that is creating some impact for us in our supply chain this quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Two follow-ups. David, I want to go back to your bit shipment. In the prepared remarks, you talked about
the shipment growth resuming in the second half of fiscal year '22. You also highlighted the decline in the
November quarter. But you left out February. What should we assume for February? Would it be flat before
the growth resumes? Or would February be also down?

David Zinsner

Yes, I mean we're shying away from that. We don't -- we gave a lot of detail, obviously. We're not trying
to guide every quarter. I guess, I would just say that typically, the favorite quarter is seasonally weaker
than the first fiscal quarter. That said, given that the first quarter is a bit weaker in terms of shipments,
it's likely that this might be a more muted environment from a seasonality perspective in the February
quarter. And so that's -- I think that probably is as much as I can give you on the modeling front.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. And then you mentioned something about free cash flow seasonally weaker in Q1 fiscal year '22. Did
you mean to decline, not actually having cash burn, correct?

David Zinsner

Yes. I mean, again, we don't necessarily forecast out free cash flow every quarter. But given that CapEx
is more weighted towards the first half, it's likely to have a more meaningful impact on free cash flow.
So I think it's going to be relatively muted. Hard to say whether it's positive or negative, we'll have to
kind of see how things go from a business perspective and how work to capital plays out. It certainly will
be weaker than the fourth fiscal quarter from a cash perspective. But having said that, we are expecting
strong free cash flow for the year.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. I just want to make sure you even imply cash flow. It just it's going to be a positive free cash flow,
it's just that maybe compared to a record in Q4, maybe it's just down sequentially.

David Zinsner

Yes, I think it's going to be meaningfully down sequentially.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tom O'Malley of Barclays.

Thomas James O'Malley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Mine on the OpEx side as well. Can you talk about how contingent that 15% raise on R&D? Is some of that
bit growth coming in the back half? And I guess another way to say that is, let's just say you get to the
May quarter, bits are supposed to come back on whether that's supply or demand getting a bit better, and
you're not seeing it come on as fast. Are you still expecting to spend that much? Is that a fixed number or
would you dial that back if things were a bit weaker?

David Zinsner

Of course, we will manage OpEx based on business conditions, of course, yes. We are anticipating that like
I said that we see record revenue next year. So we're optimistic that we'll be making that investment.

Thomas James O'Malley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And I guess, kind of in conjunction with that and to a question earlier as well. In that May quarter where
you're starting to see some of that bit growth, is that more from your expectation that some supply
growth, some supply comes back? Or is that really seeing some material demand drivers improve? Can
you just talk about the mix there versus what you're expecting, which is more of a contribution to that bit
growth in the back half?

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Yes. In terms of the back half, a couple of things will happen. Number one, we feel that our internal
inventory position, which is below our target levels right now would have improved. We think some of the
component shortages that are taking place, both for us as well as our customers who don't have adequate
match sets in certain areas of their business, those component shortages would improve as well. And we
also feel that the continued growth in several of the segments that we have already highlighted are going
to create a very good demand environment.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

We expect good demand in the data center side with a lot of upgrades happening to newer processor
platforms with higher content of DRAM and NAND. We also expect more than 50% unit volume growth in
5G shipments next year and continued very robust growth significantly above average industry levels of
growth in both automotive and industrial to continue.

So a lot of strong demand trends that are underpinning it and coming together with some of the
improvements on the supply side that are creating some shortages right now, we feel will help drive the
overall business trends.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I have a question on gross margin. You talked about the mix changes being the predominant factor
impacting gross margin in the November quarter. Can you be a little more specific about what is driving
this mix? I thought less PC should be better for ASP, maybe there's just high mobile client SSD.

Also on the second question here as well. For fiscal '22 cost down, you talked about DRAM to be better
than the long-term trend and NAND to be in line. Does that comment exclude the COVID costs you are
assuming for the next 2 quarters? And is mix change a big impact on a full year basis, when we think
about the full year?

David Zinsner

Okay. I didn't quite get the second question, but okay.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I'll repeat that.

David Zinsner

No, no, that's all right. Manish picked it up, and I can add color. I think you're -- so, I think you're thinking
too much on the gross margin guidance as it relates to mix. All I'm saying is cost and price are not a big
determinant of the gross margins. We have to create a range because there's a lot of different outcomes,
the mix of NAND versus DRAM, the mix, as you can point out, of the different business units, the mix
within the product categories.

We can't call it within a 200 basis point range. So we gave you a 200 basis point range. It might be at
the high end, it might be at the low end. It somewhat depends on how we get, as Manish already talked
about, what bits come out of the line and how we do in terms of shipping those to customers. That's -- it's
no more complicated than that.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. So the second part of the question...

David Zinsner

On cost, right? So you had a couple of questions in there, Sidney. One was the clarification on the front
end. The comment we made about cost down trajectory and then the second part was around mix and
how the mix would impact, I think.

So what we said is that the front-end cost, meaning the memory level cost before we get to assembly and
test driven largely on the back of 1-alpha and 176 being really, really great leadership nodes for us and
ramping well with yields and production output and everything else, those are going to deliver really good

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

cost declines and DRAM maybe even above the long-term range that we've talked about. And in NAND,
kind of in line with the range. So we feel good about those.

But when it comes to the full product cost, we have some of the costs to mitigate COVID in all of our
assembly factories, materials cost increases that we're seeing across the supply chain and then yes, mix
will increase. DDR5, LP5, data center SSDs, these are all going to continue to grow as a part of our mix as
we move to more high-value solutions, and those impact our end kind of pure cost reduction capability.

But as Dave mentioned, when you're -- the portfolio is moving, then you're going to -- the mix will also
help you on the pricing side. And so that's why the margin side is still -- we have a pretty healthy guide
for the margins here, at least the one that we gave for FQ1.

Operator

Next question comes from Karl Ackerman of Cowen & Company.

Karl Ackerman

I wanted to understand perhaps a little bit better what the right mix of work in process is for your
inventory. You mentioned how you're trying to improve your finished goods inventory, that's had a very
record low. It sounds like you're building that up this quarter. But are you able to expand your packaging
and/or assembly and test suppliers to free up some of the bottlenecks on inventory?

David Zinsner

So I'll take that one, Karl. So broadly, there's a couple of elements of work in process. Obviously, what's
in the fab is the largest part of our work in process. And that part is as you implement longer and long
-- newer technology nodes, longer process flows, so that is one of the headwinds for us. for the whole
industry really in terms of monotonically increasing portion of our inventory because fab cycle time is
getting longer every single node.

In terms of the constraints in the back end, one of the things that's a challenge is really the lead times in
terms of how you're able to get components and get assembly capacity across our network. We've done
pretty well with being able to meet customer demand across our both captive back-end as well as our
noncaptive back-end. I wouldn't say that that's really driving so much the -- an increase in WIP. It's more
that when we work with more subcontractors and use their volumes, the cycle times are longer than they
are in our own factories. And so that does maybe elevate a little bit our back-end inventory.

But our -- I think as we mentioned, our finished goods inventories are at the leanest level they've been
in many, many years. So we're able to -- whatever we're able to produce, we're able to match to demand
and move -- and generate revenue.

Karl Ackerman

Got it, that's very helpful. I'm not sure if I was limited to one question, if I could just sneak one more in.
I want to ask about automotive. Has your ability to service automotive demand improved or stayed the
same over the last 90 days? I ask because last quarter, you indicated demand was far outstripping your
ability to supply. I'm wondering if OEM production shutdowns have allowed you to better meet existing
demand and perhaps broaden your design wins as you think about fiscal '22.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Yes. Our design wins continue to come in at a very strong pace. We have, as you know, #1 market share
in our business, in the memory space, in automotive and industrial by a wide margin compared to our
next competitor. And so we have had tremendous momentum and design wins, and we have some really
great technologies and products we have introduced and are also moving our customers to newer nodes of
technology. So really a lot of positive momentum in that space.

I think the challenges of supplying to the level of demand that we have in automotive, and I'll put the
industrial segment in that same bucket because they use very similar products and similar nodes of

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

technology. Both of those are continuing to have demand levels that significantly outstrip our ability to
supply to those. We are working very hard. We have made improvements internally, but we are still short
of where we would need to be, we would want to be.

Some of those shortages relate to internal production capacity. Others relate to some of the components
that we need in our supply chain to be able to ship. So there are shortages of both kinds that are
impacting that particular segment. And the demand supply balance is such that it will take us a while
before we will be able to catch up. And I think you have already seen that. Broadly speaking, in the
semiconductor industry level, it's also the segment that is the most challenged in terms of getting to that
supply-demand balance. It will probably be the longest in that segment where supply-demand balance will
be achieved in the industry, probably not till the end of next calendar year, maybe into 2023.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Caso of Raymond James.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I just say my question is, I know that it's the goal to...

Farhan Ahmad
Senior Director of Investor Relations

Chris, sorry, you're not coming in clear. Can you try to get closer to the mic, if you're on a speaker phone,
maybe just pick up the handset?

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Sorry about that. Yes, is this better?

David Zinsner

Yes.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay, sorry, headset problem. So I said I know the goal over time is to modulate the CapEx to stay in line
with industry bit demand. Have you taken any steps to do that? And I guess the question is, has what
you've seen in PC been enough to convention to make any changes. And I know you've given us a CapEx
number now, but I know it's even in the planning process for a while? Or is this transitory enough such
that it really hasn't had an effect on what your capacity planning has been, again, not just on a 1 quarter
basis, but over a couple of quarters?

David Zinsner

Yes. I mean growth has been stronger both in DRAM and for calendar '21 versus what we expected, for
sure. And so that obviously is an influence on what we think in terms of the growth. And then, of course,
you're right, the PC market is softer, but we do view it as transitory or an air pocket and so forth.

We do view the long-term bit growth rates of both DRAM and NAND to be very similar to what we have felt
the long-term growth rate would be, which is mid- to high teens in DRAM and about 30% in NAND over
time. And so as we obviously look at this every month really with Manish to determine what makes sense.
And we haven't really changed our view from that perspective.

That being said, if we do start to have a feeling that bit growth assumptions are too high, we, of course,
would immediately adjust CapEx spend to react to that. But so far, based on our view, we haven't.

Manish H. Bhatia
Executive Vice President of Global Operations

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

And I think this time, we went in the script, Chris, giving you a little more color on some of the aspects
that drove our CapEx guide that are not really going to contribute to bit growth in the near term, right?
We've got the investments in EUV that are going to benefit us a few years down the road. We've got
investments in other R&D for other products. We've got assembly test, which won't add to bit growth, but
will help with our supply chain resiliency.

So these are some of the examples of things that are in our CapEx guide that are not tied directly to
our view of the next 12 to 18 months' worth of market conditions. And then I think we are being pretty
disciplined even within that. We explained that our DRAM CapEx for transitions, we've done a good job
with 1-alpha so far, and we're going to leverage that with over the next year and our DRAM CapEx will be
lower year-on-year. So I think we're managing prudently with sort of the near-term market dynamics as
well as keeping in mind the long-term strategic technologies we need to invest in for the future.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And if I can just have a quick follow-up. And recognizing that the CapEx is not necessarily apples-
to-apples because of some of those things that don't affect bit demand. I mean is the net of it that the
CapEx spend that we see this year is in line with what your view of industry bit demand is as we look at
the full year?

Manish H. Bhatia
Executive Vice President of Global Operations

Yes, I think as we said that we think our bit supply growth for calendar year '22 will be in line with the
long-term CAGR, and that should be -- in fact, the whole industry has this challenge of having shipped
-- depleted inventories over the last 12 months, maybe even longer. And so in order to be able to have
the industry growth rates catch back up, you're going to need to -- you're going to see that it's going to
be difficult for the shipment growth rate to be above the long-term CAGR. That's why we think that in CY
'22, there'll be healthy supply/demand balance. We'll be shipping new supply -- the whole industry will be
shipping from new fab supply not from inventory.

David Zinsner

I think the other thing is that -- and we'll see this year-to-year that while we believe that capital intensity
over time is kind of mid-30s as a percent of revenue. It will vary year-to-year somewhat as a function of
the revenue number, but also a function of what node we're investing in and what that delivers in terms of
bit growth. And so those things will obviously influence how we invest our capital on a year-to-year basis
on the nodes.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Yes. And on that point, 1-alpha is a good capital intensity node, right? So DRAM CapEx is going down
because it's a mature node now, and we are investing on it. And 176, our transition is especially expensive
transition for us because we are not just going up higher layer count, we are also changing the notes, the
stack of the NAND, and so it is more expensive. So NAND CapEx is also going up because of that because
more of the wafers we are converting next year.

Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho.

Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Dave, just a question on the -- I know you talked about inventory on the gains on the supply constraints.
But just wondering what -- how we are seeing inventory levels on the cloud hyperscale guys and on the
mobile handset side, too? If you could give some quantification as to where those were versus normal
levels? And I have a follow-up.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Yes, in terms of customer inventory, by and large, we think that the inventory levels are in decent shape. I
think on the cloud side and on the enterprise side, the inventory levels are in much better shape than they
were, for example, a few years ago when everyone was all concerned about how that inventory would
impact the market environment, let's say, in 2018-2019 time frame. So this time around, that definitely
that inventory is in much better shape. And also, the data center companies are looking ahead to a fairly
strong year of CapEx investments in server capacity and deploying new server platforms, both with newer
processors as well as DDR5 capabilities. And so it's going to be an important investment year for our
customers there.

So I think on the mobile side, some customers have little bit elevated level of inventory. Others are
in relatively good shape. Of course, there are market share shifts that keep happening in the mobile
space. So it is not unusual for certain customers to have more inventory. But this time around, we feel
maybe there is some element of geopolitical risk that's causing perhaps some of those inventories to be
somewhat elevated and also a lot of challenges that most companies have faced over the last 18 months.

Certainly, since COVID began is likely causing -- and all of these events that keep occurring every few
days or weeks about some new supply chain risk that's coming up in the industry is also probably causing
companies to have a strategic decision to carry a little bit higher inventory for a period of time perhaps.
But certainly, things like geopolitical-related aspects don't have any end in sight. So we don't know what
the outlook of that is in terms of its impact on normalization of those inventories. But overall, I would say
some customers are on the mobile side with okay inventory. Others have a little bit higher inventory.

Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just one other question. I know you mentioned maybe a couple of months here quarters to
resolve this whole constraint issue. Is that more a commentary on the PC side in terms of the component
constraint side? Or is that more a commentary on that the supply -- that OEMs will start to pull on
demand again on all segments like data center and mobile and PCs you go into -- as you go through some
adjustments here.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Manish, you want to take that or you want me to?

Manish H. Bhatia
Executive Vice President of Global Operations

I was thinking -- I think the question was more about PC market, right?

Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes. Not just PC and mobile and data center, yes. sorry.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

But the inventory of the...

Manish H. Bhatia
Executive Vice President of Global Operations

Yes. About the components. You're talk about component charts in the end. I mean I think for the PC side,
definitely, we talked about it as a 1- to 2-month -- sorry, 1 to 2 quarters. This quarter, next quarter should
be getting resolved and seeing the end market demand start to come through more fully.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

Across the other markets, we don't see as much of constraints. From the end market side, PC is definitely
the one that's there. And we think that the end market demand for all segments, whether it's mobile,
whether it's data center, obviously, automotive which has been constrained quite a bit. The end market
demand is very, very strong. And as Sumit said earlier, automotive will be one like -- that may take longer
to be able to be resolved.

Operator

Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.

John Pitzer

Dave, I'm just kind of curious on the R&D guide you gave for the full fiscal year. Is the implication there
that you're going to be outside of the normal range, and that's why you're calling it out? And specifically,
help me understand what this R&D is going to? Is this really a qualification of new products?

David Zinsner

No. I mean, I think -- I mean the reason to call it out was because 15% growth is actually higher relative
to what we've normally seen in terms of growth in our OpEx. And in fiscal '21, we're basically flat with the
prior year. So just wanted to make sure that investors were modeling that level appropriately. I mean I
think that was more of the intention there.

It's going through a whole bunch of things. I mean, we are hiring engineers for the product side, no doubt
about it. We do have a heavier load of just prequalification expenses where the R&D groups are utilizing
the wafer lines for their run as opposed to direction runs. So that obviously if -- and that activity kind of
goes up and down quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and it's going to be a pretty heavy year in terms
of activity around qualification expenses. So that's another aspect of what we're trying to highlight.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

I think we had some -- just to start, we have some significant increases in investment happening in high-
bandwidth memory and CXL, which is a completely new area that we have started investing in, continued
investment in data center SSDs. So it's a set of significant ongoing investments on the product side
because as we have mentioned, we are constantly trying to improve the product mix.

And some of these newer technologies that we are going -- that we are working on, obviously, both on the
DRAM and NAND side, the wafer costs keep increasing. So that constantly puts upward pressure on R&D
and, of course, that's why it's not easy to -- for newer players in this business because it's a business of
scale and it requires that level of scale to be able to make these large investments.

David Zinsner

EUV R&D technology investment is also something that we have talked about as a program where we are
making it a bigger program.

John Pitzer

Got it. And then, Dave, maybe just trying to ask my question on the public call a little bit differently.
I mean to the extent that what we do is kind of look at historical patterns and try a correlation, this
cycle or this upturn looks a lot different than a normal upturn. I'm kind of curious, to the extent that the
magnitude and duration is at least taking a pause here, are you arguing that that's completely attributable
to some of the supply constraint issues that your customers are having? Or can we actually dare say that
maybe your customers are thinking about memory procurement a little bit differently?

And perhaps I know you guys have been striving to make this business less volatile and more predictable.
Is that sort of what we're seeing? Or is it too early to make that call?

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

I mean from a...

David Zinsner

What's causing the air packet, it is definitely the component side of PC space, there's no doubt about that.
We have -- our embedded business unit is now at record levels. That is a more stable business within
the portfolio. So I think that does help in terms of alleviating some of the pressure that past cycles have
had on gross margins, for sure. I think we really view the next quarter, first Q1 plus Q2 is more just a
function of the PC customers needed to cleanse out the results. They've got fairly strong demand at the
end customer level and just can't build units without all the components.

And as soon as they do, we have seen sustainably strong demand for memory across all of the various
markets. And I think that once we get past that period where the PC market gets back into a better place,
we'll see a resumption of our strong demand as well.

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

I think the other aspect to just keep in mind is, there is nothing normal about the time that we are in,
right? I mean this is an unprecedented time in our industry and certainly in the memory and storage
business as well, in the technology business and anything that uses semiconductors, it's an unprecedented
time.

And shortages of the type that we are seeing across a whole range of aspects of supply chain have never
been experienced in the industry in the many decades that all of us have been working in this industry. So
I would say that for us to expect that will be a "normal" upturn is sort of maybe not a realistic expectation.
So really what all of these things that we have described in our discussion today with you are meant to
describe an environment where a lot of the demand is stretching out because largely, it's difficult to meet
the demand in the time frame in which it has been placed on not just us, but the rest of the industry. And
that is going to enable us to look ahead and feel a level of confidence that we will be at record levels of
revenue in fiscal '22. And that's all the reasons I've done. We think the supply will be pretty constrained.
And so it's going to be a very profitable year as well. So sort of I just wanted to mention that. So Manish,
you want to...

Manish H. Bhatia
Executive Vice President of Global Operations

I'm going to say the same thing at those points.

John Pitzer

And then lastly, Dave, very quickly, there's been a lot of questions around the gross margin guide. To the
extent that the revenue guide is being driven by PC weakness, do we just conclude that PCs are a much
lower-margin business for you? And if PC start to come back, does that become a margin headwind?

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

I mean, PCs are not a low-margin business for us. In fact, the PC segment is very solidly profitable and
compares very well with -- in other segments that we serve. And so I would say that I would not think of
PCs as being either a headwind or anything else like that. But I feel like I should just reemphasize what I
mentioned earlier, which is it's certainly the PC segment that is part of the issue that we have. The other
issue is, I just want to reiterate our below target inventory level and the aggregate memory and storage
-- on that memory and storage side, as well as our own constraints that we are seeing on the supply
of certain ICEs as well as the constraints that our customers are seeing across multiple end markets in
terms of getting all of the semiconductors that they need to get matched sets of semiconductors for their
products. So it's -- I wish I could say that it is only one thing, but all of these constraints are causing us to
feel like we'll have a stretched out cycle.

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

Our last question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

You hinted at mix into '22 throughout this call, but I was hoping you could isolate your commentary just
on mix for calendar '22. And what should we be thinking about pluses and minus wise for you guys? Can
you hit on DDR5, data center SSD? Anything else that we should be considering as it relates to gross
margins and revenues in calendar '22? .

Sumit Sadana
Executive VP & Chief Business Officer

Yes, I can address some of that. So on the product side, of course, we will continue to ramp our newest
products with 176 layer NAND and 1-alpha DRAM. So both of those technologies have good cost
structures. So we are very eagerly looking forward to continued ramp of those products.

And between the different product categories and segments, we do expect that the component mix of
our NAND business is going to decline. The components typically have the lowest prices and we feel that
the high-value solutions that we have in NAND will post a pretty robust improvement in fiscal '22. So we
should end up with more SSDs in the mix and also more data center SSDs in the mix in fiscal '22. So we
are certainly looking forward to that.

And then, of course, we expect to have more DDR5 shipments in the mix, which is a new set of products
that the industry is just on the cusp of adopting. Of course, the DDR5 volumes as a percent of our total
is still going to be pretty small. It will take a few quarters for it to ramp to some appreciable levels. But
fiscal '23 will be a very strong year for DDR5 shipments, and we obviously, expect DDR5 ASPs to be higher
because those modules are more expensive and more complex than DDR4 modules. So those are going to
be additional opportunities for us to continue to drive our mix.

And longer term, we will have improvements in mix coming from high-bandwidth memory and CXL. So
if I look out for the next 2, 3, 4 years. Those kind of products will start to become more impactful. And
so we have what we believe is a multiyear journey in which our portfolio mix should continue to improve,
continue to become better and continue to enable us to create more differentiation and higher gross
margin opportunities for us as a company.

And part of the R&D investment that Dave spoke about, that 15% growth, is meant to drive some of those
investments that enable that differentiation for us to be able to drive higher gross margins in the future.
