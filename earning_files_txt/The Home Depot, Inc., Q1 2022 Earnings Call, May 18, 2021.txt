THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Greetings and welcome to The Home Depot's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As
a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.

Isabel Janci
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's First Quarter 2021 Earnings
Call. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman and CEO; Ted Decker, President and Chief
Operating Officer; and Richard McPhail, Chief Executive President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our
prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors.
[Operator Instructions] If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor
Relations department at (770) 384-2387.

Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations
made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is
provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Craig.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning.
Fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start as we grew the business by over $9 billion compared to the first quarter
of last year. Sales for the first quarter were $37.5 billion, up 32.7% from last year. Comp sales were up
31% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 29.9%. Diluted earnings per share were
$3.86 in the first quarter, up from $2.08 in the first quarter last year.

Our results this quarter were once again driven by broad-based strength across the business and
geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the
company average, and Mexico posted double-digit comps. Both ticket and transactions were up double
digits in the quarter. And as Ted will detail, we saw strong double-digit growth from both our Pro and DIY
customers.

We continue to effectively manage the outsized demand for home improvement products seen throughout
most of last year despite disruptions in global supply chains that were further exasperated by port
congestion during the quarter. We leveraged the scale of our supply chain and partnered with our vendors
to maintain our in-stock positions and prioritized key SKUs in high-demand categories.

While we continue to see strong level of engagement across our digital platforms, we saw more of our
customers return to our stores. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 27% versus
the first quarter last year, and approximately 55% of online orders were fulfilled through a store.

We continue to roll out new capabilities, such as mixed-cart selling from store, that remove friction for
both our customers and associates. The mixed cart feature enables associates to more efficiently and
effectively serve the total project needs for a customer as products from both the website and store can
be added to a single transaction.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

We also continue to drive interconnected enhancements in other areas of the business to solve customer
pain points. In tool rental, for example, we will soon expand our rent online pilot chain-wide, enabling rent
online, pick up in store capabilities for all 1,300-plus tool rental locations in the U.S. and Canada. This will
enhance the experience for our busy Pro and DIY customers and complement additional investments we
are making to expand our rental footprint and increase our assortment and delivery capabilities.

We are focused on continuing to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance
the interconnected shopping experience. Our efforts will continue to support what we believe is our
winning formula: deliver the best shopping experience in home improvement, extend our position as a
low-cost provider with a relentless focus on productivity and be the most efficient investor of capital in
home improvement. We believe this strategy will help us deliver returns by driving growth faster than the
market in any environment.

The build-out of our One Home Depot supply chain vision is a wonderful example of our strategy in action.
Enhanced fulfillment capabilities will not only create a better customer experience, but they will also
expand the breadth of our current opportunity set from both a product and customer standpoint. The
ability to combine this growth potential with scale to create the low-cost network in home improvement
is a formula that we believe delivers long-term value creation for our customers, supplier partners and
shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to build out our One Supply Chain vision by opening
several new facilities, and we are very excited with the progress we continue to make on this key strategic
priority.

We have now been operating in this unprecedented demand environment for over a year and continue
to align around a few key learnings: first, the investments we have made in the business over the past
decade were the right ones; and second, they have enabled agility and flexibility to execute on critical
business decisions in a challenging and dynamic operating environment. As a result, we have managed
unprecedented levels of web traffic, record levels of product flow through our supply chain, all while
improving customer service levels in our stores. These factors, coupled with our world-class associates and
strong partnership with suppliers, have enabled us to meet outsized demand week after week.

Our cultures remain our North Star as their decisions are anchored to some of our most important values:
do the right thing and take care of our people. Our ability to continue investing for the future while also
managing the most fluid environment in our company's history is a direct result of our associates and their
extraordinary efforts. I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values
by serving our customers, communities and each other during these challenging times. With that, let me
turn the call over to Ted.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and
supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities.

We continued to experience unprecedented levels of demand during the first quarter, with comps
accelerating to more than 30% when compared to the first quarter of last year. This elevated demand
and transportation headwinds are pressuring parts of the supply chain, but our teams continue to work
together with our supplier partners to manage through these pressures.

Moving to our comp performance during the first quarter. 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted
comps at or above 20%, led by our lumber and kitchen and bath departments. Our comp average ticket
increased 10.3%, and comp transactions increased 19.1%. Similar to what we reported in our previous
3 quarters, the growth in our comp average ticket was driven by elevated project demand, customers
trading up to new and innovative products and continued inflation in many product categories, including
lumber. This was another record-setting quarter for lumber prices. Let me give you an example of what
that means for one of our core lumber SKUs.

At the end of the first quarter last year, a sheet of 7/16 OSB was approximately $9.55 As we exited the
first quarter this year, that same sheet of OSB more than quadrupled in price to $39.76. Inflation from

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 375 basis
points during the first quarter.

Our interconnected retail strategy is resonating with our customers as evidenced by strong growth from
both in-store and online transactions, and we are pleased with our ability to meet widespread demand
across our selling platforms. As you heard from Craig, sales from our digital channels grew by 27% during
the first quarter, which equates to more than 100% growth on a 2-year stack basis.

Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 50% compared to the
first quarter of last year. We saw widespread big-ticket strength across our business, with notable
outperformance in lumber, vinyl plank flooring in many of our installation services.

From a customer standpoint, we saw double-digit growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. Growth
with both customer groups accelerated during the first quarter, with Pro sales growth slightly outpacing
DIY. Sales to our Pro customers continue to strengthen, posting the fourth consecutive quarter of
accelerating growth and the best quarterly growth rate on record. Pros continue to tell us that project
demand is strong, and their backlogs are growing.

Shifting over to our DIY customers. The strong demand we saw during the back half of last year continued
during the first quarter. From gardening to garage and organization, new and existing customers are
engaging with home improvement. And during the quarter, we were also well positioned for the start of
the spring selling season. We took decisive action earlier than usual to proactively lean into our inventory
position. This paid off as spring began breaking across the country, and our associates were well equipped
to service customers across key outdoor and garden categories. And the strength in gardening was more
than just plants and shrubs. We posted a record quarter in categories like planters and hardscapes.

Additionally, while outdoor categories exhibited significant growth during the first quarter, we've continued
to see strong momentum with interior projects around the house. Interior projects like countertops,
vanities, blinds and home decor all showed significant growth in the first quarter.

As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are focused on continuing the momentum we are seeing
with our customers. We're particularly encouraged with the strong demand we're seeing from our Pro
customers. And for our Pros, we know that brands matter. Brands like Milwaukee, Klein and Carlon have
significant market share in their respective categories and are trusted by our Pro customers to get the job
done.

Milwaukee recently expanded their powerful M18 battery platform to include a full line of cordless nailers
that deliver pneumatic performance with no compressors, no gas cartridges and rapid fire rates to keep
Pros productive. The M18 platform now features over 200 tools that are exclusive to The Home Depot and
the big-box home improvement channel.

And at a time when Pros are busier than ever, we are thrilled that we are the destination for Carlon's PVC
electrical boxes and Klein Tools. These brands are 2 of the most widely used by electricians. We've enjoyed
a long exclusive partnership with Klein, being first to market with their new and innovative products, and
we are now the exclusive national partner of Carlon in the big-box home improvement channel.

And while we don't know how the demand environment will ultimately unfold, as we look forward to
the rest of the busy spring season, we feel great about our position, and we look forward to serving our
customers, both in-store and online. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $37.5 billion, an
increase of $9.2 billion or 32.7% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were
positive 31%, with positive comps of 19.8% in February, 36.2% in March and 34.3% in April. Comps in
the U.S. were positive 29.9% for the quarter, with positive comps of 19.9% in February, 35.6% in March
and 32% in April. During the first quarter, all 19 of our U.S. regions as well as Canada and Mexico posted
strong double-digit comps.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34%, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points from last
year. Mix pressure from higher lumber sales alone negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately
35 basis points.

During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 390 basis points
to 18.6%. We were pleased with our operating leverage during the first quarter as it reflects disciplined
expense control, along with a couple of other expense items that I'd like to highlight.

First, our operating leverage in the first quarter of this year reflects the impact of several onetime
expenses that we incurred in the first quarter of 2020, including additional compensation and benefits to
support our associates. These expenses were partially offset by underspend in other expense items in the
first quarter of last year, notably payroll, as we worked to staff up labor to meet the surge in demand.
Together, the net impact of these factors resulted in approximately 240 basis points of operating expense
leverage during the first quarter of 2021.

Second, during the first quarter of 2021, we incurred approximately $80 million of COVID-related
expenses, which created approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage. And lastly, our
operating expense leverage during the first quarter also includes pressure from higher accrued bonus
expense primarily related to our outperformance for our store Success Sharing program in store and field-
based management bonuses for the first half of fiscal 2021.

Our operating margin for the first quarter was 15.4% compared to 11.6% in the first quarter of 2020.
Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased by $26 million to $333 million, due primarily to
higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago.

In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, down from 24.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.86, an increase of 85.6% compared to the first
quarter of 2020.

During the quarter, we opened 1 new store in the U.S. and 1 in Mexico, bringing our total store count to
2,298. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 239 million square feet.

At the end of the quarter, inventories were $19.2 billion, up $4.2 billion from last year. And inventory turns
were 5.5x, up from 5x last year.

Turning to capital allocation. Our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have
not changed. First and foremost, we will invest in our business. During the first quarter, we invested
approximately $525 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And second, it is
our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend
and repurchasing shares. During the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.8 billion in dividends to our
shareholders, and we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Our share repurchases during the first quarter partially reflect an elevated cash balance in 2020 when
we paused share repurchases to temporarily increase our liquidity levels as we navigated the pandemic.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months,
return on invested capital was approximately 45.1%, up from 40.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

Moving to the broader demand environment for home improvement. The strong demand that we've seen
for more than a year now has continued. During the first 2 weeks of May, on a 2-year stacked basis,
we've seen comps in the U.S. above 30%. Housing remains strong. Homeowners' balance sheets are
healthy, and our customers continue to tell us that they are planning on spending on a variety of home
improvement projects.

With that said, we cannot predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will ultimately
impact the consumer. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our
successful performance. Our relentless focus on the customer and our ability to remain flexible and agile
has enabled us to serve our customers and to meet demand in this dynamic environment.

Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers,
our associates and our shareholders. We intend to provide the best customer experience in home

improvement. We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider. And we intend to be the most
efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will grow faster
than our market, and we will deliver exceptional shareholder value.
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

My first question is, is there anything that changes your view on housing, more or less constructive
compared to the underlying assumptions that you built through '21 plan against?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

No. Simeon, I'd say, yes, the housing environment continues to remain very strong. So it's only
strengthened, I think, from last year. And the current shortage of new housing clearly is helping to drive
improvements in the home values, which is a good thing for spending in the home.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then my follow-up is actually more on operating profit and margin. And I think your message is
very clear, that you're focused on growing faster than the market. And I think Richard told us last quarter,
you're managing operating profit dollars and margins fall where they fall. Can I ask about the 2 -- I think
about incremental drivers going forward. It's about interconnected retail and then somewhat in MRO and
Pro because some of the investments and acquisitions you've made. Is there anything about the margin
structure of those businesses and incremental growth that would hold back margins?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

No. I mean when we look at the business overall, we -- interconnected, we manage as a portfolio
approach. And 55% of the orders are flowing through our stores.

And then as it relates to the structure in Pro, we've shared in the past -- and you look at Pro in total, Pro
is a very similar margin profile to the DIY customer when you're looking at a complete project. And so
that's -- really nothing there that's dramatically different.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And I appreciate the fact that you didn't really update your outlook in your press release or talk to it too
much. But I guess, let me ask this. Are you -- it seems, and correct me if I'm wrong, you're probably
ahead of where you thought you would be at this point. So is there any update to that idea of -- that
trends continue -- will be, I think it was, what, flat to up slightly in margins, at or above 14%. Can you
update that comment that you gave in the first quarter?

And I guess related to that, is the right way to think about comps for the quarter and, I guess, the year
somewhere in that 30% 2-year stacked rate? Would that be a fair sort of assumption to model for the rest
of the year?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

Michael, let me share with you -- I mean, clearly, the first quarter performance was stronger than what we
anticipated. We did not think that we would deliver a [ 31% comp ] in the quarter. And as it relates to the
framework that we provided, Richard, you might want to speak to the framework.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. And just to remind everyone, we actually -- at the end of the fourth quarter last year, we felt unable
to provide an outlook due to level of uncertainty in the environment. So we did not provide an outlook.
We did feel that, given the significance of nonrecurring expenses in 2020, we could provide our view on
our margin profile at a hypothetical level of sales. So looking forward, we continue to believe that the
environment and the consumer response to it is difficult to predict.

With respect to Q1, we're very pleased with the operating expense leverage and earnings flow-through
that we drove. And we're going to keep operating the business with discipline and keep a focus on driving
operating expense leverage.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

If you look at your months of May and April, your 2-year stacks were running around or even better than
40%. And now you mentioned May, so far, is up above 30%. So do you think that we're starting to see the
stimulus impact to your comps dissipate and such that -- and I know this was asked a couple of different
ways, but 30% run rate in a 2-year stack is a good way to move forward? Or is it better for us to expect
that, that 30% 2-year stack run rate on an arithmetic basis should slow from here?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Michael, we just -- we can't extrapolate results to future periods. It's just too difficult to predict how
the environment might evolve and how the consumers' response to that might evolve.

When you look at the progression from March and April and you just -- you think about stimulus impact,
it's very difficult to quantify the impact from stimulus. What we do know is that of the $402 billion that the
government announced would be paid directly to individuals as part of the American Rescue Plan, of that
$402 billion, $325 billion of it hit bank accounts in March. And so while we can't quantify the exact impact,
it probably did have some sort of impact on that March to April progression.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

And Michael, I'd say while we really can't extrapolate to future periods, the one thing that we're very
encouraged about is, when you look at the overall kind of backdrop for home improvement on a longer-
term basis, we feel very good about that.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Anything you want to point to specifically, Craig, from a longer-term basis that you...

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Well, again, when you -- Mike, when you think about, we're at post-World War II housing availability, so 2
months of supply versus historical average of 6, that situation won't be resolved in near term. It's going to
take time for that to be resolved. So I think that supports home values and the continued growth in home

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

values, which we know, as home values grow, people feel good about investing in their home overall. So
that alone is, I think, a very positive outlook for home improvement as you move forward.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. My follow-up question is, how do you think your market share unfolded in the first quarter from an
online perspective, recognizing that you had a very difficult comparison? Do you think you kept pace with
the overall market? And is this the right run rate for the online growth to think about moving forward?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

I mean we -- again, we look at this as a total and run this as a portfolio because it's so interconnected.
And if you look at the data, it appears that we picked up about 170 points in share overall based on the
March data that was put out by the government.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

And just to kind of talk about e-commerce, e-commerce is a capability. It is not a business. And so I think
it's very important to always look at the top-level demand in the environment and what we've delivered.
So we don't break the business down like that.

We intend to be there for the customer however they like to shop. There's been a lot of dynamism in that
as we worked through the last 12 months, but we're satisfied that we've been there for them. And it's --
as Craig said, it's because of the investments we made in interconnected retail over the last few years.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

And Michael, as you think of last year in the first quarter, the interest in buy online, pick up in store and
we stood up curbside, again, our customers chose to shop that way in a contactless or as least contact as
possible in the early days of the pandemic. So that's returning to some more natural run rates.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

I'm curious if you guys are surprised that your basket trends have held in so strong even as your traffic
has improved so much.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

I mean we are seeing customer engagement in all segments of our business. And when you -- we
shared that through the progression of the last 4 quarters, our Pro business has been strengthening as
customers get more comfortable having folks in their home. Our services business has been strengthening
for 3 quarters consecutively in a row now. Those are all big-ticket drivers. And then as Ted called out,
innovation has been a driver of expansion in our ticket as well as inflation. And Ted, I don't know if you
have any other comments.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

And I think it also speaks to projects. Again, people are engaged in projects, and they're engaged in
projects across the whole store. So with projects comes basket and ticket, and we're certainly enjoying
that.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Got it. And then just a quick follow-up for me would be, you spoke about the big increase in lumber prices.
Curious what you're seeing on the demand side unit volume, if it's starting to compress a little bit as those
prices rise.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Well, the lumber environment is certainly unique. And the way we're thinking about it right now, Chuck,
it's really a storm environment. It's very tough to look at traditional elasticities. Certainly, prices are up. As
I referenced in the call, a sheet of OSB has quadrupled in price, and it's up even more since the end of our
fiscal quarter.

But at the same time, demand has kept pace. And when we bring the product into the store, it sells. And
the mills are at capacity. We have plenty of wood fiber in the supply chain. The relative bottleneck is in the
sawmill cutting capacity. We don't see a lot of capacity coming online. So we're probably not going to see
a lot of finished lumber product in distribution.

So as soon as that product hits our stores, it sells. Certainly, price is up. And you would think there'd be
supply and demand, traditional elasticity equation there, but it's hard to determine the impact given the
storm nature of the demand.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So we know that you've been working on your One Home Depot, One Supply Chain at least for a couple of
[ years ] now. Obviously, the overall industry is extremely strong. But I'm curious, are there any examples
you can share regarding how these new capabilities may be enabling you to either increase penetration
rates in existing markets or penetrate new markets where maybe you couldn't compete as well in the
past?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Well, I'd say a couple of things, and I'll turn it over to Mark. So first of all, the ability to meet the kind of
demand we've seen on direct fulfillment, I think, has been a direct result of the investments that we've
made in the business. And the customer satisfaction and efficiency that we're seeing through our new
flatbed distribution centers indicates to us that we're making real progress with the customer there. And
Mark, I don't know if you want to add to that.

Mark Q. Holifield
Executive Vice President of Supply Chain & Product Development

Sure, Craig. Yes, we had a great first quarter in our supply chain development, and we're on track based
on that. So continue to increase our fulfillment square footage over 70% this year.

Specific to the results we're getting in terms of the flatbed delivery centers, maybe I'll highlight that. That
was really designed to provide store relief, increase our customer satisfaction and service to customers,
expand our available assortment and delivery capabilities. And we now have 4 flatbed DCs open now in
various stages of ramping.

Dallas is the furthest along. It's ahead of our plans in terms of the flatbed sales comp, which are very
strong and not just in dollars, but also in units and in number of deliveries. Our customer satisfaction
has improved by 11 percentage points. We've improved our on-time and complete. And notably, our Pro

penetration is very strong. In fact, the preponderance of sales out of that facility are, in fact, Pro. So really
helping us to capture the Pro there in Dallas.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And I guess a follow-up would just be, I guess, my understanding, at least historically, has been the new
HD Supply capability -- supply chain capabilities should enable you to penetrate markets where you really
couldn't play before. You just didn't have that capability to be competitive. Are there any examples of
where you're making progress on that front?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean the focus of the capabilities that we're building on is to be able to expand our reach into the
[ Pro ] customer. We've been very strong over the years with the smaller Pro and the unplanned purchase
with a larger Pro. And what we're building is capabilities to actually extend into that planned purchase,
and we're seeing that beginning to play out. So we're very -- we're pleased with what we're seeing in the
early stages.

Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Right. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the market in general. I'm wondering if you could
frame how big you think the DIY market is versus the Pro market during, I guess, post pandemic versus
prepandemic? And then I had another slightly different angle on a different question.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean we really don't have data as it relates to what we think the growth in the market is. That's a
pretty tough number to come by at this point.

I mean, obviously, we play in a big market, straight out of the blocks. It's a $600-plus billion market in the
MRO space that we play in, which is largely focused on multifamily, is another $55 billion. So -- but I don't
have no way of knowing how much that's expanded as a result of the pandemic.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then, Richard, I just wanted to ask a question on the actual -- that 14% framework that you
had given. And I realize that was just an attempt to give a framework. But when you look at your sales
growth this quarter versus your EBIT growth, EBIT grew more than double sales growth. Whereas when I

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

look at prior quarters, even if I add back COVID costs, you kind of had like 10% spread. So I'm wondering
if that is the right relationship to think about going forward, especially because even in 1Q, as you noted,
you had the higher bonus accruals.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, what I'd say is the reason that we laid out the 14% was because we knew that we were coming to a
year where COVID expenses were rolling off and investment expenses were rolling off. And so it was going
to be and is the first year where we said, look, we are returning back to operating expense leverage that
you could see in the P&L.

We feel like we delivered that in Q1. We're very happy with the operating expense leverage and the
flow-through relative to sales. And like we said, we're going to keep operating with discipline, and we're
going to drive operating expense leverage just as we intended. Margin will be a function of sales volume,
obviously, but we're pleased with the relationship in Q1.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Karen, we naturally leverage with volume.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Sorry. Say that one more time.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

We naturally leverage with volume. There is natural leverage built into the business with volumes.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. I understand that. I mean it's all a function of sales. But it just -- it is definitely a much wider gap
on the 2 because it would imply full year numbers are way too low, depending on how that relationship
continues.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, just -- I think you -- one of the other reasons that we laid out a hypothetical was because it is harder
to read through only 1- or a 2-year comparison in operating expense because of the fact that we were
still in the middle of an investment program in 2019 and exiting it at the end of 2020. So again, the best
comment I can give is we were very happy with Q1 and how we drove operating expense leverage and
flow-through.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So my first question is, do you think stimulus helps the DIY side of the business more than the Pro? And
not sure if you looked at it this way, but on a 2-year basis, did Pro accelerate more than the DIY side of
the business?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

I'd say, Chris, on the stimulus situation, it's all consumer demand, whether it is the Pro buying for the
consumer because the consumer is doing something or the consumer buying for the Pro. So we kind of
look at it as total demand.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then I guess anything on a 2-year -- I guess, my thought on that is Pro, you got to get them in your
house. And there's a lot of backlog. So it would seem like there could be a near-term bump on DIY versus
Pro. So -- and you also had some Pro comparisons last year where the Pro was nonessential. So I was just
curious if you had teased out what it looked on, on a 2-year basis.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, the 2-year stack plainly is the consumer has outgrew the Pro modestly on a 2-year basis. But I don't
know that, that provides information that's more helpful than saying that the Pro has come back to the job
site. Demand seems to be potentially more easily fulfilled through the Pro than it was a year ago.

But like Craig said, I think you have to look at top line demand. Ultimately, this is all or almost all
consumer demand that is being fulfilled in different ways. So if anything, we're happy with the fact that
the Pro seems to be -- seems to have easier access to the job site and is getting to the job site easier.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. And then May was a funny month last month. You had sort of stimulus spillover into
the first half. You had Pro restrictions. I know you talked about on a 2-year basis north of 30%. But can
you maybe tease out how that month played out relative to the 27% total and -- or even talk about 1-year
comp trends quarter-to-date?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

I'm not sure I understand your question.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You talked about in May being north of 30% on a 2-year basis. Last year, you did 27% in May, but there
was a lot of noise. So boiling it down, can you talk about on a 1-year basis what the business looks like so
far in May?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

No. We're 2 weeks in. It's just too early. But as we said, demand remains strong.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Richard, could you talk about performance at the gross margin line versus your initial plan? And to what
extent was lumber an incremental headwind? And when you think about the other moving parts around
promo, underlying comp leverage, maybe mixing and HD Supply, is there anything in Q1 that changes
your thinking for the full year gross margin framework?

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

Well -- so versus last year -- again, just to recap, we were -- we saw a decrease of approximately 10 basis
points in gross margin, 35 of which were from the increased penetration of lumber in our sales. And so the
net of that obviously shows margins up.

There's no doubt there is cost pressure in the economy and in our environment, but hats off to our
merchants and our supply chain for managing through that. And Ted, maybe I'll turn it to you for a little
bit of color.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

No. The merchants and the supply chain team did a fantastic job. Over the years, we've built tools and
processes that give us terrific visibility and great partnership with our finance teams.

And as Craig has always said, we run the business as a portfolio. And we're a project business, and
we're always looking to provide the best value to our customers on a project basis. Having said that, we
certainly saw transportation pressure. Shrink on a relative basis was slightly improved, but we are still
seeing shrink pressure.

And then we're seeing some commodity, as in lumber, and noncommodity cost pressures, but the team
has worked through that. Believe it or not, there's still cost out in the portfolio. So we still work on cost
out and optimization of supply chain flows.

And given the strong demand, we were -- our promotional cadence was slightly higher than last year.
There were some early spring participation that we had completely canceled last year. And so we were up
in some activity on promotions. The overall level of promotions and any required clearance activity was
down meaningfully. So that is what gave the balance of the offset of the cost and mix pressures.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful color, Ted. Another one for you and also Craig. As you think about all the drivers of
home improvement spending today, could you comment on how much of the industry you would quantify
as repair and maintenance spending? How much is being driven by housing turnover? And then what
would you call discretionary?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Honestly, we have not taken the time to try to break that out in this demand environment. So I really
couldn't give you a breakdown on that.

We know that repair and remodel is the essence of what our business is all about. And then, of course,
we're there to help customers fulfill their dreams in terms of updating their homes. And clearly, over the
last year, as customers have spent more time in their homes, they've told us that their home is never
more important than it is today. And many of those customers, like myself, we got to see a whole lot of
things that needed to be done around the home, and they've been going after that.

When times got difficult in 2007 and 2008, repair became more important than remodel. But we're
certainly not in that kind of environment today. So I just don't have any way of knowing that expansion by
those breakdowns at this point.

Yes. We are very happy with our overall customer portfolio, both DIY, Pro and [indiscernible] capabilities.
While I won't give any specific numbers and breakouts, I can tell you that our customer files of both
Pro and consumer have grown. The health of [indiscernible] are really strong with a repurchase rate of
developed customers growing faster than the new customers. So the new customers gained last year,
we've been able to keep [ packing ] in our [indiscernible] at terrific rates.

And our Pro customers, [indiscernible] the activity we're seeing in engagement with our Pro customers
with our B2B website, delivery capabilities, our new loyalty program, all of those are also adding to
stickiness of the Pro customer.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And just on the services side, I mean, how big is that now as a percent of sales? I know it's
probably relatively small. But I mean, are there areas where you think you can expand into services
without competing with your Pro customers?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. That business is in the 4-ish, 5% range of [ sales ]. We are very pleased with the growth that we've
seen in that business. And we think we can do that without [ competing with our Pro customers ].

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim.

Steven Paul Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe just start with a quick follow-up on the broader supply chain initiatives. Ted, I think you mentioned
70% increase in distribution footage this year. So maybe if you can update us on how many facilities that
correlates to. And any color on the cadence or the planned cadence of openings?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Mark, do you want to take that?

Mark Q. Holifield
Executive Vice President of Supply Chain & Product Development

Sure. We're on our way to 35 FDCs, flatbed delivery centers. We have 4 open today. We're opening several
more through the end of the year. We've got a very solid pipeline there.

Our MDOs, we ended 2020 with 39. We opened 8 in Q1. And we're opening more there, on our way to
roughly 100. And then MDCs were -- we've got 2 of those open. We opened Houston during Q1. We have
a healthy pipeline there, opening several more through the year as well and on our way to 20-ish-or-so
MDCs.

Steven Paul Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Richard. I think -- I don't believe you called out the incremental
strategic investment spend impact when you walked through the expense line items. So maybe, if you
can, just remind us on where we are, right, in terms of the trajectory of that strategic investment spend
that's captive within the model.

Well, at the end of Q4 last year, we announced that our strategic investment program that stretched from
2018 to 2020 was materially complete. And so going forward, our stance is that we will look to invest
approximately 2% of sales every year in the form of CapEx. There'll be associated expense with that, but I
would just consider that part of our expense structure going forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman.

Dennis Patrick McGill
Zelman & Associates LLC

Ted, on the lumber side, when we think about -- I guess, that's the biggest driver of the commodity
inflation. Is it fair to assume that, that impact accelerated through the quarter and was largest in April and
then, as we think about the impact so far in May, would be similarly above what you experienced in the
first quarter?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Yes. It -- literally, week-on-week, it's gone up. And as we sit last week, framing and panel are effectively
quadrupled in the market index pricing. And again, each of those went up last week.

Dennis Patrick McGill
Zelman & Associates LLC

Okay. Perfect. And then anything else to learn from the category performance? As you look at passing the
April comp of last year and looking at that on a 2-year basis, any categories actually accelerating on a 2-
year basis versus decelerating? And I guess just on the quarter itself, the one category that wasn't 20%,
just curious on what that was.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

So the category that was not 20% was paint. We were very pleased with the performance in paint. But
last year, I think everyone stayed home and painted. So we had incredibly tough compares. So we didn't
quite hit the 20% mark.

Overall, on what's accelerating, I would say continued outdoor living has been very strong. So if all of you
are interested in things like grills and patio sets, those are going to be in shorter supply as we get into
the spring because the demand is incredibly strong. And in things like patio, we do a fixed buy as most
of that is import, and we had to make the decision on the buy level quite some time ago. So that's been
particularly strong.

Dennis Patrick McGill
Zelman & Associates LLC

Anything else on the other side besides paint that you'd call out as being a decelerating trend?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

No.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

Richard, if we think about that operating leverage and compare it to 2019, you're up 180 basis points.
Is that -- as we think about it going forward, is it fair to say that now are where we want to be going
forward? In other words, in the second quarter, you normally are a few billion more sales. And usually,
your operating margin is a little higher than the first quarter, if you look over the last 5 years. Is there any
reason why we shouldn't assume that sort of flow-through now?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, with respect to sales, we're not going to extrapolate what we've seen into the future. Obviously,
there's a degree of uncertainty on how the consumer is going to respond this year.

I'll just say it again, Greg, when you compare the first quarter of this year to the first quarter of last year
and you adjust for nonrecurring expenses, we feel very pleased with the operating expense leverage that
we drove and the flow-through that we drove at this level of volume.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And then if I could follow up on inflation and mix. If the commodity part of it, that just -- it
wasn't just lumber, right? The 375 bps was lumber and maybe copper and other commodities? Or was it
specifically lumber? And then as part of that, if you -- that was just lumber?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Lumber and copper primarily, yes.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And so then if we look at that average basket up 10%, is it fair to say that overall inflation or
average AUR was 500, 600 bps of that basket increase?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

No.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

It was also driven by project nature of the business, the innovation that the merchants have brought to
the market.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

You've got mix. You've got a percentage of basket. I mean it's -- yes.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Went all [ through that by ] lumber.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So inflation isn't widespread across the store. Across the store, it's more mix?

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 18, 2021

If you think about it from a ticket standpoint, the ticket is being driven by a multitude of things. Yes,
there is inflation, and we've been able to pass-through. But again, it's also driven by the fact that our Pro
business strength drives a higher average ticket. Our services business drives a higher average ticket.
And so there's a number of factors that drove the ticket strength overall in the business, innovation within
categories.

So as you continue to expand and grow in cordless capability and outdoor power equipment, for
example, the average price in a lawnmower that is a cordless versus gas is significantly higher. All of that
contributes to driving the -- that growth in ticket.

Operator

Our final question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.

Scott Andrew Mushkin
R5 Capital LLC

So I was just wondering if you could talk about labor inflation and just the overall inflation as you guys
think about the back half of the year. So that's number one question.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, as you know, we converted part of our COVID expense into permanent labor cost in the
November time frame of 2020. And so obviously, all of that is in the performance that we just delivered.

As it relates to labor in total, we're -- this is spring. We're hiring up. We've been able to hire more
folks this year than last year, even though we were ramping last year to cover the demand. And so
that's something that we work on a week-to-week basis. To be flexible and agile right now is incredibly
important.

And the 2 areas that we're focused on, not knowing exactly how all this will play out, is inventory flow and
labor. Those are the 2 things that we're focused on. Both are relatively short-cycle planning. And so that's
really what we're trying to make sure we can cover the demand that's out there.

Scott Andrew Mushkin
R5 Capital LLC

And are you guys having any trouble getting labor and having to raise rates -- labor rates a lot in certain
markets? Or is that really not an issue for you guys at this stage?

Craig A. Menear

No. I mean there's always variances by market, and some markets are more challenging than others in
any given year. But as I said, we've actually hired more folks this year than we did last year.
