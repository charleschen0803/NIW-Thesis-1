Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Public Storage Fourth Quarter and
Full Year 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you
may begin.

Ryan C. Burke
Vice President of Investor Services

Thank you, Maria. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call.
I'm here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle.

Before we begin, we want to remind you that all statements, other than statements of historical
fact, included on this call are forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the statements.
These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results that are described in
yesterday's earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC.

All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, February 26, 2020. We assume no obligation
to update or revise any of these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our
earnings release. You can find that press release, our SEC reports and an audio replay of this call on our
website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially limit yourself to 2 questions. Of course, if you
have additional questions after those, please feel free to jump back in queue.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us. We had a good quarter, where we reported our 7th
consecutive quarter with same-store revenue growth between 1% and 2%. As we previously disclosed in
an 8-K filed on February 14, we submitted a nonbinding proposal to acquire 100% of the stapled securities
of Australia-based National Storage REIT and its controlled entities for AUD 2.40 per share. Please refer to
the 8-K, and we won't provide any updates on this call.
Now I'd like the call to be open for questions.

PUBLIC STORAGE FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 26, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shirley Wu of Bank of America.

Shirley Wu
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So my first question is on the marketing spend. So it's up roughly 50% in '19. So I was curious as to what
your thoughts are on the effectiveness of any incremental spend and how you think that's going to trend
in 2020?

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Sure. Shirley, it's Tom. I'll speak a little bit about our advertising spend in the quarter and then outlook as
we head into 2020.

So we've been communicating a pretty consistent strategy on advertising throughout 2019. We've liked
what we've seen with the increase in spend through 2019. And so as we've spent more money, we
liked the demand response we received from customers. Advertising was up 40% in the fourth quarter.
That rate of growth did moderate from the third quarter. And as we've discussed on our last call, we
proactively pulled harder on the advertising lever in the third quarter during the busy season to attract
more customers during that time period.

Stepping back, we continue to have real advantages online. Our brand name, which is synonymous with
our product and a top-search term, drives a meaningful portion of our move-ins, either direct to site or
through unpaid channels. Roughly 2/3 of our move-ins come through unpaid channels. Those are our
largest channels. In addition to that, about 1/2 of our paid move-ins come through brand search and
brand advertising, which comes at a lower cost. So those give us some advantages with which we are
utilizing today online.

We talk a lot about Google. Google is a primary portion of our advertising spend, and we really like that
tool, given it's dynamically managed and very local and granular, so we can set our bidding strategy
similar to how we set our pricing on a very local level. But in addition to that, we do utilize social media
and affiliates as well. So we spend a lot of time talking about Google, but it's a broader marketing plan.

As we head into 2020, I would anticipate that if we continue to like the incremental traffic that we're
seeing from the advertising spend, then we'll continue to spend. And so far, in 2020, we continue to like
what we're seeing. So I would anticipate that we continue to pull on that lever, along with rental rate
changes and discounting, to drive traffic to our stores in what is a -- what remains a challenging operating
environment.

Shirley Wu
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. So -- and then on the flip side, can you talk a little bit in terms of what you're seeing
for your move-in rates in 4Q and so far into 1Q as well as street rates?

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Sure. So as you know, Shirley, we don't really like to talk about street rates. We think that move-in rates
are really more valuable. So move-in rate was 2.4% in the quarter, which is a little bit better than what
we saw in the second and third quarters, but we did have lower move-in volumes. The move-in volumes
were down 3.5% in the quarter compared to roughly flat in the second and third quarter. So while move-
in volumes were down 3.5%, we continue to be benefited by lengthening stays of existing tenants and
continued very good performance by existing tenants. And so move-out volumes were down 1.5% as well.

So continued good -- good trends there amongst initial or existing tenants, but the initial acquisition of
customers remains challenging in this operating environment.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets.

Robert Jeremy Metz
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Joe, I want to go back to NSR. I understand you can't comment on the process here, and that's not where
the question is related. I guess, as I think about what you have going on in the U.S., you have a lot going
on with the developments and expansions. You've been increasingly active on acquisitions. You have
the broader CapEx program you initiated a while back, and that's still ongoing. You've got some tech
initiatives. We all know about supply in the market, the pressure on revenues and expenses. I guess, you
take all that together, why would now be the time to look to make a move outside the U.S. in a big way?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Well, Jeremy, I appreciate, and you did a good job characterizing the variety of things that we're looking
to do from a capital allocation standpoint. So as an entity, we have and always will be inquisitive along a
number of different fronts, whether it's within our borders here or where opportunities may lie outside of
our borders. You can see that from, obviously, the investment that we made into the Shurgard platform
a number of years ago. We have talked over the years about, again, the outlook and the desire on our
part to continue to vet and understand markets outside of our borders. And with that, we're going to
continue to look for those opportunities as they arise. Looking at the things you talked specifically about,
yes, we have had over the last year, in particular -- particularly strong uptick in the amount of volume that
we've done, particularly tied to acquisitions. We're seeing a healthy amount of attractive opportunities that
continue to lead to the kind of volume that we did in 2019 where we bought approximately $430 million of
acquisitions, 44 separate properties. And again, that's higher than the volume that we've done in the prior
4 years. So we continue to vet and leverage our relationships, leverage the amount of opportunities that
we're seeing out in the market, and we're seeing good trends.

We also have a decent backlog of acquisition activity going into 2020. So we continue to be equally
focused on everything that happens right here within the United States. And then from time to time, if
things happen outside of our borders, we're going to take a strong look at that too.

You mentioned the development and redevelopment activity. That too, again, for 2019 was a vibrant
part of our business. We brought 40 properties online, whether from ground-up or redevelopment, again
about $375 million of investment. And again, if you combine that activity with the acquisition activity, we
brought in about 85 additional assets into the portfolio. We think they're great additions to the platform,
and we will continue, again, from the development -- redevelopment standpoint to fund that business as
we're finding attractive opportunities. We're seeing good land sites that are coming to us. I would tell you,
frankly, we're seeing more of those right now than we have in the last 2 or 3 years, because there is a
little bit of rewinding relative to some of the spec development that has been going on in certain markets.
So we're seeing a number of additional land sites that are attractive. So we're going to continue to look at
that.

So overall, I mean, we've got a number of very positive things happening. The management team is well
prepared to embrace the kind of volume and, again, from a capital allocation standpoint, the way that
we can drive good returns to our shareholders. And we've no confusion. Our balance sheet has been and
continues to be ready to fund a whole range of different capital allocation initiatives. So we continue to be
encouraged by what we're seeing out there. And like I said, looking at the beginning of this year, we've
got some good momentum at hand.

PUBLIC STORAGE FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 26, 2020

And the second question for me. In your 10-K, you do allude to the Prop 13 initiative on the ballot,
granted timing of any reassessment or it getting actually to happen if it passes is uncertain. But if there --
is there anything you can share with us on the potential impact if it did pass? Or any color on your assets
there? And what that kind of mark-to-market could look like on the tax side?

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Sure, Jeremy. So we do benefit from a very strong portfolio of about 440 properties here in the State of
California. And many of those assets are in great locations and were acquired or built by the company
years ago, which gives us a great competitive position in many of our markets. So we like -- we really
like the portfolio. In the 10-K, you highlighted, we did include some disclosure. I think that's the best
information we can give you to allow you to be able to underwrite what you think the impact would be. So
we provide to you, in that risk factor, what our 2019 State of California net operating income is and also
our property taxes for the State of California. So depending on what time period or valuation strategy you
think will be employed, you can model what you think the impact will be.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi.

Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I just wanted to ask you a little more on the acquisition side. You had pretty high volume in '19, and it
looks like '20 is starting out ahead of where you were at this time last year. And I mean would you expect
that you could see the same kind of volume -- acquisition volume activity this year that you were able to
put up last year?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Yes, Smedes. It's always tough to predict. I'll just try to answer the question around, again, the number
of things that are driving the opportunity set that we've been able to capture. So we are seeing a higher
level of sellers coming into the market that have either acquired or built assets over, say, the last 3 to 5
years with certain sets of expectations, many of which have not met either pro forma or have not basically
put them in the position that they expect it to be in at this point. A number of the deals and, frankly,
the majority of the deals that we did in 2019 were off market. So some of this comes with enduring
relationships that we've got with these owners. And again, some of that's harder to predict to get to your
question, well, how much volume might we see in 2020. The thing that is pronounced and I think we
talked to quarter-by-quarter last year was the theme of more owners coming to us with more anxious
motivation to get out, right?

So with that, it's, again, a more vibrant arena. Our acquisitions team is very busy looking at a number of
opportunities, again, with the kinds of circumstances that I've described. And we also have a number of
owners who have also come to us and said, "Hey, it's been a great business. Timing is right." And they
too want to exit for a variety of different reasons. We continue to evaluate the quality and the pricing of
these assets. Our filter is as tight as it ever has been. And frankly, with that, we're off to a good start, as
you mentioned, in 2020. How much of that plays through for the balance of the year? To be determined.
But if you step back and look at the wave of development activity in particular that's taken place over the
last 4 or 5 years, there's a pretty strong collection of assets that have come into various markets, many
with ownership histories that have nothing to do with long-term commitment to the storage business.
And there are a lot of entities out there who are looking for exits. And we've been pleased by, again, the
amount of volume that we've seen come through, the quality of the assets, and in our view, again, the
appropriate time to acquire and see ultimately good returns from those investments.

PUBLIC STORAGE FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 26, 2020

Okay. And I just wanted to ask you, you've lined out development spending. Just when you look at the
quality of your portfolio now, you've talked in the past about bringing some of the older facilities, kind of
more -- have more curb appeal for lack of a better word. Do you still -- is that still a pretty big effort to
be done this year? Or did you -- how much of the portfolio, I guess, do you feel like needs to, I guess, be
improved from a looks perspective?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Yes, sure. So yes, you're speaking to what we call our Property of Tomorrow program. So that launched
in 2018. Last year, we put about $100 million into that platform, where we retooled approximately 250
assets or so in a variety of different markets. And if you look at 2020, the size of that program will
take another step up. So it's a multiyear program. We're embedding a number of our latest generation
assets into existing assets to get the not only curb appeal impact, but the relevancy to our brand; the
optimization of some of the physical characteristics of the asset where we're retooling, lighting, for
instance; in some cases, we're putting solar on assets; we're optimizing the customer environment;
and doing a number of different things to, again, enhance the overall quality. Because, frankly, we've
got many assets that continue to do phenomenally well. And we've just gotten to the point where we
think that ultimate lift to our most recent Generation 5 quality standard is very appropriate. Customers
are responding well to it. Our employees are responding well to it. We're prioritizing as we're ratcheting
through the full portfolio. And again, this program is likely to take 5 years or more to get through the
portfolio at large. But we are prioritizing around market concentrations, higher revenue markets, where
we're seeing even better impact from the investment. So all things considered, we're seeing good traction
from the investment in the program, and it will continue, like I mentioned, over the next few years.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Tom, I don't think in the 10-K, you explicitly provided kind of the fourth quarter average move-in rates
or the move-outs. I guess, we've sort of backed into the numbers for both of those and got about a 17%
decline. I was just wondering if you: a, had those or -- does that sound about right? And I know you don't
provide guidance, but do you feel like that number is kind of getting towards the bottom? Or do you feel
like that can continue to sort of widen out a bit? Because if that 17% is right, that was probably the widest
number we've seen on that statistic.

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

You did a good job with our numbers. The gap between move-in rents in the fourth quarter and move-out
rents on a per square foot basis was 17%. If you look back at prior year, it was 16%. And so while it did
get a little bit wider, that's a seasonally wider time period. And so that obviously sounds like a reasonably
large number, but we lower our rental rates seasonally through the fourth quarter and in the first quarter
as occupancy dips and we have vacancy to fill. So that's a strategy that we've employed year-in and year-
out for a number of years, and you saw that again this year. In terms of overall move-in rate trends, I
think it's really a story of markets and it's hard to talk about, at a high level, what it is we're going to see
for 2020. But if you look at the different market performance in the fourth quarter, you have markets that
have been impacted by new supply, where move-in rates we lowered proactively to drive volume. So a
market that I'd highlight is Houston, and we're seeing some encouraging trends in Houston as it relates
to year-over-year move-in performance as we went through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter,
but it's come at a lower rate. So fourth quarter move-in rates in Houston were down 16%. But for the first
time in a little while, in 2019, we started to see real volume in Houston. So move-in volume was up north
of 5% in Houston, and we're seeing better traction as we go through the first quarter.

We have markets like Houston or Atlanta, where the impact of new supply continues to be felt, and we
have little pricing power in those markets where we're utilizing rate and we're utilizing advertising to fill in

PUBLIC STORAGE FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 26, 2020

occupancy. The good news is, in Houston, we are getting good occupancy traction. Right now, we're sitting
at 300 basis points plus year-over-year occupancy, just looking at my dashboard this morning. So getting
some good occupancy traction, but it's coming at lower rate. And then, going to flip side, a market like
L.A., where we had positive move-in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So stepping back, we continue to
think there's going to be ebb and flows through markets as they're impacted by new supply in 2020. Just
as another snapshot, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported 1.1% same-store revenue growth. In the
fourth quarter of '18, we reported 1.2% same-store revenue growth. So pretty consistent revenue growth.
But if you look at the contribution from the different markets, it's a barbell, and you've got markets like
Chicago, Denver and Dallas that actually are the best year-over-year change in revenue growth. And the
flip side is you continue to have Houston be a laggard; Atlanta, as I highlighted; and Boston that was
impacted by new supply in 2019 that impacted us. So another quarter of reasonably consistent revenue
growth in the fourth quarter, but the market contributions continue to shift as we navigate through what is
a tough operating environment.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And I guess, maybe second question, just kind of big picture, maybe for you or Joe. Just in terms
of like the pressure from supply, I mean, it's interesting to see that revenue growth or decline in revenue
growth seems to be stabilizing a bit. And frankly, it was a little bit better in Q4 than we thought. Generally
speaking, I realize the markets will change and mix around. But do you feel like the overall competitive
pressure from new supply is beginning to kind of find a footing here? And maybe it doesn't get a lot worse
from here? And the question then is how quickly can it improve in '21 and beyond? Or do you still feel like
there are more supply coming and there's more competitive pressures as we move into '20? And how does
that sort of play into the, I guess, the Google spend on the advertising side?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Well, there's a lot of correlations between all those things, Steve. And you're right, we are seeing less
deceleration. We feel like we have a strong tool kit to continue to maneuver through higher supply
markets. As Tom mentioned, some of that is shifting the supply picture nationally. We'll have another
strong year of deliveries in 2020. It could be plus or minus, say, 10% down from what we saw in 2019.
Again, these are elevated levels of construction that we're now going into the fourth year of a range of
anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion in deliveries. And again, if you don't have the right playbook to
deal with supply as it impacts particular assets, say, right down to that 3- to 5-mile trade area, you could
definitely have some pretty strong headwinds to deal with. And frankly, that's where we continue to see
some, not all, but some of our acquisition opportunities as well.

The interesting thing and it ties to the resiliency of the product overall, the resiliency of our own brand,
et cetera, is we are seeing deliveries come down in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and
Chicago. And not ironically, those are some of the markets now that we're actually starting to see some
decent percolation, and we're encouraged by that. Now going into this next year, we've got our eyes
wide open on markets like Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami, D.C. and New York, because there's more
deliveries coming to those markets, some of which haven't had the kind of development activity in quite
some time. But reflecting on some of the comments Tom just walked you through relative to, again, the
ways that we're using our own brand, our marketing strategies, the ways that we're improving the quality
of the assets directly themselves, the way we're doing our own revenue management, pricing strategies, I
mean, we continue to have ways that we feel are strong components to work through these higher supply
conditions.

The outlet -- or the outlook beyond even this year is more murky. We are seeing fewer CofO deals get
delivered to the market. I think that's an encouraging sign. There may be some tapering down of the part
of the market that was driving, again, share development just based on spec developers out there just
flipping an asset and trying to get a quick return, because there were many buyers that were basically
just aggressively taking down empty facilities. That volume is down quite a bit. And part of the reason it's
down, again, it's -- you could look at it and say, this is probably a healthy thing as rents are down too.

PUBLIC STORAGE FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 26, 2020

So they're not making the pro formas that they intended to maybe when they acquired that piece of land
or had it tied up. So there are a number of things that are starting to work through that hopefully will
lead to a more balanced market-by-market set of conditions. But again, this year, in 2020, we've still got
the lingering impact of the supply that's been built over the last, say, 2 to 3 years. We'll have, again, a
number of deliveries this year. But we're highly encouraged by our own capabilities and the things that we
can do uniquely enough to keep, again, this band performance, at least what you've seen for the last 7
quarters, in pretty tough market conditions. If things actually start improving, then we'll hopefully see the
upside of that too. It's too soon to tell. But again, we'll continue to use all those tools that we've got.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital
Markets.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just a quick follow-up on Steve's question there about revenue growth. Maybe taking a step back and
thinking about it at a high level, Joe, you just commented again and, in your prepared remarks, you
mentioned that it's a seventh straight quarter of revenue growth between 1% and 2% for the company.
Do you see that continuing to hold?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Well, again, Todd, we're not going to give guidance. Again, the point that I just made and to Steve's
question was tied to the fact that, yes, we've got tools. We've got ways, again, to continue to deal with
higher supply conditions, and we'll have to see how that plays forth going forward. The deceleration that
we were dealing with has eased. Will it continue to ease? We'll see. But again, we feel very confident that
we've got the right set of strategies and capabilities to deal with the environment that we've had over the
last 2 or 3 years.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then -- so switching to investments and thinking about an expansion overseas. You're invested
in Europe and have a platform there. But in terms of thinking about investments outside of the U.S. or
halfway across the globe, can you just help us understand the synergies from investing outside of the U.S.
that may not be obvious for self-storage?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Yes, the only thing I'd really speak to, Todd, is what we've said consistently for a number of years, which
is we will continue to evaluate a variety of different markets. It's likely, but not always, but likely beneficial
to enter any market we're not in through some kind of a platform. So okay, look at Shurgard. That
was the platform, okay? So does that mean that's the one and only way to do it? Absolutely not. Is it a
way that can have certain advantages? Yes. So -- and then beyond that, as I mentioned in my opening
comments, we're really not going to talk more specifically about any particular transaction we're looking
at. But that, again, thematically, is and will continue to be the way that we'll evaluate any opportunity,
not that, again, it has to be tied to a specific platform, but there are many inherent benefits that will likely
come through if it's the right type of platform that aligns well with what we do right here in the United
States. Shurgard was a perfect example of that. So I can just point to that and say that's -- that was a
very successful playbook.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And to the extent you were to make a large acquisition, something in excess of the sources of
capital that the company has over, say, the next approximately 12 months, how should we think about --

PUBLIC STORAGE FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 26, 2020

obviously, you have a lot of capacity and access to capital, but how should we think about funding a larger
investment, if something were to materialize?

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. We're not going to comment on any specifics. But balance sheet is in very, very good shape. Last year
was a good capital raising year for us. We extended the line of credit. We issued $1 billion of preferreds.
We redeemed $1 billion in preferreds. We issued some debt in the U.S. We recently issued debt in Europe.
So we've got a lot of capital sources at our fingertips and capital is pretty attractively priced today. So
overall, we like our capital sources heading into the year regardless of what the capital will be allocated to.

Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Just going back to the Prop 13 discussion. Could you give us a sense of their average tax year basis in
California?

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Well, I think what we've disclosed, we feel, is adequate for you to be able to do some underwriting. If you
want to talk through that on a one-off basis, we can certainly do that. But I think we disclosed $42 million
of property taxes paid in 2019, and we disclosed our California NOI. And so that should give you an ability
to underwrite different assessed values and compare those assessed values and ultimate taxes to what we
paid last year.

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And going back to your acquisitions. I'm just trying to get a sense of if there's been any incremental
change in the thinking strategically for -- about your excellent growth. And basically trying to get a sense
of, are more assets and deals just fitting in the parameters that you have always set? Or are you also
expanding the parameters that you're looking for, our IRR thresholds?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Yes. I mean we're never -- we've never been an IRR buyer, Ki Bin. But no, I wouldn't say in any way
we've widened our underwriting and made some additional accommodation to what we've always done
historically. We have a pretty stringent and disciplined methodology that we use for acquisitions. Again,
we're -- frankly, we're just -- we're pleased by. We're seeing good quality assets and more of them that
meet our thresholds. And we've been pleased by the amount of volume that's come to us. And we're
going to, again, continue to stay focused on the range of opportunities that are out there, and the team is
working hard. And many of these situations don't evolve at a moment's notice. Some of them take many
years, in some cases, to evolve, so we've got a whole collection of different kind of opportunities around
us. And we're going to continue to vet and determine whether or not they're the right types of deals to
bring into the portfolio. We like the quality that we're seeing with the range of assets. It's a combination
of some more mature assets and some relatively new assets as well. So good quality, good location, very
additive to the platform. And again, like I mentioned in 2019, we pulled in 44 assets. And overall, it's kind

of a seamless transition. So ops team is ready to continue to absorb that volume and more and it's all
going very well.

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

And I remember years ago, you guys had a pretty big emphasis on buying things below replacement cost.
Is that still the case? And how do some of these deals compare to replacement cost?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Yes, we definitely -- we strip out a lot of different financial factors and compartmentalize them and that
being one, okay? So just again, to step back, I mean, we have the only development platform in the
public arena, and we by far have the biggest development platform in the United States. We understand
replacement costs quite well. We deal with it literally on a daily basis as it ties to our own development
and redevelopment activities. It's a great benchmark for us to continue to evaluate the price point that
we're looking at assets. And that is a key factor that we look at.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Lumb of Green Street Advisors.

Ryan Gregory Lumb
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Just wondering if you could expand on what drove labor costs higher during the quarter and if it was sort
of onetime in nature or if you anticipate this to be some sort of longer-term trend.

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Sure. So as you look at labor costs in the quarter, on-site property manager payroll was up about 6%. The
drivers of that was largely wages. And we've talked for now a number of years about the very tight labor
market that we find ourselves in today nationally. There's certainly some pockets that are even tighter
than the national numbers. And so what we've done over time is make sure we're being as efficient as
possible. And some of that comes down to some of the initiatives tied to Web Champ 2. And otherwise
that we were able to utilize efficiencies and reduce number of hours. But ultimately, we've continued over
that time period, and including last year, to increase wages to attract a competitive employee and provide
a competitive package for employees to give our customers a good customer service at the property level.
So wages is the short answer. I would anticipate that we continue to have wage pressure as we go through
2020. As always, we're looking at the ways to be more efficient and utilize the hours that we have best,
but would anticipate that wages will be a pressure in 2020.

Ryan Gregory Lumb
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Sure. And then, I guess, related to the comments that you made on the Property of Tomorrow initiative,
when you think about the expansions, is it a decision that is made based on a market-by-market basis?
Some markets are more apt or more suited for expansions? Or is it sort of an asset-by-asset basis? Some
assets are well suited for an expansion regardless of market. Or how is the decision made there?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Yes. So Ryan, yes, the Property of Tomorrow program isn't directly tied to expansion. That's really tied to
like-for-like asset condition. So separately, we do have all of our initiatives tied to redevelopment, which
would include expansions. So -- and that does go right down to a case-by-case basis. So what comes with
that is there are a whole host of roadblocks that you might have to go through, depending on zoning, any
kind of approvals and opportunities to actually expand an asset that at face value may look like a prime

candidate, but it may be a condition where, frankly, you just can't get the appropriate zoning and ability to
expand the site itself. So that's one hurdle you have to work through. There are economic hurdles that you
have to work through, because if we're going into an asset and disrupting current income, it can be quite
dilutive in some cases. So you have to measure and understand that as well and then counterbalance
it with the kind of returns and opportunities that you would get by putting, basically, whether it's some
additional size into an existing property through a single, larger building or a multitude of, again, new Gen
5 properties or in some cases actually tearing down the entire site. So there's a whole host of parameters
that go into that, but it goes right down to a case-by-case, property-to-property base.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Tom, I think you were talking about marketing spend levels expecting to continue to spend in 2020.
Should we be in the mindset of you've seen the spend levels ratchet up a notch on an absolute dollar basis
and you're thinking more about maintaining that absolute level? Or we could see it move up again and just
have notable growth on top of a year of pretty accelerated growth?

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So we did see accelerated growth in 2019. But if you go back through 2018, we actually continued to
ramp good spend in 2018 as well, and we've liked what we've seen. So there's no question that we spent
more in 2019 than we did in 2018. So your point around comps as we get into 2020 is a fair one. We don't
manage our advertising spend based on what we spent last year. We manage it based on what it is we're
getting for it and what the return is on it in the current period. And so if we like what we're seeing, we're
going to spend even more in 2020. We won't hesitate to do that if we like the returns. And the flip side is,
we're managing it dynamically. So there will be markets where we've toned down advertising spend and
ones where we likely increase as we get into 2020. The one thing I highlighted on the last call was just
stepping back and thinking about advertising spend as a percentage of revenue and the fact that it was 3-
plus percent historically in previous cycles and it got as low as about 1% of revenue in 2015, 2016 when,
frankly, we were full and didn't need to spend on marketing. We've been increasing it consistently over
the past several years and would anticipate that we increase it in 2020 as well. But if you look historically,
we're in a comfortable range for advertising spend.

Michael William Mueller
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then, Joe, looking on the -- looking at the 2020 acquisitions and kind of what, I guess,
what you have earmarked for under contract right now, I mean, what are the buckets that those would fall
into, if you split it between -- here's a bunch of what the market would consider to be stabilized properties
versus here something that's clearly in lease-up. Can you just kind of walk through what that split's been?

Joseph D. Russell
CEO, President & Trustee

Yes, Mike. It's a combination. There are assets that are newer, say, anywhere from 1 to 3 years old, and
then some that are more stabilized that have been in place for 10-plus years. So it's a combination and it's
motivated by many of the things I outlined earlier in my comments. Some owners come into the market
thinking they're going to get a quicker profit or be able to turn an asset and achieve whatever pro forma
hurdles they were looking at and kind of step back and said, "No, I don't want to continue, let's look at a
quicker exit". And then some have been more mature owners that for a variety of reasons, too, are saying
this is a good time to exit. So it's a combination.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Sorry, just one follow-up guys. On just the Google kind of ad spending and just some changes Google
might have made, I think there was a reference in your 10-K about maybe level the playing field. I'm just
curious, is there anything you can share with us about maybe just how Google ad searches are working
and just things that maybe are leveling the playing field there? Is there any real change in that dynamic
that we should be thinking about?

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. No, I think we included that to just describe, frankly, the evolution of paid search on Google and
the other search platforms over the last couple of years. I think they've got a great business and they,
obviously, seek to garner as many competitors in the keyword auctions as they can. And I think they're
doing a pretty good job of it. And we're just highlighting the fact that it's gotten more competitive, and
they're doing a good job of getting more people into those auctions.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. So it wasn't that there is something more recent that really changed, it's just more the general
trend?

H. Thomas Boyle
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, general trend there, and they've got a great business.
