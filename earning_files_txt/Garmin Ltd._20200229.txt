Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Garmin Ltd. First Quarter of 2020
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program may be recorded. I
would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Teri Seck, Manager of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Teri Seck
Manager of Investor Relations

Good morning. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd. First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please note
that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor Relations site on the
Internet at www.garmin.com/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcripts will also be available
on our website.

This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and
its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross margins,
operating margins, future dividends, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products
and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances
discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of risk
factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-K and
first quarter 2020 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, there is
significant uncertainty about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that results
could change at any time, and any statement about the impact of COVID-19 on the company's business
results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date.

Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer;
and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. First quarter of 2020 continued the strong momentum
we experienced in the back half of last year. Revenue increased 12%, resulting in a new record for the
first quarter. Gross margin was stable to last year, and operating margin expanded, resulting in operating
income growth of 17%. Late in the quarter, the landscape changed as the COVID-19 outbreak became
a global pandemic and governments responded with drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus.
This resulted in unprecedented economic changes affecting every company, and Garmin is no exception.
Accordingly, we are withdrawing our fiscal 2020 guidance. However, we are optimistic for the long-term as
the markets we serve and the products we offer are well positioned to succeed in a post pandemic world.
I'll explain why we are optimistic in just a moment. But first, I want to share a few insights on how Garmin
is approaching the most significant health and economic crisis of our time. First, I'll highlight our business
priorities. The global awareness of the coronavirus is recent, but its impact was felt much earlier when
parts of Asia were dramatically affected by its emergence and rapid spread. Since the beginning, employee
safety has been our top priority, starting in Asia and expanding as the virus spread to other regions of the
world. Most of our employees can work from home. And we've taken steps to protect those who continue
to work within our facilities. Our employees adapted to these new circumstances with speed and resilience,
and I'm super proud of their response to this challenge.

Our second priority has been to strengthen our supply chain. In the early days of the virus outbreak, our
supply chain teams were working hard to ensure we would not be affected by the widespread industrial
shutdowns that were occurring in Asia. I'm pleased to report that our supply chain is healthy, and we've

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

not missed any opportunities due to COVID-19-related disruptions. This is remarkable considering the
unprecedented disruption occurring in global supply chains.

Our third priority is to focus on opportunities. The crisis is often defined by its challenges, but we are
looking through the lens of opportunity. We've accelerated efforts to increase our mix of online sales with
business partners and on garmin.com. We have plenty of inventory, allowing us to capture market share.

And finally, we'll be using this opportunity to refine our product road map priorities to make sure we have
the right products now and after the crisis fades.

Next, I will talk about the leadership model we've embraced during this time of global crisis and
unprecedented disruption. First, we think to choose positively. In the contrast -- constant rumble of
negative unthinkable headlines, there are positive thinking, things happening all over Garmin. All of us
wonder what the new normal will be. No matter what happens, I feel good about the markets we serve
and the product lines we offer. We believe every business segment has a bright future.

Second, we are responding accordingly. We recognize the world is facing the most significant health and
economic crisis of our time. We understand it could take some time before the global economy recovers
from the effects of the virus and the actions taken to control its spread. With this in mind, we're taking
pragmatic steps to maintain our strong financial position.

And finally, we're focused on the long term. In this dynamic environment, aiming at what we see today
will only cause us to miss the target. Instead, we're aiming for where we want to be when the crisis fades.
Paraphrasing our company mission, we aspire to be an enduring company by creating superior products
that are an essential part of our customers' lives. Our vision is to be a globally respected leader in every
market we serve. We expect to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more capable company. This isn't
the first global crisis we faced, and it won't be our last. During each test, past and present, we rely on a
set of unique strengths that help us through times of crisis.

First, our highly diverse business model provides a rich set of opportunities and reduces our reliance on
single markets and product lines. Each market we serve and each product line we offer has an important
role to play, both now and in the future. We are also well diversified geographically with roughly half of
our revenue generated in the Americas, 1/3 in Europe and the remainder from Asia Pacific. Our revenue
diversity will help us capture opportunities as the pandemic evolves from region to region.

Second, we are a vertically integrated company. We control our own supply chain and are not overly
reliant on outside partners to produce and distribute our products. This gives us a high degree of
flexibility, efficiency and effectiveness while operating in a highly dynamic business environment.

And finally, we have a strong balance sheet with no debt and over $2.6 billion in cash and marketable
securities.

We're often asked why we maintain such a strong balance sheet, and our answer remains the same. Our
balance sheet provides stability to our investors through our commitment to an attractive dividend and
allows us to invest for the future when others are pulling back.

In summary, our balance sheet is the cornerstone of our ability to face a crisis such as this. With these
things in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a market update for each of our segments.

Fitness had a strong quarter, driven by advanced wearables and our Tacx indoor bike trainers, which
continue to experience strong demand during the

current stay-at-home orders. A positive outcome of this crisis is the increasing focus on personal fitness,
health and wellness. People recognize that good health is an important defense against contracting the
virus. And they're looking for tools that can help them improve their health. Our fitness products are
highly relevant today and will remain so in the future.

Marine posted a strong first quarter, driven by our strong lineup of chartplotters and game-changing sonar
technology. We were recognized as Supplier of the Year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc. for the second
year in a row, and our sponsored anglers swept the top 3 spots at the recent 2020 Bassmaster Classic.

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Boating is an active lifestyle pursuit that promotes family time, relaxation and a sense of freedom. In
the long term, we believe that the current crisis will increase consumer interest in boating and fishing.
Certain restrictions have prevented some boats from coming out of storage as planned, which could
impact the marine season. Once restrictions are eased, we expect to see strong demand for our products.
Regardless of how things play out, we believe compelling innovation is driving market share gains, and we
will continue to deliver innovation for the future.

Outdoor posted strong operating results driven by adventure watches. Time in the outdoors is highly
compatible with healthy social distancing. And we believe that interest in outdoor activities will increase
in the future. We already have a great lineup of products that support a broad range of outdoor activities.
And in coming months, we will strengthen our position by introducing compelling new products and new
categories.

Aviation delivered strong operating results for the first quarter. We saw additional growth in the ADS-B
category but at a lower rate than last year, which was expected. Retrofit systems were strong, while OEM
categories were roughly flat. The aviation market has been significantly impacted by the pandemic and
economic damage caused by measures to contain the spread.

First, travel has been brought to a near standstill by stay-at-home orders and international border
closings. This has impacted both commercial and general aviation. Business confidence has been shaken
by stock market volatility and rapidly declining economic activity. From history, we know that aviation
takes longer to recover from severe economic shocks. Even so, we are optimistic about the future. We
believe more people will seek transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. These are
the enduring qualities that general aviation has been known for throughout the decades. We are ready for
this opportunity with industry-leading cockpit systems for every aircraft from light sport airplanes to large
business jets. We will continue to invest for the future. And disruptive new cockpit technologies are on the
way.

Revenue from auto decreased 17% in the first quarter, and the segment was essentially breakeven.
The first quarter of the year is seasonally slower for our consumer products, and some of our top-
performing OEM products are at a mature point of their life cycle. As I mentioned earlier, people will seek
transportation options that are secure, flexible and convenient. For this reason, we believe personal autos
will remain an important part of the future. To prepare for this opportunity, we've been making significant
progress transforming ourselves to be a Tier 1 auto supplier. New vehicles are launching this year with
Garmin hardware and software solutions, which will lead to revenue growth for the OEM category.

In addition, we will be introducing new specialty product categories that will appeal to automotive
adventurers.

Finally, I want to make a few remarks about our plans for guidance. The impact of the coronavirus and
the economic damage caused by efforts to contain its spread are unprecedented. The ultimate outcome
remains unpredictable, causing us to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance, as I mentioned earlier. While the
long-term is difficult to predict, we want to share insights on what we have seen so far in Q2.

On a consolidated basis, our April sales are trending about 40% lower than last year, as many retailers
have curtailed operations and consumer activity has been severely limited by government restrictions.
We expect these trends to continue throughout the second quarter as restrictions remain in place across
much of the globe. We anticipate being profitable in Q2, provided that our revenue development follows
the trends we've been seeing so far. We've taken near-term measures to defer discretionary expenses,
prioritize uses of cash for critical CapEx and acquisitions, and we've sharpened our focus in R&D. We look
forward to providing annual guidance once economic volatility subsides and when consumer behaviors are
better understood after restrictions are eased and the crisis passes.

That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results.
Doug?

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results,
move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $856
million for the first quarter, representing a 12% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.2%, a
20 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 38.5%, a
70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $177 million, a 17% increase year-
over-year. Operating margin was 20.7%, a 90 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was
$0.84 and pro forma EPS was $0.91.

Next, to look at our first quarter revenue by segment, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $856
million, with 4 of our 5 segments posting double-digit growth. As seen in the charts, we have a diversified
business model from both a segment and geography perspective.

Looking next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million or 10%.
Research and development increased $19 million year-over-year, investments in engineering resources,
incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions. Advertising expense decreased approximately
$1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $10 million compared to prior year quarter, but
decreased as a percentage of sales to 16%, 60 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase
was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
As Cliff mentioned, we're implementing expense control measures to defer discretionary spending and
sharpening our focus in R&D.

A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash
and marketable securities of approximately $2.6 billion and no debt. Accounts receivable decreased
sequentially to $500 million on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, increased year-over-year in line with
first quarter sales. Inventory balance increased on both a sequential year-over-year basis as we have been
preparing for the seasonally strong second quarter. We are aligning production levels and inventory with
anticipated demand. However, we expect incremental increases in inventory in the near term as it takes
time to scale supply chain around near-term demand.

During the first quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $185 million, $50 million increase for
the prior year quarter. We took another look at our capital expenditures and now expect 2020 annual cap
expenditures to be approximately $140 million. 2 key capital expenditure projects for 2020 were the Tacx
manufacturing facility and the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe. Also during the quarter, we paid
dividends of $109 million. Turning an attractive dividend to our shareholders is one of current priorities for
cash.

In the first quarter of 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 9.3% compared to 15.7% in the prior
year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the migration of intellectual property ownership from
Switzerland to United States.
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, can you please open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

Cliff, I wanted to start, I think, back in 2008, 2009, you were, I believe, President and COO of the
organization. Interested in any thoughts you have on how -- what you're seeing now is similar or different
versus then? And if you kind of take out your crystal ball and look into the future, how are you thinking
about things developing? Or what are you looking for in the business before you start thinking about
providing guidance on the year or even on a forward-looking basis? And then I have a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Ben. I think 2008, 2009 was a totally different set of circumstances. I think Garmin was a
much different company back then. About 70-plus percent of our revenue came from literally one product
line. And we were not as well diversified then as we are now in terms of facing a crisis. So we had a lot
to worry about at that time, and we were facing also not only an economic crisis, but a declining market.
I feel like things are totally different now. Our company is very well diversified. And our product lines
target all of the areas where we believe people are going to have a lot of interest in, especially as these
restrictions are removed.

So one thing we learned in the past is that, certainly, you have to have great new products. You have to
be able to continue to invest. We're doing all of those things today, but we're a much different company
than we were back then.

In terms of how things develop for guidance, as I mentioned, we're going to be looking for changes
around these restrictions. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty that's happening as every locale seems
to have a different approach to removing restrictions. And every locale has a different approach when it
comes to how much things they allow so all of these things probably impact consumer behavior. That's
a big wildcard. And then just trying to see how the economic volatility shakes out once we get a feel for
that, we believe we'll be in a good position to be able to predict the business going forward.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

The follow-up, if you look at your retail footprint, my understanding is you have a little more exposure to
smaller specialty stores versus perhaps some other OEMs. What is your approximate exposure to maybe
smaller mom-and-pops, smaller specialty retailers that don't have perhaps the same type of balance sheet
as the larger big box stores? And any concerns on receivables from those partners?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I don't have a number I can share in terms of mix. But what I would tell you is that the execution of
retail partners has been varied. The smaller shops are looking for ways to be successful and to try to keep
their businesses open. Some of the larger retailers have taken a more conservative approach, and that's
impacted, obviously, the retail sell-out and the availability of products for consumers. But we've seen a
great improvement in terms of online sales. So we're really excited about that, and we're working with our
business partners to be able to enhance their online sales as well as our own garmin.com.

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Yes. And regarding receivables, Ben, so those -- yes, we are getting some requests from some of our
customers regarding extended payment terms, and we're granting some of those. But I do want to --
so our DSO probably will increase in Q2. But we want to remind everybody that we do have trade credit
insurance to limit some of our exposure with our receivables.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Nick Todorov from Longbow Research.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

I hope everyone is safe and well. Doug, can you comment on -- or Cliff, on the current state of the
channel inventories in each of the segments, maybe relative to historical norms? And what do you think
is going to be the retailer strategy for channel inventory for the remainder of the year? I understand how
in second quarter, there's going to be a lot of destocking. But do you have any visibility how these -- your
partners are thinking about the second half?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think we don't have a lot of direct feedback. I would tell you this, that we believe that the channel
inventory is actually low. Where we see less restrictions in some of the locales, we actually see sell-
through, as indicated by our Garmin Connect indications as being very strong. And with the sell-in
situation being much lower, we believe the channel inventory is being depleted.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. And the second question now. Can you help us how should we think about decremental margins?
It's very unusual to see revenue declines on a sequential or on a year-over-year basis for you. I think
historically, it had been in the mid-30% range, but any color on how should we think about decrementals,
that would be helpful here.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's not surprising that we see revenue declines in this environment. Today, GDP for the
quarter was down 5%. And most of the economic activity impact was in the last couple of weeks of the
quarter. And so there's a severe economic impact taking place out there, and we certainly cannot defy
that gravity. But in terms of our margin impact, it all depends on product mix. We think some of the online
sales will be accretive. And of course, our key product lines are still a strong part of the overall mix. And
so we're not anticipating any gross margin impact to any significant degree.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. And then the last question before I jump back in the queue. Can you help us think about OpEx? I
mean a lot of companies have seen increased expenses related to COVID-19. Are you seeing any? What is
the impact of that? I know you originally planned to scale up R&D and SG&A, but at the same time, I think
I'm assuming that some discretionary spend is going to go down. Any color on how should we think about
operating expenses in the near future?

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Treasurer

Sure. Regarding -- this is primarily, as we look at what's happening with our demand, so we've taken a
close look at our expenses across the board and put in place various expense control measures. Some
of those of which were slowing our hiring. The second of which is taking a look at all of our discretionary
spend just to make sure that, that's appropriate.

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

And also as it relates to advertising, with the lower demand there, we're flexing our advertising down in
response to some of that lower demand that's out there.

And as it relates to CapEx, it was previously mentioned that we took a look at all of our CapEx also and
making sure that's all the critical CapEx we have. So relates to Q2, looking at each one of those, probably
R&D and SG&A, I probably expect that to probably be up dollar amount year-over-year just due to our
analyzing -- or annualizing some of the 2019 headcount additions.

As it relates to advertising, that's one that we would expect that to be down year-over-year just due to the
flexing that down on our demand. But we're constantly looking at our expense structure and seeing how
we want to make that fit with the current environment we're at.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Company.

Charles Lowell Anderson
Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division

I wanted to start on the comments around the April sales. I just wanted to double check that, that was
indeed a sell-in versus a sell-through comment. And then within that, I wondered if it's one versus the
other, if you could sort of speak to the other. So if it's a sell-in, what are you seeing in terms of sell-
through trends? And then you have all kinds of different businesses here. I wonder if you could sort of
speak to how uniform those declines are? What's better off versus what's worse off within the business
unit, then I have a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Yes. So April, the April trends that we're seeing, everything that we're doing is, of course, sell-in. To
the extent that those sales came from our online mix, of course, that's going more direct-to-consumer. But
in general, it's more influenced by sell-in.

Sell-out, again, as I mentioned earlier, our indications from our product registrations on Garmin Connect
are strong in those regions where restrictions allow the kinds of activities our products are known for. So
we're encouraged by that. And because of that, we believe that the channel inventory is being depleted in
some of those places as customers are looking for products and trying to find whatever they can.

In terms of segment by segment, we're seeing right now in terms of the sell-in stronger results in outdoor
and fitness compared to the trends that I mentioned. Marine is about where we expect. And then aviation
and auto are trending behind.

Charles Lowell Anderson
Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division

Okay, great. And then as it relates to the auto OEM business, I wonder if you could sort of speak to what
you're seeing there? And then we have a few large projects on the horizon with BMW and Geely. If you
could just update us on if those schedules are remaining on track?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So our current sell-in situation in the OEM is affected by those programs that are more mature,
like I mentioned in the remarks. So we're seeing some weakness there as -- and especially probably
compounded by the fact that automakers are shut down right now, and their inventories are high. As we
look towards the back half of the year, we do have those newer programs launching, and those should be
a boost to the overall auto OEM category. And the projects, the major ones, especially the BMW project,
it's a very complicated and involved project, but it's going well. And we're meeting all of the milestones
there, including standing up our factories that we need to be able to support the program.

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Our next question comes from the line of Will Power from Baird.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I guess a couple of questions. Yes, I guess either Cliff or Doug, I guess I'd be curious as to trends you've
seen in Asia Pac. I mean, it looked like lower growth in Q1. And obviously, they would have had an earlier
COVID impact, but what have you seen trend there from March into April? And how does that inform how
you're thinking about some of the other geographies?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Asia continues to struggle right now. China, I think, was the first country that really was impacted
from a virus outbreak perspective, and the retail channels there completely shut down due to the virus
spread. And we've seen it kind of roll around from country to country. So some of the stronger countries
as they get impacted and implement their own measures, then of course, we see the situation change.
So in general, as a whole, APAC has struggled to regain their footing, even though they're theoretically a
little more advanced in the overall development of the pandemic. But we see encouraging signs in those
countries where the virus has either been well controlled and restrictions are lifting or they haven't yet had
the kind of spread that other countries have had.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then, Cliff, I guess, separately, you had talked about one of the areas of focus going forward
is looking at opportunities longer term. And I think you referenced the strong balance sheet and cash. So
how should we think about potential M&A? What are -- are you starting to see more opportunities? How
aggressive might you be there? And are there particular verticals that could look interesting here given
some of the challenges of some of your competitors potentially in the markets?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're still looking for opportunities. Of course, we're very discriminating, but I would anticipate
there would be some opportunities that would come our way in the near term. And I think generally, our
experience in the past has been that this tends to shake out more opportunities. So again, we're looking
to leverage our cash for things that can help Garmin be stronger and grow in the future, and that's what
we'll continue to do during this time.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. Yes. I hope you all stay as safe and healthy as possible. Thanks.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Will.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Chung from JPMorgan.

Paul Chung
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So just first up, retail shops are seeing some 0 traffic essentially. So how big of a shift to online channels
are you seeing as a result? Is there kind of a percentage of sales on your website and e-commerce site
you can share pre-COVID?

And then as we move forward post, are you thinking about kind of like a shift in strategy to kind of place
more emphasis on direct-to-consumer e-commerce channels which would benefit margins, I assume? And
then I have a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So online and web has been very strong during this time. I think it's a combination of the fact that
many retailers, especially the bigger ones, have restricted access to their stores and customers are looking
for ways to get products safely, so they're turning to online.

For us, our website growth has been phenomenal during this period, and we've been adding to our
capabilities on the website to be able to support sales strategies there. With all of that said, our retailers
remain very important to us. And as soon as they can come back online, we'll certainly be supporting
them. But we do see a significant shift at this time, and I would anticipate that generally speaking, the
shift to online that has been occurring broadly across all of the geographies is going to continue in the
future.

Paul Chung
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then a follow up on the marine side, nice kind of growth to start the year. It sounds like some marine
retailers are kind of seeing some positive trends in April, though sales are probably going to be down
for the year. But now you have like the New York Tri-state area kind of reopening marinas and boating
arguably kind of suit social distancing. So usage, I assume, would be fine, possibly benefiting some
accessory upgrades. Just want to get a sense for what you're seeing from your customers? And how much
-- how the month of April is evolving? And anything you want to call out on the marine side?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I would say that it's a mixed situation for marine. Depending on the locale and the retailer, some
retailers are doing very well and some have had to operate under more restrictive circumstances even
closing their stores. So this has hindered the access to marine products. And generally, we've seen very
strong end-user demand for the products. Some of our top products, even on our own website, are
our marine products, which is somewhat counterintuitive because they're more complex and require
installation, but people are buying those.

So again, it's kind of a mixed bag. We would expect things to get better, as you say, as states open up for
boating. Michigan has been a big one. You mentioned New York. That's also been a big one. We hope that
boats can come out of storage soon. And we are hearing from the field that customers are excited about
equipping their boats and getting them on the water.

In terms of the opportunity going forward, we're very optimistic about marine. It's a great market. I
think a crisis like this when people are evaluating priorities, they tend to turn to things that inspire them,
and I think boating and fishing is one of those things that we'll see a benefit in the future from people's
evaluation of their priorities.

Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Again, congratulations on another great quarter and really nicely managing the company during this
difficult and crazy time.

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Thanks, Ivan.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

My first question is Doug had spoken about CapEx, but something cut out on my phone. You said that
investing in expanding the Tacx manufacturing. And then you said one other thing, it sounded like auto
something. So what are the 2 big CapEx projects?

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Treasurer

Yes, Ivan. What it relates to is the Tacx facility. So when we acquired Tacx facility, we basically, at that
point in time, made a decision to expand its manufacturing facility because of the increased demand
we saw there. So we're in the process of actually building a brand-new manufacturing facility at Tacx to
handle the increased demand there.

And the second one relates to auto OEM manufacturing. So with that, expanding with some of the
additional programs we have, we're actually standing up a manufacturing facility in Europe.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Okay. Then I think one of the things that when things go back to normal from my interaction and talking
with people, I think the in-home fitness trend is going to be powerful. While people are -- seem to be
willing to go to restaurants, theaters, all kinds of other venues that are crowded, the one thing is people
seem to be reluctant to go back to the gym and are more interested in in-home fitness. So I think that's
going to be a huge opportunity. How do you view addressing that opportunity further?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, that's what we're seeing, Ivan, and the back orders on our Tacx products are very strong. We've not
been able to supply all of the demand that we're seeing there. So we're working hard, as Doug said, to
increase our capacity and hopefully then be able to get ahead of the demand curve that's occurring. We
expect that there will be -- people talk about a second cycling season, if you will, or indoor cycling season
as people are more interested in staying indoors for a while, and we expect strong sales to continue. And
then, of course, as our factory comes online, we'll be able to deliver more volume.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Then one of the other things I noticed, which was really good that you added a lot of features and
functionality to the Connect app that supported the watches with like downloadable exercise routines
that you could do at home and use your watch for. And like can you give us some color on how you were
able to coordinate that, especially like if people who normally were in the office and kind of collaborating
together and working from home because they did a nice job to increase the features during the time.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We've had the capability in our devices to be able to put custom workouts and even provide
instruction on the device as some of the newer devices that are out there. And our Connect IQ platform
has been a solid investment for us to be able to expand the interest that people have in the product
through third-party apps and our own apps that can expand utility. So our teams have been able to be
very agile in rolling new things out, and it's helped create more engagement and interest in our products,
which we're really thrilled about.

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

And I have one last question. I know it's a hard question to answer. But as this increased interest in home
fitness grows, there's a lot of small companies that have interesting products that could benefit from, let's
say, your expertise. Are you looking at growing through acquisition in that area further the way you did
with acquiring Tacx?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think Tacx is a great example, and we did see the opportunity for that, and that's where we put a
big bet in terms of expanding into a new category. I would say, generally, our MO for acquisitions is that
we look for things that are either a complementary product or a technology, enabling technology that
can help us expand into new product categories. And so that's what we'll continue to do, not speaking
specifically about fitness, but really across the board.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Thanks, and congratulations again, and I look -- everybody stays safe and well. And I look forward to,
hopefully, a different environment on the next call.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Ivan. Same.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So just curious if you could provide some color on just what you're seeing? Obviously, you spoke to sell-
through in the outdoor and fitness segments. But obviously, your results kind of bucked the trend that
we've seen or heard with other consumer names. So just any high-level color on how coronavirus has had
an impact? And then perhaps asking that question a little bit of a different way. How far in advance do
your channel partners typically purchase inventory? And is that changing in the current environment? And
then I have a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we saw strength in our business through most of the first quarter, remarkably strong really
through most of about mid-March, and then things started to come down as the panic over the crisis
quickly spread into Western Europe and North America. So we were super strong. We believe that's
encouraging because, again, our product lines are very strong, and our business in general had a lot of
momentum.

In terms of retailer behavior, even when times are good, they don't try to over index on inventory. I think
they're very cautious. They have a certain amount of open-to-buy dollars. So it isn't as if they had stocked
up with a significant amount of inventory. I would say it was fairly manageable inventory levels. And
as their businesses have scaled back as they respond to the crisis, we believe that the inventories are
depleting.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That's super helpful. And then can you just provide some commentary on what you're hearing from
your OEM partners in the aviation market? If you look back to '08, '09, obviously, those markets were --
that market was very weak. So just curious how they're viewing the current crisis relative to a little over a
decade ago.

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

I think for aviation, probably the situation is very similar to '08, '09, a significant economic downturn
and loss of confidence, particularly in the business sector. So generally, I think they're very concerned
and some of the more public things that have been announced, you see some OEMs that have done
some furloughs and different things like that, and they're trying to scale their production to demand. But
again, that said, I feel like the longer term is that general aviation has a bright future. Even now, many
communities are actually losing their commercial airline service as airliners scale back. And so the only
options for getting certain kinds of transportation is through general aviation. And we think because of
the security, the safety, the convenience and flexibility of general aviation that it can play a big role in the
future in the kind of concern over viral spread.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Super. Thank you. And then just last question, just a clarification question. Did you say earlier that you
still expect your auto OEM business to grow in 2020? Just want to clarify that point, and then I'm done.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it will be towards the back half as newer products launch from the OEMs. And of course, their
schedules are more in doubt as well as they face supply chain issues and also demand issues. But in
general, all of the indications we have is that these new products are launching as they planned.

Operator

Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Nick Todorov from Longbow Research.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

You mentioned an inability to meet fully the current Tacx demand. Can you try to quantify that? And also
remind us when the new capacity is expected to come online?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's hard to quantify because we haven't found where the demand is. It's been so strong. So we're
chasing as much of that as we can and trying to serve our customers the best that we can. The new
factory is scheduled to come online about midyear and should start to ramp up into the fall as we prepare
for the next indoor cycling season that occurs next winter.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. And then you mentioned that channel inventories are depleted. And I'm assuming that in fitness,
the trends are strongest among all the segments. Yet how do we -- can you provide any additional colors
other than just April orders are down 40%? How much are orders for fitness segment trending year-over-
year if you can share?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Fitness and outdoor have been above that trend. And again, these, to clarify, are sell-in trends. So the
sell-out is -- everything is a case-by-case basis. But in those regions and countries where restrictions
allow, we see strong registration activity on our Garmin Connect platform. And in places where restrictions
are very tight, of course, you see a very predictable downturn in what's going on. So we're optimistic that
as restrictions ease that things should get better.

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Are those restrictions kind of implying more of a flattish environment or year-over-year growth in sell-
through? Or how should we think about this?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, every country, every region has a case-by-case situation to look at. If you look at the countries with
the strongest restrictions, such as Italy, Spain and France, sell-out is very confined there. And some of the
cases in those countries, you need permission to even go out of your house.

In other places, such as the Nordics, which have been -- taken a different approach to how they manage
the crisis, the sell-out is very strong and actually in strong growth mode over the last year. So it's a mixed
situation. And everything that we're seeing points to the fact that the restrictions on people is impacting
the sales more than anything right now.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. And last question for me. The Marine segment, can you compare and contrast? Obviously, it's a
much different business and your overexposure to aftermarket helps you here. But compare and contrast
that to the '09 period, where it kind of took 2 years for the segment to reach the '08 peak. It seems like
this cycle is going to perform much better. But what specifically gives you confidence and allows you to
be more positive on the marine segment here, given it's still a discretionary spending, and it's -- they're
rather high-priced products?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So there's a few things that are different this time. In '08 and '09, the production capacity was so
high that when the pullback occurred, there was simply no way to sustain that kind of production capacity
in marine products. And so the marine market, especially the OEMs, felt a significant impact from the
reduction in demand. There was also a lot of crazy financing going on with boats. And so the overall
financial situation of people buying boats and the financers that were financing the boats was very, very
precarious. Rolling forward to where we are today, the boat market has slowly recovered from those lows.
And so it hasn't overbuilt in the same way that it was back in '08 and '09. And the kinds of products that
are being offered are in the bell curve of where demand still exists, tends to be in those mid-range center
console type of boats that still remain popular. And many of our OEM partners that are shut down right
now are very anxious to go back to work because they have customers that want their boats, that have
ordered them and are anxious to get them.

So we're optimistic about that. We don't think it's the same situation. But I would also say that anytime
there's economic shocks, that will take a certain number of customers out of the market. So there's bound
to be some impact, but we hope it's not as bad as what it was before.

Operator

Our next question is a follow-up from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just one last question here. I was just wondering if you could detail kind of on the -- in the fitness and
outdoor segments, what the contribution to growth was from units versus pricing?

GARMIN LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Yes. We don't break out just in terms of ASP and units versus pricing. But we're seeing in the Q1 growth
in boat as we've had newer product lines in fitness and also our new product lines in outdoor, especially in
the Phoenix area.

Operator

Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the
