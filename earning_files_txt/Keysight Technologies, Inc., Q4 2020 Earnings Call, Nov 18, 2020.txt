Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered an outstanding quarter to finish
our fiscal year, driven by strong execution and broad-based demand for our differentiated solutions.
Despite COVID-related macro challenges, it was a record year for orders, gross margin, operating margin,
earnings per share and free cash flow.

Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered exceptional fourth quarter results,
driven by strong execution as demand for Keysight's next-generation technology solutions continued and
end market demand began to recover. Second, record profitability and cash flow again demonstrated
the durability and strength of our financial operating model despite a challenging macroeconomic
environment. And third, our long-term outlook for revenue and earnings growth is strong, and we haven't
wavered from our pre-COVID long-term financial commitments and growth expectations announced in
March of this year. The power of Keysight's Leadership Model and our execution this year underscore our
ability to deliver on these commitments, which includes 4% to 6% long-term core revenue growth and
achieving 26% to 27% sustainable annual operating margin by no later than fiscal year 2023.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2020

Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial
performance. In the fourth quarter, broad-based demand for Keysight Solutions drove strong results
across the business as the economic recovery in certain sectors gained momentum. Record orders of
$1.2 billion exceeded revenue and grew 3% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. We achieved fourth
quarter revenue growth of 9% year-over-year with growth across all regions. Both the Communications
and Electronic Industrial Solutions groups achieved record revenue in the quarter. The resilience of our
financial operating model resulted in an all-time high profitability in cash flow. In Q4, we delivered gross
margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%, and earnings of $1.62 per share and free cash flow of $308
million. For the year, and despite COVID-related macro challenges and supply chain disruption, orders
grew to $4.5 billion, an all-time high for Keysight.

As you recall, in Q2, we responded to government directors to limit the spread of coronavirus and close
the majority of our offices worldwide, including our order fulfillment and manufacturing operations. We
then ramped back up our production capacity in Q3. Despite the significant disruption, full year revenue
of $4.2 billion declined only 2% year-over-year. Even in a difficult operating environment, we continue to
deliver on our margin expansion commitment. Both gross margin and operating margin improved by over
100 basis points, generating a record $4.85 per share in earnings in fiscal year 2020.

Turning to our markets. The Communications Solutions Group record quarterly revenue was driven by
growth across the aerospace, defense and government and commercial communications. Aerospace,
defense and government revenue increased 13% year-over-year in Q4, driven by strength in the
Americas and Asia, as defense modernization continues to drive investments in technology with a focus on
electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and new commercial technologies like 5G.

In commercial communications, 5G technology is scaling and drove strong demand across the design
life cycle from development to deployment. Keysight has the industry's most comprehensive range of
5G design and test solutions, enabling the global build-out of networks and devices. 5G has been a
strong growth driver for us for over the past 3 years, and we continue to see new use cases and ongoing
innovation as the ecosystem scales and adapts to a new technology. A recent example of our 5G solutions
approach includes collaboration on O-RAN with many industry leaders.

Investment continues across the commercial communications market spanning wireless and wired
technologies in data centers and also in the cloud. This quarter, we announced a new high-performance
PXi, a modular 5G base station solution. It is enabling network equipment manufacturers and small
cell vendors to accelerate their time to market. This solution also incorporates enhancements from our
PathWave software platform that help automate some of the current workflow limitation.

Within the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, orders and revenue for our broad portfolio of general
electronic solutions both grew double digit, driven by gradual economic recovery across most regions and
improvement in the education market. Demand for our semiconductor measurement solutions was again
strong this quarter as investment in next-generation process technologies continued.

In automotive, while macro-driven weakness continues to weigh on the sector, strategic investment in
the advanced automotive technology is a market priority. We saw an improvement from last quarter as
orders grew double digits sequentially across all regions. Our Scienlab electric vehicle test solutions are
expanding in Asia and Europe, where government mandates are driving the electrification of vehicles. We
continue to add to our solutions portfolio, impressing challenges in the development of advanced driver
assistance systems, or ADAS, and ensuring compliance to important standards. In Q4, we introduced
a new radar target simulator for ADAS being developed to enable autonomous driving as well as a new
solution for testing automotive ethernet standards compliance for in-vehicle networks. We also recently
announced collaborations with SGS and Qualcomm to advance testing of cellular vehicle to everything or
C-V2X technology.

Turning to software and services. Combined, they were 1/3 of total Keysight revenue for this year after
another quarter of solid growth. In addition, recurring revenue increased from 18% of total in FY '19 to
21% in FY '20. On an annualized basis, recurring revenue grew high-teens over last year. Software and
services are important elements of our solution-centric strategy and differentiation and further strengthen
the durability of our business model. In Q4, we launched new and enhanced solutions to tap the power of

cloud-based processing and advanced analytics to speed design simulation, validation and manufacturing
test. These include several new PathWave software solutions targeting advanced design, compliance test,
automation and measurement and manufacturing analytics.

Increasingly complex designs and the volume of data associated with their validation are driving demand
for Keysight Solutions. Keysight's execution and financial performance this year is a testament to
Keysight's Leadership Model, our values and our commitment to corporate social responsibility.

A year ago, I shared with our teams my top priorities for the company. One of these priorities was a
specific focus on increasing our inclusion and diversity efforts. In support of this priority, I appointed a
new Senior Director of Inclusion and Diversity, who has been working with Keysight leaders and external
organizations to increase representation of diverse groups within our workforce. We placed a high-value
on inclusion and diversity at all levels of our organization, including the Board of Directors. We continue to
make progress, and I'm pleased to share that as of today, over 30% of our U.S. executives are diverse in
gender, race and/or ethnicity.

Before I turn the call over to Neil, I'd like to sincerely thank all of our Keysight employees for the
relentless commitment, engagement and dedication to our success over the past year. Our people and
culture are truly a competitive differentiator. Thanks to their efforts and in the face of unprecedented
challenges, Keysight exits this year stronger than ever and is very well positioned to capitalize on our
growth opportunities ahead.

Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, please note that all comparisons are on a year-over-
year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise.

As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter, and despite a challenging macro environment, we
continue to make great progress towards our long-term annual financial targets.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we delivered record revenue of $1.220 billion, which was above the high
end of our guidance range and grew 9%, or 7% on a core basis. Q4 revenue growth was driven by
continued demand in areas such as 5G, semiconductor measurement and aerospace defense where we
have leading positions and differentiated solutions. Demand for general electronics improved significantly
in the quarter, driven by regional economic recovery, particularly in Asia. Total Keysight orders exceeded
revenue in Q4 with a book-to-bill of just over 1. We delivered a record 1,231,000,000 in orders, up 3%, or
1% on a core basis.

Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of
$446 million, resulting in operating margin of 29%, an all-time quarterly high. Net income was a record
$305 million, and we achieved $1.62 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our
guidance and an increase of 22% year-over-year. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was
188 million shares.

Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record
revenue of $901 million, up 8%, while delivering record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin
of 29%. In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $605 million, up 5%, driven by strength
across the 5G ecosystem from development to early manufacturing, Gen 5 high-speed digital applications
and data center-related 400-gigabit and 800-gigabit technology. Aerospace defense and government
achieved record revenue of $296 million, an increase of 13% versus a prior all-time high in Q4 last year.
Growth was driven by strength in the Americas and Asia, with improvement in Europe.

The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $319 million, up 12% or 7%
on a core basis, driven by strength in general electronics and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin
of 65%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year and record operating margin of 30%.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2020

Given the challenges that we faced this year, we are very pleased with our full year results. FY '20 revenue
totaled $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year or 3% on a core basis, impacted by supply chain disruptions
and macro challenges caused by the pandemic. Despite this small revenue decline, gross margin improved
140 basis points year-over-year to 65%. While continuing to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or nearly
$700 million for the year, operating margin improved 130 basis points to 25%. This year-over-year
improvement demonstrates strong progress towards our annual operating margin target of 26% to 27%,
which we expect to achieve by fiscal 2023. FY '20 non-GAAP net income was $919 million or $4.85 per
share for the full year.

Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash
equivalents, a reported cash flow from operations of $338 million record free cash flow of $308 million.
Free cash flow is net of a $100 million funding contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the quarter, which
provides a tax benefit in the current year and a pension expense benefit in FY '21. Total free cash flow for
the year was $899 million, representing 21% of revenue and 98% of non-GAAP net income.

Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we were opportunistic in deploying capital during the
quarter. We acquired approximately 2.2 million shares on the open market at an average price of $96.55,
for a total consideration of $215 million, and exhausting our $500 million share repurchase authorization
from May of 2019. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 4.3 million
shares at an average share price of $95.90, for a total consideration of $410 million or 46% of free cash
flow. As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase
authorization of $750 million effective immediately.

Before moving to FY '21 modeling and our Q1 guidance, I'd like to provide a brief update on global trade
concerns. We admittedly have a tough order comp in Q1 due to China trade restrictions and the pending
U.S. administration change, which has historically dampened government business during the transition.
Despite these headwinds, we have started to see gradual improvements in many of our markets and are
entering the year in a strong backlog position, giving us confidence in our ability to navigate these near-
term perturbations.

Looking to FY '21, we expect quarterly revenue seasonality to be more muted than in the past due to
ongoing COVID-19 and macro-related uncertainty. Just as we flexed expenses down this year, flexible
spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY '21 to more normal levels, with Q2
expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters. In addition, FY '21 pension expenses reflected in the
other expense line, are expected to increase by $5 million per quarter. Interest expense is expected to
be approximately $78 million, and capital spending is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180
million as we begin a 2-year project to increase the resiliency of our supply chain. Regarding our tax rate,
we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '21.

Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect first quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of
$1.140 billion to $1.160 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.38 based on a
weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares.

In closing, our solid outlook for revenue and earnings growth, coupled with the durability of our business
model, give us confidence in our ability to deliver on the long-term financial commitments that we outlined
in March prior to COVID. Despite the challenges of this past year, we continue to make good progress
towards our long-term targets of 4% to 6% core revenue growth in the annual operating margin of 26%
to 27%.

With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations
Thank you, Neil. Chris, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Yes. I want to go back to your booking and better understand. Specific to commercial communication, how
should I think about orders for 5G, specifically millimeter wave? And how does the networking like a fiber
for 800-gig compared to millimeter wave-related orders? And I have a follow-up.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Thanks, Mehdi. This is Satish. I'll take it. Our commercial communications group had a record
revenue this quarter and second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. And a large part of the
results were driven by strength in both the wireless and wireline ecosystems. Specifically from a trend
perspective, 5G and 400-gig were big drivers of growth for us.

And I would say, in 5G, while -- we observed 3 things, right? The commercialization is ramping. A large
part of that is low-frequency or mid-band frequency networks, the standardization of the technology
continues to progress, and the big theme is the ecosystem is expanding. So these are sort of 3 big trends
that are enabling both wireless and wireline technologies to be strong for us.

As far as the millimeter wave is concerned, we view the -- we have long viewed and we continue to view
the millimeter wave opportunity as very favorable for us because of the upgrade potential to our presence
and our traditional strengths in millimeter wave technologies play out. And even this quarter, specifically,
we continue to see a steady ramp in customer interest as they retool their engineering flow to adopt to the
millimeter wave technology.

On the wireline side, we captured pretty strong ramps that occurred for 400-gig in Asia throughout the
year, and we are starting to see increased activity in R&D to our 400-gig and 800-gig ethernet this quarter.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. Just a quick follow-up. And as we look into FY '21, 5G goes into production, how should I think
about the software content? And this question actually ties into the last question. As you go into
production, should we expect continued strength in R&D, specifically R&D that is software-heavy? And in
that context, would the gross margin hold up? Or as we go into production 5G, should we expect some
gross margin headwind?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes, Mehdi. As far as R&D, we continue to see a robust pipeline for demand for R&D with Release 16
features coming out next year, so I would continue to see strength there. With regard to our production
test opportunities, we're starting to see that the deployments are actually driving ramps in the supply
chain, and we're benefiting from them. And in fact, this quarter, we referenced a pretty sizable win for our
PXi or release of our PXi modular solution, which has also has a software content associated with it. So
we'll continue to see a steady improvement there as well.

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I'd certainly expect any margin impact from a migration towards manufacturing to be more or less
undetectable at the Keysight level when you think about $4.5 billion of revenue and the progress we're

making generally as a company around software and services and other areas. So not something that
we're concerned about.

Operator

Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

If I can just start off with commercial communications as well and just following up on Satish's comment
-- his commentary here on 5G momentum being strong. Just wanted to see if you can outline how to think
about maybe kind of an acceleration in terms of 5G revenue momentum? And how does that play into kind
of what kind of declines to expect on the 4G revenue side? Any thoughts as we look into kind of the next
couple of years on that front? And I think one of your competitors has also talked about some of the 5G
release delays driving order weakness. So have you seen anything on that front?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. There is no doubt that the -- there has been some implementation delays in some quarters of the
ecosystem. If it were not for this, given the momentum that the industry is sustaining, we would be
further along.

Having said that, we saw strong orders for our business, the quarter and for the full year, in 5G. And we
see a robust pipeline for Release 16 in R&D and for production-related expansions that customers are
planning for. So we continue to believe that 5G represents a long-term opportunity for us, especially as
we have talked about our portfolio being broad, starting with the physical layer where we have millimeter
wave -- bulk of the millimeter wave opportunity in front of us, and then we have the protocol layer where
Release 16 and Release 17 to follow, where there's been some delays in Release 17 that you referenced.
But Release 16 is very high-impact in terms of its expansion into new use cases that we're very excited
about.

And lastly, I would say that we saw strong growth in the application layer opportunity where we've
expanded our 5G strength even beyond commercial comms into aerospace and defense with security
applications into our general electronics business to multiple industries and into automotive with CV2X. So
you piece that all together, we continue to believe that this is still very early innings in 5G as we stated at
Investor Day.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Satish, if I can just follow-up. What are you seeing in terms of activity on the 4G side? Are we at a
point where some of these revenue declines moderate on the 4G side?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. I think we've -- obviously, the year-over-year, if you look at last year, we saw some expansions in
traditional smartphone driving up the legacy of 4G business. And so comparatively, things declined sharper
this year given that customers prioritize 5G. But again, I would go back to saying we have a very broad
breadth of tools for the labs that we offer. And in many cases, customers delayed that spend. And we
expect that to stabilize and ramp back up as customers return and recover from COVID.

Operator

Our next question is from Tim Long with Barclays.

Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2020

Just if I could just follow-up with one on the 5G side and ask on optical. Just talk a little bit about kind of
the pricing and competitive environment as some of the competitors try to play a little catch up there. Any
changes of note? And then secondly, you mentioned some strength in the data center 400-gig, 800-gig.
Could you expand on that a little bit? Where do you think we are in that cycle? And if you could also talk
into the service provider opportunities as they transition to 600 and 800 gig as well.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Thanks. I think our differentiations front, I would say, continues to be strong. You look at the
standards-based test cases that we offer, and you can see that we're leading and that we're staying on
the cutting edge, and that's what our customers appreciate. So on the edge -- on the edges, we don't see
any material change to our competitive position with regard to these advanced technologies, and we have
continued to invest this year in R&D to keep our differentiation strong. So that's the point I'll make.

With regard to how this is all playing out, you might say, if you just think of the smartphone use case,
there is about 7,200 band combinations in 5G that have been defined. And to date, only 1,500 of them
are being tested, so the latest devices that we have account for 1,500. So you start to see that there is
considerable runway just in the smartphone use case. And with Release 16 that is in front of us, there is
new expansion opportunities for industrial applications and automotive applications that creates a healthy
pipeline for us.

With regard to the wireline, the first phase of the 400-gig deployments have largely been in what I would
consider east-west traffic that flows in a data center, and with more to come as operators start to deploy
this technology when the price -- when price on the transceivers start to become more affordable. So
that's the second wave we expect, but there is continued evolutions of 400 gig and 800 gig that have
started, which we -- which feeds into our R&D strength.

Operator

The next question is from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations on the solid results. A couple of questions. Just when you think about the year-over-
year compares on both revenue in orders to the fiscal first quarter guidance, can you just remind us how
much of a headwind Huawei should represent fiscal first quarter to fiscal first quarter? And sticking on
the China topic, I'm just kind of curious, when you think about the 5G strength, how important has China
been over the last several quarters? More importantly, as you look into the first half of the year, what are
you expecting from China? I guess the underlying question is, do you feel as though China will continue to
deploy 5G at a relatively healthy clip despite the Huawei band? And do you think there's some potential for
digestion there before reacceleration?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So this is Neil. Why don't I take the first part of that, and then maybe we'll have Mark comment on
China and some of our expectations there.

I think the most important comment with regard to Huawei is the situation with Huawei is not going to
change our expectations as it relates to our long-term growth outlook for our business or for our markets,
right? We're entering the year in a very strong backlog position, and I think that strong backlog position is
going to enable us to essentially mitigate the impact of any short-term perturbations that may happen on
the order line because of the year-over-year Huawei compares. We have an extraordinarily diverse base
of customers around the world that's driving demand in our end markets, and we're looking at that and
the strengthening we've seen over the past couple of quarters relative to where we were in Q2, and we're
going to keep our foot on the gas relative to those long-term targets.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2020

Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. John, this is Mark. I'll follow-up with that. So the business -- our orders in China in Q4 were strong
and steady throughout the quarter despite some decline, obviously, impact from Huawei. That came from
strengths in 5G, and it is extending across the ecosystem as we scale those solutions. As Satish talked
about, 400 gig is hot, high-speed digital and optical manufacturing. So it's a very broad industry for us.

We've also seen the economic recovery in China. They recovered first and more quickly, and we've seen
that show up in our automotive order growth and general electronics. And the bottom line is, as Neil
mentioned, our business in China is -- we have a very broad footprint. The business is strong. We've been
successful, and we'll continue to be successful to deploy and redeploy our resources to continue to capture
growth in 5G and across the other segments.

The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Niknam
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

One on margins. So you're exiting the year a lot closer, and I think actually exceeding your sort of longer-
term target. And so maybe, Neil, if you can help us think through why, with a seemingly improving --
you've got a big backlog, revenue trajectory should improve, the anticipation of margins maybe reverting
back lower, how we should sort of think about the different puts and takes.

And then just 1 follow-up. On orders, I know normalized order growth was about 1%, and you're sort of
reaffirming the sort of longer-term top line growth target of 4% to 6%. Just wondering if you can sort of
call out the bigger areas that are still lagging and the path to get back to that sort of longer-term mid-
singles growth rate.

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So let me start with the margin side of that first. So first of all, we're very pleased with the margin
performance of the business in the year. And we look at this year and some of the challenges of this
year as a great test of the operating model that we've been talking about, really, since the launch of the
company.

That being said, our operating margin targets or margin targets in general, they're annual targets, not
quarterly targets. We hit 25% this year, and we've talked about getting to 26% or 27% operating margin
is the target that we outlined at our Analyst Day, and we are still working towards that objective. I think
we're highly confident in our ability to achieve that. And as we look forward to this year, I think you can
look to, obviously, in the second and third quarters, with revenue down and the corresponding expenses
down, but you saw in Q4, the kind of margin performance that we can put up with the expenses turning --
returning to a more normalized level.

With regard to kind of how we get back to mid-single digits, I think we are seeing some relative
strengthening across the broader markets and economies in general. I think we -- a great indicator of
that is what we're seeing in general electronics. We saw a strong return on our education business, which
is, I think, is indicative of some recovery from the COVID situation. Even looking at businesses like auto,
while auto orders were still down on a year-over-year basis, we saw very strong sequential improvement
in auto. So things are getting better, and I think we're going to look really across the entire portfolio for
strengthening -- just broad macro strengthening to help drive us to those levels.

You guys talked about the tough Q1 comp. Can you just maybe tell us what percent of FQ1 orders and
revenue came from Huawei, just to give us a feel for what the underlying demand is?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

We expect it to be about a 5-point headwind in the first half. That's roughly how we're thinking about it.
But again, I think, given the backlog situation that we have coming into the year, I think that that's going
to be the dominant driver of our business. And so I think that's going to give us the ability to -- and give
us some time to overcome what might be some short-term perturbations on the order line. We're highly
confident going into the year.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Appreciate that. And I mean is it fair to assume that your 5% for the first half, it's more weighted
into fiscal Q1, just kind of given that the China COVID impact hit in the fiscal Q2?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

No, that's correct. And I said as much in our -- in my prepared remarks. We clearly have a tough order
comp in Q1, but I'd point you back to the backlog situation. We're guiding stronger revenue growth in
the first quarter, and we're going to be in a good position as we migrate through the year. Certainly, our
revenue comps in Q2 and Q3 get significantly softer, obviously, but the backlog that we built over the last
several quarters is going to provide a buffering for us.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Appreciate that. And then just kind of following up on that, some peers have talked about the ability to
sell non-U.S. IP to Huawei. Can you maybe talk about any opportunity here for Keysight? And has these
restrictions that we've seen led to any upstream share shifts that would maybe allow you guys to partially
offset this headwind as we move into 2021?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Let me take the first part of that, and I'll let Satish maybe comment on the second part. We do have
some ability to sell some small portions of our portfolio into Huawei going forward that don't include any
material U.S. technology, but it is a very small portion of the portfolio. We do not expect Huawei to be a
material customer for us going forward.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

And just to add to what Neil said, it's too soon to call any share shifts, but we start to see the smartphone
-- Tier 2 smartphone makers in China continue to invest in R&D because they see an opportunity, so that's
probably 1 positive offset, if you will. The second one that is evolving is the resurgent interest in Open
RAN technology to sort of provide a different alternative to base stations -- to 5G base stations. I think
you look at those 2 things, have the potential to -- for us in the -- as we look into 2021 and beyond.

Make it a good one.

Adam Robert Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

Let's go with the seasonality for fiscal year '21, Neil. I think you said less seasonality in '21? I'm just
curious what you meant by that and how you want us to model it.

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. We just think -- again, I'm going to bring you back to the backlog situation. As we slowly work off
the backlog that we built up over the last several quarters, we think that is going to essentially mute the
impact of what would typically be more demand-driven quarterly seasonality that we've seen in prior
years. So we expect a much more muted revenue seasonality over the coming quarters, maybe with a
slight uptick in Q4, but a much more muted revenue seasonality than what's been is typical.

Operator

The next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Sure. Just wondering what the kind of all-in temporary cost reductions were in fiscal year '20 to come
back in fiscal year '21. Just trying to get a sense of, as you referenced in your prepared remarks, some of
those variable costs flexing back up?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I mean, I think the big drivers, obviously, we've talked at length in prior quarters about our variable
pay programs and the flexibility of our cost model. That's probably the single biggest driver. Then there's
the obvious things that impacted many companies. Dramatic reductions in travel, as an example.

I would point you to kind of our Q4 expenses. I think we largely saw our spending return to more
normalized levels here in the fourth quarter of the year. Obviously, we'll continue to do some of the
administration and other things. But I think as we look forward, you look to Q4 as a baseline. And then
as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect Q2 to be higher than the other quarters from an OpEx
standpoint in FY '21.

Next question is from Richard Eastman with Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Neil, could you just give us the backlog number at the end of the year? I mean at face value, it looks
like it's up 22%. But I'm curious, maybe was there any debooking of orders around Huawei or anything on
the defense side? Or did we enter with that kind of a step up?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

We have not seen any material -- any change in kind of debooking. There's always some noise level of
debookings, but it hasn't changed at all. Obviously, we built a significant amount of backlog, just looking
at the difference between orders and revenue for the year. It's on the order of $300 million, of which a
portion of which you would consider to be kind of abnormal backlog build given the revenue disruptions

or the shipment disruptions in the second and third quarter. So it's that abnormal portion of backlog build
that we'll be looking to work off over the course of -- in the next several quarters.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then just a question around Ixia. Can you give us a sense of -- are you seeing any --
an uptick in demand there? Just given the timing and the pacing of demand relative to the new network
rollouts and infrastructure roll outs. But how does Ixia look here at the end of the year and for the year?
And what does the outlook look like from a demand standpoint for 2021?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes, Rick. So it's been a little over a year since we integrated the Ixia business into the commercial
communications segment, and we've made some excellent progress in realizing synergies with respect
to solutions. I would say in the networking phase, we see a 400 gig ethernet. Our portfolio has been
significantly strengthened, not only the physical layer, but also in the protocol layer, with the addition
of the Ixia's Layer 2, Layer 3 business. And we're securing some good wins in the industry as the R&D
investment flows.

And with the security piece of the business that we acquired, now we're able to integrate that with our
5G platform and realize greater synergies there as we position solutions for the aerospace and defense
industry, so that's another area where not only are we addressing traditional opportunities, but also some
expansion areas.

With 5G now getting deployed we're starting to see a pickup in demand for the visibility part of the
business where we -- just this quarter, we had a couple of big opportunities that we closed on, with
operators looking for enhanced application layer visibility there. So overall, I would say, you look at the
big trends of virtualization, cloud and the progression that's going into the application layer, we view the
portfolio to be strong, and we think the outlook is favorable. Obviously, right now, everybody is recovering
from COVID, so that sort of gates that recovery.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Okay. All right. And congrats on a very solid quarter, next quarter.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Rick, this is Ron. Just one other comment. We talked about the backlog build in FY '20. You may want to
also go back and look at backlog build in FY '19 because it's been a very steady build that we've had for
many quarters beyond FY '20.

Next question is from James Suva with Citigroup Investment Research.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

A question on the backlog. I heard you mentioned several times that it's strong, and then you just have
a clarification that it built in fiscal '19 as well as fiscal '20. So the question is, are you at a point where
the backlog is now, this most recent quarter that you just reported, starting to work down? Or was it still
growing? And the duration of work down, is it kind of 2 or 3 quarters? But you just said in fiscal '19, it was
building also. So I'm just trying to figure out the dynamics of the variable of the backlog.

Neil P. Dougherty

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2020

Yes. So obviously, Jim, we've been a growing business here for a number of years, and so we -- it's not
-- we would expect that our backlog would be growing in absolute terms just given the overall growth of
the business. I think, if you look -- what you saw in Q4 was pretty much a reduction in the rate of growth
of that backlog, right? We built very significant backlog in Q2 and Q3, as I previously referenced, kind
of abnormal levels of backlog because shipments were depressed because of the factory shutdown and
reramp. In Q3, while our book-to-bill was over 1, it was just a tick over 1, right? So we were more or less
in a neutral position in the fourth quarter.

And so as I think about going into next year, we have this backlog that is -- particularly focused on kind of
the abnormal amount of backlog build where we've got to get product delivered to customers.

And I think on a positive note, really, when we were in the process of building that backlog in Q2 and
Q3, while orders remained strong, because our customers' businesses were disrupted, we weren't in a
situation where they were really pounding on the door saying, in most cases, we need immediate delivery
of this product. And we really saw that tick up in the fourth quarter, which is what drove the revenues
north of $1.2 billion. And I think it's that dynamic of our customers now looking to take delivery of that
backlog that was built in the Q2, Q3 timeframe that is going to be the predominant driver of revenue for
the next couple of quarters.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And just housekeeping for the stock buyback, is it meant to just keep share count relatively flat and offset
dilution? Or is it actually meant to bring the share count down?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Well, I'd say a couple of things about that. So first of all, obviously, we've made a commitment to, at
least at a minimum, be anti-dilutive with our buyback programs, and we will continue to do that. But
just as you saw with us in Q4, and frankly, over the course of FY '20, we will be opportunistic when those
approach, right? And so we were very pleased to take 4.3 million shares off the market at an average
price somewhere around $96 this year, bring the share count down.

And so when we see those windows, we'll certainly do that. But at a bare minimum, you can count on us
to keep the share count constant. We did say in our prepared remarks that we expect to -- in FY '21, our
share count to be 188 million shares, which is flat. So that's what -- that's our base case we're modeling.

When I think about capital use, priorities for capital beyond share repurchase, we continue to have an
active M&A funnel development process. We continue to look for ways to put money to work through M&A
and assets that are accretive to growth, accretive to gross margin, much like the acquisition that we did
of Eggplant at the end of last quarter. So no real change to our capital allocation priorities at this point in
time.

I wanted to ask a quick question on the semiconductor business. That's been strong now for a few
quarters. I'm just curious to get your view of where we are in that process node transition cycle. And as
we're looking out into in '21, how we should think about that, that semi business performing for you as
we're going into next year?

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2020

Yes, I'll make some comments, and maybe Mark can also chime in on the forward-looking demand. I
would say that we had a very strong year for the semi business, and it's been driven by the growth in
the 5G devices and the high-performance computing needs that have proliferated, especially due to folks
working remotely and working from home environment. And we've also captured and capitalized on the
China IC spend. Our position in that -- in the semi business is highly differentiated, and we continue
to track the node sizes from 7 to 5. And now, new activity starting for 3 nanometer. So we're highly
differentiated there, and I'll hand it off to Mark to make some comments on forward-looking demand.

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. What I would add is that the leading demand, as Satish talked about, is continuing, and the length of
the process of retooling the fabs is a very long one. So we're involved in relatively long sales cycles that
involve both the process nodes and new technologies like with extreme ultraviolet lithography, and we
see those opportunities continuing to drive into next year. We see continued investments in China as well
as other parts around the world, including the United States with the chips program that was announced
several months ago.

So the bottom line is we could see some market constraints coming in the next couple of quarters, but we
see continuing demand for our process solutions to support these next-generation technologies.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then maybe, Neil, just a quick follow-up on the gross margin strength here. How much of that,
I guess, is mix-related? Is it a function of that continuing growth in the recurring software piece of the
business? As we look out into next year, I guess, what's the right sort of level-setting for that given some
of the strength we've seen, even with some of the challenges that you had through this fiscal year?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Sorry. Let me repeat that because I realized my mic was off. We continue to be very pleased with the
progress that we're making on gross margin. And really, there's a lot that goes into that. First of all, I'd
start with software content, right? During this year, our software business continued to grow -- outgrow
the broader company. And so we continue to see nice growth in software, and we continue to make great
progress in the conversion of the way our customers buy software from us towards more time-based
purchasing. So we actually saw our annualized recurring revenue grow in the high teens during FY '20. So
that's helpful.

We're making great progress, I talked about this last quarter, in our services margin portfolio. That's a
below-average gross margin business for us. But on the operating line, we have our services business now
north of 20% which had been our long-term goal, and a lot of that improvement has come on the gross
margin line.

And then I would talk about our migration towards selling complete solutions across the entire portfolio,
right? As we migrate to those complete solutions, they tend to be more highly differentiated, and we can
monetize that differentiation.

And so you couple that with the strength that we're seeing -- the strengthening we're seeing in the
markets over the last couple of quarters, I mean, I think we're very pleased with the way orders -- the
strength of orders, really through the entire cycle of this year, but the strengthening in Q4, the broad
indications of macro recovery across large portions of our portfolio and large geographies around the world
as, I think, very favorable as we look into FY '20 -- excuse me, FY '21.

Neil, just a quick one. You alluded to a 2-year CapEx program, I think, to modernize some plants. First
part, is that growth-oriented or cost-oriented? And should we expect a similar kind of $170 million to $180
million in fiscal '22?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. It's a 2-year program. So I'm envisioning, obviously, we're still a year away. But FY '22, I think, will
be similar from a CapEx perspective. And we've essentially got some facility up. I would call it just kind
of resiliency of our supply chain. We have some facility upgrades we need to do. In other cases, we're
looking to get some alternative sourcing sites for some specialized productions for diversification purposes,
those types of activities, to just make sure that our supply chain is secure.

The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

The company mentioned COVID-19 as 1 of the factors behind the muted seasonality this coming year.
Can you elaborate a bit more on that? Now that we've unfortunately seen some increasing cases in
many countries, are you seeing any customers or geographies where there's actually some pushouts and
schedules that have been occurring? Or are you more raising this as a potential risk we should be mindful
about?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

No. I think it's just broad uncertainty, right? Nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, and it's -- the
question about seasonality, typically, we see plus or minus a couple of points. As we move from quarter-
to-quarter, you can go look at the history and see what that is. And all I'm -- we're saying 2 things: one,
you've got this kind of broad overarching uncertainty around COVID; and then we've got this backlog burn
that's going to be happening, and we think those are going to kind of more or less drown out the typical
seasonality that we would see in a current year. So we're expecting a much more steady revenue flow over
the course of the next several quarters.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And just a follow-up question on the geopolitical issues that Keysight's been dealing
with in the China market. And we discussed Huawei already on this call. But can you talk about any
other customers where perhaps you've been doing business with? And as there's been some increase in
sanctions even beyond Huawei. I know that had created some potential risk for tech companies. And is
there any business you may be doing separate from Huawei that you think could potentially come under
additional restrictions that we need to be thinking about or maybe already has?

Neil P. Dougherty
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So I don't -- I'll let Mark comment on that as well. I mean I think we're a couple of years now into
this kind of ongoing back and forth around trade restrictions, and I will tell you that we've weathered it
very well. Our business in China continues to do very well. And so whether you're talking about the initial
tariffs or companies added to the restricted party list or the situations with ZTE and Huawei, we've been
through a lot of these things, and our China business continues to grow. We have a very broad portfolio,
we have a very broad customer set, the types of things that Keysight does as a company is very well
aligned with what's happening in China. And so I just think that -- and Mark mentioned it, we've been

very good at redirecting our own internal sales and other resources to where the market opportunities are.
Mark, I don't know if you have anything that you want to add to that.

Mark Wallace
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. So Mark, I would just reiterate that we've already pivoted with the most recent regulations. And as
a matter of fact, there were earlier ones back in June that was tied to the military end-use customers in
China and Russia and Venezuela that we also endured, and we made some changes associated with that.
So we're closely monitoring this thing. We'll continue to be 100% compliant, as we always are. And we
have built a core capability to pivot quickly and go after the additional business that's available to us. And
as Neil just pointed out, for many, many quarters, we've been very successful in doing so.
