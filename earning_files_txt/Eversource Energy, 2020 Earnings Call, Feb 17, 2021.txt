Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Eversource Energy Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020 Results
Conference. My name is Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Please note
this conference is being recorded.

And I will now turn it over to Jeffrey Kotkin. You may begin, sir.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's
Vice President for Investor Relations.

During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website. And as you can see
on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined
within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are
subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and
projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.

Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in
our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our Form 10-Q for the 3
months ended September 30, 2020. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-
GAAP measures and how those measures reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release
and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K.

Speaking today will be Jim Judge, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice
President and CFO. Also joining us today are Werner Schweiger, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer;
Joe Nolan, our EVP for Strategy and Customer and Corporate Relations; John Moreira, our Treasurer and
Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory; and Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.

Now I will turn to Slide 2 and turn over the call to Jim.

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for a review of 2020 results and our
updated long-term outlook. First, let me say, I hope that all is well with you and your families at what's
been a challenging year for everyone.

I'll start my comments by thanking more than 9,000 Eversource Energy colleagues for their exceedingly
high work in extraordinary difficult circumstances in 2020. Not only did they had to deal with the first
pandemic to strike the country in more than a century, but they also had to address the highest level
of storm activity ever for our company as well as the hottest summer on record in large parts of our
service territory. Through it all, they worked safely and professionally, keeping their fellow workers and
our customers first in mind.

As you can see on Slide 4, despite 107 major and minor storms that struck our service territory in 2020,
we successfully executed our $3 billion capital program. These expenditures are critical to enhance the
resilience of our energy and water delivery systems as well as to connect new customers and to support
state clean energy initiatives.

2020 was also a year during which we advanced a number of our strategic initiatives. At the end of
February, we executed an agreement with NiSource to buy its Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets, and
we closed on that acquisition in early October, just 7 months later.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

The acquisition added about 5% to our regulated business and has been extremely well received by state
policymakers and by the more than 330,000 customers that Eversource Gas company of Massachusetts
now serves. We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive in 2021 and progressively more
accretive in the years ahead, as we steadily increase our level of investment in the Eversource Gas
system. Phil will profile some of these investments shortly.

Over the past 12 months, we also moved ahead on the permitting of our 3 offshore wind projects, and we
are developing strategies to meet our industry-leading target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030.

On the financial side, we achieved balanced outcomes in rate cases affecting our 2 operating companies
that have struggled in recent years to earn their wild returns. And we also maintained that track record,
dating back to the 2012 merger that created Eversource of posting attractive earnings and dividend
growth.

Turning to Slide 5. You can see some of the very solid operating metrics that we achieved in 2020 despite
the unprecedented challenges of COVID and incessant storm activity. I am extremely proud of the
operating record our employees achieved on behalf of our customers.

Slide 6 illustrates what we're able to achieve on behalf of our shareholders. 2020 was far from the best
year for utilities, as you know, but we were able to achieve a 4.5% total return for our shareholders,
keeping us in the top tier of our EEI peers in the short, medium and long term. Medium and longer-term
returns also compared favorably to the S&P 500. A key element in achieving that long-term return record
is our steady and attractive dividend growth.

As you can see on Slide 7, last week, the Eversource Board increased the quarterly dividend by
approximately 6.2%. You can also see that our payout ratio remains at about 62%, a relatively
conservative level that allows about $500 million of our earnings to be invested in our delivery systems
each year. We continue to target dividend growth to be in line with earnings growth, which continued in
2020 at a roughly 6% pace.

As you can see on Slide 8, we expect that growth rate to be enhanced in the coming years by our
Eversource Gas acquisition and our offshore wind investments. The math associated with the acquisition is
quite straightforward. Adding Eversource Gas increased our total regulated rate base by about 5%. And to
finance it, we only added about 1.8% to our outstanding share count.

Since we already operate natural gas and electric utilities adjacent to the Eversource Gas service territory,
there are considerable opportunities to bring our high level of service and strong safety culture to arduous
customers. Phil will discuss the impact on our capital program in a moment.

I'll now turn to our long-term strategy of being a principal catalyst for greenhouse gas reductions in New
England. Slide 9 shows how far we, as a company, have come over the past 30 years as we have divested
all of our fossil generation, continue to reduce methane leaks from our distribution system and taken other
steps to improve the efficiency of our delivery systems, our facilities and our vehicles. This has enabled us
to be in sync with all of the states of New England, which are targeting greenhouse gas reductions within
their borders of at least 80% by the year 2050. Our long-term strategy is built around being a principal
enabler of that reduction.

While our company operations are not a significant contributor to our state's greenhouse gas emissions
today, we have set a goal of driving our direct emissions to net 0. The left side of Slide 10 highlights our 5
primary areas of focus in that effort.

More significant to the region are the items on the right side. Over their lifetime, the more than $500
million that we invested in customers' energy efficiency initiatives in 2019 alone will reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 3.2 million metric tons. Efforts to significantly expand our 0 emissions vehicle
charging infrastructure and reduce the number of homes heated with oil offer very significant additional
opportunities to reduce the region's emissions. But the most significant initiative we have underway is our
partnership with Ørsted that we expect to result in at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind facilities
being built up the coast of Massachusetts. That will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 6
million tons annually.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

The current status of our offshore wind efforts are noted on Slide 11. As you can see, our South Fork
project received a strapped environmental impact statement and comments on that draft are due next
week. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management continues to target January 2022, for issuing a
decision on South Fork's construction and operations plan. And assuming a positive decision, we continue
to target in-service date by the end of 2023.

I should note that all the steps in the South Fork review process have been met either on or ahead of
schedule since long established its revised schedule last summer.

On the state side, New York hearings on South Fork were completed in December, and we expect a state
siting decision in the first half of 2021. And on the local side, our Host Community Agreement with the
Municipality in East Hampton has been approved.

On Revolution Wind, we filed our state siting application with Rhode Island at the end of December and
was formally docketed last month. We filed our federal application with BOEM in March of last year and
expect BOEM to establish a review schedule for revolution later this year.

On Sunrise, we filed our application with BOEM in September, and our state siting application with the
New York Public Service Commission in the fourth quarter. Later this year, we expect BOEM to establish a
review schedule for Sunrise Wind.

Our partnership with Ørsted has never been stronger, and we continue to work closely on both the siting
and procurement for the projects we have won and our bids for additional contracts. While we were
disappointed that we did not win additional capacity in the latest New York RFP, we will remain very
disciplined in our bidding and know that there are likely to be several additional RFPs over the next 12
months, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts and possibly New York.

You can see on Slide 12 why we can be so disciplined with our bidding strategy. The 550 square miles
of ocean that we have on the long-term lease from the federal government are the closest to shore and
should be the least expensive to develop and maintain. Moreover, 1 lease costs us $1 million, areas that
are smaller and much further from shore released a few years ago for $135 million apiece.

This slide shows the current status of megawatts 1 and megawatts still to be bid among the 4 states
where we compete. And the number of megawatts being sought will continue to rise with pending
legislation in Massachusetts likely adding another 2,400 megawatts to the states already approved 1,600
megawatts of upcoming RFPs.

President Biden continues to express strong support for renewable energy in general and offshore wind
specifically. On January 28, President issued an executive order requiring the Department of Interior to
conduct a full assessment of offshore wind siting processes so they are aligned with the administration's
goals to advance renewable energy production.

The President has also established a White House Office on domestic climate policy and created a federal
government-wide task force to coordinate actions between agencies. Additionally, actions taken by the
Congress and the IRS late last year provide additional financial incentives for offshore wind development.

As you can see on Slide 13, those incentives include 30% investment tax credits for projects that
commenced construction before January 2026 with a 10-year safe harbor on projects eligible for tax
credits. Taken together, these changes add more certainty to the tax benefits available for offshore wind
and underscore the federal government's support for these projects.

Lastly, before I turn it over to Phil, I want to emphasize the strong strategic position of Eversource for the
coming years. Our corporate strategy is fully aligned with the energy policy of the states we serve. Our
execution continues to be extremely strong, and our employees and Board of trustees are fully engaged.

Last week, our Board's Corporate Governance committee became the Governance, Environmental
and Social Responsibility committee with additional direct [ channel ] oversight responsibilities for our
expanding ESG initiatives.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Five years ago, we said we wanted to be viewed as the country's premier energy company, and some of
the citations noted on Slide 4 (sic) [ 14 ] illustrate the recognition that we've received from a number of
well-regarded third parties. I'm very confident that our future remains exceedingly bright.

Now I'll turn the call over to Phil.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and I'll be covering several topics: our 2020 financial results,
I'll be discussing our 2021 guidance, our long-term growth rate, our capital investment plan and recent
regulatory developments.

So starting with a quick review of our full year results, our GAAP earnings were $3.55 per share, excluding
$0.09 per share of transaction costs associated with our October purchase of assets of Columbia Gas --
I should say that's including the $0.09 of transaction costs. Excluding those costs, we earned $3.64 per
share in 2020, consistent with consensus and with guidance we gave you a year ago.

Slide 16 summarizes both the year and fourth quarter. Electric distribution earnings totaled $1.60 per
share in 2020, up $0.01 per share from 2019. Higher distribution revenues were largely offset by higher
O&M, depreciation, property tax expense, interest costs and dilution.

The higher O&M was primarily attributable to record storm expense as a result of more than 100 major
and minor storm events that affected our 3 electric service territories last year. Non-deferred storm
expense totaled nearly $77 million and was the highest level we've experienced in recent years in each
of the 3 states we serve. These nondeferrable storm costs totaled $0.17 per share in 2020, compared
with an average of about $0.10 per share in -- if you look at the years 2016 through 2019 average. It
particularly impacted the fourth quarter of 2020 when it was responsible for an incremental $0.05 per
share in O&M compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.

Electric transmission earnings totaled $1.48 per share in 2020, up from $1.43 per share in 2019,
excluding the Northern Pass charge. The benefit of increased investment in our transmission system was
partially offset by dilution there.

I should note that 2020 was a very successful year for our transmission segment, placing into service
more than $1 billion of investment, including 3 major projects we've been working on for several years.
They were the Greater Hartford and Greenwich substation projects in Connecticut and the Seacoast
project in New Hampshire.

Transmission capital expenditures totaled $964 million in 2020, up a bit compared with our projection that
we had a year ago, which was $910 million of investment. Our natural gas distribution business earned
$0.40 per share in 2020 compared with $0.30 per share in 2019. Much of that improvement occurred in
the fourth quarter as a result of the addition of Eversource Gas company of Massachusetts. Eversource
Gas of Mass earned nearly $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Our water segment earned $0.12 per share in 2020, with earnings up $6.3 million from 2019. Much of the
improvement was due to small gains associated with the sale of our Hingham, Massachusetts system and
the sale of a small parcel of property.

Earnings from the parent and other companies totaled $0.04 per share in 2020, excluding $0.09 per share
of acquisition-related costs compared to earnings of $0.02 per share in 2019. The improvement was due
to a number of factors, including a lower effective tax rate in 2020 compared with 2019.

From 2020 results, I'll turn to our 2021 guidance. As you can see on Slide 17, we project earnings per
share of between $3.81 and $3.93, excluding certain costs we were incurring to transition our new natural
gas franchise into the Eversource system. Key drivers include several distribution rate adjustments that
were effective in 2020 or the first quarter of 2021. They also include the benefit from our transmission
construction program, which I'll discuss shortly, as well as a full year earnings from Eversource Gas of
Massachusetts.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Offsetting these benefits will be higher depreciation and property taxes, which results from the significant
upgrades to our energy and water delivery systems to better serve our customers.

We'll also have a higher average share count in the first half of 2021, as a result of the shares we issued in
March to close out our equity forward and in June to finance the Columbia Gas acquisition.

In terms of O&M, you should expect the numbers we will report, you'll see, will be higher because of the
addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. On a normalized basis, though, we expect O&M will remain
relatively stable during the entire forecast period.

Our long-term growth will be driven by the investments we make to modernize and harden our system,
to serve our customers and to support clean energy policies of the states we serve. Our updated core
business 5-year capital plan is shown on Slide 18. It shows projected investments of $17 billion over the
5-year period compared with $14.2 billion a year ago. There are many changes from the forecast we
provided you a year ago, but the most significant is adding Eversource Gas of Massachusetts.

Slide 19 reviews the capital forecast changes by segment during the '21 through 2024 period, which is
the years that are common to both forecasts. The transmission segment accounts for $528 million of the
increased investment during that 4-year period. There are number of drivers here.

Unlike many of our past forecasts, increased transmission investment is not being driven by large regional
projects. Many of those were completed in 2020 on or below budget. In the coming years, there will
be more, I'd say, bite size. We'll be replacing equipment that was installed 60 or more years ago that
has reached the end of its life expectancy and is vulnerable to more frequent and severe storms we're
experiencing in New England. We are making these types of investments as well as investments in cyber,
physical security and other areas across our service territory.

On the electric distribution side, we need to continue to upgrade our facilities to ensure that the reliability
gains we've experienced in recent years are continued. Additionally, new legislation that passed the House
and Senate in Massachusetts last month is expected to provide NSTAR Electric with an opportunity to build
280 megawatts of new rate-based solar generation. We expect the legislation will be enacted and have
included $500 million of solar investment in our forecast.

For the natural gas segment, the continued replacement of aging infrastructure in the form of steel, bare
steel or cast iron pipe with a safer more durable plastic remains a key component of our natural gas CapEx
plan. The appendix includes a slide that presents the Eversource Gas capital investment forecast separate
from that of the entire natural gas distribution business so you can better model and understand our
newest subsidiary.

And for the water segment, our capital plan increased due to CapEx required for ongoing main
replacements, treatment facilities and supply of improvements in Southwest Connecticut.

On Slide 20, we show the impact on rate base compared -- comparing our actual rate base at the end of
2019 with our projected rate base at the end of 2025. Our rate base CAGR over those years, including
the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts is projected to be 8% compared with just under 7% we
showed you last year.

We expect EPS growth to be in the upper half of the previously announced 5% to 7% CAGR range. The
higher growth outlook is primarily due to Eversource Gas earnings. This acquisition was immediately
accretive, and we expect it will be incrementally accretive each year through the 5-year forecast period,
as we migrate off of NiSource systems and increasingly apply Eversource best practices to our newest
operating company.

There are a number of investment opportunities that would significantly benefit our customers but are not
reflected in the plans because there's still some uncertainty around their scope and timing. So Slide 21
highlights many of these. As we get clarity of these opportunities, we'll update our subsequent forecast.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

In Connecticut, PURA is moving along on a number of grid modernization dockets, but there are no final
outcomes at this time. Implementing AMI solely for our Connecticut and Massachusetts electric customers
would involve an investment of approximately $800 million, but none of that sum is in the forecast.

Additionally, Massachusetts and Connecticut have a commitment to have at least 425,000 electric vehicles
on the road by 2025. There's only a fraction of that level currently on the road and -- but we are only
including a limited amount of investment in electric vehicle charging stations in our plan, approximately
$15 million a year.

Two weeks ago, Massachusetts regulators approved extending our recent level of grid modernization
investment through the end of this year. In mid-2021, we'll file our new 3-year grid modernization plan
in Massachusetts. Additionally, we are now thoroughly reviewing the Eversource Gas of Massachusetts
system since we have an obligation to identify the capital investment needs and report that to our
regulators by September 1, 2021. As a result of that review, incremental investments may be identified.

Finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, BOEM's schedules for a review of the Revolution Wind and Sunrise
projects are expected this year. I expect that in next February's update, we'll have enough clarity to roll
these offshore wind outlooks into our base forecast, especially since the Biden administration stated a
desire to accelerate offshore wind development. But to be clear, in our CAGR guidance today, we reflect no
earnings contribution from offshore wind.

From our forecast, I will turn to current regulatory items. 2020 was marked by achieving balanced
outcomes in 3 rate reviews that are highlighted on Slide 22. Public service of New Hampshire and NSTAR
Gas have been under-earning their allowed returns in recent years, but both companies were able to
complete lengthy rate reviews towards the end of 2020 with new multiyear plans.

NSTAR Gas was also able to implement performance-based rate making similar to that of NSTAR Electric.
We expect NSTAR Gas to continue without a base rate review for up to a decade. Also in October,
Massachusetts regulators approved an 8-year rate settlement in connection with our acquisition of the
Eversource Gas assets, formerly known as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts.

With small rate changes in November of '21 and November of '22 and additional rate resets in 2024 and
2027, based on our investments in the system, we don't expect Eversource Gas to undergo a full base
case review before 2028. So not in the rate arena for several years.

At Public Service of New Hampshire in addition to the permanent rate increase that took effect January
1, the settlement approved in December by regulators allows 3 additional distribution rate changes to
cover certain resiliency investments. The first of those changes took place last month and resulted in an
additional $10 million of annual revenue for PSNH to reflect investments that were made in 2019.

The next rate resets in August of 2021 and again in August of 2022 will reflect investments during the
2020 and 2021 periods, respectively. We do not expect to file any general rate reviews in 2021. The next
review of Connecticut Light & Power rates would not commence -- would need to commence no later than
the first quarter of 2022 under the Connecticut statute that requires rates to be reviewed every 4 years for
electric and natural gas distribution companies.

As you know, we have a large number of other dockets in Connecticut, some of which stem from tropical
storm Isaias, and subsequent legislation that passed in September of 2020 in a special session. We've
listed several of the dockets on a slide in the appendix to help you understand which PURA inquiries cover
which topics.

From state regulatory reviews, I'll turn now to FERC. Many of the specifics concerning the new England
ROE cases are shown on Slide 23. We do not know when these cases will be decided. At this time,
pursuant to FERC directive, the transmission owners in New England continue to build their customers
based on the 2014 ROE decision in the first complaint or Complaint I, that was later vacated by the DC
Circuit Court of Appeals. And we continue to record transmission earnings based on that decision, that is
a base ROE of 10.57%, an RTO adder for the vast majority of our facilities of 50 basis points and an ROE
cap of 11.74% on all transmission investments in New England.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Turning to our expected financings. In 2021, we have about $1 billion of debt that comes due during the
year, primarily at the Eversource parent or NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and we expect to refinance all of
these maturities.

We will continue to fund our dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs with treasury
shares, raising about $100 million a year -- each year over the forecast period. In 2019 and 2020, we
issued just over 1 million treasury shares through these programs. Additionally, we continue to expect
that over the next several years, we'll issue about $700 million of equity through an at-the-market-style
program. We will continue to evaluate the timing of such equity issuances based on market conditions, our
investment program and credit metrics.

Finally, turning to Slide 24. We know that investors are primarily focused on future earnings and cash
flow when evaluating investments. However, I mean, I also believe that a company's track record of
performance must be considered in evaluating the credibility of these future forecasts.

As you can see on this slide, we have a very strong track record of accomplishing what we say. When
our merger closed nearly 9 years ago, we said we would improve reliability, achieve a high level of safety
performance, control our costs, support our communities and our region's sustainability initiatives, invest
in the future and provide very competitive earnings and dividend growth.

As you can see on this slide, we have been successful in each of these areas and we're confident we can
accomplish the very ambitious goals we've set for ourselves over the coming years, delivering for all of our
stakeholders, including achieving the carbon neutrality by 2030.

Thanks again for joining today, and I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Phil. And I'm going to return the call to Brandon, just to remind you how to enter questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Brandon. Our first question this morning is from Shar Pourreza From Guggenheim.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a couple of questions to start off. Just one clarifying question on the growth rate on Slide 8, when the
larger offshore wind projects start to kick in. When you obviously state higher than 5% to 7% growth, are
we inferring that we could see a step change in the growth rate to maybe, let's say, 6% to 8% or simply
a higher rebase that year and you would retain your 5% to 7%? And do you have any sense on when you
might be adding these projects to your plan, I think you're obviously waiting for the review schedules from
BOEM to solidify the CODs.

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Shar, the reduced schedule will obviously give us some certainty and definitions in terms of the
spending profile and the earnings profile. But yes, the expectation is that we will have higher growth as
those projects kick in beyond 2025. So we're not sort of resetting or providing guidance as to what that
looks like right now, but it clearly will be an incremental contributor to our earnings growth out in the late
'20s.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. So basically a step change in the growth rate. Okay. Got it. And then just taking a look at your
planned investments at GMA, you point to $270 million in CapEx annually there, which is, I think, more
than double the amount of capital that NiSource was investing in the system. What's sort of driving
the increased CapEx? Is it just more safety and reliability? And just remind us if you need any sort of
regulatory approvals for the spend?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

The regulatory approval to the extent that capital trackers are in place is the norm, but the spending
level is more than -- historically has been spent there, but it's our assessment to bring the safety and
performance of the infrastructure to the stage that the other Eversource Gas companies have been able to
achieve will require that type of investment in the system.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

I could add just a couple -- just a little color there, too, is that, as you know, this was an asset purchase,
not sort of a purchase of the company. So we're -- some of the things where we do have some
incremental maybe IT technology types of spend to move over to Eversource systems in the past, and
we certainly spend and continue to spend on our gas safety enhancement program. That's the largest
category of spending in that business.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Got it. And then just lastly for me. Obviously, you highlight there's a couple more RFPs coming this year,
rely on Massachusetts in New York. Just given the bids we've seen from, obviously, some of the oil majors,
it may be difficult to be successful so -- but you still do have a lot of excess lease capacity. So can you
maybe just elaborate a little bit more on your strategy with the lease areas? Do you sit on your leases
until the other leases sort of are filled, which could take years or would you look to potentially monetize
some of the space there? So maybe just, Jim, if you could just elaborate a little bit more around the
strategy around those leases?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. The strategy has been consistently one of financial discipline. As I've told my Board and I've actually
presented to the Ørsted Board in the past that they should expect us to lose as many RFPs as we win
because we're intent on having these warrants to be profitable. So we're excited about the increasing
demand. It seems like every couple of months, the numbers go up in terms of the state's appetite for this.
And when we look at our situation, we have plenty of dry powder for those bids. I think it could be one,
but I think our leases are undersubscribed compared to the others that are starting to fill up with their
existing portfolio of contracts.

So we will continue to be disciplined, and we're optimistic that the appetite is there for a significant
buildout of offshore wind. So I think we're in a very good position.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question this morning is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to start off with the offshore wind here, and wanted to see if you might be able to help us.
How much offshore wind can you fit on the leases using the new 13-megawatt turbines versus the 8-
megawatts turbines originally discussed?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, I'll take a shot at that, and others could add. But fundamentally, we've been talking about the lease
capacity as being 4,000 megawatts historically. When you increase the capacity of the turbines from
what was an 8-megawatt turbine to 11, and as you mentioned, potentially 13 going forward, obviously,
that increases your capacity. At the same time, we have agreed to spacing of the turbines as part of the
compromises to get the approval process at BOEM, when we're spacing the mile up between each turbine.
So that actually reduces your potential capacity.

So net-net, we are saying it's at least 4,000 megawatts, and we expect it to -- we expect to fully build it
out at that level, more than 4,000 megawatts is what the guidance we're giving.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Understood. At least 4,000. That's helpful. And just want to turn over to CLP for a quick minute
here. The CLP rate case reopening appears really focused on low-income rate structures from what we
can see, making it kind of a very low-risk event in our minds. It look like this to you or are we missing
something here? Just any color you could provide would be great.

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. The guidance that we've seen is that there will be looking at new rate designs, including possible low-
income or economic development rates and it may require a possible interim rate reduction. I think it's

important to recognize that we're not earning our allowed return in that franchise, and we're mandated
or required to commence with a full rate review actually within the next 12 months. I think it still mention
the first quarter of 2022, a full review is needed.

So our understanding -- our expectation is that any rate design changes that come out there would not
necessarily be punitive to the company, especially as we continue to underearn.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Our next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

I apologize in advance if I missed some comments on my -- related to my questions. But just I think on
the -- one of the first questions asked about the long-term growth rate with the offshore wind. And I
think you said, Jim, higher into the late 2020s. And not to be too picky, but just is that suggesting that
you're not really expecting the projects to fully come on until after mid-decade? Like should these projects
essentially beyond for 2025, I guess, is my question.

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean again, we're very hesitant, Steve, to commit to changing dates, especially since we think that
we'll shortly have guidance from the administration in terms of expected timelines. But what we've said
and continue to say is that South Fork, we hope that we expect to be in by the end of 2023. But it's clear
that revolution will not be by the end of 2023, and Sunrise Wind is not expected to be by the end of '24.
So there's some slippage there.

The full impact of the offshore wind projects, especially the big ones, clearly, a mid-'20s event and ITC
kicks in there as well. So we're not talking about the waste here. It's just the map of a project that comes
in during the year. You don't get the full benefit of it until a full calendar year, the next year. So I don't
want to read more into my comments than that and step up.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Okay. No worries on that. And I guess it doesn't matter as much anyway, given the ITC extension and
safe harbors and stuff. And just maybe on that, I mean, is there -- I know there's a lot of moving parts
when you look at the economics of the projects you've done, but would you characterize the ITC order as
kind of improving the economics overall from what you had expected before?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Certainly -- significantly [ approved ] based upon what we're assuming for ITC at the time of our
bids. As you mentioned, there's a lot of puts and takes, you have costs that go up and down. And so we're
encouraged that the ITC amount is the level that it's at now. And more importantly, the 10-year window,
I think, derisks quite a bit. The say that some might have that ITC level was vulnerable. So we see it as
certainly as a major positive.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. And then lastly, on the Connecticut rate review that's going on, and I recognize that it's not kind of
full rates and the like. I just -- I guess, I'm -- I don't really know how the size of these issues, like what
the basis would be to set any of these interim rates or other things? Or like do you have any idea how
they would even calculate what to do? What would the basis be?

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Chairman, President & CEO

I don't. I mean there are probably examples of low-income rates or economic development rates that
other states have implemented that they could look at as models. What I would say, Steve, is that we're
very early on, the early stages of this process. So it's hard for me to add any certainty there other than,
as I mentioned earlier, that we clearly are not earning our allowed return that we have agreed to under a
settlement that's been in place for 3 years now.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Our next question this morning is from Ryan Greenwald from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

It's Julien here. So maybe to follow-up in order here. Can you talk about the run rate level of contribution
from the offshore projects? I know that the timing is obviously moving around, and I know you just said
that there are lots of puts and takes. But in an effort to sidestep some of that debate, as best you see it
today, including the latest update, the ITC, how would you characterize that run rate level of net income
contribution, if you will?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And again, it's another way, Julien, I guess, to get at the question of providing guidance beyond our
forecast horizon here. So I don't want to publish a number until we have a pretty good visibility into the
annual cash flows and earnings profile of each of the projects.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Understood. And then...

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

What we have said is consistent on -- is that we anticipate these projects to provide mid-teens ROEs,
which would be sort of the highest of our business segments, which we feel is appropriate because they
are the riskier of the business segments in our portfolio.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. I appreciate the reaffirmation. On the balance sheet and equity, I just want to make sure I heard
you right because you made a couple of comments, and I think you didn't say specifically over what period
of time. So I think you said $700 million over the next several years. I just want to make sure I'm hearing
you very clearly about your equity needs and where it positions your balance sheet over the full 5-year
period, if I can ask more directly.

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, I'll ask Phil to answer that for you.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Great. I was going to jump in there, Jim. So Julien, the -- for the plan that we put out in terms of
the $17 billion capital forecast over the 5 years, the $700 million supports that plan along with the $100
million a year that we do through the dividend reinvestment and DRIP.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

So if you look -- if you add that up, that's $100 million a year through that and then $700 million through
a periodic at-the-market-type program. And what I suggested was that, that would be based upon what
market conditions look like, what our metrics are looking like, what our -- if there's changes in terms of
puts and takes in terms of the timing of the investment profile. So those would be the considerations. So it
would be sometime over the 5-year horizon.

I don't expect that it would be -- in 2021, I would expect that it would be in years other than 2021 in
terms of the $700 million. Obviously, we're doing the dividend reinvestment every year. So we'd have that
number. Does that clarify for you?

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe you can say slightly more definitively. This puts your metrics where from an FFO-to-debt
perspective, i.e., this should suffice to maintain your metrics at roughly the same level through the 5-year
outlook at that equity level or you're not...

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

That is correct. That is correct. We would be looking to target the metrics to support the current ratings
and where they are today.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. With the $700 million. All right. Sorry, I don't mean to overemphasize that. I just want to make sure
it's clear.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

No, that's fine.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Our next question this morning is from Angie Storozynski.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

So I just wanted to follow-up on the equity needs. So the delta between the rate base growth and the
earnings growth, that's purely about the equity dilution or there's some changes in realized ROEs as well?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

I'm not to -- say that again, Angie.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Because you're saying that the rate base is growing at 8%, right? And then you're saying the earnings
growth is the upper half of the 5% to 7%, right? So let's just say, 6.5%, right? So I'm trying to
understand it, the delta between 8% and then, say, 6.5% is solely a function of the equity dilution or is it
some, I don't know, assumed lower ROE or something to that effect?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

No. It's primarily the equity issuance would be the driver there. I mean, even for 2021, you have to keep
in mind that, as I mentioned in my comments, we closed out a forward contract in March, and then we
had additional shares that we issued in June. So all of those now get into a full year of 2021 that didn't
impact us in 2020. And then as we do the treasury shares and move in the $700 million that I discussed,
that would be the primary mechanism that would be causing the difference.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then on Columbia Gas, I'm sorry, I'm just going to keep calling it like that for now. Is it the
$275 million of CapEx, I understand that this is your current assessment that you're going to be working
on incremental CapEx updates. But can you give us a sense how big of a delta we could see there? Is
it doubling of the $275 million a year? Is it just some tweak to the current CapEx estimate that you'd
expect?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Well, that process, as I said, we are -- as part of the rate agreement that we had in -- with Massachusetts
when the deal got approved, in September of this year, we'll be filing a report that identifies that. So I'd
say it's a little premature to speculate on what that might look like.

In terms of sizing, we're certainly active in terms of looking at that right now. I'd say that we've not been
-- there's been no surprises in terms of taking the keys. We did it all remotely in a COVID environment,
but we did a very in-depth due diligence job. So no surprises there, but I'd say it's -- we're just not at the
final stages of that assessment so that I could give you a good answer.

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. The only thing I'd add is that, as Phil mentioned earlier, in that $275 million, we have some onetime
items over the next couple of years to fully integrate the shared service functions that are currently being
supported by a ISO transmission services agreement. So some of that spend in the next 2 years, in
particular, is really merger integration related.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Great. And if I may, just one last question. In the climate bill in Massachusetts, the latest version of it,
at least, I mean, it still talks about conversions of numerous houses to electric heat and then maybe
less aggressive, but still electric-driven construction in the state. How do you see it impacting both your
electric utility and gas utility in the state with -- I mean, it is a Republican Governor who seems to be
pushing for less natural gas connections for new build -- new construction?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think first of all, we -- both our gas and our electric business in the State of Massachusetts operate
under a decoupled rate regime. So to the extent volume goes up or down to an improved revenue level,
the biggest opportunity that we have in the State of Massachusetts is in the areas of transportation and
home-heating oil. More than 50% of the businesses and homes in Massachusetts heat with oil. And there's
a significant improvement, if you don't go to electric, but even go to gas, the emissions uptick on --
improvement, if you will, is significant. So I think we'll work with the state as we work with the other
states to make sure that we can aggressively decarbonize the supplies, but we're comfortable with where
that legislation is. And as Phil mentioned, one of the components allowance at the utility scale solar build-
out, and we're confident enough in it being there and that we're putting into our base forecast here for
this guidance.

Next question this morning is from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Two quick ones. First, maybe can you sort of what milestones should we watch for in terms of this rate
review in Connecticut, the low-income tariff that you mentioned? So what's -- what is the time line? And
what should we be sort of looking for in terms of calendar?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Jeff, I don't know, do you have any specifics there, the calendar on that proceed? I know we're early on in
the process.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. We put the docket up, but I don't think there's really any -- I mean, it's sort of open-ended right now.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just one quick clarification in terms of the -- I believe the decision is in
April on the storm investigation. Just what to expect there? And how are you sort of accounting for that in
your 2021 guidance numbers?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. The remaining schedule there is, I think, the applied briefs are actually due this week. I think, we
would expect the tentative decision about a month later, so mid-March. Written exceptions would probably
follow that a few weeks later. And then all arguments, maybe mid-April with the final decision on the 28th.

I think PURA is investigating the prudence of the costs. We're confident that the -- we assembled the
largest workforce ever in the State of Connecticut for that storm response. And the vast majority of the
costs that are being reviewed have to do with bringing in those external resources, either from other
utilities or from contractors. So we expect, as we have in the past, the cost recovery would be allowed for
these costs as they are prudent.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Ryan Levine from Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

A couple of questions. What percentage of the offshore wind CapEx do you expect to qualify for the ITC?
And are there any steps that the company can take to increase this in the coming months or years? And
then I guess the follow-up related to that is, how does that differ for some of the prospective projects that
you're looking to bid on?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

I'd ask Phil or John to provide any insights on that question.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Effectively, we would expect all or majority of the spending to qualify under the ITC provisions.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. I mean, I thought there was some component of that portion that's not considered offshore that
may not qualify in terms of the total CapEx deployed for the project, are you saying that 100% of the
CapEx is?

John M. Moreira
Senior VP & Treasurer

No. It's roughly -- it's kind of roughly about an 80-20 split. So you kind of look at the total CapEx, about
80% of that will be the offshore piece would qualify for the ITC.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. And there's no opportunity to move that 80% closer to 100%?

John M. Moreira
Senior VP & Treasurer

No. I mean, the rules are pretty clear in terms of what would qualify and what wouldn't. And so kind of
what it ties to as the onshore piece, obviously, wouldn't qualify. And so when you tie it to that onshore
piece, that's deemed onshore.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

And is that 80% statistic roughly apply to the prospective projects that you're looking to bid in the various
states?

John M. Moreira
Senior VP & Treasurer

I mean I think from a rule of thumb, it's probably safe. But again, it all kind of depends on how we look at
where we're going to land and how we look at kind of the profile that's out there with what we build in the
lease area.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Nick Lebrano from BMO Capital.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

It's James Thalacker, actually. Real quick question. Just, I guess, just confirming, it doesn't sound like the
equity needs that you are forecast, the $100 million of sort of treasury shares and then the $700 million
of incremental equity has really changed. I guess, as we think about the -- you've got a pretty large rate
base growth at the Columbia Gas business right now. Is part of the reason that your equity needs aren't
going up materially is because of the rider treatment you have there as well as the fixed rate increase that
you have embedded in the settlement?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'd say that we do have a number of, I'd call them, timely recovery tracker programs, not just that
Eversource Gas of Massachusetts but throughout the various subsidiaries, whether they be for accelerated
pipe replacement, for safety and pull replacements, things like that. So because of the timely tracker cash
recovery, that is very beneficial.

Next question is from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

A couple of quick ones. So I was just curious on offshore wind. To the extent there are items that
improved the economics like the higher ITC level or longer wind blades, would those benefits accrue to
yourselves or are there opportunities or chances that you would pass any of those back like in lower rates
within the contract mechanism or anything like that?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

The current contracts don't call for adjusting the pricing based upon changes like that.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Got it. Understood. And then a separate topic, I was curious, do you see any prospects for improved
acceleration in heat pump use in your states? Anything that's on the horizon that might change the
economics or be in favor of using more heat pumps to electrify space heating and potentially increase the
electric load going forward?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

We do have a pilot program that was approved in our NSTAR gas rate case. And so at this stage, I think
we're exploring what those pilots will tell us in terms of the long-term prospects up in our geography for
that technology.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I just want to follow-up on an earlier question, I think, it was Angie's question about that 8% rate base
CAGR and then the earnings guidance of 5% to 7%, I understand the equity component. It seems
like you've got good long-term rate plans in place, not a whole lot of regulatory risk on that side. Just
wondering if you could take us through some variables that might get you to the lower end of that range?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

There's a -- thanks, Travis, for your question. We talk about we're a regulated business. So certainly
regulatory outcomes have an impact on where you end up in any kind of earnings growth or annual range.
So outcomes of regulatory cases could move you higher or keep you in the middle or move you to a
different end of the range. Certainly, incremental investment opportunities, we've identified several of
them that are active now in terms of AMI or additional grid modernization and those are more things that
can take you to the higher end of the range.

Certainly, how you do as a company, any company does on their O&M management is important. And I
think you might agree that you can't really find anybody better there. They never source in controlling
costs. So certainly, if there's cost O&M pressure, that could move you around in the range. So I think
those are some of the bigger variables that could move you into different parts of the range, but we're
confident in where we are guiding to. We're confident in our ability to execute on our investment plans and
as well as run the business in a safe and efficient and effective manner.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then real quick on electric vehicle charging. If you look out over the 5 years, you
had mentioned a relatively small program you have now. What do you think about the upside potential in
terms of CapEx? And would we see that more in distribution or is there an opportunity to add transmission
in terms of large substations, et cetera, that would support EV?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

I think the benchmark, Travis, I mentioned is that I think there were only 1,400 charges in the State of
Massachusetts, and we're finishing up a 3-year program that brings that number up to 5,200. But the
targets in Connecticut and Massachusetts, both have for electric vehicles are quite ambitious. We have a
slide in here that shows that. So my expectation is that the investments will largely be in the distribution
system, I think, we'll be mindful about any potential impacts on transmission needs. But I think that would
be focus on distribution build-out for these charges, and I wouldn't expect any near-term transmission
needs created by that growth.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Certainly quickly, on the Connecticut, you guys mentioned that you don't think you're earning your ROE
and stuff. And I was just wondering, I know, last year, you guys obviously had challenges with storms and
stuff. But if we would look like on sort of this level, I mean, 2021, I know you're not giving guidance for
sub. But just sort of roughly speaking, what kind of ROE or return range do you guys sort of expect to be
in for 2021 in Connecticut?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Paul, this is Phil. The -- we're -- our last filed -- we filed sort of on the quarters in Connecticut was about
8.6%. We're allowed 9.25%. So we're certainly below the allowed return in the settlement that we had.
So that -- we'll be finalizing the year. I don't expect it to change dramatically, but that was our last filed
number in Connecticut.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

But does that have the storms and stuff in there or is that sort of a normalized number?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as you probably know that most of the storm costs for Isaias were deferred because there's triggers
that if you're above $4 million in Connecticut, you defer the cost. So we'll be disclosing -- there's about
$228 million of deferred storm costs. So those wouldn't affect it. So it's not an abnormally low number
because of that.

In addition, as I mentioned and Jim mentioned, we had 100-plus other storms, and some of those don't
trigger a deferral. So those would impact all franchise -- all electric franchise ROEs.

Okay. That's great. That's helpful. And then also just on the CLP transmission CapEx, 2021 and 2022
seemed like they jumped a lot over your last forecast. And I was sort of wondering if there's anything to
call out on that? I mean, you guys mentioned you're not doing any large projects really or it's mostly sort
of nuts and bolts, it sounds like. I was just wondering if there's anything in particular that -- I mean, that
seems to be one of the bigger moves in the slide deck.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

I'm not -- actually, I think the projected transmission capital is decreasing at CL. There's some larger
expenditures or you could say, larger in '21, but then those sort of decline. Is that the chart you're looking
at, Paul?

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Well, I think it's on -- when I look at the chart, it look to me when I was doing a comparison that from
2021 and maybe it went from $209 million to $443 million. And for 2022, $184 million to $264 million.
I can follow-up later. I mean, I'm not -- I don't -- but that's what I -- it just looked like to me like there
was a -- it could be timing too or something, I don't know. Anyway, I just -- I was wondering if there's
anything in particular.

And then finally, on the offshore wind, given what we've seen in Texas and what have you, and I apologize
for not knowing this, but I was just wondering, just in terms of how these contracts work, if there was
some issue with not being able to provide power, is there -- I mean, do you have to go in the spot market
and make it up or do you just simply not get paid for the power that you have delivered? Or I just wanted
to sort of get a sense as to how it works since basically, what -- but maybe think about this, of course, is
what we're seeing in Midwest and stuff?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I guess from what I understand about the Texas and what they're struggling with. I think the
problems stem from the financial structure for power generation that really doesn't often the many
incentives to -- the power plant operators to prepare for the winter. They have an electric rig that put an
emphasis on sheet prices over reliable service. In New England, as you know, we have a robust capacity
market where the ISO box inadequate supplies to maybe 4 or 5 years out.

And in terms of the people talking about wind, from what I understand, the impact on the thermal plants,
the wind frees up that they the deal with, I think, either the nuclear unit went down, but the gas plant
were probably 5 or 6x the load that was lost in wind. I think wind is only 10% of the load in Texas.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

I hear what you're saying. I'm not suggesting that there's some particular issue with it. I was just
wondering, though, if -- in terms of wind being kind of an intermittent resource, I'm just wondering, the
way the contract works, if for some reason, whatever it may be, you don't have the production that you
expected. Would that be something where you just simply don't get paid if that production isn't happening
or would you actually maybe be short, so to speak, and have to make up the difference. My assumption is
the former not the latter, but I just want to...

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it's the former. We get paid on a per [ production ] pay system. And so if we don't deliver it, we
wouldn't have the revenue stream coming in.

Next question is from Mike Weinstein from Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

A couple -- one more question on offshore wind. CEO of Total today came out and said that the IRRs on
offshore wind are very -- like most competitive than the entire renewable industry, 2% to 3% IRRs. Is that
something you guys are seeing as well in your analysis of your -- the project opportunities from Ørsted?
What do you see going forward?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Clearly, the competition has increased. And I think the latest evidence of that was the New York RFP
that I mentioned in my comments. And we continue to stay disciplined. I think people are bidding into this
for multiple reasons, very small returns, but maybe some branding uplift, I think, has appealed to some of
the players in the business now.

So as I mentioned, we'll continue to participate in the RFPs. We will get creative about our cost structure
going forward. More and more that the supply chain moves over to the U.S. from Europe, I think there are
cost advantages there. So we'll be continuing to be disciplined. 2% to 3% IRR is not something that we
would want to win, frankly in an RFP. We're still targeting that mid-teens ROE for our investors.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Right. And for the BOEM review schedule, I know -- I think in the slide deck, you said expected in 2021 for
both Revolution and Sunrise. I think previously, you had said early '21 for Revolution, but it looks like you
forgot the word early, is that intentional?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I don't think it's essential. I think it's recognizing that we're going to get more specifics on both of
those projects as new leadership of BOEM and the Department of Interior settle into their rates -- into
their roles rather. Clearly, the Biden administration is supportive of offshore wind and accelerating the
approval process. But you have the Department of Interior, I don't believe the proposed secretary has
been approved yet. We are encouraged by what we see as the new Head of BOEM. She actually came
out of the Home administration and is very familiar with the offshore wind solicitations that New York has
won. So yes, I wouldn't read much more into it other than new people, new roles. So we'll see what the
schedule is.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then for the EV and AMI dockets, is that -- I think you guys are expecting some comments in
March in those dockets? And also, is there any kind of interplay or are they dependent on getting this rate
review docket done first or are they completely independent?

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

I don't remember -- go ahead, Phil.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Go ahead, Jim. You finish in.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Yes. The -- I think the AMI is always early on in the process in terms of the calendar, but the electric
vehicle deployment hearing is going to take place on sharp proposals at the end of February, and we would
expect the decision in late March. I think they weren't totally separate from the other dockets that are on
the table.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

And that was the last question we had this morning. So thank you very much for joining us today. If you
have any follow-up questions, please call or send an email, and we'll get back to you. And have a good
day.

James J. Judge
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks. Stay well, everybody.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.
