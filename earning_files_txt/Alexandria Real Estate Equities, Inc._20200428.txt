Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon. Welcome to Alexandria Real Estate Equities first quarter 2020 conference call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to
Paula Schwartz from Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Paula Schwartz
Rx Communications Group LLC

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from
those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the
company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to
turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Thank you, Paula, and welcome to everybody. And with me today, virtually -- I think, our first virtual
quarterly call, in order of presentation is Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean
Shigenaga. And we're pleased to present the first quarter earnings call. This will forever be known as
the COVID-19 quarter for all public reporting companies. And as I always do, I want to thank our entire
team for a truly stellar operationally excellent first quarter 2020 under extraordinarily difficult COVID-19
circumstances. Our current and go-forward operating and financial status is excellent. On the fourth
quarter and 2019 year-end earnings call on February 4, I commented on the novel coronavirus global
health emergency and what Alexandria and our client tenants were already working on. Astoundingly,
it was not until March 11, 2020, that the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The COVID-19 virus is a tiny 120-nanometer particle, roughly the wavelength of ultraviolet light that
has rippled and replicated across the globe with virulent ultraviolence. And more than 3 million cases
worldwide to date.

Tiny things have immense impact, especially when everything and everyone is so interconnected and
vulnerable. And some have kind of dubbed this China's Chernobyl. In a few minutes, I'll ask Jenna to
update you on the COVID-19 fight regarding testing therapeutics and vaccines, which is moving forward in
a rapid pace literally every day. We at Alexandria are laser-focused and enormously proud of our collective
accomplishments during this very challenging first quarter, which none of us will ever forget.

Our team's tireless and truly outstanding performance really by all metrics, and we are staying lean, mean
and laser-focused on our mission with no ego. Our teams acquired and delivered over 35,000 individual
pieces of PPE, mostly N95 masks and delivered those to hospitals in 6 cities. New York City, Boston,
Seattle were our top priorities. We also delivered them to Dayton, San Diego and LA hospitals. And we
consider this to be a truly great execution of our corporate responsibility.

Alexandria is among the industry leaders in total shareholder return. Alexandria has best-in-class tenants.
Alexandria has best-in-class assets and a powerful and inspiring cluster market presence, design and
place-making really second to none other. We have world-class trusted relationships. And importantly, our
fortress balance sheet gives us great flexibility and optionality going forward.

We in the life science industry are at the forefront of this multifaceted fight against COVID-19, while still
innovating each and every day novel technologies and new products to also treat cancer, cardiovascular,
metabolic, neurological and other serious, serious diseases. While most REITs compare their business
today, the COVID-19 -- in the COVID-19 pandemic to the great financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, I think
for us, we like to look at 4 years after that time really in 2013, this industry and its innovation really
catapulted its capabilities and impact starting in 2013, which really was the start of the great bull run

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

of this industry. And as we sit here today, the life science industry is really the true solution to winning
the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. A return to the days when Merck and its then CEO, Ray (sic)
[ Roy ] Vagelos, were the most admired company and the most admired CEO in America.

The first quarter of 2020 set an all-time record quarterly high of $8.1 billion invested in venture-backed
life science companies, a very high level and accelerated pace, over 80 of biopharma R&D collaborations
took place in the first quarter, including the blockbuster, $483 million Moderna and BARDA government
funding to -- and Moderna being one of our important tenants to fund -- to advance and scale clinical
testing and the manufacturer for a novel COVID-19 vaccine really the key to the solution here.

Biopharma continues to outperform the broad market in the first quarter amidst the COVID-19 reality.
While most industries are adversely affected by acute changes in consumer demand, this is not the case
for biopharma, as the need for new medicines is fundamental to our human condition. This discrepancy
is one of the reasons why biopharma outperformed other sectors during the great financial crisis and the
tech bubble crash of 2001. NIH funding support remains very strong with a 7% budget increase for fiscal
2020, up to $41.7 billion, a very favorable regulatory environment continues with the FDA, especially in
light of COVID-19 and 11 new product approvals were achieved in the first quarter.

Medical research philanthropy has also hit an all-time high as well. I think it's fair to say that the --
much like flying was before and after 9/11, things will never again be quite the same as they were pre-
COVID-19 and the international pandemic. How quickly we return to what will be a new normal depends
on how we solve the public health situation, restore public confidence and safety. Jim Collins, the famous
business author and writer, research clearly evidences to be built to last, you have to be built to change.
And more importantly, in Jim's introduction to his book Built to Last, he states, the real focus is, "It is
really about building something that is worthy of lasting. It's about building a company of such intrinsic
excellence that the world would lose something important if that organization cease to exist."

Jim Collins further stated, "We are more convinced than ever that building an enduring great company,
one that is truly worthy of lasting is a noble cause." And our mission at Alexandria is now more important
than ever, and we are in the fight each and every day, making a tangible and positive impact. And we're
great -- we were really graced by Jim Collins' quote on the cover of our 2016 annual report, where
he indicated, "Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results,
distinctive impact and lasting endurance." And with that, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger.

Jenna Foger
Senior Principal of Science and Technology

Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Against that backdrop and the backdrop of the
unprecedented economic, public health and social impact of this global coronavirus pandemic, as Joel
eloquently described, life science fundamentals remain strong as the biopharma industry represents the
beacon of hope in the fight against COVID-19. Effective diagnostics, therapies and vaccines are absolutely
mission-critical to solving this crisis, and we truly owe a debt of gratitude to the heroic work being
spearheaded by so many of our tenants to help test for, treat and prevent COVID-19. The countless efforts
we are tracking, not to mention the many philanthropic initiatives across our cluster campus communities,
providing medical supplies and protective equipment to neighboring hospitals is profound and inspiring.
We are currently tracking over 60 tenants across our cluster markets with publicly disclosed COVID-19
program with dozens of intercompany and public-private collaborations transpiring across our portfolio.

Our tenants' position at the forefront of fighting COVID-19 reflects the strength, quality and fortitude
of our tenant base. As you all know, we take tremendous pride in the tenants we attract, each of which
is strategically underwritten by our science and technology team, which I have a profound honor of
being a part of alongside 20 of our colleagues with deep background in science and business. So I would
like to briefly highlight the mission-critical work of our tenant companies across 3 major categories:
one, improving testing quality and capacity; two, advancing new and repurposed treatments; and
three, developing preventative vaccines. So in the area of improving testing quality and capacity,
tenant companies, including Abbott Labs, LabCorp, Roche, Quest Diagnostics, Thermo Fisher, UCSF,
Color Genomics and several others are working to enhance the quality and capacity for rapid and
accessible testing to determine who actively has the virus, who has been exposed and who has developed

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

immunity against it. The availability of widespread screening and serological testing of this nature will be
instrumental for track and trace initiatives and, of course, the safe and healthy reopening of society and
return to work.

In terms of therapies and vaccines, over 180 potential drug treatments and vaccines are being studied
in more than 250 clinical trials around the world, with well over 100 preclinical stage programs in
development. As you can imagine, a substantial number of these programs are sponsored by our tenants.
Headlining efforts among them include Gilead Sciences' remdesivir, which is in late-stage studies for the
treatment of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, which, if positive, will likely form the basis for the
first FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19.

Tenant company Adaptive Biotechnologies is partnered with Amgen to identify and develop therapies from
the blood of sick or recently recovered COVID-19 patients. Other tenant Vir Biotechnology has announced
partnerships with fellow tenants, Alnylam, Biogen, GSK and others to develop new and existing antibodies
that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to combat COVID-19 and other coronaviruses.
Several other tenants, including AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Novartis are similarly endeavoring to develop
novel therapies and repurpose existing drugs to provide near-term treatments for moderate and severe
COVID-19 patients and those at highest risk.

And lastly, vaccines. So clearly, a prophylactic vaccine represents the effective end of this global COVID-19
pandemic. Our tenants Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID,
partnered fast track Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine into the clinic last month. Subsequently, as Joel
mentioned, BARDA committed up to $483 million to support the clinical development and manufacturing
scale-up of Moderna's vaccine candidate to help expedite FDA approval over the next 9 to 12 months, an
unprecedented pace for the sort of activity, and facilitate the supply of tens of millions of doses of that
vaccine for a month thereafter.

Other tenants, including Johnson & Johnson, Medicago, Novavax, Pfizer, GSK and Sanofi are leveraging
their vaccine development expertise and technology platforms with the goal of expediting the delivery of
a safe and effective vaccine to the public in 2021. These noble and expedient efforts across our tenant
base are in large part due to the fact that as the new coronavirus made itself known to the world, these
companies were already well equipped with the R&D infrastructure, resources and talent in place such
that they were able to mobilize at nearly a moment's notice to combat this unprecedented global health
emergency.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.

Stephen A. Richardson
Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. Steve here. We've discussed the mission-critical nature
of our laboratory office facilities since our inception 26 years ago. It is clear now more than ever that
Alexandria is the proven leader in providing mission-critical and indispensable strategic national health
infrastructure in these unique facilities. As Joel and Jenna outlined earlier, we have 60 companies directly
engaged in the fight against COVID-19. Our unique platform is leading to healthy activity at Alexandria's
Class A laboratory facilities. During Q1, we leased 700,000 rentable square feet at very strong rental rate
increases. Actually, the highest during the past 10 years with 22.3% on a cash basis and 46.3% on a
GAAP basis, led by a large lease in our flagship Tech Square campus in Cambridge. Our mark-to-market
continues to be strong at 15.8% GAAP and 14.3% cash.

Lab supply constraints continue with nearly 0 lab subleases coming to market since the inception of the
pandemic and continued strong occupancy at 97.5% in our campuses, when excluding the vacancy of
the recently acquired campuses in San Diego and South San Francisco, that will provide future growth
opportunities. Executed leases now for the month of April are on pace with Q1 leasing velocity. And
important to note that we do have ongoing demand in the form of serious interest and negotiations with
tenants on renewals, expansions and our new ground-up developments and redevelopment projects.
It's also important to highlight that Alexandria has long been a pioneer, an early adopter in the discipline
of designing and constructing state-of-the-art healthy facilities. We currently have 39 total Fitwel and

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

WELL health certification initiatives with 12 projects completed and another 27 projects underway. One
of these facilities in Cambridge, in fact, received the highest score Fitwel ever awarded. Our mission-
critical facilities already feature many state-of-the-art mechanical and filtration attributes and are easily
adaptable as may be needed going forward guided by our skilled operational teams who are well versed in
the types of measures needed to deliver enhanced environments.

Finally, Alexandria is fully prepared and well positioned at all strategic and operational levels to protect the
inherent value of our unique Class A facilities and continue to grow as a trusted partner to the life science
industry to beat this pandemic.

With that, I'll hand it off to Peter.

Peter M. Moglia
Co-CEO & Co-Chief Investment Officer

Thank you, Steve. I'm going to quickly update you all on our development pipeline, acquisitions closed
in 1Q and touch on some capital markets activity. Coming into 2010, we have 11 development and
redevelopment projects in our pipeline that are 61% leased, with another 7% under negotiation. One of
the many things that we like about our pipeline is that it is spread among 6 markets and 9 submarkets,
which really shows that the ecosystems we've built in all of our clusters are contributing to our growth
and our story is not just about any particular region. Despite the shelter-in-place orders reducing our
ability to tour potential tenants, there is good activity on partially leased assets that are progressing at
various levels from initial online presentations to paper being traded. As Steve mentioned, we are still
seeing healthy activity in our markets. And these leasing percentages should accelerate given the pent-up
demand and the new COVID-19-related requirements.

As you may have noted, by looking on Page 38 of the supplemental, 7 projects have had a temporary
pause in construction, but 3 of them have restarted as they've been deemed essential. Delays related
to shelter-in-place orders or I'll refer to as SIP, are not day for day. They are likely between day for day
and 2 days per day of delay, depending on how long it takes to remobilize the subcontractors back on-
site and where we were in the staging of the work. We do not anticipate any material supply chain issues.
The amount of delay is really going to depend upon the subcontractor labor and what other work they are
performing elsewhere.

In general, we anticipate about 1/4 delay on average for those projects that are in temporary work
stoppages due to SIP orders and assuming construction recommences upon lifting of the current orders,
and they are not further extended. We do anticipate -- or we do not anticipate any material movement in
yields at this time due to these delays. In the -- touching on acquisitions, in the first quarter, we closed on
2 projects we discussed on last quarter's call, 275 Grove in the Route 128 corridor and the JV with Boston
Properties in South San Francisco.

In addition to those, we closed on 9808 and 9868 Scranton Road in Sorrento Mesa. And 3330 and 3412
Hillview in the Stanford Research Park. The Scranton Road assets total 220,000 square feet and are
located directly across the street from and will be incorporated into our SD Tech campus. They are
currently 88% leased with the predominant tenants being investment-grade companies. The assets
present us the opportunity to achieve a strong 6.8% stabilized cash yield by leasing the vacant space
and future value creation opportunities as they are convertible to lab. A 50% interest in these assets was
subsequently sold into a joint venture, and we received $51.1 million from net asset sale.

As mentioned, in addition, we closed on 3330 and 3412 Hillview in the Stanford Research Park for $105
million. These 2 high-quality Class A office properties total approximately 106,000 square feet and are
fully leased to credit tenants. The rents are considerably undermarket and offer near-term value creation
in an irreplaceable location. The buildings are also convertible to lab offering us long-term optionality and
further value creation opportunities down the road.

Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed on 975-1075 Commercial Street and 915-1063 Old
County Road, a 12.7-acre site that is the fourth and final piece of our 25-acre assemblage branded as the
Alexandria District in San Carlos. This campus is in close proximity to the Caltrain station and will reach 2

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

million square feet upon full development. The first phase of a little over 500,000 square feet is currently
under construction and has been well received as the only purpose-built Class A lab campus in the Greater
Stanford cluster illustrated by it being 56% pre-leased with another 9% under negotiation.

I'll wrap up by mentioning that conversations with a number of brokers indicate that there is still strong
interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors. To that end, The Post, 426,000 square foot
campus in Waltham, Massachusetts closed on April 2 at a 5.1% cap rate, the lowest suburban cap rate
we know of. And a reliable source has told us another life science transaction in the Boston area has gone
under contract while in the shutdown. With a positive light shining on the industry, it is not surprising that
demand for our product type remains robust.

And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean.

Dean A. Shigenaga
Co-President & CFO

Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm just going to quickly rattle through
my commentary, kicking off with really outstanding results for the first quarter. Revenues were up
22.6% over the first quarter of '19. NOI was up 22.9% as well over the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA
margin was very strong at 68%. Contractual annual rent escalations average almost 3% today. Our value
creation pipeline is 61% leased and will generate significant revenue and cash flows, and I'll come back
to this topic in a moment. We also have about $37 million of annual cash net operating income that
will commence as free rent burns off primarily over the next 4 quarters related to recently placed into
service development and redevelopment projects. Same-property NOI growth was very solid at 2.4%
and 6.1% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth, as you heard from Steve earlier, on lease renewals and re-
leasing the space was very strong, up 46% and 22% on a cash basis. And our properties are open and
operating today and through this environment. Our business is not absolutely immune from this unusual
and unprecedented environment. But is doing very well on a relative basis. The NASDAQ Biotech Index, as
some of you may have noted, was up 5.8% year-to-date as of yesterday. And our stock has outperformed
on a relative basis, roughly down about 7% year-to-date, again through as of yesterday.

Our team is working diligently on our annual corporate responsibility report, which we expect to issue
around mid-year. Now as Joel had highlighted, our balance sheet really remains in the best shape in the
history of the company. We had about $4 billion of liquidity. We have an excellent maturity profile with no
debt maturities until 2023. The top we rank roughly in the top 10% on a relative ranking with our credit
profile when compared to all publicly traded REITs. We have a real high-quality tenant roster, et cetera,
et cetera. I mean these are just some of the best statistics in the REIT industry today. And we remain
committed to our strong and improving credit profile. Our dividend is well covered with an FFO payout
ratio just under 60% today. This strategically allows us to use a portion of our cash flows from operating
activities after dividends, which is just above $200 million today for investment into our value creation
ground-up development projects.

Now briefly on rent deferrals and an update on rent collections. We've only received a handful of requests
for rent deferrals, which is primarily on the retail side of our tenancy. And we've really taken these
requests one by one, and we'll review each -- review these each 1 month at a time. The total rent
deferrals were in the low $600,000 range for the month of April. Now we're very proud of our research
and property management teams for really building an outstanding and high-quality tenant roster and for
really taking care of these long-term relationships. We've collected 98.4% of our April rent and expense
recoveries, which is just outstanding.

Our AR balance as of Friday, April 24, was $7.3 million, representing the lowest balance since 2012. And
our team has successfully decreased our AR balance, both when we look back to the depth of the great
financial crisis. So our goal was clear from the beginning of April that we would continue to make this a
priority each month. We're feeling really good now that we're at the end of April. We've collected almost
all of our account receivable balances. Our business is doing really well, again, relative to other REITs.
However, this is an unprecedented environment, and we have forecasted a relatively minor impact to
our outlook for the last 3 quarters of 2020. We're forecasting about an $0.08 or 1% reduction in FFO
per share as adjusted at the midpoint of the range of our guidance. And this is really related to a very

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

limited retail tenancy that we have as well as transient and short-term parking. Of the $0.08, 60% of this
is related to retail, and the remainder is primarily related to transient and short-term parking. To put this
into perspective, this $0.08 is roughly 60 to 70 basis points of our annual rental revenue, and we believe
this will only be about a 50 basis point decline to our year-end occupancy.

As of March 31, our annual rental revenue from retail was about $10.4 million. We recognized an
allowance of about $3.8 million related to NOI for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2020, and most
of the impact to retail revenue will really occur in the second quarter since GAAP requires cash basis
revenue recognition related to these leases that now have specific allowances or reserves. And our retail-
related occupancy declines, which we expect to be very minor, may not occur right away since these
leases are still in effect today. And keep in mind, retail is a very minor part of our operating results, but we
hope these details are useful.

Parking income for ARE is primarily from urban or CBD markets. And these markets have very limited
parking to service tenants and daily parking needs. For example, Juno Therapeutics in Seattle has about
600 employees, but they only have parking for about 50% of that employee base. So these really dense
urban CBD submarkets generally have lower risk of a major decline in parking income due to the very
limited supply of spaces in the markets.

Our outlook for same-property performance for 2020 remains very strong, down only about 50 basis
points. The $0.08 of FFO per share related to retail and parking revenue translates to about 60 to 70 basis
points of same-property results. And this was offset by our same-property results in our forecast running
at the upper end of the range prior to this guidance adjustment.

Now turning to real estate impairments. We spent quite a bit of time analyzing options for one of our
unconsolidated retail joint ventures. To put this into perspective, this deal came together back in 2015
as we were looking for opportunities to monetize certain assets, including this land parcel. Now in this
case, we found an opportunity to contribute our land into a joint venture with a local retail developer in
Maryland. And this project was really doing well on its way to solid, stabilized NOI until COVID-19 arrived
and almost every tenant was required to comply with executive orders and close their business. Now we
concluded that we're not going to recover our bases and wrote off our investment of approximately $7.6
million.

Turning to our venture investment portfolio. The portfolio has done really well to date. For example, our
venture investments aggregate about $1.1 billion. But this includes unrealized gains of $384 million.
During the first quarter, we did recognize impairments aggregating about $19.8 million, primarily related
to 3 privately held investments. One is focused on Parkinson's and ALS, another in the dermatology area.
And the third is a smart glass technology-related company. Now each of these companies really have great
innovation and technology. However, we do not expect to recover our entire investment.

On the positive note, realized gains for the first quarter were $15.1 million. Recent quarterly gains were
put on -- for 2020 really are on track to exceed the $50.3 million in realized gains recognized in 2019.

Turning to our value creation pipeline. We're uniquely positioned with flexibility to be prudent during this
unprecedented time, while we're also very well positioned to address future demand. Now construction
has been impacted in urban markets with more of our suburban markets having limited to no impact.
COVID-19 and other projects continue while following appropriate guidelines.

Now we felt it was prudent to significantly reduce our 2020 capital plan with a reduction of $640 million
in construction spend and $300 million of acquisitions, both at the midpoint of our guidance. Now our
remaining construction spend for 2020 is now primarily focused on construction that is committed to
tenants. Importantly though, we remain uniquely positioned for opportunities on a project-by-project
basis to meet the demand for our well-located pipeline of future ground-up development projects. Now we
updated our 2020 guidance to a range for EPS dilutive from $1.69 to $1.79 and for FFO per share diluted
as adjusted from $7.25 to $7.35. As usual, please refer to the detailed underlying assumptions included in
our 2020 guidance, beginning on Page 9 of our supplemental package.

Let me pause there and turn it back to Joel.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore ISI.

Sheila Kathleen McGrath
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Joel, I was wondering if you could talk big picture, your thoughts on research funding for life science
tenants in the race for the cure, do you think the laser-focus will have some positive outcome for R&D
funding for your tenants? And you also mentioned 60 tenants working on COVID responses. Are they
dominated in any 1 or 2 single markets or across the portfolio?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Sheila, welcome to the call. So the -- I talked about NIH being up 7% this year, who knows where
Congress may decide to additionally focus. There was $25 billion in the recent care bill. This, I think,
the second addition focused on testing. In fact, I was on a call the other day, where there's going to be
some rollout of some pretty amazing novel testing. So a lot of money is going into that sector. In fact, it
may be that the nasal swab will actually be old technology at some point, and people will be using there
some research out of -- practical research out of Rutgers and Yale, indicating that you can actually find
virus in spit. And if you could imagine, you could do that simply on a daily basis and be alerted on your
smartphone that you aren't able to go to work, that would be a pretty unique solution. So we see a fair
amount of money, both from pharma, from bio, from the venture side, obviously, from philanthropy and
from the government. I think the BARDA deal that I mentioned and Jenna mentioned almost $0.5 billion
to try to ramp up testing and the vaccine with Moderna is 1 example of, I think, extraordinary focus in this
area. So I think it's broad-based and really across multiple regions.

Sheila Kathleen McGrath
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then on leasing spreads for the quarter, I think Steve mentioned they're the strongest in
10 years. I was wondering if you could give us more detail on the mix of the increases geographically? And
if there was any 1 lease that was well below market that might have impacted the numbers?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes, I'll have Steve comment. It was somewhat broad-based. One of the important leases was a renewal
in Tech Square. I don't want to get into the details of that, but that was certainly an important part of
driving. But Steve, any further comments?

Stephen A. Richardson
Co-Chief Executive Officer

Sheila, it's Steve. No, that's exactly right. We do have, as we said, mark-to-market strong across most of
the regions, and it is typically broad-based. For this particular quarter, we did have that 1 lease at Tech
square that was a particular driver. But in general, we do have nice mark-to-market opportunities.

Sheila Kathleen McGrath
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Last question. On the North Tower, your 10-Q mentioned that, that project would be postponed.
I'm just wondering if that -- in York, is that indefinitely postponed? Or what's the status of that future
development?

Founder & Executive Chairman

Right, as you maybe even have seen on television when some of the news -- media reports go to that site,
which is right next to our 2 towers, the pad that was the location of OCME, the office of county medical
examiner was occupied for many, many years. So the white tent with the unidentified remains of the world
trade center victims. They've vacated that site, and then we began a diligence there. They reclaimed that
site for a temporary period just a number of weeks ago. They have mobile morgues there because of the
number of people dying in the New York City area. We would expect them to probably vacate that by the
summer or the fall, and then we would look to see where we are with the economy and so forth. But I
don't think it's going to be an indefinite postponement in the sense of how long they'll be there. We just
don't know at this point.

Operator

Our next question is from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.

Anthony Paolone
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You talked about just the continued demand for space from your life science companies. And reading
these headlines about Google, maybe changing some of their space plans. And so I was wondering if you
could talk about when you net all of this, maybe what's happening on tech and what's happening on life
science together, what do you think is happening with your rents? And what do you think will happen with
occupancy on the ground in some of your markets?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Well, I'll ask Steve to come in, in a minute. But I think in general, we're a dominantly life science-focused
business, as you know, Tony, for a long, long time. We do have a number of important single-tenant
buildings where we have companies like Google. They have the original campus they started in; Facebook,
et cetera. We don't typically have multi-tenant office buildings that have lots of different tenants and lots
of different in the office [ vein]. And so we don't think that's going to have any particular impact on us. It
may more broadly. But Steve, you could comment what you're seeing on the ground?

Stephen A. Richardson
Co-Chief Executive Officer

Tony, it's Steve. Yes. Broadly, when you look at just the overall vacancy in these markets, they're typically
mid-single-digits and even low single digits. Look at Cambridge, 1.8% vacancy. San Francisco, 2.2%
availability and on with other regions as well. And then my comment as well, there has not been really any
significant sublease space that's come to market since the pandemic. So you do have, again, a constrained
supply situation. We think pricing power will be maintained. The level of demand continues to be strong.
Again, April's activity was consistent with what we saw during Q1 of this year. So the markets are, in fact,
healthy at this point, and we're very, very close to them as well with our installed tenant base.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. I think the bigger question, Tony, that you may be asking, too, is, will these companies somehow
decide to put people in more remote locations or even at home. And that's something we just don't know
yet. There are obviously a number of office tenants who've indicated that they will have a new way of
working, maybe in shifts or, in fact, maybe will wait and do telecommuting until there's either an effective
therapeutic or hopefully an effective vaccine as well. So we haven't seen that roll out. But again, in the
office world, most of our leases are really full building leases with the major tech companies. We don't
have lots of spaces rolling and smaller spaces to deal with. So that's a good thing on the office side.

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Okay. And then in terms of the acquisition you walked away from in the quarter, can you give us a sense
as to the size of it? And what changed or what your view of value was and maybe is now to prompt
leaving the $10 million on the table?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. So maybe I'll have Dean comment and then maybe Steve as well.

Dean A. Shigenaga
Co-President & CFO

Tony, Dean here. So the size of the deal is roughly $150 million to $160 million in that range. And it really
came down to economics at the end of the day, during the diligence period, Tony. We constantly revisit
the cash flow analysis and our views on the performance of the holding in the near-term was meaningfully
different. And when we took it in totality with our business today, and where we want to deploy capital,
it was a pretty simple decision, even though we don't take these decisions lightly because you're talking
about $10 million. But it's the only transaction I can think of in the history of the company where we've
had to do that. And it was well thought through, and I think the prudent decision for us as well as our
investors is to pause and terminate the deal.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

It was -- keep in mind, it was an office asset in the city of San Francisco. Steve, anything else you'd want
to add?

Stephen A. Richardson
Co-Chief Executive Officer

No, Dean really covered it there.

Anthony Paolone
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. But just to make sure I understand, was it more you just saw your capital better situated
somewhere else given what's unfolded? Or was there some -- okay, well, it wasn't a matter of the tenant
crapped out or something?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Well, I think in this -- remember what I said, this was a office asset, a multi-tenant office asset. So you
can imagine your first question really went to the heart of that as we saw things unfolding in the office
sector. Our underwriting changed. And so that kind of alert you to is this, where you would want to deploy
your capital in this particular kind of environment. The answer was no.

Operator

Our next question is from Tom Catherwood from BTIG.

William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Peter, it was helpful your comments on the 7 active construction projects that had been delayed and the
3 that had been restarted. But you also have another 2.1 million square feet of near-term development
opportunities. Have your capital spending plans impacted these projects? And are there some that you're
prioritizing over others at this point?

Co-CEO & Co-Chief Investment Officer

13

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Yes. So maybe let me ask Dean to kind of take first shot at that.

Dean A. Shigenaga
Co-President & CFO

So Tom, the way we thought about our capital, and this is true for many years now. The large portion
of our capital spend is in the category that we always have the flexibility to moderate, like we did just
now with our earnings release. These are future projects in the pipeline that have not yet commenced
vertical construction, not committed to tenants yet. We moved them along to shrink the time to deliver,
which means everything from entitlement to site work. We could be doing anything below grade, which
could include a obviously, infrastructure, but a parking garage, if necessary, just the strength of time
to deliver. Now there's still important costs continuing, but the bulk of the spend has been temporarily
paused because we think that's the most prudent thing to do in this environment. And I think as we get
clarity to COVID clearing out and things getting closer to normal. I'm pretty confident we're going to see
opportunities that will present themselves, i.e., tenants looking for expansion capacity within this portfolio
of land holdings that we have. And we could do these deals one deal at a time, Tom. I think that's the
beauty of the position we're in. We can moderate the spend like we have, but we also can be opportunistic
when appropriate. And I think that's what we really want to convey. The projects, by and large, remain in
the priority, the way they've been disclosed from near term, medium and future. And that's how we rank
them generally. But the specific ones that will pull the trigger around will be more demand driven.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

And keep in mind, as we said in our guidance, Tom, one of our overriding goals, having lived through the
great financial crisis was to give ourselves maximum optionality so that we adjusted our spend and our
go-forward business plan almost on a dime, pivoting very quickly so that we don't need any further -- to
raise any further capital this year to accomplish what we presented here on the call.

William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That makes total sense. I guess the kind of follow-on to that then would be -- so I assume then
you get those projects that are near-term to a level where there aren't startup -- significant start-up costs
again. I guess we're thinking longer-term for yield impacts, and obviously, it's very early to be able to
tell on that. But I would imagine if it was shut down midstream without full entitlements or without full
approval that there would be kind of restart up costs or delays. So all that is part of the calculation?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. Yes. And I mean, we -- to some extent, did something similar was different, but yet there is kind of
a similarity during the great financial crisis when we continue to build the East Tower in New York and we
shut down the West Tower having finished the foundation, but we didn't go vertical, and it turned out to be
a really great call.

William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Understood. And over to acquisitions. Obviously, acquisitions came in higher-than-expected over the past
2 years. The lower guidance for 2020 makes sense as you talk through your capital allocation plans. But
I want to get more color on the transaction market in general. Is part of the lower guidance that you're
seeing sellers pull their properties because they're not getting the pricing they want? And on the flip side
of that -- sorry, go ahead, Joel.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

I was going to say, let me just respond quickly. Now I think that's part and parcel of giving ourselves the
maximum optionality where we don't have an assumption of as many acquisitions as we had earlier so

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

that we don't have to tap either the debt or the equity markets at all or even raise money through partial
interest sales or whatever. So part of that was -- had nothing to do with the outside state of the market. It
had to do with giving ourselves total and maximum optionality here. That was the driving force.

William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. I was just wondering as far as if there were opportunities out there that you might like that
we missed out on because of the lower guidance, but it doesn't sound like that is the driving force.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

No. Although given where we are today and our balance sheet, as Dean articulated, we have optionality to
do a lot of things that maybe we wouldn't have had to do in a different environment. So it really puts us in
a unique and, I think, excellent position, which is where you want to be if you can be.

Operator

Our next question is from Manny Korchman from Citi.

Emmanuel Korchman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

In your press release, you talked about the fact that a lot of the new ground-up development in your
pipeline is supportive of COVID-19 research. That would obviously imply that, that's a shift as to the work
that's happening in those facilities. So one, is that simply an overlap with the tenants that were already
signed up and now they're going to be doing that type of work in those facilities? And two, does that mean
that there should be more shadow demand for all of the other stuff that they thought they would be doing
in those spaces pre-COVID?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Well, so maybe the first question, the COVID-19-type requirements or COVID-19-type infrastructure
requirements, I should say, in the buildings. These are companies who are already focused in areas of
therapeutic need in the antiviral areas and certain testing areas, certain infectious disease areas. I mean
Vera is a good example. That was their business before. And to be able to move from a particular focus in
infectious disease or in therapies in the antiviral side to a COVID-19 is not much of a stretch because the
basic capabilities and technology and manpower is already there. So there isn't a lot of big pivoting among
tenants who we're working at. I mean the East Lake development for Adaptive, I mean, they are all over
the COVID-19 area, but it was a natural progression from where they were. But the second part of your
question, yes, we've been already contacted. I can think of personally about a half a dozen e-mails I've
got from individuals, from companies where they are looking for additional capability, additional facilities
for their ramp-up on COVID-19, whether it be vaccine, therapeutics or in fact, in testing. And so we do
think there will be some pent-up demand there.

Emmanuel Korchman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Great. And then on your comment about sort of the retail environment within your assets, what does that
retail look like on the other side of this? Is it going to be a different mix of retail? Is it going to be not
retail at all? Sort of help us get out there first of all, what those retail spaces and what it will look like?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. That's really hard to say. My sense is that given that we're not a heavily retail-oriented developer and
operator, we think that one by one, we're going to look at the retail operations and see, does this make
sense in a new environment? People are going to want clean, prepackaged, probably not so quickly to

15

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

sit down. So I think there's going to be some shift. Some operators will be pretty facile at being able to
do that. And others probably won't. And I think those will just be done on a one by one basis. Luckily, as
being said, we don't have immense numbers of retail tenants. So for us, it will be pretty methodical to try
to go through that analysis. But I think it's fair to say until there is a truly effective vaccine, people are not
going to be socializing and eating the way they used to.

Operator

Our next question is from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I was hoping you could talk about your tenant base in the life science, tenant base that's not involved in
COVID-19. I mean are those tenants basically still open for business?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

They are.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And any pushing for rent relief or any kind of issues on earnings or revenue?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

No. I think what's happening is many of the office-type people are working virtually. Because you've got
a component in every company depending upon size of people who are just office users. And then people
in the labs, labs, by their very nature are essentially, you've got good spacing between people. In fact,
when we've done tours in the past, especially I remember in San Diego people saying, "Oh my God, are
there anybody working in the labs?" So because on a beautiful day, a lot of times, people worked through
the night rather than during the day. But they -- I think people have adapted pretty well, so they have
essential crews going in to do continue experiments and mission-critical work in those -- and they shift
around on days and weeks, and then those who don't need to be there aren't there until the stay in place
orders are lifted. But everything is essentially open and working. But under new rules and new rules of the
road, if you will.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then as you think about long-term building design, do you think -- there's a lot of talk about
what might be different in the office sector, but if you think about the lab sector, do you think this is a
catalyst for any changes in space design?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. So Peter, you want to maybe comment?

Peter M. Moglia
Co-CEO & Co-Chief Investment Officer

Sure. So Jamie, one of the things that we used to get asked about was the densification trend for office
going to affect lab, and the answer was always no because for one, lab spaces is much about equipment
as it is about people. So the way that just research has done right now with people kind of that every
other bench with equipment filling in, social distancing is really already factored into the design. There
may be some things that can be done with circulation within a lab that we'll examine to make things even
safer. But by and large, we've already been studying this. Our traditional lab product is probably already

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

safe in this environment. We're looking at some of our proprietary products that might be a little bit more
dense, and we've already got plans in place for some practical reconfigurations that will not be costly, but
will just create a little bit more safety.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And there's a lot of talk about air quality just for traditional office. And are there things in your lab
development business that you think are strategic assets or knowledge assets that might actually help you
even more in the office business? Or that if you think how that design might change going forward?

Peter M. Moglia
Co-CEO & Co-Chief Investment Officer

Well, that you bring up a -- if you don't mind, Joel. You bring up a really good point...

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

No. I was going to say, please answer.

Peter M. Moglia
Co-CEO & Co-Chief Investment Officer

Yes. You bring up a really good point. We actually even have one of our large tech tenants, which I won't
name because I'm not sure they would want their publicity, but has come to us. They were put into one
of our large lab buildings and as the only non-lab tenant, they really have fallen in love with the high floor
to ceiling and the 100% fresh air. This is pre-COVID, by the way, that they had such great experience
and such great feedback from their employees that when they go out now with RFPs for new space,
they're asking for the same floor to floors and the same air filtration, air changes that we provide. So look,
everything that we have that is office with potentially a couple of minor exceptions, is built for laboratory.
And therefore, it does have high ceilings. It may have MEP design that is a bit more efficient for office,
but we have thought about and put in infrastructure that will enable it to be lab in the future. So we do
have the ability to provide an atmosphere from a mechanical standpoint, that mirrors lab. And I think
to the extent that office tenants are growing and expanding, we'll see when that happen. But that they
will look at buildings like ours, like they have been because we have that advantage. And Steve even
mentioned the fill -- the fit well and the wealth standards, which factor in such things as the amount
of natural light that comes into the space, the amount of actual space people have to move around the
building, the outdoor space people have to work in. All of those things in this environment are going to be
really important as people decide where they want to office. And so our forethought to getting into these
well and fit well-designed standards is going to pay off not only in our lab business, but for anybody who is
leasing office from us as well.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then finally for me, as you look across the competitive landscape, are there
buildings owned by landlords that have balance sheets that may not be so strong, and you kind of see --
you could see some distressed opportunities? Or do you think the better quality buildings that would fit
with your portfolio are pretty well owned at this point?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

I would say it's possible. So stay tuned.

Our next question is from Rick Anderson from SMBC.

ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

So this question has kind of been asked and kind of answered, but not quite. And I still wanted to sort of
ask it a different way. The 60 tenants, in some way, shape or form involved in the process here and doing
awesome things to try to move things along. But is there a -- I know when suggesting, they shouldn't be
doing that, of course, but is there a short-term potential impact on their own profitability as they -- some
amount of resources are redirected towards COVID-19 and their own core drug research business perhaps
gets a little bit of a delay? Is that a reasonable way to think about this? Or am I completely off base on?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Well, I think for those that -- certainly for the bigger pharma and bigger biotech, who actually report
quarterly earnings, I think that's a possibility. Saw a little bit of that in Merck's report today, where it's
pretty clear that when people can't go visit the doctor, can't go into the hospital for normal procedures and
you're stuck kind of in your home, your access to medical care and in fact, pharmaceuticals is a little more
problematic. I think for the private biotechs or the biotech companies that haven't reached profitability, I
don't think that's such a big issue because it's the pipeline and the value of the pipeline that really counts.
I don't know, Jenna, do you want to make any other comments?

Jenna Foger
Senior Principal of Science and Technology

Yes. I think the other thing that I would add, Rich, is really that the platforms themselves that they're
optimizing. So in case of Vir or Moderna, the learnings and the pure intelligence that they're getting by
optimizing the platform in this rapid speed and rapid notion is actually incredibly valuable for the company
overall. Hopefully, they'll be successful. But even if they're not. So I think that's the way to think about
it. And I think, as Joel mentioned, clearly, the large pharma folks will have some trouble of their own
as far as clinical trials and progressing. But as far as refocusing efforts to COVID, it's actually not all
that expensive for them to do that. So if they're successful, I think it's great and they'll come back to
them. And if they're not, it's really not that much because a lot of it is either in collaboration with other
biotech companies that they're doing the work or using -- repurposing old drugs. So I think that's just the
overview.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then the other reference earlier in the call was sort of different utilization of office space
in the longer-term aftermath of all this. But when I think of your lab buildings, perhaps maybe the build-
out there is 50-50 office and lab space. Do you think for that 50 that's on the office side that your tenants
might start thinking about a work from home type of strategy? Or is it just too soon to sort of make that
call even for the life science component of your business, not the pure office?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Well, I think at the moment and when they reintegrate into the -- whatever will be the new opening and
that's going to be different city-by-city, state-by-state and even company-by-company. I think you'll find
people working maybe shifts to begin with. Those who can work from home over time will probably be
brought back into the system because I think it's pretty clear you -- it's hard to build a culture when you
have people or maintain a culture when you have people working from home consistently. And especially
a number of those people are senior management of a lot of these companies. So I don't think that's
going to be a big issue, but I think it will be a time frame issue. But there's a light at the end of the tunnel
because once there's a -- if there is, and we think there probably will be an effective vaccine. Hopefully,
that goes away, although the age-old habit of shaking hands, hugging, being close to people probably will
be rethought a lot by people and that may never change, except in family settings or things like that. So
there will be some long-term changes. But I think as I've described the reintegration, I think that's likely
what would happen on the office side.

Great. Great. And then lastly -- go ahead. Sure. Peter?

Peter M. Moglia
Co-CEO & Co-Chief Investment Officer

If you don't mind. This is Peter. Yes. The people -- a lot of that office space is actually the office space
for the people working in the lab. So they do their experiments in the lab, and then they go back to their
office and write things up and communicate about those things. So you actually can't work from home.
You have -- that office has to be next to the lab because you're going in and out of that. And the majority
of our space is revenue-producing space. It's research and development. It's not -- has nothing to do with
back office. I'm sure there's a few companies that we have that may have some back office in there. But
by and large, the majority of that office space are people that are actually working in the lab. So that can't
be brought home.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Next question for me is on the VC side. Obviously, some noise, not to be unexpected this quarter. But has
it caused you to rethink or tweak that strategy at all? And the answer could be completely no or perhaps...

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. Completely, no. Yes, the 3 -- the 3 items that Dean mentioned are all very unique situations. One
has to do with just the market. It's more of a consumer kind of product. Another one has to do with --
actually, the other 2 are really primarily due to management issues, not fundamental underlying business
issues. And so in any venture portfolio, you're going to expect some don't perform. And yes, no change
whatsoever.

Our next question is from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I wanted to see if we can talk a little bit about the Mercer Mega Block. It seems like that asset was
delayed. I'm not sure if it was delayed because of the current COVID environment or if there's something
unique that's going on right there. So how is that acquisition going right now? And is there any changes
within expectations?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. I don't think there's any delays other than COVID. It's just hard to get -- we're in diligence. And
it's hard to get things done. Sometimes when cities are shut down, when we're shut down to the extent
that we have to be and when you're working virtually and mobilely. So I don't see any -- we were --
the anticipation is to close that either toward the end of the year or early '21. And I don't think that's
materially changed.

Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then can we talk a little bit about the leasing activity? And I know you made several
comments throughout this call, and it seems like leasing trends are still very healthy. But has it changed,
I guess, in the current environment compared to 3 months ago? Is it harder for people to see certain
assets? And is that potentially delaying transactions, but not stopping those transactions? I guess, what's
the good way to think about that?

Yes. Steve, you can take that, but I don't think there's any huge delays and people are virtually looking at
assets.

Stephen A. Richardson
Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Hi, Michael, it's Steve. No, that's right. I mean the demand continues. The need for lab space, as
Peter has outlined, is qualitatively different than office space. As people's programs and the funding that
Joel highlighted in the beginning come to fruition, they want to keep moving forward, they want to lock
down lab space. The markets are very tight. Again, no major subleases have come to the market. So
people are still acting with a sense of the need to move forward and do that deliberately and diligently.
We have been able to go into the market. These are all essential service buildings. In the orders, they are
very clearly and explicitly defined biotech and pharma buildings as essential services. So they are open, so
we continue to see healthy demand.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. And as you saw from the press release and supplement, we announced that we had considerably
upzoned our asset at 325 Binney. And that's a good example during this last month or 2 of COVID
shutdown, we've still seen a remarkable amount of interest in that development as a good example.

Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then just last one for me, I guess. I know that it seems like there's been a lot of funding
coming into the space. I mean in the post COVID environment, do you think it's logical to assume that
there's going to be more funding coming into biotech that could drive, I guess, incremental demand? Or is
the demand that you've seen is already pretty at record levels -- and that's a pretty good pace.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

I think there's going to be more, and I don't know how things are going to sort out with China, whether
they really open up the -- what really happened in Wuhan. I mean, there are a lot of different theories,
as you guys know. But whether it was pure research, whether it was maybe a biological weapon, I don't
think the web markets were necessarily the exact cause of that, but I'm not the expert. But I think there's
going to be a much more intense federal, state and local effort to try to stockpile medicines, therapeutics,
testing capabilities, vaccines. And remember, there are more than 1 strain of the coronavirus. And we
don't know what other ones are out there and due to come. So I think this is with us maybe for the history
of humanity here.

Our next question is from Dave Rodgers from Baird.

David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And maybe following up on Mike's question and some things that both Steve and Peter mentioned earlier.
You talked about the activity in the proposal consistent with pre -- prior quarters, and that's pretty
consistent with what we've talked in the private market as well. But leasing, new leasing activity in the
first quarter was just slower. So maybe that -- you could just address that specifically. Was that always
going to be a little slower just the way the pipeline was materializing? And then maybe take that question
to the future and say, second quarter, do we see a spike in COVID leases? Third quarter, maybe the core
portfolio, fourth quarter, we start to see people committing to kind of multiyear developments? Or do you

think it happens more quickly than that? Can you give us maybe just a little bit more color on kind of how
you're feeling today about some of the timing around that?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. I'm not sure anybody really knows, given so many different state, local and even fed's commentary
on what to do in different locations. But Steve, you could take a crack at that?

Stephen A. Richardson
Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Hi, Dave, it's Steve here. Yes, again, the activity remains consistent. It is consistent across all of the
regions. So I think we're very well positioned to capture that demand. We'll just have to see exactly the
intensity of the velocity and the magnitude of it. It is high-quality demand, but I think it is still a little bit
TBD, but nevertheless, again, April was very encouraging. We're in the full throes of the pandemic, and it
was consistent with what we saw during Q1.

David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

In terms of the COVID leasing or the activity that you're seeing there, would that be a notable spike that
we'll see coming? Or is it just kind of incremental to the demand that you've already been seeing?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

I think it's hard to say. I think it's possible that when you say spike, I mean, if there's an additional
building or 2 requirements, or half a dozen. I mean, don't know if that's considered a spike or a
natural evolution of the pandemic response. But we would expect that there are going to be a range of
requirements out there, given the amount of money flowing into testing therapeutics and vaccines. I think
you have to believe that don't know if it's a tsunami or a wave, but it'll -- it's going to happen.

David Bryan Rodgers
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Last for me. Dean, your comment, if I heard it right, was that you thought gains this year, the realized
gains from your equity investments would beat last year's $50.3 million. Talk about maybe the confidence
and liquidity around those? Are those largely already identified and likely to be public market sales, so that
gives you kind of the confidence in the liquidity for that market? Any thoughts would be helpful.

Dean A. Shigenaga
Co-President & CFO

Sure, Dave. So my comment is really just driven by the historical trend of realized gains. So if you look
back over the last number of quarters, it's been roughly in that $14 million a quarter range. This quarter,
about $15 million. And so I think over the last number of quarters, I've always mentioned, I think the best
way of thinking about it is to watch the historical trend of where we're headed. And at that run rate at
$15 million a quarter, just as an example, we're already ahead on an annualized basis to the $50 million
that we recognized in 2019. There's a tremendous amount of unrealized gains today in the portfolio, $384
million today. So there's good value still to be tapped.

Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho Securities.

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Just one quick question. I was curious if there was any -- what the interest in other markets you're
currently not in right now, whether there was more interest in some of those markets or less? I think at

the Investor Day, there had been some conversation about some markets that you could potentially be
looking at outside your current core clusters today.

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Well, I think in this environment, that's not something that we're thinking about at this time. But I think
over the long term, there will likely be other markets, but probably nothing that we'd comment on at this
point.

Operator

Our next question is from Manny Korchman from Citi.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

It's Michael Bilerman. I just had two questions. One, and you talked a little bit about this deal that you
walked away from the multi-tenant tech office building. Do you have sort of a broader sort of perspective
on how you sort of think about your capital investment going forward, whether you view that 100%
targeted towards lab and life science, where a lot of the office opportunities you've been involved with
have been a byproduct of the markets that you've been in and the relationships that you've developed?
Does this whole pandemic change the sort of single-use office, either for a single user or a multi-tenant
building going forward where you could see the company being -- going back to being exclusively focused
on life sciences and labs?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Well, I think, Michael, one thing is for sure, we have always put our -- always allocated capital to our
core, which will never change, which is the life science industry. But as you know, the intersection of life
science and the whole, you might call it the whole IT world is really booming. And so I mean, telemedicine
went from something that millennials or Gen Z or Gen Xers would occasionally use because they're pretty
healthy too. Right now, it's -- I think, I've got a note because we're involved with the company that's kind
of at the forefront that it's spiked up 85% of what it was 2 months ago. So I think you can't ever forget, I
mean, and tenants of ours, Google, Verily, Microsoft, others that are heavily, heavily involved in the health
care sector. So the 2 overlap in ways that are pretty fundamental. So that will always be of great interest.
I don't think we'll have as much interest in pure tech office buildings. But I think where we see a building,
as Peter described, that may be a office tenant today, but that's in a great location that we can convert
in the future, that -- those would still be of interest. And I don't think we've ever really had interest in
owning lots of office buildings, multi-tenant office buildings per se. That's never really been a focus of
ours. So I think we continue our focus.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then you talked a little bit about sort of all the focus on COVID-19 right now from your tenant base
and that there may be clearly some effects from other activities that are not occurring for those tenants.
How do you sort of think about the academia side with schools potentially not opening up in the fall?
Clearly, a lot of your buildings are in close proximity to key academic institutions, whether it's MIT,
Harvard, UCFS. How do you think about that aspect and what potentially could come out of that if schools
don't physically reopen?

Joel S. Marcus
Founder & Executive Chairman

Yes. Well, I think number one, those are mostly for undergraduates. If you look at MIT, a lot of the
professors and a lot of the labs are still open. They've gone to COVID-related operations where people are
cycling in, not at all at the same time. But labs and a lot of the graduate students and professors are still
working. So in that sense, that's -- we're not so tied to the undergraduate populations. We don't -- we

aren't kind of just out there being near university campus, that's kind of not our business model. But what
we are focused on are being close to the fundamental institutions in the United States that have pretty
strong computational, biological, chemical, all the right kind of areas where they're going to continue to
work and people will continue to visit labs and work in labs. So I don't think that changes anything we're
doing in the IOTA.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Joel
Marcus for closing remarks.
