Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Ecolab Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you
your host, Mr. Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Thank you, sir, you may begin.

Michael J. Monahan
Senior Vice President of External Relations

Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today
are Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with
our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results, are available on Ecolab's website at
ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, which
state that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future
performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those
projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section
in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted
earnings per share information in the release.

Starting with a few -- brief overview. Strong second quarter results reflected significant year-on-year sales
and earnings growth driven by recovering markets, accelerating pricing and new business wins, which
more than offset increased delivered product costs and the slower pace of reopenings outside the U.S. We
have implemented aggressive pricing actions to offset increased over product costs, leveraging the strong
product and service value we deliver to customers. When combined with our strong new business wins,
we expect to once again successfully manage the current inflation challenges and uneven global economic
recovery to deliver very strong sales and earnings growth in 2021.

Our position as a leader in food safety, clean water and healthy environments has become even more
important in the last 18 months. We believe this position, along with our strong long-term growth
opportunities, remain robust driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our leading global market
positions, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while lowering their
water, energy and other operating costs and through that, our ability to help them meet their growing ESG
ambitions. We believe that these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue to yield superior
long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors.

And now here's Christophe Beck with his comments.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Thank you so much, Mike, and thanks to all of you so for joining us today. As expected, Q2 was indeed a
very strong quarter for our company. Acquisition adjusted sales rose 12% driven by the U.S. and China,
with the reopening of Europe and the rest of the world expected to follow progressively. Adjusted earnings
per share ended up a strong 88% over last year. U.S. Institutional sales more than doubled in the second
quarter versus the same quarter in 2020, clearly outperforming the industry. The number of restaurants
we serve as well as the number of solutions they buy from us ended up almost back to 2019 levels and
are growing fast. Both are strong signs of how much business we've gained during the pandemic and the
growth potential we have as markets reopen.

Industrial accelerated to 3% in Q2 driven by strong business -- strong new business generated during the
pandemic and accelerated pricing. Water sales were up 7%, with light industries up 12% driven by strong
momentum in new segments like data centers, which, by the way, grew 53% in the quarter. Paper was up
10% driven by strong demand for our innovative solutions in board and packaging, while Food & Beverage
kept improving.

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Downstream remained a bit challenged in the quarter as it repositions itself from a focus on operational
efficiency, toward new promising sustainability offerings. Healthcare & Life Sciences also had very strong
and consistent underlying sales growth in Q2, with mid-single and double-digit growth, respectively.
Reported sales were only down as they respectively compare to exceptional growth of 13% and 53% in
2020, largely driven by unusual high demand and onetimers during the pandemic. And finally, the Other
segment grew 23% driven by continued strength of Pest Elimination, which was up 21% in the quarter,
benefiting from further markets reopening and very strong new business.

On the margin front, things progressed very well too, with overall margins improving 420 basis points.
Beyond the U.S. Institutional recovery, our continued progress benefited from accelerated investment
made in digital technology during the pandemic as well as overall pricing that accelerated to 2% in the
second quarter.

With this backdrop and for the full year, we remain confident of our ability to deliver adjusted earnings
that are better than 2019, excluding the Texas freeze. How much better is the only question, considering
the Delta variant, the timing of the opening in Europe and in the rest of the world as well as the speed and
amplitude of the rise of inflation.

More broadly, our longer-term outlook has never been stronger. Our new business and innovation pipelines
are at record levels. Our new growth engines, like Life Sciences, Healthcare, high tech and data centers,
are all very well-positioned to drive incremental growth. And our digital capabilities continue to increase
customer value, field productivity and customer experience.

Our main focus right now will be to leverage this positive pricing environment to protect and strengthen
our margins and do so while further enhancing value for our customers. This is something we've
accomplished many times in the past and expect to successfully accomplish once again. Therefore, we
have now embarked on a third round of price increases, which will progressively cover the new rapid rise
of input costs that we've seen in Q2, with the biggest impact to be seen in Q4 when we expect pricing to
reach 4%.

Overall, we feel good about our ability to deliver the second half of '21, even if the pacing between the
next 2 quarters will be slightly different than initially anticipated. We now expect attractive sequential
improvement in the third quarter and a more significant one in the fourth as pricing actions will hit the
P&L.

And finally, global trends in people health, like infection prevention and food safety, as well as planet
health, like water and carbon emissions, are becoming front and center for every business leader. And
there's no one positioned to help customers on both fronts better than Ecolab, while helping them ensure
strong and long-term business sales. In other words, we're strengthening our global position as the
natural sustainability partner for our customers. All this, combined with the strengthened highly innovative
portfolio, strong business momentum, terrific new wins, accelerated pricing and unique digital capabilities,
to position us with great momentum for '22 and will contribute to drive continued strong digital -- double-
digit earnings growth for the years to come.

With that, I look forward to your questions.

Michael J. Monahan
Senior Vice President of External Relations

Thanks, Christophe. That concludes our formal remarks. As a final note before we begin Q&A, we plan to
hold our 2021 Investor Day on Tuesday, September 14, in St. Paul.
Operator, please begin the question-and-answer period.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

So okay. So I want to focus on raw materials and price, which probably doesn't surprise you. But in the
face of raw material cost pressure, I think your typical formula is to increase price to make up for the
dollar amount in year 1 and then the margin in year 2. But in your press release, you said the recent
pricing actions you took remain ahead of input costs.

So I was hoping you could clarify this language a little bit. If your price minus cost dynamic is currently
positive, it sounds like you've already moved past Phase 1 and you're essentially already on Phase 2,
which is working to rebuild the margin. Am I reading into that statement incorrectly? Or is that how you
would characterize it?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

The general direction, Tim, is right. Actually, when I look at the first half of 2021, so I like a lot, where
pricing was compared to the input cost. We're usually good at that as well so to begin with. Now what has
changed is that the indices as we've all seen, you've seen that as well, so during the second quarter so
have changed for the much higher -- for the second half. And that has indicated we had to change our
pricing plans quite significantly.

It's been the third time we've done it so over the last 12 months. We've engaged those new plans as
well with the whole team. We have indicated that as well so to customers, and progress is good. So we
were ahead. Market has changed a little bit, which forced us to change our plans as well. And I feel good
right now that we will be in a good place so for the second half, both in terms of dollar and progressively
improving the margin.

And now, to that point, it's going to impact mostly Q4 obviously because it takes some time obviously to
agree with customers to get to that new pricing. So we will see a better improvement in Q4 than what we
have expected and a lower improvement in Q3 than what we had expected. But overall, so for the second
half, basically, at the same place as what we had planned initially.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. Very clear. And the announcement that you guys gave publicly in a press release, I think that
was specifically related to the Industrial segments. But presumably, you're also seeing cost pressures in
Institutional and Healthcare as well. Are you implementing price increases across those divisions as well?
Or is this really a conversation about Industrial primarily?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

We're implementing price increases in every business every year, Tim. This is really a practice that we
have, coached our teams and our customers for the many past years as well, really making sure it's not
an event, but it's really something that's happening every single year, really driven by the value we create
for our customers and not directly driven by the input cost, which is one of the elements, obviously, of
the discussion. So you're right, Industrial so takes the heaviest or biggest part. Because of their cost
structure, this is nothing new, and they're really good at it. So the majority of the price increase is in
Industrial, but the other businesses are moving up as well at the same time.

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just had a broad question, which is what do you need to see happen in terms of visibility before you can
start giving your detailed guidance like you used to. I was just hoping you could help us through some of
the moving pieces, maybe beyond just the Delta variant, I suppose.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes, hi, Manav. Good question. So it's all related to the variant, Delta, or D as it's called out there. As you
know, if you look at the past 20 years, we've always delivered so within our guidance, with the exception
of 9/11, unfortunately, so 20 years ago. So for us, the level of assurance and certainty is very high. And
we focus on everything we can control, including questions of price and inflation, as we just discussed.

The Delta variant is something that is really unusual, hard to predict as well. So that's the only question
mark that we have out there. The clearer things are going to become with vaccination rates, with how
governments and countries are reacting as well out there, well, will bring us closer to us providing as well
guidance.

We will get back to that. We like it. It's something that has been good for us and for investors as well
at the same time. So we'll get back when time is right. But so far, I would say if things do not change
materially, our directional guidance remains true, and we will firm it up as soon as variant D so becomes
more clear.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And just maybe on the margin front, I mean, if pricing is ahead of cost, and you've obviously
learned a lot, I think, in terms of efficiency from the past 15 months or so, so just curious if the
incrementals and the incremental margins in the business, should we think of that as getting better or
more of the same. Or any color there would be helpful.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Overall, for the second half, it's going to be the same. But obviously, so the input cost has changed quite
dramatically and the pricing has changed as well so quite a bit. We had initially thought so for the full year
that our input cost would increase kind of mid-single digit. That was the initial plan. The way we look at it
for the full year now, so it's closer to double digit numbers, so quite a change.

And we've changed pricing as well for that. We're good at it as well. But let's keep in mind as well that
in order so to get the margins back to where they used to be, we need to double the pricing versus the
input costs since we have a gross margin of 50%, so easy math as such. So overall, a good situation in
terms of pricing versus input cost. Second half is going to deliver a similar improvement than what we had
expected. But as mentioned earlier, the pacing between Q3 and Q4 will be different just because we need
some time in order to get the agreement with customers.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Christophe, just again on price versus raws, in Q3, do you expect pricing to again exceed input costs in
this quarter?

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Yes. The price will be ahead of the input cost. And as mentioned before, so our objective is not just to get
there, but it's to get back to the margins in percent that we used to have, and that takes a little bit more
time. But so far, things are going really well.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

You mentioned again Q3 being below your initial expectations with that catch-up in Q4. How much lower is
Q3 going to be below versus your prior expectations on a sequential earnings basis?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

This is hard to tell because it depends on agreements with customers, and it's a question of weeks/1 or 2
months. We do that very thoughtfully with our customers. So we're not a commodity-driven company. As
you know, we are all driven by the value we create for our customers, with whom we've had relationships
so for decades. So we are very careful in how we do that, really in order to make sure that a year from
now, while they still believe that we did it the right way, that it was good for them, well, it was good for us
as well.

So it's all timing-dependent for Q3. That's why I'm directionally saying it's going to be a little bit pressured
in Q3, and it's going to be better in Q4.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood.

Ryan Michael Connors
Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division

My first was just on -- you noted that the Institutional results were actually not only up nicely year-over-
year but actually outpaced the end market, at least as you saw there. Can you kind of give us some color
around what metrics or quantitative metrics you have around making that assertion? And then talk about
how sustainable that is going forward. Is that just a snapback in some specific markets you're in? Or do
you think you can continue to outperform as Institutional recovers?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

I like where we are in the U.S., especially since it's where the recovery so has happened first -- or second
after China, obviously, but the size is completely different. Maybe just to give you a few numbers as well
in here. You look at the restaurant, sales so were 9% down, so for us -- or 91% back to where they used
to be, which is a better way to look at it. 15% of the end units so have closed as well out there so in the
market. And the dine-in traffic, which means, so in the dining room, so it was down 37% as well in the
second quarter.

So with us being 91% of where we were before, so it's much better than where the market is. And the
second perspective is also we measure how many restaurants, or hotels for that matter, so we serve and
how many solutions they buy as well. And we are back to the levels that we were in 2019, knowing that
the traffic is not as high as it used to be. So when traffic is coming back up as well, our growth is going to
pick up further as well. So I see that as a sustained development.

Ryan Michael Connors
Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then on the flip side, there was a lot to like in the report, but Healthcare was a drag, which, I
mean, I guess we know that last year was the apex of the pandemic, but I'm a little bit surprised to see
that. Can you give us some dynamics around that? Is that sort of more virtual medicine that's driving
that? And what's the outlook for that Healthcare as we move into the recovery?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

No, it's just a comparison so versus exceptional results last year driven by the pandemic. So we're
comparing so 12% or 13% growth in Healthcare in Q2 of 2020 and 53% growth in Life Sciences as well,
so in Q2 driven as well so by pharma demand and as well infection prevention solutions as well in the
pharma sector.

What's important for me is really to look at the underlying growth. So when we strip out so the unusual
demand of 2020 and onetimers, you see Healthcare so in mid-single digit, which is better than where
we used to be. So this 2%, 3% in the past has moved so closer to the 5%-ish. And Life Sciences as well
underlying is in the double-digit territory, which is very good, so kind of sustained growth as well going
forward. So when you strip out the noise, basically, you get to this mid-single and double-digit growth for
Healthcare and Life Sciences, respectively.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just first question on margins, I wanted to ask a little differently. Obviously, Institutional still down from
pre-pandemic levels quite a bit, along with the revenue and the volumes. But the other 3 segments all had
second quarter margins ahead of the second quarter of '19. And I know you've had ongoing cost reduction
efforts, and there's a lot of moving parts, obviously, with the input costs in the short term and everything
else.

But outside of Institutional, which presumably will continue to see the margin recover with revenue, for
the other 3 businesses, is the margin this quarter a reasonable number to use to think about moving
forward other than maybe a little bit of raw material hit in Q3 and maybe you get that back in Q4? Or are
some of these that are still way above the 2019 margin, is there risk of some further giveback to get to a
more normal go-forward margin base for each of the segments?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes, all 3 segments are a bit in different places, but the headline is that the margin trends are a good
indication overall of where we are and where we're heading. But if I just unpack them, just for you, so
Industrial first. Yes, it's growing. But as mentioned before, so it's impacted the most by the input cost as
is always the case. So nothing unusual in here. They have also the biggest share in pricing, and they're
really good at it as well at the same time. So there are different elements of cost, and price are different.
But ultimately, so industrial is going to keep its development so in gross margin, and we expect the overall
year so to stay fairly close to where it used to be as well so last year.

Healthcare and Life Sciences, it's as mentioned before, so we're comparing to very unusual so growth
numbers in Q2 as well last year. And if you strip that out, ultimately, so our margins have improved very
nicely in 2020. And we expect as well in Healthcare, Life Sciences, so to get quite close to where we were
in terms of record margins in '21. And as you mentioned, so Institutional so is on its path to recover as
such, so it's maybe so the business where the margin we had in Q2, the improvement in Q2, so it was a
bit overstated as such because we compare in 2020 as well with 2 special events. The first one was the
bad debt that we recorded for obvious reasons in Q2 during the beginning of the pandemic. And second,
we foregone as well so the lease payments for dishmachines. So you compare to something that was
lower. As such, so it's going to change a little bit in Q3 and Q4.

But overall, for the company, a good situation in margin. And assuming that our assumption obviously,
so for raws and pricing, happen as planned, which I do ultimately, so margins should keep evolving as
expected.

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And then a quick follow-up. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that you put out there, refocus
in mining away from coal and alumina. I think you've alluded to that in the past, but also, I saw in
Downstream, some low-margin refinery exits. Are these material? Or is this more just sort of coming out
of the pandemic, trying to refocus the portfolio on the best opportunities? Any color on those, if there's
any other strategic sort of...

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Gary. So it's mostly the latter. So it's really so refocusing the portfolio towards the better
opportunities. The mining point, moving away from coal and refocusing towards fertilizers, for instance,
which are related to ag and to food, is something that we started, obviously, so way before the pandemic,
and it's working really well. So our exposure to coal so has become minimal over the past years, and
our exposure to the growth segment so has become much better as well. So risks are lower and growth
potential are higher, which is good.

On the Downstream side, it's a bit different. Downstream, it's a bit of a tale of 2 stories in here. So you
have petrochem, kind of plastics, which is an end market that's doing well. We've been growing for a long
time. We are still growing right now, and we were growing during the pandemic. So this is an end market
that we like and an end market that we want to further focus on. And we're bringing new solutions as well
so to recycle better plastic, for instance, which is very traditional with our sustainable solutions approach
for this business.

And then the last point is refining, which is an industry that is in a complete transformation. As we all
know, they have to reduce their footprint in terms of carbon footprint as well in here. And that's going
to take a few years. So for us, so to get it right in the way that we have refineries first to produce with a
lower carbon footprint and very good pilot project in there and help those companies as well refocus on
renewables as well.

So I like where we're going here, but that's going to take quite some time in order to get to a place where
it's sustained high-level growth as well in refining. So that's the way I would express it.

Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So I guess, maybe 2 quick ones. Just with regard to Europe and how you see the reopening or gradual
reopening impacting the businesses, can you give us a little bit of color or thoughts on how to think
about things sequentially from 2Q to 3Q and the pace of that reopening for both the Institutional and the
Industrial segments?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So hi, John. The Europe reopening happens so early Q3. Let's put it that way, as you've read as well
in the newspaper. I had a chance as well to spend a few weeks as well in Europe, so towards the end of
June. And Europe was clearly closed until June, then suddenly, reopened everything. So we've really seen
so a pickup in our Institutional business, so first and foremost, because it kind of went from 0 to kind of
open. Obviously, that's quite a dramatic change, and we've seen that in our numbers, so very encouraging
trends in Institutional Europe.

And we see Industrial, which was in a very different place, they were not closed, obviously, like
restaurants and hotels, improving as well. So overall, Europe doing okay so far and international overall as
well. It's an interesting perspective as well to keep in mind, where, last year, international was kind of flat,

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

which means outside North America. So it was kind of flat for the whole company. And we see it coming
back to growth, not only in Q2, but it's going to get even better in Q3. So good news on that front, too.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. No, that's helpful color. And then, I guess, from a raw material perspective, can you speak to
whether or not you had any issues in terms of sourcing raw materials and if that had any impact on the
businesses? Or has it really just been a function of inflation and just getting that through in terms of
pricing?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

It's a great question. The market is tight out there. The Texas freeze made it harder, obviously, so in
February for everyone out there. We're lucky enough to have a great procurement team, a great supply
chain team as well that could find alternative sourcing, that could reformulate product. So overall, it's
been heavy-lifting within the organization, but we've been able so to supply our customers in a fairly
continued manner during the second quarter, and we see that so improving as well in the quarters to
come. So bottom line, a lot of work, but the great teams are helping customers being supplied as they
should.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Labor is an issue for your Institutional customers right now. Is your Lobster software, or any of your other
digital offerings, enabling you to help your customers with their labor issues?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

It does. Actually, we're expecting to have close to 1 million users with Lobster Ink by the end of the year,
which is driven by exactly what you're saying. Those labor shortages in hotels and restaurants are creating
so new challenges for that industry. They need to train a lot of people coming into restaurants and hotels,
and that kind of solutions are definitely helpful. So that's the good side of the story.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then could you talk about some of your other new product offerings? So many of the new products,
like fast-acting, hard surface cleaners, had a surge last year. But are you still penetrating new customers?
Maybe talk about it in terms of market penetration or customers that you're adding.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

We are. Actually, when you think about it, the fact that we have as many restaurants buying as many
solutions as pre-pandemic today, in a market which has seen units so declining by 15% during that time,
is a direct outcome of, first and foremost, Ecolab Science Certified, which is the sort of the customer
program since the customers had to buy all the solutions in order to be certified as such. So that's been
a great story that's progressing very well. You've maybe seen that McDonald's as well, for instance, has
endorsed as well that program as well as the corporate companies, so great story here, which has driven
penetration of units and solutions, so really good.

And you're right. So when we think about sanitizing products, we've refocused quite a bit over the last 18
months, partly driven by the pandemic as well. All the surface sanitizers that we brought in the market
are doing really well, by the way, and we still see so a double-digit growth versus what we had so pre-

pandemic, which is a good sign. And we will keep innovating as well in that field, like with disinfecting
wipes, for instance, as well. So we've acquired 2 companies, one in the U.S., one in the U.K., in order to
supply as well that market. So, so far so good on the innovation front and especially on the disinfecting
side.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with CrÃ©dit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wonder -- just a point of clarification. The 4% price increasing, is that across all of Ecolab or just the
Industrial business? And if it's across all, is it 75% Industrial? Or just any way to frame out that 4%
increase overall that you talked to?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes, hi, Kevin. So 4% is for the whole company, and you will have more in Industrial because that's where
we bear the brunt of the cost increases as well. So you're going to have higher than 4% in Industrial. And
in the other businesses, you're going to have lower than 4 ultimately.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And then just within kind of the Downstream business overall, as you're clearly repositioning that,
any thoughts as to what percentage of the revenue for refining today and then where that ultimately
bottoms and ultimately, you're going into kind of higher growth areas as well? Just out of 100%, is there
ways to think about those end markets just within the Downstream business itself?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

It's hard to tell, but I would say that we've reached the bottom. In the refining part of Downstream right
now, so petrochem so has been doing well all along. So that's a bit of a different story, obviously, as such.
So I think it's going to improve progressively as of now in Downstream refining. But it's going to take us a
year or 2 to get to the right place where we can say so we truly like the trajectory of that business. It's an
industry that is in total transformation as well.

The good news is that we are uniquely positioned to work with those companies to help them get to the
better place. I've had great discussions with some of the CEOs of those companies lately as well. They
need us more than ever. That's especially true with European companies, but also in the U.S. So longer-
term, I think it's going to be a very good opportunity for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

You mentioned in the prepared comments in Specialty, in the food retail business, that you were seeing
sales reversion as expected, some of it, I think, coming just from less consumer demand, but also there
were labor issues from a customer perspective. And one of those things seems temporal and the other one
seems sort of a little bit more structural. So could you help us understand how to think about those trends
on a go-forward basis?

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Yes, hi, Vincent. So it's really because we're comparing to a strong Q2 in Specialty last year. It's a
business that's doing well actually. So it's a comparison question, underlying. So I like a lot so where
quickserve and food retail are heading, very strong businesses, very profitable and serving successful
industries right now as well. So it's the comparison that's kind of a little bit so skewing the numbers,
otherwise, underlying very good. And I see a future that's going to keep steady on what you've seen pre-
pandemic as well with those 2 businesses.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just as a follow-up. I assume you're on track for the $120 million of cost savings you've
targeted for this year, and I think the total number overall eventually was going to be $365 million. Are
those still the right numbers?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes, let me give that question so to Dan, who was looking forward to a question as well there. So that's a
perfect opportunity. So Dan?

Daniel J. Schmechel
Chief Financial Officer

Such a great question. So thank you. Yes, we remain very much on track to deliver our incremental $120
million year-on-year. And more broadly, maybe the A 2020 program, which has gone through a couple
of iterations, we feel very good about the progress that we've made sequentially, and we'll continue to.
Okay?

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.

Scott Andrew Schneeberger
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So my first -- I want to inquire about new business wins. A lot of the description today has been
recovering markets, but we -- in the press release, a lot of highlighted new business wins and that's
across Water, Paper, Science Certified, you talked about, and even Pest. Could you just elaborate a little bit
on maybe where you're getting the most strength and what type of wins you're getting?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Great question. Thank you, Scott. So new business, interestingly enough, is gaining traction in every end
market. We thought that in some markets, like the Institutional markets over the past 18 months, it would
have been way harder. Actually, it's one of the areas where we've made the most progress, which is really
good news. Industrial is doing really well and Healthcare as well, and Life Sciences has always been great
at it, which we see in the numbers as such. So a really good story.

I would say one of the new emerging stories in new business is, what many call, is net zero, with
many customers, are trying to get closer to the sustainability ambitions, so water-neutral or water-
positive or carbon-neutral, carbon-positive. And those discussions with those forward-looking companies,
interestingly enough, are strengthening our relationships with them because they need our help even
more than before. And that's growing as well as our new business opportunities because they need our
help in all the units around the world and need much more solutions as well from us in order to get closer
to the net zero ambition. So that's one of the new drivers that we're seeing emerging, which is good for
our company.

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Great. And then I think a good follow-up to that would be just to ask specifically on data centers and
animal health, some of your other emerging growth opportunities, just a progress report there. And any
quantification on pace of growth or margin expansion?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So starting with data centers, as mentioned earlier, so we've been growing, I think, 53% in the
second quarter. It's been a terrific story. It used to be part of our light water industries business. In the
past, we've created a dedicated unit, 12 or 18 months ago, which is really a division that's focused on data
centers and microelectronics, by the way, the Intel of that world as well.

And interestingly enough, it's new expertise that we could build, it's new offering that we could provide to
those companies that are really interested in close to 100% uptime for all the reasons that we understand,
our secure solutions as well from a digital technology perspective, they want to make sure that any access
that we have with them is done in a totally secure way as well. And those are companies that are very
sustainability-friendly as well. So they all want to get so close to the net zero as fast as they can. All that
is really driving that business in a great way.

Animal health is a complete different story. Obviously, as such, this is something that takes time as well.
We've created a dedicated unit. We've made acquisitions as well in that field. Underlying, I like where
we're going. Q2 has been a bit subpar because we compare it to a very high Q2 in 2020, but that's a
business that's going to be very interesting going forward for at least one important reason, that most
of the farmers won't be or are not allowed so to use antibiotics to protect the animals, and they need
way more solutions in order to make sure that they are in a healthy environment in order not to get sick.
And this is exactly what animal health is doing in our business. So it's an evolving proposition, but that's
clearly aligned with the longer-term trends that customers and consumers like you and I ultimately are
expecting so from the food manufacturers.

Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.

Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli
G. Research, LLC

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about M&A. You have been making small acquisitions. Do you
have an appetite for larger ones? And are there targets that you would be interested in?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So the short answer is yes. We're interested in M&A and larger ones. We've done smaller ones over the
past few months, as mentioned earlier, in the wipes area, which is a perfect complement to our offering
in Institutional, in Healthcare and in Industrial, and we couldn't produce that ourselves. So we worked
on manufacturing with other companies, and we've seen during the pandemic that, that could be a great
business so for us today and especially going forward. So we've done that as well. We've done animal
health as well last year, as I just mentioned as well so to the previous question.

And we've been extremely active on the M&A front over the last 6 months. We have a very rich pipeline.
We have very serious discussions with many as well out there. But at the end of the day, we have this
very disciplined line on what we do and what we don't do. And when I look at all the discussions that
we've had so far, we didn't find the exact opportunity so right now. But I feel confident that in the future,
so we will get to a bigger opportunity at the right time.

interesting, so for us; Life Sciences, which is a very successful business serving a very large, and a high-
growth as well, end market; and third, so related to digital technology as well. So those are kind of 3
areas that are very interesting for us.

Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

Eric B Petrie
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

It's Eric Petrie on for P.J. You noted you were gaining share in U.S. restaurants. I was wondering if you
had a similar data point on lodging. And then in both restaurants and lodging, how does that compare in
Europe and Asia?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So my comment was mostly focused on restaurants because it was a highly impacted area. I like the
progress we're making in hotels a lot as well and mostly because of the offering that we provide them in
terms of automation, ease of application of our solutions. You've heard about the staff shortages that they
all have.

ECOLAB INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

I've had the chance to talk to a few CEOs as well so lately from large hotel chains in the U.S. and abroad,
and this is top of mind so for them. So the solutions that we have, which are not new, those are things
that we've been doing so for many, many years, are ultimately helping them clean quicker, which is
something they really so are challenged with right now or in the dish room as well, so to clean dishes in
an easier way, faster way, with less labor as well. The same on Water, the same on housekeeping and so
on. And those are solutions that are ultimately helping us sell new business in lodging. So good progress
in lodging as we've seen as well in foodservice.

Eric B Petrie
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And just a follow-up then to clarify, would you say you're gaining share in restaurants in Europe and Asia
as well? Or is that not settled out?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

We have less numbers over there, and to be honest, so those markets are reopening right now. So we've
gained new business. We have to see how it looks in practice then afterwards. So I think that in the
months and quarters to come, I will be in a better position so to really share so whether we've gained,
which I believe we will, but I want to have the facts first or not.

Eric B Petrie
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And second, for my follow-up question, how much were your sanitizer and hard surface cleaners
sales down in the quarter? And what do you expect in terms of moderation for second half?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So sanitizing sales so were -- so just to put in perspective, it's 10% of our overall sales for the company.
We had significant growth last year. And we expect to be lower than last year overall. So we don't disclose
all the detailed numbers, but quite a bit higher than 2019. And that's probably the way you need to think
about that, so lower than the peak of the pandemic, thank God, but higher than 2019 because practices
have changed in most end markets and countries.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just a quick one to follow up on the discussion earlier of the shifts away from some of the lower-margin
businesses like refining. If you look at the moves you've done over the last couple of years, can you give
a rough sense for how much sales you've moved away from sort of some of the out-of-favor business
segments over the last couple of years, how much stronger your sales line would have been if you hadn't
done that, calling up the mix?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

It's a great question, Laurence, but I have no idea because it's something that we're doing all along in
every business. The focus is really so to move up the chain, move up the margins. It can't be driven only
by pricing. It needs to be because we are focusing on the higher-margin segments, higher-margin offering
as well. So it's a continuous work, where, in some areas, it's more extreme, like the coal, as mentioned
before, or refining in Downstream that are more significant. But I couldn't put a number exactly on that
because it's a continuous process.

Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.

Shlomo H. Rosenbaum
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Christophe, I want to ask you a little bit about how the company is leveraging the technology investments
as it approaches the C level of an organization in terms of their sustainability. So my understanding is
this is enabling Ecolab to start discussions with the C-suite as opposed to starting discussions more at the
plant level. And I'm wondering how are those discussions progressing. Is there an increased pace? Are
you seeing a large potential for you to accelerate or an incremental potential for you to accelerate Ecolab's
revenue growth by being able to sell further up the chain within the organizations?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Hey, thank you, Shlomo. This is a great topic. I would love to start with way more time, so we can zero in
on that, but maybe so 2 quick answers, the what and the how. First, on the what. We have always more
customers. It's not new, but it's clearly accelerating. So customers that are asking us, so partner with us
in order to find a path, in order to get to net zero or positive water or carbon, Microsoft being one of the
obvious ones, and it's not a secret since they've been expressing that in -- on CNN so over the past year
or so.

So in order to get there, you need to have digital technology because you need to understand to make it
easy to recycle water, which is a physical product. We need to understand in real-time the quality of the
water or lack thereof, actually, which indicates what kind of chemistry we need or what kind of technology
is required in order to bring it back to the standard level that's being used in a data center or in a food
plant as such. This is the direct application of our digital technology.

And second is the how. Since we are serving thousands of locations out there in the world, we are
uniquely placed to know what's the world-class performance that can be achieved. Take a brewery, for
instance, how much water per hectoliter of beer that's being produced. Well, we can compare within a
company, a brewing company, how does the performance of the individual plants compared to the best-
in-class. We can compare across brewers as well. We can compare across industries as well as a company
as well. So we can provide customers with good benchmark of what good looks like and second, how
to get there as well. That's all enabled by digital technology that we've been building, developing and
implementing so over the last 10, 20 years around the world.

Shlomo H. Rosenbaum
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And so is that -- I guess just to keep that going. So is that -- do you see a potential for that to
really incrementally improve the revenue growth of the business because you're able to sell at the higher
levels, obviously bringing the capabilities that other companies can't bring to the table?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. So what you saw with data centers, so the growth of 53% is directly driven by that.
And our light as well, which has been growing 7% as well in the quarter, is also driven by that kind of
solutions. So early indications are positive, and the more we can implement that across the end markets,
the more it's going to help us as well as a company.

Shlomo H. Rosenbaum
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. If you don't mind my sneaking in one more. Just the areas that are completely open now
in terms of restaurants, let's say, taking the Florida or Texas, how does the chemical usage compare to
what it was pre-COVID? What are the levels in the restaurants that were customers before and are still
customers?

President, CEO & Director

It's still lower today, Shlomo, because the dine-in, so the dine-in rooms are, as mentioned before, so
in Q2, it was 37% down so versus pre-pandemic, as such, which means that the usage of cleaning and
sanitizing solutions has been lower as well. But as dine-in is going up, so the demand is going up as
well at the same time. So the fact that we have the same number of units buying the same number of
solutions today ultimately is a good sign as well so for compound growth, when dine-in is going to pick up
as well in the weeks and months to come.
