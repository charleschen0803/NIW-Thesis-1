COMERICA INCORPORATED FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 19, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Comerica quarterly earnings call.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead, ma'am.

Darlene P. Persons
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference
Call. Participating on this call will be our President, Chairman and CEO, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial
Officer, Jim Herzog; Chief Credit Officer, Melinda Chausse; and Executive Director of our Commercial Bank,
Peter Sefzik. During this presentation, we will be referring to slides, which provide additional details. The
presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC's website as well as in the Investor
Relations section of our website, comerica.com.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the
risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any
forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor statement in today's release on Slide 2, and I
incorporate it into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that can cause actual results to differ.

Now I'll turn the call over to Curt, who will begin on Slide 3.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. As we all know, 2020 was a very trying
year, and I could not be more proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers,
communities and each other during this unprecedented time. It has been truly remarkable.

When I assumed the role of Chairman in January, the fundamentals of the economy were strong, and I
was looking forward to working with our executive team to execute our relationship banking strategy.
Then in March, our focus shifted due to COVID. Despite the many challenges the pandemic posed, we
have proven our resilience and achieved many important accomplishments along the way. This includes
the bank and the Comerica Charitable Foundation together providing $11 million in assistance to local
communities and businesses. We funded $3.9 billion in PPP loans to small and medium-sized companies.

We were able to quickly enable the majority of our employees to work remotely and introduce programs to
provide support, such as Promise Pay and dependent care stipends. As consumers' desire to utilize digital
channels increased, we enhanced our online capabilities for deposit accounts as well as loan originations.
Also, we achieved our 2020 environmental goals set in 2012 to meaningfully reduce our water, waste,
paper and GHG emissions. Our commitment to corporate responsibility was recognized, including receiving
high marks from Newsweek, DiversityInc, Civic 50, CDP and Corporate Knights. The compassion and
tireless efforts of our colleagues across the bank has allowed Comerica to persevere and remain in a
strong position as we move forward.

Slide 4 provides a review of our 2020 financial results, which included solid loan performance and a record
level of deposits. This growth, combined with prudent management of loan-to-deposit pricing, an action
we took to deploy excess liquidity, helped offset the pressure of rates dropping to ultra-low levels. In
light of the swift deterioration in the economy, we significantly increased our credit reserve and took a
large provision in the first quarter. While we saw some negative credit migration through the year, it has
been manageable, and our net charge-offs for the year were 38 basis points or 14 basis points, excluding
Energy, a true testament to our relationship banking strategy and deep credit experience.

COMERICA INCORPORATED FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 19, 2021

Card fees and securities trading income were strong, while other fees, such as deposit service charges and
commercial lending fees, were impacted by the slowdown in economic activity. Expenses remained well
controlled and included COVID-related costs. We maintained our strong capital levels, and our book value
grew 7% to over $55 per share. In summary, a solid performance, particularly considering the difficult
environment.

Our fourth quarter performance is outlined on Slide 5. We generated earnings of $215 million or $1.49 per
share, a 3% increase over the third quarter, driven by an increase in revenue and strong credit quality.
Compared to the third quarter, loans essentially performed as we expected. While lower on a quarter-over-
quarter basis, average loans increased in December rather to November by nearly $300 million, excluding
PPP loan repayments. Our loan pipeline continued to grow through the year to pre-COVID levels at year-
end. Average deposits increased by nearly $1.5 billion to an all-time high, with 55% of the growth derived
from noninterest-bearing accounts.

Customers continue to prudently manage their cash, cutting costs and reducing leverage. Yet they remain
cautiously optimistic that the economy will pick up in the back half of this year. Net interest income
increased $11 million, benefiting from our continued careful management of loan-to-deposit pricing,
combined with the contribution from fees related to PPP loan forgiveness. This was partly offset by lower
loan balances. In addition, lower yields on our securities portfolio were mostly offset by actions we took in
the third quarter to deploy a portion of excess liquidity by increasing the size of the portfolio.

As far as credit, our metrics remained strong, and our provision was a credit of $17 million. Criticized
loans declined, and net charge-offs were only 22 basis points. Positive portfolio migration and a slight
improvement in the economic forecasts resulted in a reduction of the credit reserve to just under $1 billion
or nearly 3x nonperforming assets. Through the cycles, our credit performance relative to the industry has
been a key differentiator, and I believe we will continue to outperform.

Noninterest income increased $13 million or 5%, as customer activity continued to rebound. This included
strong derivative income and commercial lending fees. We continue to maintain our expense discipline
as we invest for the future. While expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, this was primarily driven
by performance incentives as well as outside process related to our card platform. Our capital levels
remained strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.35%, above our target of 10%. As always, our priority is
to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth, while providing an attractive return to our
shareholders.

And now, I will turn the call over to Jim.

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, average loans decreased approximately
$600 million or 1%, which compared favorably to the industry HA data. Loans in Corporate Banking and
General Middle Market decreased as customers are performing well, prudently managing their business to
increase cash flow and reduce debt. For the fourth consecutive quarter, Energy loans decreased and are at
the lowest level since 2011.

The U.S. rig count is less than half of what it was a year ago. However, it has been gradually increasing
since late summer, as oil prices began to recover. Technology and Life Sciences loans declined about $180
million, mainly due to M&A and increased liquidity, driven by fundraising activity and company's reducing
cash burn. Equity Fund Services, which provides capital call lines to investment companies, increased
$244 million as activity has picked up with new fund formation. National Dealer increased $190 million
as inventory levels are rebuilding, yet remains $2 billion below fourth quarter 2019. Mortgage Banker
reached a new record with strong activity in both refi and home sales.

Period-end loans were stable and included a decline in PPP balances of $298 million, primarily due to
loan forgiveness. Line utilization at year-end for the total portfolio remained relatively low at 48%.
Loan yields increased 7 basis points with accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness and continued pricing
actions, particularly adding LIBOR floors when possible as loans renew. Average deposits increased 2%

COMERICA INCORPORATED FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 19, 2021

or $1.5 billion to a new record of $70.2 billion, as shown on Slide 7. The largest driver continues to be
noninterest-bearing deposits and growth has been broad-based with increases in nearly every business
line.

Customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances. Period-end deposits increased
over $4.4 billion. Timing of monthly benefit activity in our government prepaid card business increased
balances by $2.2 billion at quarter end. However, this does not include the latest stimulus payments,
which were received in early January. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to
72%. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 11 basis points, a decrease
of 6 basis points from the third quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 10 basis points.

As you can see on Slide 8, the average balance of the securities portfolio increased. This was due to the
third quarter purchase of $2.25 billion in additional securities, primarily treasuries, as we took some action
to put some of our excess liquidity to work. The additional securities, combined with lower rates on the
replacement of prepays, which totaled about $1 billion, resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining
to 1.95%. We expect repayments of MBS to continue to be about $1 billion per quarter and yields on
reinvestments to be in the low-to-mid 100 basis point range.

Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income increased $11 million to $469 million, and the net interest margin
was up 3 basis points to 2.36%. Interest income on loans increased $6 million, adding 4 basis points to
the margin. Higher fees, mostly related to PPP loan forgiveness and continued pricing actions as loans
renew, together added $10 million and 4 basis points to the margin. Other portfolio dynamics, including
higher nonaccrual income, added $1 million. The decrease in loans had a $5 million unfavorable impact.

Lower securities yields had a $6 million or 3 basis point negative impact. This was mostly offset by
the higher balance, which added $5 million. Average balances of the Fed increased over $500 million,
impacting the margin by 1 basis point. Our extraordinarily high Fed balances of $13 billion continue
to weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately 43 basis points. Finally, prudent
management of deposit pricing added $5 million and 3 basis points to the margin and lower rates on
wholesale funding added $1 million.

Given the nature of our portfolio, our loans were priced very quickly as rates dropped earlier last year. So
the bulk of the impact from lower rates has been absorbed. Also, while deposit rates are at record lows,
we continue to manage deposit pricing with a close eye on the competitive environment and our liquidity
position. Overall, credit quality was strong, as shown on Slide 10. Gross charge-offs were only $39 million,
a decrease of $14 million from the third quarter. Net charge-offs were $29 million or 22 basis points.

Nonperforming assets increased $24 million, yet remained below our historical norm at 69 basis points of
total loans. Inflows to nonaccrual were about half of the amount of the third quarter and the lowest level
of any quarter since the pandemic began. Criticized loans declined $459 million and comprised 6% of the
total portfolio. We believe our disciplined underwriting and diverse portfolio are assisting us in managing
through the pandemic conditions. Positive migration in the portfolio, combined with a modestly improved
economic outlook, resulted in a small decrease in our allowance for credit losses.

As the path to full economic recovery remains uncertain due to the unprecedented challenges of the
COVID-19 pandemic, our reserve ratio remains elevated at 1.90% or 2.03%, excluding PPP loans. We are
well positioned with a relatively high credit reserve and overall improving credit quality. Slide 11 provides
detail on segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment. Period-end loans in the
social distancing segment declined slightly. Criticized loans were stable, and nonaccruals remain under
1%. This segment has performed better than expected, but issues can be lumpy and sudden and resulted
in a net charge-offs of $21 million in the fourth quarter.

The new round of PPP will certainly be helpful for customers that are challenged by the current
environment. Energy loans decreased 13% to $1.6 billion at quarter end, representing 3% of our total
loans. Oil prices have increased, and credit quality has improved with reductions in criticized, nonaccruals
and net charge-offs. We have seen a little more capital markets activity and fall redeterminations resulted
in only a slight decrease in borrowing basis due to lower reserves. Additional information can be found

in the appendix. While we're pleased with the performance of these segments, we have applied a more
severe economic forecast to them and believe we're well reserved.

Noninterest income increased $13 million, as outlined on Slide 12, continuing the positive trend we've
seen since post the shutdown of the economy earlier last year. Fourth quarter includes increased customer
activity in most categories. Customer derivative income increased $8 million with higher volume due to
interest rate swaps and energy hedges, combined with the change in the impact from the credit valuation
adjustment. Specifically, there was an unfavorable adjustment of $6 million in the third quarter and a
favorable adjustment of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter.

Commercial lending fees increased $5 million with a seasonal pickup in syndication activity and higher
unutilized line fees. We had smaller increases in fiduciary, foreign exchange and letters of credit. Also,
card fees remained very strong due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic
stimulus and changes in customer behavior related to the COVID environment. Securities trading income,
which includes fair market adjustments for investments we hold related to our Technology and Life
Sciences business, decreased $5 million from elevated levels generated over the last couple of quarters.
Note, deferred comp asset returns were $9 million, a $1 million increase from the third quarter and are
offset in noninterest expenses. All in all, a strong quarter for fee income.

Turning to expenses on Slide 13. Salaries and benefits increased $14 million, with higher performance-
based incentives, severance, staff insurance expense and technology-related labor. Note that on a full
year basis, salary and benefit expense was stable, with a reduction in incentive compensation, offsetting
annual merit, higher deferred comp and COVID-related costs. We realized a $7 million increase in outside
processing due to card activity, technology spend as well as PPP program costs.

Occupancy increased $2 million due to a catch-up in maintenance projects that were delayed due to
COVID as well as seasonal expenses. There is also a seasonal increase in advertising expense. Our strong
expense discipline is well ingrained and is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest
for the future. Our capital levels remained strong, as shown on Slide 14. Our CET1 ratio increased to an
estimated 10.35%, above our target of 10%. As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our
customers and drive growth, while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In this regard, we've
maintained a very competitive dividend yield.

As far as share repurchases, we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning
excess capital generated to shareholders. As we sit here today, a great deal of uncertainty remains about
the ultimate pace of the economic recovery, whether it'd be faster or slower than economists forecast. For
that reason, we have paused our share repurchases and look forward to restarting the program as soon as
we deem it prudent to do so.

Slide 15 provides our outlook for the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter as well as some color on
the year ahead. In the first quarter, we expect National Dealer loans to continue to increase at a moderate
pace as auto inventory rebuilds. Also, Middle Market is expected to grow as a result of increased economic
activity. However, this will be more than offset by Mortgage Banker declining from its record high due to
seasonally lower purchase and refi volumes.

Energy is expected to decrease due to higher oil prices, driving improved cash flow and capital markets
activity. As far as PPP loans, we expect the pace of loan forgiveness could potentially exceed the second
round of fundings. Looking past the first quarter, excluding PPP loan activity and based on improving
economic conditions, we expect loans to grow throughout the year. We expect average deposits to remain
strong in the first quarter as customers continue to carefully manage their liquidity.

As far as net interest income, continued management of loan and deposit pricing is expected to be
accretive, albeit to a lesser degree than we've seen so far. We are currently in the process of deploying
some excess liquidity by repaying $2.8 billion of FHLB advances over an 8-week period, which will provide
a modest lift. These benefits are expected to be more than offset by reduced loan balances, lower yields
on securities, slightly lower LIBOR as well as 2 fewer days in the quarter.

COMERICA INCORPORATED FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 19, 2021

As we move through the year, assuming there's no change from rates that we experienced in the fourth
quarter, we expect quarterly pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be mostly offset by loan
growth, excluding PPP impacts. We expect net charge-offs to increase from low levels we've seen recently.
However, with our credit reserve at year-end at over 2% of loans, excluding PPP, we believe we are well
positioned to manage through this period of economic uncertainty.

We expect noninterest income in the first quarter to benefit from higher deposit service charges, fiduciary
and brokerage fees. As deferred comp is difficult to predict, we assume it will not be repeated. We expect
a seasonal decline in syndication activity. Also, card, warrants and securities trading income are expected
to decline from elevated levels. As we progress through the year, we believe that customer-driven fee
categories, in general, should grow with improving economic conditions. We expect expenses to be lower
in the first quarter.

Our pension expense is expected to decline $9 million in the first quarter to get to the new run rate for
2021. The decline is primarily due to strong investment performance in 2020. As I mentioned, we do not
forecast deferred comp of $9 million to repeat. Also, marketing and occupancy expenses are expected
to be seasonally lower and there are 2 less days in the quarter. Partly offsetting all of this, first quarter
includes annual stock comp and associated higher payroll taxes.

We remain focused on maintaining our expense discipline while we invest in the future. Therefore, on a full
year basis, we expect higher salary expense related to normal merit and incentive comp as well as higher
tech spend will be mostly offset by lower pension and deferred comp returns. We expect a 22% tax rate,
excluding discrete items. Finally, as mentioned on the previous slide, we remain focused on maintaining
our strong capital levels and providing an attractive return to shareholders.

Now I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Jim. While difficult and uncertain conditions persist, I'm confident that our team will continue
to adapt and thrive as we have over the past year. We expect the economy will improve in 2021. We
believe firming trade and manufacturing conditions, increasing business and consumer confidence, as well
as pent-up demand will support solid economic growth, particularly in the back half of the year.

Comerica has a long history of successfully managing through challenging times. We have demonstrated
our resiliency and unwavering dedication to provide a high level of customer service as we navigate the
COVID pandemic. We maintain a culture that drives continuous efficiency improvement. We believe this
will assist us in preserving our cost base as the economy improves, and we continue to invest in our
future.

Our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continues to serve us well. Utilizing our deep
expertise and experience to help our customers navigate these difficult times builds and solidifies
long-term relationships. These key strengths provide the foundation to continue to deliver long-term
shareholder value. This has been demonstrated by our ROE, which increased over 11% in the fourth
quarter, and our book value per share which grew 7% over the past year, as well as the current dividend
yield, which remains above 4%.
Thank you for your time, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens.

Terence James McEvoy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Maybe start with the outlook for loans. I believe you said about $300 million of loan growth you
experienced or saw in December. How much of that was within General Middle Market? And I'm just
trying to get behind some of your optimism about growth in that portfolio, at least in the early part and
throughout 2021.

Peter L. Sefzik
Executive VP & Executive Director of Commercial Bank

Terry, it's Peter. Thanks for the question. Yes. The month of December was -- felt really good. It actually
felt like kind of pre-COVID environment. I don't know that I would say that it was robust, per se, though,
in General Middle Market or our general Business Banking businesses. Those businesses continue to do
really well. But we saw a little more of our momentum, I think, in some of our specialty businesses than
just pure Middle Market. Now that said, I do feel good about sort of where the pipeline is going into the
year. We're encouraged by what we are seeing in that segment. And hopefully, the first quarter will be
a little bit better than what we've been seeing in this COVID world. So again, I think that most of our
general businesses are still -- have this headwind of -- that you're seeing with COVID across the country,
making it a little challenging.

Terence James McEvoy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And then as a follow-up, I just saw the severance expenses on Slide 13 were at least higher in the fourth
quarter. Could you just talk -- is there internally a plan to maybe reduce the headcount and focused on
expenses? And I know you talked about the first quarter expense trends. Any thoughts on full year 2021
core expense growth kind of netting out some of the moving parts that we see quarter-to-quarter?

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, Terry. This is Jim. Thanks for the question. Regarding the severance that we had in the fourth quarter,
I would say that, that was specifically targeted in certain areas just to restructure and make sure that we
had the right staffing both to fit the skill sets that we need in certain areas and also as part of some of the
transition we've had with new leaders. So it's really more optimizing our org structure as opposed to an
expense reduction play.

Regarding just core expenses going forward, I'll just say that we clearly had some expenses in the fourth
quarter that elevated our run rate. And I certainly would not look at the fourth quarter as an example of
what the run rate will be going forward. As we look into the full year for 2021, as we mentioned in the
opening remarks, I do expect that lower pension expense and deferred comp will mostly offset merit, tech
spend and a little bit of a reset of stock comp given the COVID year that we had this year. So we'd expect
expenses just to be slightly up on a year-to-year basis.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.

COMERICA INCORPORATED FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 19, 2021

Question in terms of provision guidance. Obviously, I see it's reflective of the economy. I guess my 2
questions on this. What does your economic model expect to happen that you're building in for your
provision? And if that does play out as you expect, how do you see provision expense trending going
forward?

Melinda A. Chausse
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Ken, this is Melinda. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously, the small reserve release that we had
this quarter was really reflective of the really strong credit performance of the portfolio and the modestly
continuing to improve economic forecast. We use a variety of forecasts in the CECL provisioning process
that go through different scenarios, including recovery as well as some additional stress in the more stress
scenarios. Assuming no material change to the credit profile, which, based on all the factors that we see
today, we're not expecting any material credit deterioration and that the macroeconomic outlook stays
stable to slightly -- continuing to improve as we go throughout 2021.

And probably most importantly that the current level of uncertainty has started to abate, i.e., we get past
the next couple of months of this COVID resurgence the vaccine rollout accelerates and the efficacy is
proven out. Reserve levels are definitely going to come down. It's impossible to tell you exactly how that's
going to play out. As you know, CECL is a very complex accounting exercise that we go through each
quarter. But we expect to be moving towards pre-COVID levels over the course of 2021 and perhaps into
the early part of 2022.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

All right. No, that's very helpful. And then just a follow-up question. In terms of the accelerated PPP
fees, can you just clarify again? How are you accounting for the anticipated accelerated fees in your NII
guidance?

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, Ken. We exclude PPP from that guidance since it is unpredictable in terms of where it would go. When
I look at PPP, we noted that we had pretty strong fees in the fourth quarter, the majority of which -- of
that increase was PPP. I would expect in the first quarter that amount of accelerated fees to about double
from the increase that we saw in the fourth quarter. I wouldn't necessarily expect overall PPP income to
double in first quarter compared to fourth, just because the rate of loan forgiveness will probably exceed
the new round 2 that's coming on board.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got you. Okay. So when you said -- and I think if I heard this correctly, for the full year for NII, I think you
were assuming the lower security yields largely offset by loan growth. So if we assume relatively stable
NII, then any accelerated PPP fees would be on top of that. So it would be technically going from flat to
something positive on the NII side. Is that the right way of thinking about it?

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

That is the right way of thinking about it. It will clearly be higher in 2021 because of accelerated PPP fees,
but I was excluding that from guidance.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.

COMERICA INCORPORATED FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 19, 2021

I wonder -- if I could just hop over to your commentary on buybacks, I know you indicated that you plan
and remain on the sidelines right now, pending some clarity around the macro backdrop. But can you give
us a little bit more detail there? Like what exactly are you looking for in terms of data points on the macro
backdrop to get you comfortable that you can start to put some of the excess capital to work?

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

All right, John, thanks. This is Jim. When you look at where we're at today, we're actually at the peak of
the COVID pandemic. I think we just had a record in terms of daily deaths in the last week or so. And so
we just think it's prudent to wait and look for a little more clear line of sight in terms of where this thing is
going. We feel like we already returned a fair amount of capital just due to the relatively stronger dividend
we have compared to peers. We are just looking forward to starting the share buyback. We just think it's
prudent to wait to see where things go because we want to make sure we're there for the customers,
should things either take off faster than expected. Or what we're more focused on is what would happen if
the economy took a step backwards, and we needed to be there for our customers, and there were some
economic ramifications to the step down. And so we're just being careful and watching for a clearer line of
sight, and we'll look forward to starting it at the appropriate time.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. All right. And then, separately, on the margin front, I know you don't really give explicit margin
guidance, but just wanted to get your thoughts on some of the -- maybe if you can help us how to think
about the NIM progression from here, given the PPP benefit. But also you've got the steeper curve, which
is certainly a factor, but also the expectation that short rates remain low. So I just wanted to see if you
can help us with that? And then, secondarily, if you can maybe give us some color on your new money
loan yields by portfolio if you have that?

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. We can answer that in a couple of different ways. I mean, number one, the PPP income will be a little
bit lumpy by quarter. So as I mentioned earlier, we will exclude that from the guidance. Overall, we will
have more PPP income in 2021, certainly than we did in 2020. And as we mentioned during the script, I
do expect the impact from rates. Even though the yield curve has deepened, as you point out, we're still
adding securities in that low 100 bp range, and so we are adding securities at a lower rate than what we
are running off.

And then on top of that, you'll notice in the appendix, we are going to have in the second half of the year
some lumpy treasury maturities as well as some hedges that start to mature, not in a big way. But due to
all those factors, we will see a little bit of rate pressure each quarter. And I do that -- I do see that mostly
offsetting or perhaps a little more than offsetting the loan growth benefit that we get. Now PPP would be
totally separate from that. And again, we will see some significant amounts of accelerated fee income as
the year goes on, both due to round 1 as well as round 2. So hopefully, that helps make it a little bit more
clear.

COMERICA INCORPORATED FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 19, 2021

Yes. No. I was just asking about the new money loan yields, if you happen to have that by the different
types of the different loan categories.

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

John, as you see from the slide, we've actually been having some pretty good success with our loan yields
and the pricing of new business coming on board. We actually did have a slightly lower LIBOR in the
quarter, about 1.5 bps down. Yet you'll notice that due to pricing actions, we showed an increase of $3
million just due to pricing dynamics overcoming that lower LIBOR. So you can take away from that, that
loan yields are holding up quite well. In fact, they're accretive right now. Now we don't expect that to
continue at that same rate, as I mentioned, because there are competitive pressures and there is a lot of
excess liquidity out there. But up until now, they've been holding up quite well.

Peter L. Sefzik
Executive VP & Executive Director of Commercial Bank

Yes. John, it's Peter. I would just add. I mean, pricing continues to be very competitive out there in
the marketplace. Depending on which line of business you might be talking about it, it's maybe more
opportunity for us than others. It just sort of depends. But to Jim's point, I think we've done a really good
job of maintaining our pricing and producing good yields for the bank. And so far, we've been able to keep
doing that, and I think we'll be able to do it going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

So I wanted to ask if we -- assuming that rates stay low at the short end and we get a bit more
steepening, could you give a little bit more color on when you would expect the trajectory of net interest
income to stop declining? And then, I guess, within the securities portfolio, if you could discuss what
kind of reinvestment rates you're seeing relative to the 1.95% and maybe a little bit more color on what
opportunity a steeper curve represents? That would be great.

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, Bill, it's Jim. Thanks for the question. We -- it's really the short rates that drive our net interest
income here at Comerica. And so even with a little bit more steepening in the yield curve, we're still going
to have some pressure on the securities line. In fact, the 1.95% you mentioned, right now, we're adding
securities in the low 1s. And so it would take quite a bit of steep things to head off that deterioration that
we're seeing. And in addition, we are seeing some lumpy maturities with treasuries, as you see, again, in
the appendix as well as swaps. And that has quite a delta between what we'd either reinvest those in or
if they just fell to cash at the Fed. So it really would take a change in short-term rates to see any kind of
material movement upward in our ongoing net interest income on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Understood. That's very helpful. And I had a follow-up on expenses and efficiency more broadly, if I could.
Can we see a return to positive operating leverage without higher rates, given the dynamics that you were
just describing on net interest income?

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Bill, this is Curt. I might just talk a little bit about our sort of income-generating potential and just sort of
our outlook from a growth perspective going forward. And your question was specifically about efficiency

ratio, but I might first just comment that the last 2 quarters, we were able to generate double-digit ROE in
what has been a pretty challenging environment. And we continue to feel really good about our long-term
financial model and really our long-term financial outlook and our business model. And as always, we're
focused on the things that we can control. We think we've got a very attractive franchise. We're in a lot of
very high-growth markets that we do believe should perform better than the U.S. as a whole as we come
out of the COVID situation and hit the second half of the year.

So we do believe that we'll see higher customer demand, loan activity, et cetera. And as you know,
we've got a lot of depth and expertise in Middle Market, Business Banking, a number of sort of unique
businesses. And beyond just sort of the balance sheet growth opportunity, we continue to maintain a very
attractive deposit base. And most financial institutions are flush with deposits right now. But we really feel
like what we've got is very relationship-oriented deposits, and we've done a very good job of relationship
pricing with those deposits.

Credit continues to do very well. We think we will outperform relative to our peer group in that area, which
we think we're newer to our overall financial performance. And then we're very focused on 2 other things
I would mention is just fee income and how we can generate more fee income as an institution, especially
in the card area, treasury management, wealth management. We've got strong capabilities there. We've
been doing a lot to continue to invest in those areas. And we, again, think that will help in terms of our
overall financial performance. And while expenses were up some for the quarter, we do feel like that's not
necessarily run rate, but just some unique items that hit us in the fourth quarter.

And our expense discipline is very ingrained in our culture, and we're always looking for opportunities
to continue to manage tightly on the expense front. And then just maybe lastly, as I said in my formal
comments, we've managed through lots of different cycles, and this is just another cycle that we're
managing through. And as an institution, we have always struck a good balance between growth and
conservative management of our balance sheet and credit. And we think that will help us manage through
whatever happens in the next 3 or 4 months, but position us well longer term, given all the factors that I
just outlined.

Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with Truist Securities.

Jennifer Haskew Demba
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Could you give us a little more detail on what you're seeing in the more at-risk portfolios from more social
distancing right now? The credit obviously continues to outperform peers. So I'm just curious as to what
you're seeing below the surface here.

Melinda A. Chausse
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Jennifer, this is Melinda. Thanks for the question. So overall, as you already sort of highlighted and Jim
and Curt did in their opening comments, I mean, we're really pleased with the performance of the portfolio
as a whole. And although these are at-risk industries, they have actually held up, I think, better than
what we would have expected coming into this. The segment called social distancing specifically are those
companies that are most directly impacted by any social mitigation actions that are taking place. So
obviously, in the near term, given the current coronavirus surging, it's probably the portfolio that we are
watching the closest and probably has the most opportunity for some additional migration.

All of these 4 portfolios that are listed on Slide 11, although they have elevated credit metrics, we have
not seen a high level of migration into the NPA category, which obviously NPAs would need to increase in
order to see significantly increasing losses. The Energy portfolio, although it has the most stressed credit
metrics, actually has stabilized quite nicely, certainly prices at $50 a barrel, supply-demand dynamics have
changed. And that portfolio, I would call, much more stabilized, even though it has elevated credit metrics.

And certainly, charge-offs the last 2 quarters have shown that we may be through the worst of that. That
can change really quickly with Energy, obviously, given the commodity nature. So we are continuing to
work with those borrowers. So overall, again, we feel pretty good about all these at-risk industries. We
certainly are well reserved with almost $1 billion of reserves and feel like anything that does migrate into
that NPA category, we are more than well reserved to handle.

Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Melinda, a question for you, a follow-up to Ken's earlier question on the outlook for reserve levels. I know
you probably hate these questions. But when we think about pre-COVID reserve levels, and I look at
Slide 10, and I see that 1.33% reserve. And I think the day 1 CECL for you, if I remember correctly, was
basically 0 to maybe a positive. Is that the message you're sending when you say pre-COVID levels that
we can head back to those levels by the end of '21 or early '22? Is that what you said? Or did I mishear
that?

Melinda A. Chausse
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

No. I think that's fair and accurate. I mean, again, obviously, CECL is a complex accounting exercise. In
every single quarter, we're going to take the most recent economic forecast in the portfolio -- our portfolio
and what's happening in our portfolio. But again, given where the credit metrics are today and the overall
improving economic forecast, particularly for the second half of the year, I think that directionally, yes, we
expect to be headed in the direction of pre-COVID levels. I can't tell you what that number is. I don't think
anybody knows what that number is. I mean we're in new and unchartered territory. CECL, obviously, is
new. And we've never sort of come out of a recessionary environment, particularly one as severe as what
we experienced in the first and second quarter. So directionally, yes, by the end of 2021, beginning of
2022, and that could either slow or accelerate based on how quickly the second half of the year recovery
happens.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. Okay. That's all fair. And then on the charge-off thinking, you're seeing modest increase. And I guess,
is there anything we should be aware of? I mean, are there any bigger charge-offs coming or bigger
problems that you worry about? Or you just expect maybe some modest increases, which I think we
probably all have built into the models? But is there any thing you want to flag for us in terms of the
longer-term charge-off outlook?

Melinda A. Chausse
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

No. I think what you said that it's really just some modest increases over the particularly low levels that
we've seen in the last couple of quarters. We've obviously also had some nice recoveries. Those are
lumpy and difficult to predict. So there is nothing in the portfolio that has me overly concerned from a
concentration perspective. I mean, I think that where we'll continue to see charge-offs, honestly, is going
to be in those at-risk portfolios and probably more likely in that social distancing.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. Okay. If I can squeeze in one more, maybe for Peter. The dealer balances and the trends, how long
do you think it takes to get back to normal? And do you think normal is that kind of high $7 billion type
balance range?

Yes, Jon, thanks. I don't know if normal is the $7 billion. I think the getting back to normal is probably
harder to determine than we would like. It's certainly second half of 2021, hopefully. It's just hopefully
seeing that business kind of get back to its normal inventory levels, which there's a lot of debate about
when or if that's going to happen. We believe it will happen, and we hear from our customers. They
believe that, that will happen as well. So hopefully, that, that happens in the second part of this year, and
we certainly -- we love that space. We're very comfortable getting back to the numbers you see in prior
quarters on Slide 26. And if that can happen end of this year, into next, then we'd be very excited about
that.

Our next question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Curt, my first question, during this period of low rates and slow growth, we've seen more banks turning
to M&A, right, to drive shareholder value. And it's been quite a while since we've seen Comerica use this
tool. As you think about 2021 priorities, how are you viewing M&A here? And should we expect to see the
company get more active on this front?

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Steven, as I have said, through the years on these calls and other forms as well, we believe our model
really is built for success on organic growth. We're in great lines of business where we have deep expertise
and scale and in great markets where we still have a lot of room to continue to grow. And so we're going
to be primarily focused on that. I do think there's a lot of uncertainty around the environment on a go-
forward basis and how the credit cycle will play out. And so I don't have a crystal ball as to what M&A
activity looks like in 2021, but really no change for us, focus on organic growth. We've only done 2 deals
in the last 20 years. We have said repeatedly that if we were going to look at opportunities, we are
probably, first and foremost, interested in Texas and California, given the growth dynamics of both of
those markets.

And that a deal would have to make great sort of strategic and cultural sense for us. And so while there
have been a number of deals announced last year, that really doesn't change our overall view, and we're
going to be a patient acquirer. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't look at opportunities, but again, first and
foremost, focused on organic growth. We would, as we have been in the past, be interested in things that
are non-bank acquisitions. So if we have a GAAP and fee income or we see an opportunity there, then
those are the types of things we might look at as well, nothing on the immediate horizon.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And for my follow-up, if I could ask you a big picture question. So one of the impacts
that we've talked about has been from the pandemic is this dramatic acceleration, right, the adoption
of digital consumers businesses, everybody. Curt, how has this impacted how you view the historical
relationship banking model at the company and how have your investments in technology changed as
you're seeing customers adopt digital more frequently?

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Executive Chairman, CEO & President

Well, fortunately, I think not only for us, Steve, but for the whole industry, we've all been on this digital
journey in 2020 in many regards. And the COVID situation has accelerated that path as we've seen more
migration to digital and mobile online channels for consumers as well as businesses. We believe that
we remain in a well position there. We've got really strong talent on the IT side. And this past year, we
recruited a new Executive Director of Technology and Operations, Megan Crespi, and a new CIO, Bruce

Mitchell, and they've been bringing a lot of new thoughts and ideas to us. And it's always for us sort of
focused on 2 areas. One is the things that we can do to continue to enable our customers and provide
attractive products and services for our customers. And then, secondly, how we use technology to help
reduce expenses across the company, things like AI, et cetera.

We've talked before about the fact that we've been on this path of migration to the cloud and are making
good progress there. And we've also talked about the fact that while we don't necessarily have the same
scale as many of our larger competitors, we can leverage both a good blend of proprietary capabilities with
third parties and really achieve scale, where needed, if we don't necessarily have it in-house. And there
are a number of things that we've got in-flight right now. We rolled out a new digital onboarding platform
last year that will benefit really across all of our business lines in terms of originating new relationships.
The mobile and web channels. We've rolled out a new loan origination platform for our consumer bank.
We've done a lot around just how we leverage data and push data to our employees in terms of customer
information.

We're making a number of enhancements to our treasury management platform. And then we've been
going through some upgrades in our Wealth Management business line, our new Trust platform and a new
Wealth Management portal sort of single sign-on portal for our Wealth Management clients. So I think we
remain competitive. We feel good about our positioning. I think it's always important to remember that we
are, first and foremost, primarily a commercial bank and relationships still really matter in that business.

The intellectual capital we bring, the advice we bring, every deal we do is highly customized. It's not
something that you push out over a sort of a digital channel. But we've got to have products and services
that support the treasury side of the house, the Treasurer, the CFO, et cetera, in that space, and we
believe we do. And then even in the other business lines, Wealth Management, and even in our Retail
Bank, we tend to serve a more affluent client relationship, still really important there. Advice still really
important, but again, enabled through digital and mobile and other channels as well. And we feel like
we're well positioned.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask about loan growth and the confidence that it picks up in the second quarter. And the
reason I ask is we've heard from other banks that there's so much excess liquidity that borrowers would
tap that excess liquidity before drawing down on lines of credit or new loan growth. I was just wondering if
you could talk about that.

Peter L. Sefzik
Executive VP & Executive Director of Commercial Bank

Yes. Peter, this is Peter. I think you'll probably see both of those things. I don't know that I would disagree
with the idea that we probably see some of the liquidity get used up. I mean we've got very high deposits
right now, like all banks, some of the highest we've seen. And so I suspect that would be part of the
turn and, frankly, a good indicator that loan direction is moving in that -- is moving up, while deposits
are coming down. So regardless of the -- which of those necessarily occurs first, we still feel pretty
encouraged that the second half of the year, based on most of the macro indicators that we're seeing so
far, would lead us to believe that we're going to see a better second half of the year when it comes to loan
growth. And -- but I don't think you're necessarily wrong or I wouldn't disagree with that idea that you
would like to see deposits come down first, and I think those together would directionally be really good
for loans.

Okay. And Jim, if I could follow-up about the reinvestment pressure on the securities portfolio. Would you
continue to shift some of that excess liquidity into securities as maybe as an offset like we saw in the first
-- fourth quarter?

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Peter, thanks for the question. That is something that we are going to have to examine on an ongoing
basis. We have been and we are taking incremental steps to invest the excess liquidity. But we're being
careful not to jump in all at once and place a big bet at any one time, given that we just don't know where
things are headed. So as you look at where we've been and where we're going, certainly starting in late
second quarter of '20, third quarter of '20, we did prepay a material amount of purchase funds. Midway
through third quarter, of course, we bought the $2.25 billion of securities, which had a fourth quarter
benefit also.

And then, as I mentioned in the first quarter of this year, we're prepaying $2.8 billion of FHLB funding. So
we are attempting to take steps that show some type of benefit each quarter in terms of doing something
with the excess liquidity, but we want to do it in a very measured way. We don't necessarily want to sit
on the sidelines forever, but we don't want to jump in all at once either. And so you'll see us continue to
evaluate this as time goes on and take incremental steps as the quarters go on. And then when there's
more of a line of sight, we may take even a bigger step. But we do think caution is in order, but totally
sitting in the sidelines doesn't make sense either. So the measured pace is kind of where we're managing
ourselves to.

forward.

Brian D. Foran

Got it. And then on the growth, you gave a ton of commentary on loan growth. So I don't want to ask a
question that's redundant, but it did really jump out to me the comment that December felt really good,
almost like pre-COVID. I wonder if you could just give the next level down, was it conversations with
clients? Was it the pipelines where certain activity metrics you're looking at? What were the things that
started to feel like pre-COVID by the time you got to end of December?

Brian, it's Peter. And the -- one, I know, for sure, is just the amount of deals that we approved and looked
at in the month of December that came through the process. And so that was probably the best indicator
that I've had -- that Melinda and I've had together in a while of just what we see at our committees and
the amount of activity we've had. So that was encouraging. Now end of the year is always busy. And
you're always going to sort of see that, but it certainly felt like a pre-COVID better than we'd certainly
seen in the last 60, 90 days.

And one thing I continue to say about the pipeline is that it feels -- and the numbers look good. They look
pre-COVID. What is less certain is just the timing of some of this. And so much of it right now is M&A. It's
dividend recaps. It's not necessarily core requests that companies have for CapEx or things like that. So
it's a little bit lumpy. But it does feel better than it did, certainly, 90 days ago. It's just still a little bit hard
to determine when exactly all of that's going to happen. So hopefully, that gives you a little double-click
down, Brian, as to what you were looking for.

Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I think most of mine have been hit, but I just wanted to ask one question, just on the Mortgage Banker
portfolio. Obviously, it's been kind of swollen by the huge mortgage market we had over the course
of the past year or so. Just I guess, I'm curious where that ends up settling out since there's so much
air between where it started and where it is now. I guess the bull case is that you guys as sort of a
strong market share player would retain more of those balances as originations for the industry kind of
normalize, but just curious how you guys see that playing out.

Peter L. Sefzik
Executive VP & Executive Director of Commercial Bank

Yes, Scott, it's Peter. Thank you. Slide 23 in the appendix has our Mortgage Banker outlook for originations
in 2021. And I think we usually use that as an indicator of what we think the year is going to be. As Jim
indicated, it will be a little bit of a headwind on loan balances. But overall, we think the sort of annual
cycle you see in that business continues to lift for us, if you will, a little bit. We continue to add new
names. We love the space. We've been in it a long, long time. We think we're a very important player in
it. And so I think when you look at the outlook for the MBA forecast that, that sort of gives you an idea
of what I think we're going to see. But we also feel like we are increasing our customer count and our
opportunities in that space, and we'll continue to do so in the coming quarters and years.

I just wanted to ask a follow-up to Steve's question regarding technology. I think an ironic benefit of
COVID, if you call it that, is that it does allow kind of a reanalysis, reexamination of the entire delivery
structure. You have seen banks. Some banks kind of attack their branch structure more aggressively to
pay for or fund some of the tech investments. Is that a direction that you may potentially pursue in the
future as your new tech team settles in?

COMERICA INCORPORATED FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 19, 2021

Brent -- Brock, just a couple of comments around our branch network. First of all, just from a size
standpoint, we have roughly 430, 435 banking centers. So we don't have the same sort of scale that some
players have, and we have less redundancy in markets. So you're not going to drive down the street and
see two Comerica banking centers across the street from each other. And so we've kind of eliminated any
sort of redundancy in the platform and feel pretty good about the network we have overall.

Having said that, just like all financial services firms, we have been selectively continuing to prune that
portfolio. We've been changing the configuration in the banking centers. We've been leveraging technology
more doing away with things like traditional teller lines, having more sort of universal bankers in the
banking center that can handle all things for clients, whether it's a loan or deposit need or whatever
advisory type capabilities we need to deliver. And that's allowed us to reduce headcount in the banking
centers over time and reduce the FTEs and the banking centers.

And so I do think that, that trend of just sort of continue to slowly decreasing the size of the number
of banking centers will continue. But I don't think you should expect necessarily that we're going to
announce some huge restructuring of our banking center platform. We have other ways, I think, to
continue to fund our technology journey, and we've been able to do that within our overall expense base.

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And more broadly, and I know this is difficult, given the uncertainty of COVID. But on the back of
that, do you have any sense you can give us how we should think about the efficiency ratio and where
that could potentially run?

James J. Herzog
CFO & Executive VP

Brock, that's going to be dependent upon, number one, where the economy goes and where interest
rates go. That will be a big driver. And I think we're in a little bit of unchartered territory here. But in
the meanwhile, we are focused on all those things that we can control. I would echo Curt's comments
in terms of some of the things we're doing on the technology side. We do focus on efficiencies on an
ongoing basis, and we do plan on leveraging technology both in terms of the IA to make departments
more efficient as well as the distribution systems, whether that be in the commercial banking side with
treasury management systems or the banking centers that you mentioned. So we'll continue to take steps
to refine how we approach the distribution model and the overall expense base. And the revenue will be
somewhat driven over the next 2 or 3 years by the rate environment. And in the meanwhile we'll keep
doing all the good blocking and tackling that we've been doing historically and keep focusing on those
things that we can control.
