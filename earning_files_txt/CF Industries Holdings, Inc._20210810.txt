Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Half and Second Quarter 2021 CF Industries
Holdings Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christelle. I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator
Instructions]

I will now turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick, with CF Investor Relations.
Sir, you may proceed.

Martin A. Jarosick
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thanks for joining the CF Industries First Half 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I'm
Martin Jarosick, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Chris Bohn, CFO;
and Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain. CF Industries
reported its first half 2021 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results
in detail, discuss our outlook and then host a question-and-answer session.

Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about
factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on
our website; also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release
and presentation posted on our website.

Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we posted our financial results for the
first half of 2021, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion. Strong nitrogen
demand and lower overall production have tightened the global supply-demand balance, supporting much
higher prices than in recent years. At the same time, energy spreads between North America and high-
cost regions have expanded considerably, increasing margin opportunities for our cost advantage network.
These factors helped drive an increase in adjusted EBITDA of nearly 25% compared to last year, and
we produced our strongest first half financial results in 6 years. Additionally, the business continues to
generate strong free cash flow, giving us tremendous flexibility as we focus on achieving investment-grade
metrics and executing our clean energy initiatives.

The first half was not without its challenges, including the natural gas-driven production interruptions we
described on the first quarter call. The first half also saw a continued demonstration of the harm the UAN
industry in the United States faces from subsidized and dumped imports from Russia and Trinidad. Until
the last few years, UAN earned a substantial premium to other upgraded nitrogen products due to the
higher capital investment required to produce it and the meaningful agronomic and operational benefit it
offers to farmers. As you can see from our recent results, UAN now trades at a significant discount to all
upgraded nitrogen products due to unfair trade practices. We have taken the necessary steps to address
this situation by petitioning the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission to
initiate antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. We look forward to the result of the ITC's
preliminary vote later this week.

Looking forward, we are very bullish about the next 2 years. As Bert will describe in a moment, the need
to replenish global course grain stocks driving agricultural demand, along with the impact of increased
economic activity driving industrial demand, should support all-time record global nitrogen demand over

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

the next 2 years. Forward energy curves are also very favorable over this time frame. We expect these
factors to help keep the global nitrogen supply and demand balance much tighter than we've seen in
recent years, supporting an extended period of higher nitrogen pricing and higher margins for our cost
advantage network.

Longer term, we believe increased demand for ammonia and its clean energy attributes will become a
significant factor in the tighter supply and demand balance, driving further value for our network. We
continue to see broad interest in clean hydrogen and ammonia to help meet the world's clean energy
needs. As we continue to have discussions with market participants, our focus remains on being at the
forefront of this significant opportunity from positioning our network to be the world's leader for blue and
green ammonia production, to collaborating with other global leaders where our unique capabilities can
provide value. We are pleased with the progress we've made and look forward to additional developments
in the coming months.

With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen outlook in more detail. Then
Chris will follow to talk about our financial position before I return for some closing comments. Bert?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Thanks, Tony. The global nitrogen supply and demand balance remains far tighter than we have seen
in recent years, underpinned by strong agricultural and industrial demand, plus higher energy prices
in Europe and Asia. This has created a highly favorable pricing environment that has persisted into the
second half of this year. Based on the agriculture and energy outlook we see today, we believe a positive
pricing environment for fertilizer will remain in place, at least into 2023.

Strong global nitrogen demand is being led by the world's need to replenish course green stocks. The
global course grain stock-to-use ratio was the lowest since 2012, entering this year's spring planting
season. Commodity prices have risen significantly in response, and farmers are incentivized to maximize
yield with fertilizer applications.

Given this, we expect to see sustained demand in the second half, led by India and Brazil. We expect
similar strengths from North America and Europe leading into the 2022 application season. We had a
positive start to meeting this demand a few weeks ago when we launched our UAN fill program. We have
built a solid order book for the third quarter at a NOL equivalent price of $285 per ton, though prices
remain at a significant discount to urea for the reasons Tony mentioned.

Further out, we expect that high demand for course grains, especially from China, will contribute to
persistent low global stocks into next year. As a result, we believe that stocks will still need to be
replenished, at least into 2023, supporting continued strong nitrogen demand.

Increased economic activity is also driving higher global industrial demand for nitrogen. In North America,
we have seen diesel exhaust fluid sales rise above pre-pandemic levels. Our first half DES sales were a
company record, and we expect overall demand will continue to grow. We've also seen higher demand for
ammonia and nitric acid from our industrial customers. Globally, industrial-related demand in China and
from phosphate producers has also increased.

While we expect demand to remain strong for some time, we believe that global fertilizer inventory in
the channel today is low and will need to be rebuilt. So far, in 2021, high energy costs in Europe and Asia
have lowered operating rates and reduced supply availability, particularly for ammonia and urea, further
supporting global pricing.

As you can see on Slide 9, energy costs in these regions have increased to over $14 per MMBtu, and
Eastern European producers have become the global marginal producer for the time being. The higher
energy costs has steepened the global nitrogen cost curve substantially, increasing margin opportunities
for low-cost producers such as CF. Forward curve suggests CF will benefit from favorable energy
differentials for the foreseeable future. As a result, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of
us as we leverage our manufacturing, distribution and logistics capabilities to deliver for our customers.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Bert. For the first half of 2021, the company reported net earnings attributable to common
stockholders of $397 million or $1.83 per diluted share. EBITDA was $994 million, and adjusted EBITDA
with $997 million. The trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2
billion, and free cash flow was $700 million. Based on the outlook Tony and Bert have shared, we are well
positioned to build on these results and continue to generate significant free cash flow.

I want to provide additional context to 2 items we covered in our press release. First, we raised our
estimate for capital expenditures for 2021 from around $450 million to approximately $500 million. The
increase is driven primarily by our decision to pull a significant maintenance event scheduled for next
year into this year. We believe that performing this activity in 2021 is best for the asset and reduces the
risk of an unplanned outage during the 2022 spring application season. Going forward, we expect capital
expenditures to return to the range of $450 million per year.

With this additional maintenance project, the high level of previously planned maintenance and the
additional maintenance from severe weather in February, we estimate that gross ammonia production
and sales volume will be around 9.5 million tons and 19 million product tons, respectively, both at the low
end of our forecast earlier this year. Looking into 2022, we have a more typical maintenance schedule and
would expect to return to approximately 10 million tons of ammonia production and sales volume of 19.5
million to 20 million product tons.

Second, we are taking additional steps in line with our focus on achieving investment-grade ratings and
positioning the company to execute our clean energy initiatives. We have announced that we will redeem
$250 million of our senior notes due June 2023, which will reduce our gross debt to $3.5 billion. We
expect to lower our gross debt to $3 billion by or before the maturity of the 2023 notes. We also continue
to return cash to our shareholders through quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases at
attractive levels.

With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Chris. Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize everyone at CF for their strong
work during the first half. They successfully managed many challenges in the first 6 months of the year,
setting us up well for the second half. Most importantly, we did this safely with our recordable incident
rate at the end of June at just 0.28 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry
averages.

As we look ahead, we expect strong agricultural and industrial demand to create all-time record global
nitrogen demand. Forward curves show very favorable energy spreads to Europe and Asia over the same
time frame, which should support robust margins and cash generation. We see good progress on our core
synergy initiatives. Taken together, we are well positioned to create significant shareholder value in the
near and longer term.
With that, operator, we will now open the call to questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

It's very rare where your second half EBITDA is higher than your first half EBITDA. I think it's been a
decade. Is that a situation you're expecting this year? And then maybe as you answer that, maybe you
could talk about what type of pricing you think visibility you have on the third quarter, what should happen
to the fourth quarter?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

So we're really pleased with how the year is shaping up. Obviously, we were disappointed with where
UAN values were as a result of Russian and Trinidad dumped imports in the first half of the year. And --
but as you look at our balance sheet, at the end of the second quarter, you see our customer advances
and basically all of that had moved through the system. And when we launched fill at $2.85 NOLA per
UAN, that's a substantial uptick. And that's really the price environment that we're looking at in the third
quarter and for the order book going forward.

And then subsequently, we've been able to get a little bit of further appreciation off of the $285 number.
So we're really pleased with how the order book is set up right now and what the back half of the year
looks like. We've seen strong interest in ammonia for the fall already. Urea continues to trade in a
reasonable spot. And as I said, UAN looks very good. So we're really excited about the second half. And
we think that it's not just the second half, but it sets up well for both 2022 and 2023.

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And just on -- maybe following up on free cash flow, do you think that this year, you'll end up with
more free cash flow than last year? Obviously, prices are higher. I think you had some working capital
outflow in the second quarter. Should that reverse in the second half?

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Joel, from a free cash flow standpoint, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we expect to
continue to see significant strength. As you mentioned, in this particular quarter, we had a few working
capital both with accounts receivable. And then as we talked about the bleed through the customer
advances, which was pretty -- that was about $0.5 billion between those two. But as Tony just got done
mentioning, we're seeing pricing strength due to the energy differential spreads that we're seeing globally
for the second half of the year. We still do have -- as we mentioned, our product tons will be on the lower
end, probably around 19 million product tons. But outside of that, we see a really strong second half of the
year from a free cash flow standpoint.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

And overall, for the year, as Chris mentioned in his remarks, we are seeing higher CapEx this year,
principally due to all of the major turnaround events that we have done. So that's a little bit of a hit
relative to where we were last year. But we're really, again, really excited about where we sit and what the
forward picture looks like.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So I guess first question on the balance sheet and capital allocation. And I was hoping to just make sure
to clarify just the value you see in having the investment-grade rating. I guess I'm still trying to get my
head around the idea of repaying early debt sub-3.5% when your stock trades at what I think would be
north of 10% free cash flow yield and just where you see the value of the investment-grade credit rating
over the longer to medium term as you think about the green investments that you're contemplating.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll take a first cut at this, Adam, and then I'll turn it over to Chris for probably more insightful
comments. But there are some real frictional costs that we face in the business from not having
investment grade that has to do with lines of credit and some other embedded derivatives with our CHS
venture. And those frictional costs go away if we go ahead and regain investment grade. I also believe
that there is a signal to the equity holders about the stability and strength and -- of the company with an
investment-grade rating. And we think both of those things are important. So that's really our focus on
why to get back to investment grade.

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I would add to that, as we look at some of our growth plans going forward, with having sort of
the senior secured notes, which are the 2026, does limit a little bit of some of the asset moves we can do
within our structuring to get the most efficient, whether it be from a tax basis or others in an asset. So by
getting investment grade, that senior secured drops off of that and allows us a little bit more activity.

But I think really where your question is going is with return of capital and different things like that. I
think what we see over the next several years here with free cash flow generation is we're really going
to be able to reduce our debt to that gross target of $3 billion, invest in our clean energy initiatives
specifically those that we've announced already and then additionally return cash to shareholders. So I
think what we're seeing over the next couple of years will allow us to do all 3 of those.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

And the investments that we're looking at right now, both from a green and from a blue perspective,
are not huge dollars and are managed easily with our cash flow. And the issue, as you mentioned, on
the yield, while the yield flow, we've got -- we've been building some cash on the balance sheet, which
is terrific but for which we're not really earning any kind of return. And so even though it's taken out
something that looks nominally like a fairly low interest rate is still better than what we're generating on
the cash.

And while you're certainly correct that the equity trades at a higher effective sort of overall cost to the
business from a cash flow yield perspective, I think that by getting rid of some of this residual just sort of
cost and drag on the business, having the flexibility that Chris talked about in terms of internal structuring
of assets to optimize the tax consideration, all of those things are pretty important things for us to be able
to do. And we want to do that first.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's really helpful. And then if I can just have a quick follow-up. Just in the second quarter, you
had about $100 million year-on-year of incremental costs in the business related to kind of maintenance
and the fixed cost absorption with higher turnarounds. And I'm just trying to get a sense how we should
think about the second half in that light. It seems like the turnaround maintenance activity is going to be
heavy again in the second half? And just thinking about the P&L impact of that for the balance of the year.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

So 2 big pieces I would put on the cost side that -- and I want to compare it to a year ago. Based on the
amount of turnaround activity and other maintenance work that was going on, we ended up with almost
$60 million of sort of incremental maintenance and fixed cost write-off associated with the plants in Q2
versus last year. And then on top of that, we ended up with about $100 million that hits the cost of goods
sold line through the first half of the year. That's based on purchased product for resale. And part of it was
based on the commitments we have made to customers with the plant outages and the turnarounds. We
needed to cover those positions and make sure we could provide reliable supply on our commitments. And
so we went out and purchased both urea and ammonia to cover some of those requirements.

And so in an average or in an otherwise kind of normalized year, you wouldn't see that $100 million hit the
COGS line in that kind of way. And so those are sort of 2 big pieces that I'm thinking we won't have to the
same magnitude second half. But you're certainly right that there is ongoing pretty significant turnaround
activity in the second half of the year. And that may very likely lead to some ongoing fixed cost write-off.
But...

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would say, Adam, probably the best way to look at that is just that the total ammonia -- gross
ammonia production, we talked about at 9.5% and then the product tons at 19 million tons. If you look
at that is what we're going to produce in the second half of the year, I think that gives you a pretty good
indication of the additional work. But as Tony mentioned, we did have some additional drag here in the
first half of the year that we don't expect in the second half.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. You're purchasing 100% of your energy in the U.K., that would be renewable energy, which is a great
step. What is the cost of renewable energy in the U.K. And how does that compare to your prior electricity
contracts?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

P.J., so the incremental cost to us is pretty de minimis, actually. As we're looking at it, it's somewhere in
the neighborhood of like 60,000 to 100,000 pounds just to move to renewable versus what we're paying
today. So the incremental cost will not be noticeable at all in the system, which is why it's so easy to --
per year, the 60,000 to 100,000 is per year, which is why it was very easy to go ahead and move to the
100% renewable on this and reduce our Scope 2 emissions. We're looking at similar opportunities in the
U.S. where we can get some incremental renewable energy into the system without significant cost to the
overall operations. And so we're trying to do this where it makes good sense. We provide a really good
base load for some people because of the consistency of draw that we have off the network. And so we're
able to negotiate pretty good rates on that.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. And then today's miss, if you want to call that, came from higher maintenance activity, which
you kind of outlined just now. And also higher natural gas costs. So how much higher were gas costs
compared to your forecast? And I know it can change anytime, but what's your sort of -- based on your
hedges and all that and forward curve, what sort of natural gas cost do you expect for you in second half?

W. Anthony Will

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Yes. P.J., on the cost of gas, what I'd say is more important than the absolute cost that we face is what
the energy spread differential is. And so while last year, you saw very low gas costs, both in the U.S. and
also in the U.K. You also saw global energy costs that were dramatically reduced, partly COVID-driven.
And as a result, although our costs were low, our margin opportunity was also compressed because you
saw really high operating rates. Right now what you see is energy cost differentials between the U.S. and
Europe and Asia is like $10 or $11 per MMBtu. And so you see a huge margin differential between what
the high-cost producers are running at and what our network runs at.

And so as we think about it, despite the fact that our costs are going up, our margins are expanding much
more rapidly than what our costs are going up, this is a great environment for us. In fact, I think -- and
this is a chart that we'll likely be producing in the future. We've looked at this analysis that the higher
the gas cost is in Henry Hub because the U.S. is such an important contributor into the LNG market,
particularly on more of a spot basis, what you tend to see is higher energy differentials in LNG import
regions. And as a result of that, there's typically margin expansion when our cost structures are -- is a
little bit higher. This is a good thing for us instead of a headwind for us. But as we look forward, we tend
to just believe in the forward energy, where the forward curve trades on the NYMEX and some of the other
major pricing indices that we don't have a lot of additional insight over kind of where the market puts
forward.

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Yes, PJ, I agree with everything Tony just said. And maybe instead of looking at the overall COGS
in total, it's the controllable COGS side that was really hit by maintenance because, as Tony mentioned,
when we see expanded gas, sometimes that helps us even more from a pricing. So the controllable cost
per ton, which generally runs in the mid-80s and is significantly higher than that over the first half of the
year, we expect that to get back closer to the mid-80s when next year, as we mentioned, we'll be back to
normalized operating rates of around 20 million product tons.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

And to add to that, what Chris just said, we're -- in a normal year, we do about 4 major turnarounds,
which would be an ammonia plant plus some associated upgrades. Because of COVID last year and us
trying to protect our employees and minimize the number of contractors we had on site, we reduced it to
just 2 major turnarounds last year, which is one of the reasons we set an all-time ammonia production
record last year because we had fewer turnaround activities. This year, we've got 7 instead of 4. So the 2
that we were supposed to do last year that we moved forward, the 4 that were already scheduled for this
year. And as Chris mentioned earlier, we're bringing 1 of them from next year backwards into this year to
make sure that we've got reliable operation on that asset.

In addition to being 7 instead of 4, 2 of the turnarounds were our major expansion plants. So our 2
biggest plants in the network, both the Donaldsonville 6 and Port Neal 2 ammonia plants. And those tend
to be a little longer and a little more expensive than the rest of the network or the average-sized plants.
This is the first time they've undergone a major turnaround. But our expectation as a result of this is that
we're well positioned to be looking at potentially able to set an all-time production record next year for
ammonia. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we got Port Neal 2 done this
year. Because our view is as good as the pricing opportunity is right now, we think next year looks very
strong as well, and we want to make sure we can run flat out. So what we're really doing is setting up for
the future here, and I feel very good about where we're positioned.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.

Lucas Charles Beaumont

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

This is Lucas Beaumont on for John. I just wanted to follow up on your discussion there on the gas cost, if
I can. So I mean I take your point that the differentials are super high right now between Europe and Asia
and North America. But just like looking at where like Chinese coal is, that's probably quite a bit more of a
normal kind of historical spread. So just as we look forward then, I was just wondering kind of what gives
you confidence that the European and Asian spreads are going to sort of persist as opposed to come back
to like a more normal level and Chinese coal shifts back into being the marginal cost producer?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I think currently, Chinese coal is about $9 an MMBtu on the anthracite side. So you're still
looking at a $5 relative differential to Henry Hub. $5 is a great place to be. And we don't see indications
that China is trying to reduce coal price. If anything, it wouldn't shock us to see further restrictions
on urea exports or really trying to push that down instead of up. And so I think just kind of lack of
substantial availability and also a pretty stable price outlook on that suggests to us that China, while
always important, may not be the global price setter going forward. Again, Lucas, as we look at the
forward curves, we tend to look at what TTF and JKM are and as well as the NYMEX on Henry Hub. And if
you just look at those differentials, that provides a really terrific margin opportunity for our network.

Christopher D. Bohn
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think to that point, the spreads right now on the TTF and MVP are $11 compared to Henry Hub. And
next year, the strip has them over $7 for the average of the year, so significantly higher than anthracite.
And as Tony mentioned earlier and Bert and his remarks, the supply side is so tight that you have to bid in
those particular higher costs. So right now, the marginal producer is European and other Asian producers.
And you're seeing that in prices. So the cost curve in a demand-driven market, we're well above what cost
curve economics are right now.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

And as I've also mentioned in my remarks, we're expecting all-time record global nitrogen demand next
year. And so as Chris said, what we're really talking about is the very, very highest cost production that
needs to be bid in. And in a demand-driven market, we're trading above where the cost curve economics
are right now. So again, all of that provides a really great operating environment for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

Tony, you mentioned that kind of a forward book on UAN and the $285 or maybe higher in third quarter.
Can you just comment on your forward book in urea and ammonia, how much of your third quarter
volumes do you think you already have locked in and roughly the price? Can you shift volumes to urea just
given it's got a higher gross margin per ton?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes. Steve, this is Bert. And we're pleased with our -- I'd say very pleased with our order book going into
Q3. As we exited Q2, and you can see from our information, that we had worked through our order book
from the first half and entered into Q3 with very little orders on the books. We built a nice ammonia book
for fall and the pricing -- the public pricing in there is the $600 to $640 at the terminal level. And then
we launched the UAN fill program at that $285 NOLA and then stair stepped it up as we go through up
through the Midwest and built a healthy order book for Q3 and now have looked at Q4 pricing.

For urea, the market has kind of stayed in the range of $420 to $440 FOB NOLA, and then obviously, stair
stepped up through the Midwest and into Canada. And so we have a healthy book on for all 3 products
and look forward to, as Tony and Chris have both articulated through their comments and questions, we
see just due to the structural nature of the global markets for grains and oilseeds and just some of the
climatic difficulties that have taken place, both in the United States up from Midwest and Brazil and just
low inventories, all these things coupled together, and low inventories of fertilizer, probably see a positive
pricing environment for Q4 and into the next year. So we're anticipating a nice year.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

And just wanted to drill in a little bit on the blue ammonia opportunity for you. It sounds like the
engineering to capture and treat that carbon is pretty well understood and underway. Is the rate-
limiting step to move forward in that less about demand and more about sequestration? And if so, would
you ever consider pursuing a Class 6 injection well on your own property just to have control, like at
Donaldsonville?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Steve. Yes, currently, availability of Class 6 permanent geological sequestration is potentially the limiting
factor, although there are opportunities to sequester CO2 tomorrow if we had the dehydration and
compression in place on for EOR applications. And even for EOR, you are provided some level of the 45Q
tax benefit from that. So it's not quite the full benefit, but it's available kind of now if we're ready. And
that's one of the reasons we're pushing so quickly on dehydration of compression because we want to get
that in place and really have that up and running, availing ourselves of the opportunity available now and
be able to go immediately into injection wells when those permits are issued and they're ready to go.

Relative to us wanting to get into that, that's not really our area of expertise. We're -- that's one of the
areas where we look to other market participants and want to rely on their expertise. And there's a lot of
subsurface geology and things that we just are not set up to do. And so instead of trying to replicate that,
we want to kind of partner and work with other people that, that's their bread and butter.

I would say there are a number of people that have come to us and said the geology within just a couple
of miles of Donaldsonville is well situated for Class 6 permits, and they're going after those kinds of things.
And so what we're talking about is, generally speaking, a pretty short haul run in order to get to them.
And so that's very encouraging just in terms of what the overall time frame and cost structure looks like to
do injection.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Tony, last October when you sort of brought the green and blue strategy to the investment community,
obviously, the free cash flow outlook was a lot different and obviously a lot lower than it is today. And I
think at the time, you sort of characterized what the spending levels would be with -- at least initially, it
was going to be sort of within your annual CapEx budget. You mentioned a few questions ago that you
weren't talking about big sums of money for the types of stuff that I think you had in the press release
overnight. But maybe you could just sort of size for us over the next few years, as we think about these
efforts, is there a dollar range that you're anticipating spending within? And is there a max level that you
would spend? Or any sort of parameters you want to put around this for us?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the ones that we've announced, the green hydrogen/ammonia project, the Donaldsonville is in
the range of $100 million. The dehydration and compression systems that we're looking at for CO2 in

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

Donaldsonville, it's probably in the range of about $200 million. And that should be able to provide us with
about 1 million tons of blue ammonia. And I think we can get there in 2 years or by the beginning of 2024.

And then we're also looking at potentially a similar dehydration compression unit in Yazoo City, Mississippi,
which should be able to provide us another, call it, 300,000, 250,000 to 300,000 tons of blue ammonia.
And that would probably be in the $70 million to $80 million range. So the projects that we've announced
so far are kind of sub-$400 million spread over the next 2 to 3 years. And based on the increased margin
and cash flow that we're seeing from operations that's easily account -- taken care of just based on
normal spending levels. Plus with the big slug of turnaround activity that we'll have in the rearview mirror
here going next year back to more normalized rates, I think we're in a good position to be able to manage
all of that.

The thing that's exciting though is, as you mentioned, a couple of our announcements, both with the
Singapore Port, Itochu consortium looking at ammonia as a marine fuel, which we think there's real legs
to that and probably happening sooner than we initially thought, along with our Mitsui announcement
around evaluating blue ammonia opportunities is there's a very likely a chance for us to potentially
accelerate some of those opportunities and help this market develop more quickly. And so we're certainly
interested in thinking about additional investments above and beyond. But I think, again, based on our
enhanced free cash flow generation right now, we're not worried about being able to fund that. We feel
that we're really in a great spot given our ability to leverage our existing asset base and get to blue and
green ammonia much more both quickly and much more cheaply than other people can replicate that.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So is it fair to say then that the probability of a very large-scale announcement with a big price tag on it
over the next, say, 3 years is pretty low?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Look, we're excited and believe, just like Mitsui and a lot of other participants, that blue and green
hydrogen, blue and green ammonia are going to be in short supply relative to the demand that's coming. I
think the world is going to need more of it than what exists today. So that suggests some of it's got to get
built, blue, in particular. And if you think about who the best ammonia operators are in the world with the
largest network and where there ought to be a significant scale advantages is us. So I'm kind of not taking
anything off the table. I'm also not saying there's going to be something happen. We're going to see how
things develop here, but we're excited that there's already an opportunity for us to generate significant
volumes at very low dollar investment.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Tony, expectations for corn acres is obviously pretty solid next year. Assuming we continue to have the
kinds of logistic challenges that we've had for the past year, is there anything materially different you
would do given the flexibility in your system? I'm just sort of curious if there's something you learned and
said well if we have known this at the beginning, we would have changed this.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'm going to turn that over to Bert here in just a minute. I would say we continue to look
opportunistically at expanding some distribution assets and whether that means incremental UAN tanks
or other points of in-market distribution where we can either lease some or buy them but just to make
sure we've got that product kind of staged in market and take full advantage of supply chain disruptions. I
think those kind of things are easy to do, but I'll turn it over to Bert and ask for other things.

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

I agree spot on. I think the biggest step we've taken is this case with the International Trade Commission.
We've been monitoring this for years and suffering for a number of years with innovation of product
coming in at subsidized levels, whether it be gas or freight as well as on consignment to some of the end
receivers in the United States. And so those 2 issues we brought to the front and advocated for our case,
and we believe will have a positive outcome.

With that, we've been, as Tony said, structurally moving over the last several years in anticipation of
supplying a greater amount of UAN into this market. UAN is growing. It has traded at a discount to
[ arrear ] over the years because of the reasons we already articulated but plan on growing that and
supplying a higher portion of the U.S. needs with a system that is built for the logistics on all the major
railroads, on the rivers. And now with our reach in California and on the East Coast, we feel very good
about our position for the future. And I think another thing, as we've talked about blue and green
ammonia and blue and green products, as we were able to bring those products to the market, we believe
ammonia in the ag market and a blue ammonia, being able to create a low value or low carbon value
chain will bring substantial value to the agricultural community as well as to CF.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

And I guess one other thing I would add, Mark, we didn't -- we weren't specific about it, although Bert
touched on it is he and his team have worked really hard to try to develop kind of the best relationships
we can on the rail side. That can be challenging with certain carriers sometimes. But we have very
competitive rates now out to California. We've invested with some partners out there around tank space.
And our logistics into that region are really attractive for us. And so our ability to go ahead and satisfy
domestic U.S. demand is better now than it's ever been. And again, we're really looking forward to the ITC
verdict here at the end of the week.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Sure. And just switching gears to Brazil for a second. Brazil farmers clearly want to plant more corn. Last
year, they didn't quite get there. But the trend is for more corn down there. How will that -- if you look
at this global cost curve and the import situation, if Brazil does finally start to see that corn tick higher, is
that going to improve your situation in terms of competition in the Gulf? You've talked about price parity
issues being out of whack every once in a while. And I'm curious if that's a partial resolution to it.

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

I mean I think anytime you see international demand continue to tick up, and we're seeing record levels
of demand for imports in Brazil, India this year. It's really, really strong. That helps take a little bit of the
relief valve pressure off of the U.S. Gulf in terms of product trying to find liquidity out there. So I think
that that's always a good thing. But given where soy prices are, and in fact, given what we view is going
to be an increasing movement toward biodiesel and a lot of that coming from oilseeds, I think you'll see
ongoing competition between the acre, whether it's soy or corn. And so I think all of this is good because
on the one hand, what we don't want to see is a huge oversupply of corn acres driving a high stocks-to-
use ratio and then you end up being depressed. So I think a nice, healthy balance where acres are being
competed for is really good, particularly given the fact that now in -- as economic activity is picking back
up after COVID, we're seeing all-time demand into the industrial sector for nitrogen products. And so we
don't need to see huge increases in corn acres. In fact, that would be a bad thing for us. I think nice,
steady as she goes with the increase in industrial demand is kind of just what the doctor ordered here.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

Yes. In terms of what we're seeing in Brazil is exciting for urea demand or I'd just say, overall nitrogen
demand because when sulfate has also increased in imports. We're close to 7 million -- a little over 7
million tons of demand. And the growth in corn acres was negatively impacted by the drought this year.
And that's going to impact kind of that whole region. And it has, especially for shipping on the Paraná,
the river there coming out of Argentina. And so what we're looking at is some structural changes that are
taking place in Brazil with ethanol production, especially in the interior and then combined feeding, which
is also consuming more feed grains.

So when you look at the whole picture and what they're looking at in terms of it, it doesn't necessarily
require more acres but just higher yields. Higher yields are driven by more nitrogen. So the combination
of looking at what they're doing structurally in the interior and for exports, for higher-end protein
production, all combined for a positive nitrogen environment for Brazil.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research.

Michael Leith Piken
Cleveland Research Company

Yes. Just wanted to get a sense for how your ammonia price realizations may trend. I understand that
you guys booked some products at around $600, and I know [ demand ] has gone up. You also have
the Mosaic contract. So could you talk a little bit about kind of how the price realizations might look for
ammonia in the third quarter and kind of moving forward in terms of the amount of volume you have
committed, that kind of cost plus.

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes. You're right. We have the cost-plus contract with Mosaic that is consistent month-by-month
consumption. And we like that contract. They're a very good customer and a good partner. And you have
the industrial contracts that are -- many of them are based off Tampa, and Tampa is at a high price today,
and we anticipate that continuing just due to the global issues we articulated in our prepared as well as
Q&A remarks. Just due to the high cost structure in Asia and Europe, they're consuming all the low-cost
produced ammonia, which is then shipping to those regions, keeping the market tight.

And then you look at fall ammonia demand in the United States. We're really anticipating corn acreage
increasing, probably over 94 million acres. And last year, we had an exceptionally good ammonia season,
and we've got a lot of that booked for this fall at those prices that we articulated, which are in short
term, you have to remember. And so we have some very good margin opportunities going forward in the
ammonia book.

Michael Leith Piken
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. Great. And then you just talked about on the call kind of being toward the lower end of the volume
guidance of 19 million product tons. I mean in terms of the split of where some of those tons might have
come out versus last year, could you give us like a rough breakdown of like how much of it is going to be
ammonia versus urea versus UAN?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

When we look at it on an ammonia basis, it's easy to communicate that on ammonia because then you're
right, the upgrades are moved around. But we shift our production based on margin. And today, we've got
some very good margin opportunities across the board. So it's a fight for the ton. And I would say, at this
point, with the projections for urea and UAN, that fight will continue. So I would say more to come.

Andrew D. Wong
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So just given the very strong cash flow that you'll probably be generating, and it seems like it's more
than enough for your CapEx priorities and debt reduction. Would you consider a bigger share repurchase
program or some sort of special dividend?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

Probably not a special dividend, but certainly are considering what we would do in the way of a share
repurchase program. Although as Chris has talked about in the past, I think we're much more likely to be
kind of larger, bigger chunks opportunistic as opposed to a ratable program. We think that going about it
that way provides even additional leverage and return opportunity for our equity holders. But certainly,
that's one of the things that we're talking about.

Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just a question on the timing around the antidumping. So a favorable versus unfavorable decision coming
up here, what are the steps after that? And then if it's favorable in the near term, do you think you'll
see a similar phenomenon here with UAN like we saw with phosphate, where the parties, this is against
extensively just stopped delivering and fought this until some kind of conclusion. What should we expect, I
guess, from this process before it's final and its impact on the market?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

So Duffy, the decision, I think, is coming out on Friday. Our expectation is that if we get a favorable
outcome, we would expect UAN to go back to the historical practice of trading at a premium to other
upgraded nitrogen products. That's really where it should trade. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's both
more capital intensive, and therefore, you need to earn an appropriate rate of return on that incremental
capital investment to incent people to make that product. And it also has significant economic and
operational efficiencies for farmers. And so because it's both good for the grower and its higher cost to
produce, it ought to carry a premium, and that's where it was. And that's really where it should be in the
absence of dumped tons.

So that's where we think it goes to longer term. The U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity is sufficient to
serve the U.S. demand. And so there's really no need for those imported, particularly the subsidized tons
to show up over here. And so I think we're well positioned to satisfy U.S. demand. And what it does then
is it just means we don't have to export those tons like we used to. In terms of overall timing on kind of
when imports would stop showing up, I think that's a little bit TBD, but we're talking about relatively short
term on that. In the event that it's not a favorable outcome, I think it's just business as usual because
that's the world that we're living in currently. So it's not like there's downside to what today is that we're
operating with all of those dumpy tons coming in today, and we're finding a way to navigate it despite the
fact that it's challenging. Bert, do you have other thoughts on timing?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Time -- well, we've kind of been given some timing ideas and expectations in that the official first
response is on Friday. And then something by early Q4, we're expected to have a result. And then final
decisions could go as long as into Q1 of next year. But I want to address more of the customer position.
We have long-term relationships that are obviously decades-long but also kind of contractually laid out

and some soft contractual commitments that we work very closely with our customers on supply. And so
those who have been with us or against us in this case, we've been talking to and we'll continue to work
with. And that's why we did a fill program in anticipation, just to -- as a good faith that was appropriately
priced based on the constraints of today, which, again, are high levels of imported subsidized product. But
going forward, we will still work with our customers and be aligned with what is an appropriate price in the
market and continue to communicate and support and help them grow their business, which in the long
term, helps the American farmer and the American economy.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My understanding is that in the third quarter and at some other times, you sell ammonia to industrial
customers on a cost-plus basis. Should those legacy contracts be revisited? That is, are you giving away
too much in this environment? Can you move the contractual terms? Or are you just stuck because they
buy seasonally in a weak quarter for you in terms of volume?

W. Anthony Will
President, CEO & Director

So Jeff, most of our industrial business, part of the reason that it tends to be lower priced is it's ratable.
It doesn't tend to be seasonal. And so there certainly is some level of our business that is on a cost-plus
basis. A lot of those contracts either come up every year, every couple of years for reevaluation. Then we
think about what the market dynamics are from an S&D balance in terms of how much of that business
we want to look at and what the -- how big the plus is in terms of the ad. Some of those contracts at
various points in time were pretty attractive to us. Obviously, right now, the ammonia supply agreement
with Mosaic is far in their favor. But for a number of years, it was a way in our favor. And that was a
very helpful kind of contract when the rest of the business was under pressure to have enhanced margin
coming out of that.

So some of those end up being sort of a natural hedge for us, which isn't a bad thing at all. But it's
certainly one of those things that Bert and his team evaluate how much and how high. And those are the
things that will come probably under a little bit of pressure more than anything else as we see ammonia
applications in clean energy beginning to expand. And so when we're able to make the blue ammonia that
we're talking about earlier and are able to service the demand that will pay appropriate premiums for it,
the place that's going to come out of is the relatively lower value industrial business that we serve today.

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes. The reason Q3 ammonia is the lowest generally is because Q2 and Q4 are our ag ammonia movement
periods, and they're obviously at higher prices. So the actual price throughout the 12 months for our
industrial book is fairly consistent, gas-based or Tampa-based. But you'll see that, I think, do well just
based on where the Tampa average is today.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then for my follow-up, I realized that CF has been a pretty good stock this year. But if you look at it
over a longer period of time, the share price has struggled. And it sounds like you don't really want to buy
back shares in that you want to buy them at a more attractive price. And historically, CF has really not
been interested in raising the dividend. And the market doesn't seem to want to pay a high multiple for
your cash flow for whatever reason. So like what do you do? Like how do people make money in CF over a
longer period of time? You don't want to lever up. What are the levers that are going to lead to an above
average return over time? Or are those out of your hands?

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 10, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, Jeff, I appreciate that question. And I think you have to look at our return in the context of other
companies within the ag space or within the nitrogen space. And I'd say, if you look at, I think, 10-year
return kind of numbers, we're at the top of the heap in terms of what our -- where our peer group has
been. And I think that certainly, there has been some challenges in the interim during that period of time.
But I also think we've done some things that make the company stronger today than it's ever been in
the past. And if you look at how much cash flow we're generating today and how many shares that are
outstanding, the ratio is better today than it was even back in the highest-priced days of the stock and/
or the highest EBITDA that we were generating in the company's history. And so I think the sector may
not be in that much favor right now in the marketplace, but I think the fundamentals of this business are
better than they've ever been in the past.

And I would also say we've taken out, I think, over 50 million shares out of our share count through
repurchases, and it's probably even more than 50 million shares. And that actually has not theme to --
led to any kind of dramatic improvement. And so I'm not sure share repurchase is the answer. I think
what really does drive value for investors in the near term, it's the fundamentals that we're looking at,
which are better than anything we've seen in the last 7 or 8 years. And in the longer term, it is the fact
that ammonia and hydrogen, I think, are really the clear clean energy sources of the future as economies
decarbonize, and we're in the best position to capitalize on that. And as demand starts ramping up and
exceeding supply, I think what you'll see is asset values will tend toward replacement costs, which is way
above where they are today. And so it gives us the opportunity to think about how we want to participate
in that marketplace, and it puts growth clearly back on the radar screen, whether that's inorganic or
organic.

But the fact of the matter is I firmly believe that you move the clock forward several years and ammonia is
going to be in tight supply and people are going to be racing the need to build it. And when that happens,
you see a dramatic uptick in terms of asset value. So we're very optimistic about the return profile that we
offer to our investors.

Your next question comes from the line of Adrien Tamagno with Berenberg.

Adrien Tamagno
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

I have a question on the UAN volumes. It seems it went down much less than urea and ammonia in Q2.
So can you explain why was that the case? And if this projects will be more subject to maintenance in H2
relative to others?

Bert A. Frost
Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development & Supply Chain

Yes. The UAN volume, we did a very good job of moving that product. But as Tony mentioned in one of the
first questions, the pricing was lower, and we had a book that carried in from Q1 and Q4 and then finished
out in Q2. And so as we've talked about, we have a competition for value in the company. And after the
freeze-offs in February, we stepped in and purchased urea, a substantial amount of urea compared to our
historical actions in that market to cover our customer commitments, which we value and make sure that
we do cover because of our ability to produce more UAN. So it's not easily available to go into the market
and purchase UAN, so we chose to purchase urea and some ammonia and run UAN at a very high level
to meet customer commitments. So across the board, on every product, we were able to deliver on time
and even with the substantial disruption that took place in February and March. And so that's why you
saw a volume uptick. And we covered the volume deficit with urea. And you will see how that goes going
forward.
