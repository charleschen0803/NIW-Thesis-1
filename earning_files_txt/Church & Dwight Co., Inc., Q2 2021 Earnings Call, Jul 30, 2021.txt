CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight Second Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's
management may make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's
financial objectives and forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other
factors that are described in detail in the company's SEC filings.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church
& Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then
I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions.
But before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their
continued dedication to keeping our company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and
R&D teams as during this quarter, the company faced the complexities of raw material shortages and labor
shortages at our suppliers and third-party manufacturers.

Now let's talk about the results. Q2 was another solid quarter for the company. Reported sales growth
was 6.4%. Organic sales growth grew 4.5% and exceeded our 4% Q2 outlook. The 4.5% organic growth
is impressive, considering Q2 2020 organic sales growth was 8.4%. Adjusted EPS was $0.76 and that's
$0.07 better than our outlook.

The EPS beat is attributed to two things: one, a temporary reduction in marketing; and two, our revenue
growth handily exceeded our outlook. Another item that is noteworthy is we overcame a tax rate, which
was much, much higher than expected in Q2.

We grew consumption in 13 of the 16 categories in which we compete and in some cases, on top of big
consumption gains last year. Another way to look at this is to compare our Q2 consumption on those 16
categories to 2019, a pre-COVID year. We have higher consumption in 14 of those 16 categories compared
to Q2 2019.

Regarding brand performance, 9 of our 13 brands saw a double-digit consumption growth, and I'll
name them for you: gummy vitamins, stain fighters, cat litter, condoms, battery-powered toothbrushes,
depilatories, dry shampoo, saline spray and water flossers. Now although many of our brands delivered
double-digit consumption growth, it is not reflected in our 4.5% organic sales growth as shipments were
constrained by supply issues, which we do expect to lessen by Q4.

In Q2, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 14.2%. Our online sales increased by 7% year-over-
year. But remember, this is on top of the 75% growth in e-commerce that we experienced in Q2 2020
versus '19. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales.

With 70% of American adults having at least 1 vaccine shot so far, the U.S. has been opening up with
consumers becoming more mobile. In recent days, however, it appears that trend could slow down due to
the Delta variant combined with many people still being unvaccinated.

Outside the U.S., many countries continue to enforce periodic lockdowns, and we expect that to continue.
As described in the release, we faced shortages of raw and packaging materials, labor shortages that
suppliers and third-party manufacturers have reduced their ability to produce and transportation
challenges have further contributed to supply problems.

Besides shortages, we are dealing with inflation. Significant inflation of material and component cost is
affecting our gross margin expectations, which Rick will cover in his remarks. Due to a lower case fill rate,

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

we pulled back on Q2 marketing, especially for household products. We expect the supply issues to begin
to abate in Q4. The higher input costs and transportation costs are expected to continue, though, for the
rest of the year.

On past earnings calls, we described how we expected categories and brands to perform in 2021. Overall,
our full year thinking is generally consistent. To name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry
additives and cat litter is expected to remain elevated in 2021. Condoms, dry shampoo and water flossers
are recovering and experiencing year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater
mobility. Baking soda and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs.

Now I'm going to talk about the divisions. Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.8%. This
is on top of 10.7% organic growth in Q2 2020. Looking at market shares in Q2, 5 out of our 13 power
brands met or gained share. Our share results are clearly impacted by our supply issues. I'll comment on
a few of the brands right now.

VITAFUSION gummy vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q2, up 10%. Consumers have made
health and wellness a priority. It appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're
staying. So here's a supporting statistic. In the last year, VITAFUSION household penetration is up 17%.
That means the brand is now in one out of every 10 households.

Next up is WATERPIK. WATERPIK grew consumption 72% in Q2 as it continues to recover from COVID
lows and benefits from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. WATERPIK is also
benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels. We expect the frequency of our Lunch
& Learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year.

BATISTE dry shampoo grew consumption 37%. Dry shampoo is recovering as stores have reopened and
consumers are becoming more mobile. Similarly, TROJAN delivered 11% consumption growth. Society has
been opening up. As restaurants, bars and clubs have reopened, people are hooking up again. Here's a
fun fact that might be a contributing factor. In Q2, TROJAN launched on TikTok with explosive uptake from
consumers with over 47 million views.

Next, I want to discuss international. Despite intermittent lockdowns in our markets, our international
business came through with 10.4% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by our strong growth
in our Global Markets Group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. WATERPIK, BATISTE and
ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter.

Our Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 11.8% organic growth. This was
driven by higher pricing and volume. Milk prices remained stable and demand is high for our nutritional
supplements. The prior year quarterly organic growth for Specialty Products was 3%, so 11.8% is an
impressive result.

Now turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. In 2021, we
have launched many new products, which are described in our press release. In the household products
portfolio, we introduced OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer. It's the first and only sanitizing laundry
additive that boosts stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses.

In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry Gummies, Triple Immune Gummies
and Power Zinc Gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity. WATERPIK launched
WATERPIK ION, a water flosser which is 30% smaller with a long-lasting lithium-ion battery. It is
specifically designed for smaller bathrooms spaces.

To capitalize on its earlier success WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was
upgraded to SONIC-FUSION 2.0, with 2 brush head sizes and 2 brush speeds, and that's doing extremely
well. And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with at-home
manicure and pedicure solutions.

Now let's turn to the outlook. Since we last spoke to you in April, unplanned cost inflation has grown by
another $35 million. In addition to the price increases on 33% of our portfolio that we announced in April,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

5

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

we have just announced price increases on other categories, which means we have now priced up 50% of
our portfolio.

Of course, there is a lag on the positive impact of these increases, which impacts our earnings outlook.
We now expect to be at the lower end of our range of adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% as a result of
heightened input costs.

Although we expect to be at the low end of the range, it's really important to remember that we are
comping 15% EPS growth in 2020. We expect full year reported sales growth of 5% with 4% full year
organic sales growth. It's also important to call out that we are committed to maintaining the long-term
health of our brands by ensuring sustained high levels of marketing investment in the second half.

In conclusion, July consumption continues to be strong. We are navigating through significant supply
challenges and cost inflation. We believe we are well positioned for 2022 with the pricing actions we
have taken. We expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times and in uncertain
economic times such as now. We have a strong balance sheet, and we continue to hunt for TSR-accretive
businesses.

Next up is Rick to give us details on Q2.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS, which
excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was $0.76, down 1.3% to prior year. And as we discussed in
previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the
earnout period.

$0.76 was better than our $0.69 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand for many
of our products as well as a temporary reduction in marketing spend as supply chain shortages were
impacting customer fill rates, which we expect to recover in Q4. The $0.76 includes a $0.04 drag from a
higher tax rate and a $0.04 drag from the VMS recall costs. Reported revenue was up 6.4%. Organic sales
were up 4.5%, driven by a volume increase of 4.3%.

Matt covered the top line, and I'll jump right into gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin was
43.4%, a 340 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was right in line with our outlook for down 350
basis points for the quarter. Gross margin was impacted by 480 basis points of higher manufacturing
costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution and labor costs.

Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by an additional 50 basis points. These costs were partially
offset by a positive 40 basis point impact from price/volume mix and a positive 140 basis point impact
from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis point positive impact from currency.

Moving to marketing, marketing was down $5.3 million year-over-year as we lowered spend to reduce
demand until fill rates could recover. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis
points to 9.2%. We continue to expect full year marketing expense as a percentage of net sales to be
approximately 11.5%, in line with historical averages.

For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A decreased 140 basis points year-over-year with lower legal costs and
lower incentive comp. Other expense all-in was $11.4 million, a $3.3 million decline due to lower interest
expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24%
compared to 19.6% in 2020, an increase of 440 basis points primarily driven by lower stock option
exercises. You will hear in a minute this also impacts our full year tax rate.

And now to cash. For the full -- for the first 6 months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased
42% to $344 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital. Accounts
payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

As a reminder, in the year ago numbers, there was an $80 million benefit in Q2 related to the timing of
U.S. federal income tax payments shifting from the second to the third quarter in the prior year. We expect
cash from operations to be approximately $950 million for the full year.

As of June 30, cash on hand was $149.8 million. Our full year CapEx plan is now $140 million as we
continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity primarily focused on laundry, litter and
vitamins. The decrease from our previous $180 million is project timing related.

For Q3, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3% and organic sales growth of approximately
1.5% entirely due to supply chain constraints. We expect gross margin expansion in the quarter led by our
price increases. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.70 per share, flat from the last year's adjusted EPS as
strong operating performance is offset by a higher tax rate.

And now for the full year outlook. We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be approximately
5%, organic sales growth to be approximately 4%. Our consumption is strong and outpacing shipments.
We expect our customer fill levels to improve by Q4.

Turning to gross margin. We now expect full year gross margin to be down 75 basis points. This represents
an incremental impact from our last guidance due to broad-based inflation on raw materials and
transportation costs. Our April outlook expected gross margin to be flat for the year and $90 million of
inflation from our original guidance. Now we're absorbing $125 million of incremental costs for the full
year. This additional $35 million of inflation drives the change in our gross margin outlook.

We have taken another round of pricing actions with over 50% of our global brands having announced
price increase. While some of this benefit helps the second half of 2021, most of the benefit is in 2022. As
a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin.

The $35 million movement versus our previous outlook is primarily non-commodity-related.
Transportation, labor, third-party manufacturers and other raw material price increases make up the
majority. Commodities are also up. And while we have 80% of our commodities hedged, let me give you a
sense of what's going on with major commodities.

Over the past few months, second half expectations for resins have moved up considerably. For example,
previously in our forecast, it was based on HDPE being up 30% in the second half of the year. Now it's up
60%. Polypro has moved from being up 40% to now 90%. In addition, transportation costs such as diesel
have continued to rise. We previously expected second half diesel to be up 18% and now it's up 27%.
Cartons and corrugate previously were single digit, now they're low double digit. So that's the latest in
commodities.

And now we'll move to tax. Our full year tax rate expectations are now 23%, higher versus our last
expectations due to lower stock option exercises. This is a $0.04 drag versus our previous outlook. We
now expect adjusted EPS to be at the lower end of our previous range of 6% to 8%.

Our brands continue to go from strength to strength as strong consumption and organic sales growth
lapsed almost 10% organic growth a year ago. While inflation is broad-based, we have taken pricing
actions to mitigate, which gives us confidence in margin expansion in the back half.
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Crédit Suisse.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Questions on the supply constraints, which is, are you running into constraints because perhaps demand is
better than you thought you can't keep up? Is it that there are certain pieces within the supply chain that
just tightened up, maybe a particular bottleneck that's isolated? Could you just maybe just give us a bit of
-- maybe more detail into exactly what's going on there?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. The issue is not that we're capacity constrained. We have capacity. The issue is getting components,
can be raw or packaging materials, chemicals, et cetera. And the reason there are shortages is because
our suppliers are having trouble getting labor into their plants to actually make their raw packaging
materials. And then that's exacerbated by the fact that sometimes, you can't get the product delivered,
particularly if you're having -- if you're sourcing components or ingredients from Asia and you're dealing
with containers.

So not a capacity issue. It's entirely due to ability to get labor. And in some cases, it's because of the
freeze. We had force majeure for half a dozen of our suppliers, chemicals. If you recall earlier in the year,
the Texas Freeze, so we're not quite out of the woods on that one yet either.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. The only thing I would add to that is the force majeure comment, like we said publicly back in Q1, we
had around 6 of them. We had 10 or 11 in this quarter. So it's just fewer disruptions in the supply chain.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And maybe just your best guess on -- is the labor issue abating at all? Or are these
comments related to 2Q and maybe you're seeing it abate? Or does it seem -- is your view that it's likely
to be an ongoing thing?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Well, it's -- we think it's starting to abate. We're seeing that from some of our suppliers and co-packers.
It's -- you have to say that the weekly unemployment supplement is contributing to the labor shortages.
And of course, that's going to roll off in September. So you think that things would loosen up a bit come
the fourth quarter.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

And we look at demand planning all the way back to the entire supply chain. And all of our independent
forecasts say that raw material input costs and whatnot were at recovery late Q3, early Q4.

Operator

Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I also wanted to -- I also have a few questions on the supply chain disruptions. Any more color you can
provide in terms of what categories are impacted? And as you think about the adjustment to your organic
sales growth guidance for the year, is it fair to say that maybe you could have even raised it if you didn't
have the supply chain disruptions?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. That's a fair question, Rupesh. I think could have, would have, should have, but consumption is
really strong. Matt said it in his prepared comments and I did as well. And so if you look at consumption,
it's really high single digits in the quarter, and we were closer to 2.8% organic. So definitely, we are
constrained. And if you roll that forward to the full year, then we likely would have been at the top end of
the range on revenue if not for supply chain disruptions.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. And Rupesh, to answer the other half of your question, if you pick up the release and you look at the
schedules in the back, and I'm sure you have, you'll see that household products is down year-over-year.
And so that's where it's most acute. So fabric care shipments are constrained by supply shortages. We
got plenty of demand out there, but the shortages are affecting the household side of the business, which
would include both laundry detergent, stain fighters and litter. So we do expect they'll be out of the woods
by the end of the third quarter.

Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay, great. And then I guess from a retail perspective, if you go to -- I know you look at your leading
retails, Walmart and some of the other players, are you -- are there starting to be added stocks out there?
Or do you expect to see out of stocks, I guess, sometime this quarter within some of those categories?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

I think we've got kind of living hand to mouth right now. If we were to get most worse than what we have
today, I think we would have out of stocks. I think our great -- most acute area for out of stocks would be
on OXICLEAN sprays right now, the triggers.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Question for both of you on pricing. Matt, I think the comment was that you now will price over 50% of
the portfolio. A couple of questions related to that because it would certainly seem like there's a cost
justification across the board. Have you led where you can lead at this point?

Is there an expectation then that the competition will ultimately move and that's not in the guidance?
Maybe just some parameters a little bit around what has not been priced and why not at this point? And
then, Rick, maybe just layer on there, what portion of the commodity cost exposure over the next 12
months you think you have captured here with current pricing.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, you hit the nail on the head, Kevin. Price increases do need cost justification. They're greater in
some categories than others, but you also have to keep an eye on the competitive set. So we are looking

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

at the rest of the portfolio now to see whether it makes sense to have a 2022 price increase. And the
other thing we're going to do is we're going to review the price increases that we've already taken on the
first 50% and ask ourselves if those need to be revisited.

As far as the price increases go, we announced in April for laundry, those have taken effect now in July.
We know at least one other competitor has said publicly that their prices are going up in Q4. So we may
have some temporary price gaps in Q3.

But -- and then on the litter side, we raised price there. That pricing is shelf mid-October. And we know
that one major competitor has already raised price as well, so we've seen that. And I think Rick mentioned
on the earlier call in April that when we were planning this, we were not assuming that competitors would
follow. So the fact that since then, in laundry and litter, we've heard and seen that from a couple of
competitors, that's a good indication for us. Rick, anything to add?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, the only thing I'd add is on your first question, Kevin, you just asked for kind of a roll forward for
2022. And the simple way to think about it is, when we gave our April outlook, inflation was at minus 300
basis points, and that was what was included in our flat guidance. Now our inflation number is closer to
minus 375. That's kind of the entire change from going flat to minus 75.

And that minus 375 for the full year is kind of an indication of the inflation that we've seen for the whole
year, inclusive of the first [ $90 million ], inclusive of the new $35 million that we're talking about. As we
exit the year, we think price/volume mix will be a tailwind of like 285 basis points. So that's probably a
good -- the way to gauge it is we're not quite recovering all of our inflation yet, but we've only priced half
the portfolio.

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. If I could just squeeze in one more, guys. Maybe just on M&A, the pipeline. And if any of the
volatility, which certainly I think we would say, would be transitory over the next, call it, 2 to 4 quarters
here, supply chain working through some of the COVID volatility, et cetera, at least certainly that would be
the hope. Does any of that give you pause with transacting from an M&A perspective until things kind of
settle a bit? And I'll pass it on.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Is your question, Kevin, would be reluctant to buy a business that had a COVID bump?

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just in general, Matt, just in terms of even buying off, putting multiples on NTM sort of earnings and right,
just given some of the volatility around supply chain, this COVID flare up here a little bit. You guys have
done a fantastic job over the years from an M&A perspective. But even that being said, does any of that
gives you some pause here given some volatility over the next 12 months?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, look, we are wary of businesses that had a big COVID bump. Remember, we bought one in
December. Remember, we bought ZICAM. We're #1 in cold shortening, 73% market share. And we bought
that for the future because we know that's going to be a strong contributor to sales and profits, not only in
'22, but years ahead.

So yes, we will have a degree of skepticism, but we -- I can tell you, there are things for sale right now
that we are looking at. It's a question of whether they're going to meet our criteria.

Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.

Olivia Tong Cheang
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask you a little bit about your view on trade promotion and the levels of trade promotion right
now, particularly as you put in the pricing. If you could just talk to the first few weeks of impact of that.

I know it's very early days with respect to laundry and about any retail response, consumer response so
far that you can see. And then for the second tranche of pricing, if you could just talk to the magnitude of
change that you're looking for there, that would be great.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Thanks, Olivia. So your second question first is we won't really get into the magnitude of change,
right? We'll be very clear next quarter after it's in market, and we'll disclose similar to what we did for
laundry. Laundry was high single digits. And so we'll do the same thing for litter and some of the other
items in 3 months, we'll go through that detail. On your first question...

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, with respect to sold on deal, it's a little early to draw any conclusions about what's going on at shelf. I
think it's important to just have the backdrop of Q2 for both laundry and litter.

Take litter, for example, year-over-year, sold on deal for litter was actually down 80 basis points. So the
categories right now, promotion in the second quarter, around 13% sold on deal. Historically, it's around
19% to 20%. And so it's pretty off its normal sold on deal percentages.

So -- but we do know that one major competitor besides ARM & HAMMER has had supply issues as well in
the second quarter, which I'm not going to name. So that may have contributed to the fact that litter sold
on deal was down in Q2 for just about all competitors.

For laundry, Q2 was up almost 1,200 basis points to about 32% sold on deal for liquid laundry detergent.
Remember, last year, promotions were pulled. So it's not surprising that there would be a rebound this
year. We actually had the lowest increase in sold on deal, up 700 basis points in Q2. And our lower
promotions made sense in the context of supply shortages. And obviously, going forward, we only want
the price to stick so the promotions would also be limited as well.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

And as to the price increase, and again, it was early July, so it's only been a few weeks, so we're reluctant
to comment. I would just tell you that it's as we expected to date.

Olivia Tong Cheang
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. If I could just ask 2 more questions. First, in terms of your sales guide, the change on the sales
guide, obviously, some supply chain and -- disruptions. But Specialty was actually quite a bit better. I
know it's a lot smaller, but just thinking about your view in terms of the mix of contribution to the top line
for the full year.

And then a follow-up on the margins. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about operating margin
expansion long term and the leverage you can pull in order to get back on track with respect to margin
expansion because, obviously, pricing is a piece of that. But mix is not as big of a factor for you guys
relative to some of your peers and then you're already still good at overhead control. So just wondering
how much you can push on the G&A or the S&A as an offset.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Olivia, you squeezed in a multipart, half a dozen questions there as you're walking off the stage. I'll start
with the SPD. As far as the SPD business goes, yes, it had a really good quarter. Last year, the quarter was
up 3% this year, up 10%. But if you look in the release, you see that price was half of that growth. So we
have been raising prices in SPD.

We probably were the earliest of all 3 divisions of raising price in Specialty Products. And that's both on
the animal side and also on the bulk sodium bicarbonate side. Bulk sodium bicarbonate is oftentimes a
contracted business, but the non-contracted volume, we've been raising price. So that's a steady business,
a good quarter. It will have a good third quarter as well.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, Olivia, is our outlook for the divisions, we told you last quarter,
was Domestic was 4%, International was 6% and SPD was 6%. I think if we had to rejigger that today,
it would be more like 3%, 6%, 9%. So domestic at 3%, largely because of the supply constraints;
International consistently at 6%; and then SPD now is at 9%.

As far as your gross margin question, look, I think you're right, pricing over the long term recovers the
inflation. And so that is a good guy and a bad guy, and they kind of wash over time. Look, we have a lot of
confidence in our evergreen model, and it's only 25 basis points of expansion. So we're going to get that
over the long term through productivity, through innovation and through mix.

And we're doing a lot of work internally on mix actually and using technology to trade optimize and
product optimize across retailers. And so that work is ongoing, but those are 3 levers that we have.

Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

You gave good comments on the supply constraints and the shortage issues. But 2 questions to follow up.
First, you talked about this a bit on litter, but is there a way you can frame or clarify the issues relative
to competition and whether you're -- are you saying you're disadvantaged on this front? In itself, that's a
concern or not really? Number one.

And then number two, if these constraints endure longer than you expect, is the playbook to pull back on
marketing for longer? And at what point would that become a concern? I'm not saying that it is now, but
just at what point do you get concerned on that front?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

What's the first one?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Competition.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, you have question about litter. No, we...

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

No, it wasn't really -- sorry, Matt, it wasn't really about litter. I think you'd mentioned that you share the
same issues on litter as your competition. But just generally, is it you or is it everybody?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

I think we have different issues. We don't have the same issues as our competitor. We just happen to
know that there are some supply constraints that they're dealing with that are affecting their ability to
ship. That's all. I think everybody's got issues.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. And in other categories, is it -- again, is it everybody? Or is it -- you have the issues different?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Well, the Texas Freeze isn't just us. Those chemicals affect lots and lots of companies and lots of
competitors. So I would say on the chemical side and transportation side, it's very similar between us and
competitors. And labor shortages as well if you have suppliers or co-packers, that's universal. So I don't
know that there's anything that's unique to Church & Dwight.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, great. And maybe, Rick, on marketing?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. On marketing, I think we've been very clear, when we look at all of our forecasts and all of our
internal information, we think we're going to be recovered by late Q3, early Q4. We think the marketing is
good demand driving activity and kind of healthy. We have put price increases out there for the back half.

So we want to make sure we're supporting our brands in a healthy way. 5 of 13 brands gained share, and
part of that was -- is lower than normal. And part of that is because they're supply constrained. So we
want to make sure that once that's not a factor that we're supporting the brands like we should, and that's
the plan. If for some reason, supply constraints last longer, then, of course, we would adjust as necessary.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, okay. And then just real quick on the tax rate. Do we -- is the expectation that we revert back lower
beyond '21? Or is the higher tax rate to be extrapolated?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. The core issue with the tax rate is really it all comes down to stock options exercised. And typically,
we've had around 2 million stock options exercised every year, if you go back and look for many years.
In 2020, it was 3 million, and our forecast this year is a little less than 1 million now. And so we think,
perhaps due to the run-up in the share price last year, that was really maybe a pull forward every year
with the stock option potentially. So we think it will normalize back to 2019 levels is the quick answer.

Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

To maybe oversimplify, but I need that because I'm a fairly simple person, is it safe to say just
commodities and input costs were kind of moving higher when you last reported in late April? You're
kind of taking a best guess of where they would play out for this year. They kept moving throughout the
quarter but did peak at some point in the quarter. So now you have a lot more confidence kind of where
pricing and costs are for the remainder of the year. Is that the right way to look at it?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

I think that's one aspect of it, Bill. I think that's a good way to say it. And then also, we've had more
broad-based inflation beyond commodities than we expected, right? I used the example at our Board
meeting, how we've never talked about pallets in the history of me being here for cost impacts, and our
pallets went up by $2 million in the back half.

So it's just really broad-based. All the third-party manufacturers are passing on the 2%, the 3% to 4%
issues that we've been talking about. So I think we have a great handle on it now. And meanwhile, what
are we doing about it? We've -- we're qualifying a lot more suppliers just to have backup redundancies
and flexibility.

William Bates Chappell
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And on the cost side, do you feel like there's any disadvantage, I mean, in terms of your scale? And I feel
that you're a $5 billion business, but really you're 15 $300 million to $500 million businesses. And so I just
didn't know if the suppliers are treating you differently versus maybe a $1 billion competitor or if it's kind
of across the board, fairly similar?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, I think this is across the board. It's pretty broad-based. I think if you look at -- and you have, but
other peers in the industry right now, even some of our European partners, peers, then it's really broad-
based and it's across the spectrum. It doesn't really matter if you're a $2 billion or a $5 billion or a $50
billion company.

William Bates Chappell
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then one last one kind of follow-up. I don't typically ask about the M&A pipeline, but with the
sheer number of SPACs and consumers focused SPACs, with the IPO market being fairly prolific, I mean,
is it kind of safe to say that some of the traditional $200 million -- $300 million to $500 million revenue
businesses that you would target are less likely over the foreseeable future just because they have other
options? I imagine most of these companies are getting an offer a day to go public one way or the other.
So just any thoughts there?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, there's a lot of logic in that, Bill. There's no question that there are other destinations like SPACs that
companies looking to monetize their investment can take. But based on what we're looking at right now
about what's coming to market and will be an auction, we think we'll have plenty to look at, at least in the
next 6 months.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Keep in mind, similar to private equity, Bill, I mean, SPACs is the same. We have an ability to pay
more typically because of the synergies that we can generate. So that's always -- when it's a down the
middle acquisition, that's always a great benefit.

Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.

Andrea Faria Teixeira
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So first on International [indiscernible] clarification on the cost outlook. On the International side, I know
it's a smaller portion, but we dedicated most of the time for U.S. So I wanted to just see -- like the U.S.,
the 6% growth that you just reiterated for International because obviously, that's the long-term algorithm.

But given that you had a very strong start of the year and how are you seeing given that you're -- you've
got this like more conservative guidance for top line in the back half, so what -- and you're obviously up
against a mid-teens comp for the balance of the year. Are you assuming that it goes negative in the back
half? So I want to clarify that.

And also on the new guidance, Rick, you're expecting commodities, are you vetting that commodities and
transportation will ease? Or are you assuming that they will stay as we see on spot on your head?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Let's talk about International for starters. Yes, we had a good second quarter. We're saying 6% for
the full year. But we are cognizant of the fact that we see intermittent shutdowns in many of the markets
where we have businesses. So we have to keep that and get that in mind. And we get this Delta variant
as well, which could result in even further more expansive lockdowns and effect on consumer mobility in
international markets. So that's what tempers our enthusiasm.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

And in terms of comps, Andrea, you do have to be mindful of our growth rates a year ago international,
right? In Q2 a year ago, we were flat. We were 0.6% on organic growth. And so the 10.4% this year, it's
very impressive. It's off a flat prior year.

Q3 and Q4 last year, the back half was mid-teens, so 13% growth. And so if you look at our guidance, it
implies, I don't know, 5% or 6% growth in the back half. But when you do the stack, it actually looks like
the International business is very, very strong.

Okay. And then your second question was really on the commodity outlook. Well, as of right now, I kind
of just went through some of the numbers with the latest expectations on resins as an example and paper
and diesel. Right now, our outlook implies that the commodities stay where they're at today. We're not
banking on a decline or a movement down on commodities for the balance of the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I know we've talked a lot about supply chain. But I had to just follow up, I think, in the line of question
that Bill Chappell embarked upon. I mean my question, looking at what happened this quarter and what
you're talking about is just if there isn't something to consider in terms of you guys just running too lean,
right? I mean that's been a hallmark of the way that you operate the business.

But when you look at this quarter and the conversation on supply and so on, it feels like you've exposed
yourselves to business risk that other companies are frankly finding their way to manage through. So
maybe it's too early to talk about, but just thoughts about how looking forward, you might want to set up
differently so that you can better weather these sorts of storms?

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, we -- I'm surprised that would be your conclusion, considering that we're saying that our full
year organic is going to be up 4%. It's going to be the fourth year in a row that we have organic sales of
4% or better. And in spite of the fact that we have $125 million in unplanned incremental costs that -- our
full year range of 6% to 8%, we found our way to 6%.

So I would say that the company has proven that it's resilient, actually, faced with those kind of cost
increases. And I think it's temporary with respect to the supply issues, and we will get -- that will be
behind us at some point. But -- yes. Go ahead, then.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Well, the only thing I would add is, look, some of our competition is vertically integrated in some aspects
of their supply chain. And some of these examples were not vertically integrated. We've chosen not to do
that. We don't think it makes so much sense. And in times like this, it might hurt a little bit.

But overall, we're doing the best we can to move our -- whatever it is, 300 to 400 suppliers and add 90
more, right, add the flexibility and the capacity there. So our flex capacity as we exit this COVID-type
environment is going to be greater than it's ever been before.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, a good point. And Lauren, that's not a throwaway comment. Over the past 18 months, we've qualified
90 additional suppliers and co-packers so that as we come out of this, we're going to be far more resilient.
And that started last year when we saw where we're -- how COVID exposed some of the weak links in our
supply chain.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Rick, that's exactly what I was asking and looking for. Next question was just on gross margin. I'm
actually having a little bit of trouble as I play around with numbers in this sequential improvement that
you're talking about, because volume, I would think -- I know you get pricing coming in, but volume will
be a little bit challenged on that price/volume mix line, I guess the implied sequential improvement and
then also I guess, the commodity headwind.

I just -- I don't know if we -- the best way to attack it, it might be off-line, but kind of the big sequential
changes in the gross margin bridge that help you get to -- I think you said a modest expansion in 3Q?
That would just be helpful.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. So maybe what I'll do for right now is just give you the second half kind of gross margin bridge. And
of course, Q3 will be -- it will be positive, but it will be slightly positive, more of the margin benefits in Q4
as we fully lap or fully have the price benefit.

But the second half gross margin outlook, right, the first half is down 230, the second half is up 80, and
price/volume mix is a tailwind of what we think is 285 basis points. Inflation is a headwind of around 285
basis points.

We have incremental tariffs of the 35 basis points, which is a little bit better than it was in the first
half because we had tariffs starting a year ago. We have productivity programs of around plus 85. The
acquisition for largely ZICAM helps on margin by about 40 basis points, and then currency is a little bit of
a drag. So that's how we get to plus 80 in the back half.

Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. That's super helpful. And then final thing, which is on the incentive compensation call out this
quarter, I guess I was curious if that was at the outset of the year, what you had anticipated. Or is that
something that was a true up this quarter and how to think about that in terms of SG&A for the balance?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. No, it's an impact on the quarter. It's an impact on the full year. It's probably why our SG&A is down
in both cases for the quarter and the full year. And that wasn't expected, but it's a reality now because
we're one of only -- we're the exception in the industry that has gross margin tied to incentive comp. And
right now, our gross margin is down 75 basis points. That was not the plan. That was not the incentive
plan. And so that has a favorable impact, unfortunately, on the SG&A numbers.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.

Christopher Michael Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I just wanted to clarify a couple of things around pricing. I think you said your main competitor or a large
competitor at litter has already priced. Clearly, there was some revenue growth management initiatives
by competitors in laundry. And so those are 2 categories where presumably, it seems people -- companies
have already moved and then you're moving. So is there a read there that you're comfortable following
with pricing? And so you want to see pricing happen in other categories first that -- I suppose just confirm
whether I heard that right.

And then just connected to that, it sounded like pricing in laundry is going okay, early days, but you also
have supply issues in household. And did it sound like it's mainly in areas where it's like components --
or could supply chain issues actually have an issue on getting pricing through in laundry if you start to
experience some out of stocks? So just some clarification and further perspective on some of those line
items would be helpful.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, lastly, pricing has been accepted by the trade in laundry. So that's sort of behind us right now.
Litter is ahead of us. That's going to be taking effect in Q4. But we think, both for laundry and for litter by
Q4, we'll be out of our supply issues.

The other question about raising price not just in laundry and litter but in other categories, which we
have. So for example, NAIR, OXICLEAN stain fighters, baking soda -- we announced one variant of
TROJAN condoms. WATERPIK will be raising price as well. So we've been able to -- we're announcing price
increases in many categories. And keep in mind that we are the #1 brand in stain fighters, depilatories,
water flossers, baking soda, et cetera. So we do have some strength and the ability to lead there.

And so I think that's -- and your other question with respect to the -- what are the issues with respect
to laundry. I mentioned earlier in my comments that because of the Texas Freeze, there are issues with
chemicals, and that affects both liquid laundry detergent and [ unit dose ]. And we expect that to be
abating as well. And I don't expect that the shortages to impact our ability to succeed in pushing through
price.

Christopher Michael Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And if I could just squeeze one in and again, keep it quick. Promo and coupon has been a relative
lever for Church & Dwight because of -- cutting it less than some of your competitors. Have you exhausted

17

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

that flexibility that you did have in the P&L in the back half, said another way, taking your couponing and
promo levels closer to peers? Or does that remain a lever at your disposal if things get worse?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, yes, I mentioned earlier on litter, the litter category sold on deal is around 12%, 13%. So
whereas historically, it's around 19% to 20%. So we and competitors are -- all have depressed sold on
deal. And with our announced price increase -- and another competitor has -- we've seen price increases
as well. We don't expect that to change in the second half.

And as far as laundry goes, it is -- we are up quite a bit year-over-year, 700 basis points. We're not as
high as our competitors nor do we expect to be at least for the next 90 days, as our price increase has to
take hold and we don't want to detract from that with the promotions.

Operator

And that's the last question of the day. I would now like to turn the call back over to Matt Farrell for
closing remarks.
