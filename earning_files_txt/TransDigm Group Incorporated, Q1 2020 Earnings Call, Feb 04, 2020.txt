Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 TransDigm Group
Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Liza Sabol, Treasurer and Director of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.

Liza Sabol
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm Fiscal 2020 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting
this morning are TransDigm's Executive Chairman, Nick Howley; President and Chief Executive Officer,
Kevin Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a
supplemental slide deck and call replay information.

Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical
in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements,
please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our
website or at sec.gov.

We'd also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically
as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial
measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the
most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliation.

I'll now turn the call over to Nick.

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

Good morning, and thanks again for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start off with some summary comments
on our consistent strategy, a few comments on the operating performance and outlook and capital
allocation and then Kevin and Mike will expand and give more color.

To reiterate, we're unique in the industry due to both our consistency and our ability to create intrinsic
shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize the reasons why we believe this, about
90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and about 3/4 of our sales come from products for
which we believe we are the sole source provider. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues,
which typically have significantly higher margins and provide relative stability in the downturns.

Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public
market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as the careful
allocation of our capital. We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically: one, we own and operate
proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content; second, we utilize a simple, well-
proven, value-based operating methodology; third, we have a very decentralized organization structure
and a unique compensation system closely aligned with our shareholders; fourth, we acquire businesses
that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns; and lastly, our capital structure and
allocation are a significant portion of our value creation methodology.

As you saw from our press release, we're off to a good start in fiscal year 2020 with solid operating
performance in the quarter. Revenues and EBITDA as defined are up substantially. Of course, much of this
is due to the Esterline acquisition. But organic revenue growth was also up nicely. EBITDA margins were
up versus the prior year as both the TransDigm base legacy and the acquired businesses all performed
well. We continue to generate real intrinsic value for our investors.

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Far and away, the largest portion of our revenue, our worldwide commercial aerospace revenue, was up
about 9% in Q1 versus the prior year driven primarily by a very strong commercial aftermarket growth.
Our smaller worldwide defense revenue was also up. Defense bookings were down a little, but defense
bookings can be lumpy. At this time, fiscal year 2020 continues to look like a good year for TransDigm,
though we see possible clouds on the horizon.

The commercial aftermarket was quite strong in Q1. However, given the uncertainty around the 737
program production rates, possible attendant inventory ripples and uncertainty in China-related travel,
we are leaving our full year guidance unchanged. We have begun to trim our cost. However, this is a little
more difficult than usual, given the uncertainty in the 737 timing. We're watching this closely and are
prepared to react more quickly if required. To put the 737 MAX OE production program into perspective
for TransDigm, at full production rate, it makes up somewhere between 3% and 4% of our revenue and a
smaller percent of our EBITDA. Kevin will discuss the quarter and the year in more detail.

With respect to M&A and capital allocation, in the last 6 months, we closed and received payment on the
sale of both the Souriau business for about $920 million and our EIT group of businesses for about $190
million. As I said last quarter, we may still sell some smaller businesses with less proprietary aerospace
and aftermarket content. If we do so, as of today, I don't expect that they would be significant in size.

With respect to capital allocation, in the last 6 months, we paid both a $30 per share special dividend
and a $32.50 per share special dividend. The combined special dividends of $62.50 per share or about
$3.5 billion is roughly 12.5% of the equity value at the start of fiscal year '20. This is a pretty substantial
payout. Due to the divestitures, combined with the solid cash generation from our operating businesses,
we're able to make these payments to our shareholders and still maintain substantial liquidity and
firepower. As usual, we will review our go-forward capital allocation over the balance of the year and see
where we stand towards the end of the year.

We now expect to have over $3 billion of cash at the end of fiscal year '20. We also have significant
additional borrowing capacity under our credit line and our credit agreement. We have the financial
flexibility and capital market access to deal with any currently anticipated capital requirements, allocations
or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. We continue to actively evaluate and seek M&A
opportunities. We have a decent pipeline, as usual, mostly in the small to mid-range. I can't predict or
comment on any possible closings. But as I said before, we're still working steadily in M&A and are open
for business.

And now let me hand this over to Kevin to review our 2020 performance outlook and some other items.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Nick. Today, I'll review our results by key market, then discuss the profitability of the business for
the quarter. I'll also comment on the fiscal year guidance and review some other operational items.

As you have seen, we had a strong first quarter and a good start to the year. Mike will provide more
details on the financials. But our first quarter operations, specifically, revenue and EBITDA as defined
were up substantially over last year due in part to good organic growth as well as continued acquisition
integration and performance. Q1 GAAP revenues were up approximately 48% versus prior year Q1, and
EBITDA as defined was up 40% versus the prior year with margins approaching 47% of revenue.

Now we will review our revenue by market category. For the remainder of the call, I will provide color
commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2019. That is assuming we own
the same mix of businesses in both periods. Please note that beginning this quarter, this market analysis
discussion now includes the results of the former Esterline businesses.

In the commercial market, which makes up close to 70% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into
OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM market revenue increased approximately 1% in Q1 when
compared with Q1 of fiscal year 2019. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the majority
of our commercial OEM business, were flat versus prior year Q1. However, bookings solidly outpaced Q1
sales in the current period by more than 15%. We did see minimal headwind from the impact of 737 MAX

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

production halt this quarter. However, we believe any currently anticipated impact from the MAX issues
should not have a material impact on our EBITDA for the full fiscal year. We are very diversified across
all platforms worldwide. So the impact of the 737 MAX or any single program should not be material to
TransDigm in the aggregate. Aside from isolated issues with a few aerospace platforms, general industry
consensus remains mostly favorable long term as significant OEM backlog remains across the industry.
We are currently assessing the near-term impact of the 737 MAX rate reduction as well as smaller cuts
in production for other Boeing, Airbus and business jet platforms. As a result of the recent production
rate changes and other evolving global concerns, we are implementing a necessary 3% to 10% reduction
in direct and indirect headcount, the impact of which will be felt in the second half of the year and will
certainly vary by business unit.

Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket
revenues grew by 17% over the prior year quarter with the commercial transport passenger market
outperforming our expectations. In the quarter, growth in the commercial transport passenger and
business jet markets were significantly offset by very modest declines in the commercial transport freight
and commercial transport interior markets. Overall, commercial transport fundamentals continue to
remain relatively strong, although a few items still bear watching. Global revenue passenger growth
continues to decelerate, albeit growth is still near the long-term average. This might be impacted by
weaker economic activity and multiple geopolitical disruptions worldwide. Cargo demand is weaker as
FTKs have declined from reaching an all-time high in 2017, and business jet utilization data is pointing to
stagnant growth that could create a headwind for the business jet aftermarket. Finally, it is unclear how
the 737 MAX situation has or will impact our commercial aftermarket, but it may prove to be a net positive
for TransDigm as older aircraft are utilized more.

Now let me speak about our defense market, which is just over 30% of our total revenue. The defense
market, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, was up approximately 9% over the prior year
Q1. As a reminder, we are lapping tougher prior year comparisons as our defense revenue accelerated
in most of fiscal 2019. Defense bookings declined slightly in the quarter driven by robust defense OEM
bookings growth and a not unexpected decline in defense aftermarket bookings, given the recent
restocking pace.

Now moving to profitability. I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as
defined. EBITDA as defined of about $681 million for Q1 was up 40% versus prior Q1. EBITDA as defined
margin in the quarter of 46.5% was negatively impacted by acquisition dilution from Esterline. Excluding
Esterline, margins in our legacy business were over 51% and improved both sequentially as well as over
the prior year quarter. Margin improvement progress is always important to us and indicates that our base
business continues to drive and find opportunities for improvement by using our value drivers.

On Esterline, we are now over 10 months post close. The integration continues to progress. To date, the
acquisition is exceeding our expectations for growth in this largest of TransDigm acquisitions. As we have
stated in the past, we will now no longer refer to any Esterline-specific metrics as these businesses have
now become part of the fabric of TransDigm.

Moving now to the 2020 guidance, also found on Slide 7 in the presentation. We're not changing our full
year revenue, EBITDA or adjusted EPS guidance at this time, although we saw strong first quarter results.
General market conditions have not meaningfully changed with the exception of the 737 MAX grounding
and production halt. This is an evolving situation that could make it challenging for us to achieve the high
end of our previously issued revenue guidance. However, as previously mentioned, we believe any impact
from the MAX issues should not be material to our EBITDA this fiscal year. There's also a potential upside
for us in the commercial aftermarket resulting in the 737 MAX issues as older aircraft may be utilized
more. We will continue to closely monitor the 737 MAX situation and the expected impact on our business
to be prepared to react as necessary, including any further preemptive steps that might be warranted.
After consideration of these items at this time, we're not adjusting our full year revenue and EBITDA
guidance as we still expect them to fall within the range previously issued. We will update again as this
situation crystallizes.

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

In addition, we are not changing our original market growth assumptions at this time. We do, however,
realize there could be some shifting between commercial OEM and aftermarket growth rates, but it is
just too close to call with only 1 quarter of data. I would also like to caution that although our EBITDA
margin was strong in the first quarter, margins can be lumpy and margins may fluctuate over the next few
quarters.

So let me conclude by stating that Q1 of fiscal 2020 was another good quarter for TransDigm. We continue
to be very pleased with the Esterline acquisition integration as well as the strong operational performance
in the quarter from our legacy businesses. We look forward to the remainder of 2020 and expect that our
consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you have come to expect from us.

With that, I would now like to turn it over to our CFO, Mike Lisman.

Michael J. Lisman
Chief Financial Officer

Morning, everyone. I'm going to very quickly elaborate on some of the financial results that Kevin just
discussed. As a reminder and as mentioned on our last earnings call, the Esterline organization as it used
to exist including the corporate office, is for the most part now gone with the business units, which used
to comprise Esterline, reporting independently into TransDigm. We're, therefore, not planning to give too
much specific color or details around Esterline's performance separate from that of legacy TransDigm. So
for the consolidated TransDigm business, a few quick notes on how we ended the first quarter of FY '20.
And as a reminder, Esterline closed mid-March of last year. So it's not included in any of the fiscal '19 stats
that I'm about to reference.

As Nick and Kevin both mentioned, first quarter net sales were up approximately 48% versus the prior
year. Organic sales growth was strong at 8.7%, and this figure still completely excludes Esterline. So it's
for the legacy TransDigm business only. The Esterline acquisition drove the remaining 39% of the increase.
On EBITDA as defined, $681 million for the quarter. That was up 40% versus last year and adjusted EPS
of $4.93 was up 28%. On cash and liquidity, this gets a little messy due to the timing of the dividend. We
declared the $32.50 per share dividend in December but then did not pay it until early January. So I'm
just going to give you the pro forma financial stats since that's what matters. So pro forma for that $32.50
dividend per share that was paid on January 7, our cash balance is $2.3 billion and net debt to EBITDA is
now 6.1x. We also currently have access to about $720 million of our revolver.

Now a quick update on interest and taxes. Interest expense is expected to be about $1.02 billion in
fiscal '20, and this estimate is unchanged from our prior guidance. As some of you may have seen,
we're currently in the market with a repricing of our $7.5 billion of term loans. This reprice is still in the
process of being finalized, and we'll update the interest expense guidance next quarter once the repricing
completes. On taxes, our fiscal 2020 GAAP cash and adjusted rates are all still expected to be in the range
of 24% to 26%, which is unchanged from prior guidance.

With regard to liquidity and leverage at the end of fiscal '20, assuming no additional acquisitions or
capital market transactions, we now expect to have over $3 billion of cash on hand at the end of the year.
This is a slight reduction from previously -- from previous guidance just to account for the $1.9 billion
dividend we paid in the first week of January. In closing, the first quarter was a good start to the year for
TransDigm.
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Nick, I wanted to try to ask you if you could kind of take a step back and try to provide us some context
for where the current fundamentals of the aerospace aftermarket are compared to your long history at
the company because we've got the MAX situation but then we've also got all the MRO facilities telling us
there's much longer wait than ever and we've got all these airplanes coming out of the warranty period.
You just printed the number you printed. So I'm just kind of curious is this as good as you've ever seen it?
Is it in line with your average good time? Or is it something else? Would love to hear from you on that.

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

Yes. I don't know that I have any great insight for you. There -- no, I mean, I see all those puts and takes,
too. I mean I'd have to put it on the better rather than worse side of the ledger, though the slowing RPM
always gets your attention a little bit. As you know, that can be sort of a leading indicator sometimes.
The situation in China, who knows where that goes? The -- I guess the closest model would be the SARS
situation, whatever that was, some number of years ago. And that, for a quarter or 2, had a pretty
significant impact.

I think I -- obviously, I come down the same place as Kevin. We're sort of -- we're going to change our
view from the beginning of the year. So I have to say there's probably a wider band around it than there
might have been 6 months ago.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And just looking at the margin performance in the quarter. I think the framework from you for a
little while has been 100 basis points a year in the core, not recently acquired business. Is that still the
right framework? Can you continue to do that even from a higher level?

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

Kevin, do you want to take that?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think that's still the right magnitude, and I think we can continue to do that.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Nick or Kevin, I have a question for you, and it relates to the MAX, but it's higher level. Nick, you've
always had that chart about the life cycle of a TransDigm program. It's like 50 years, these different colors
and so forth. How long does a platform need to stay in service before you're NPV-positive? When you get
past the development costs and the 0 to low-margin OE, how much of a run till you're in the black?

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Executive Chairman of the Board

I don't think I can give a number. We have so many different part numbers now and so many different
economic situations. Some are significant essentially upfront and some aren't much. I don't think I can
give you a very good number on that, Rob.

I would say if you look at a program, it's going to have a development that goes on, pick your number, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 years, depending on the situation. You're not going to make much money till you get through
the first 4-, 5-year period because either you're on warranty or even if it's not a warranty as a practical
matter, things don't break much or you don't get much in the first 4 or 5 years. So you're surely out 4 or
5 years after production before you're starting to see any significant, I'd say, positive, positive net on all
things. Beyond that, I just -- it's just too dependent on the specific part and program.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then I just had one on Esterline. What -- now that you've got it, I think, Kevin, you said it's 10
months post deal, have you found anything either more positive or more negative under the hood in that
business being a publicly traded company versus the private companies you've bought? Anything specific
there that would be interesting to us?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

As we've talked about, you get limited due diligence upfront. So we went in not sure all that we would
find. I think, in general, we've found that things have been better than we assumed upfront, and there
hasn't really been yet anything that is bad news, anything that we didn't anticipate or expect. It certainly
emboldens us for the future to continue to look at acquisitions like this.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Was there anything different about their aftermarket pricing dynamic because they were public
versus the smaller private companies that you've bought in the past?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

No. No. Not that we have seen, no.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I had 2 questions. First, I was wondering, have you noticed any continued or incremental hesitation by the
defense department in placing orders, just given the whole overhang of the IG investigation? Does that
explain anything in terms of lumpiness of bookings or anything you can point to there?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

So to answer that one, first off, we have -- initially, we saw some slowdown. We have been meeting
frequently with the DoD, DLA, IG and other important stakeholders in the process to continue to
communicate, answer questions. Once we started doing that, I think some of the pent-up demand started
to flow a little bit. So I'm not believing that a slowdown, to get to the point, I think, that you're driving
at, a slowdown in defense aftermarket bookings is anything more than a filling of the bins up around the
ranch. That's still what we believe.

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

We have seen that our interaction with the DoD, DLA has been positive. We're communicating, spending
time going through the issues, and it's positive.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the commercial air transport aftermarket in the quarter and
maybe subsequent to the quarter, anything you can comment on by region? I mean have you seen any
coronavirus impact in Asia Pac and/or between the various channels, distributor versus nondistribution and
what have you? Anything -- if you can parse that out.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

We don't look at our business like that from a geography, and it's also the way that our products are
distributed and sold. You can sell to one region, and that's where the distributor is based and it goes all
over the world. So we're -- we don't have great data on individual consumption by country or airline or
platform. So no, we don't have that kind of visibility to offer you.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And any change -- any disconnect between the distribution channel and direct in the quarter? Any
restocking going on...

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

We don't have a composite POS any longer that the flow-through sales from our distribution partners
that we can comment on after the combination of Esterline into the TransDigm businesses. Because they
tended to use different distributors, it made the metric not as useful for us so far. So I don't have any
good comment on POS in distribution by region. I know what you're driving at, and we keep looking for
that as well to see if there's a pickup in 737 MAX related to the aftermarket in specific regions, are there
any slowdown. But we don't have that kind of granularity to be able to give you that commentary.

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

I mean the only thing I'd add for is we're pretty well distributed across the fleet. So I mean if you look
at where the fleet is around the world and you look at where the miles are flown around the world,
ultimately, if those change, the weighted impact of that will reflect on our demand at some point.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Kevin or Nick, just wondered -- I mean if I've learned anything about you guys over the last decade or
plus, it's that you don't let resources sit around idle. So to the extent you've got folks in your factories that
are perhaps overstaffed, even if it's a temporary basis because of this MAX situation, do you -- would you
have any intent on attacking productivity with those resources in the meantime? And could you end up
coming out on the backside of this uncertainty with some better efficiency in your factories? How are you
thinking about using that?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Of course, we look at -- all of these are opportunities to drive productivity. Productivity is an important
part of our value-driver mindset. We announced a 3% to 10% headcount reduction in the call so far. I

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

think that is -- that's going to vary by business. We'll see the impact of that far out in the second half of
the year. It'll vary by business depending on impact and what they're seeing and what the order book
looks like. So we're looking at this as the right thing to do to drive productivity. Is it opportunistic? And will
we see better productivity out the other end? I don't know. We certainly aim to be very efficient in the way
we run our businesses, not let extra labor sit arounds, not go after pet programs or other projects. We're
already working productivity aggressively. So there's maybe nothing additional to be gained by putting
more people on productivity. But we want to manage our headcount efficiently in all of our resources the
correct way.

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

The only thing I'd add, Kevin, is I believe the 3% to 10% is not just factory. It's across the headcount.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's direct to indirect.

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

Yes.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Absolutely. And it'll probably -- yes, I don't know how it'll split out on that. And the reason why I'm giving
you a range is because we're still early in this process of implementing. I think most people have already
been notified. But given our decentralized nature and this -- of the actions happen at the plants, they
don't happen at corporate. So I'm still waiting to hear back on all of that.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

But just thinking through the history, I mean, I think without -- Nick, in the past, there was a sort of a
measurable impact on the back end, if memory serves me right. Is that correct?

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

I would hope so. We would expect that would be the case. I mean our hope is, Carter, to be out ahead of
this, not behind it.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Nick, you talked about the MAX being 3% to 4% of revenues, less on an EBIT basis. Is the 787 similar in
magnitude?

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

I think the 787 is a little bit less. But I don't -- I'm not looking at that or in front of me. But we have
modeled that, that would drop by, I believe, it's 4 units a month in early 2021. So yes, that's factored
into our thoughts. And I just said, the 3% or 4% on the 737, just to be clear, that is more like at full
production.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's full production. Great point.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Right. Right. I know you don't want to get too much into separating out Esterline anymore, but you
gave some -- you gave enough detail for us to back into kind of where their EBITDA margins are and
approximately where their EBIT margins are. Can you just talk -- I mean, obviously, a bit away from
the corporate average, but can you just talk about maybe broad-based views of where the margins on
underlying Esterline could go based on now having the company for approaching a year?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's -- obviously, we don't know. But in the fullness of time, it should continue to move in the
direction that TransDigm is at. Whether it gets all the way there or not remains to be seen. But in the
fullness of time, we don't see that this is a business that hampered in any way fundamentally.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And Mike, on free cash flow, it looks like backing into everything, you're looking at $1.2 billion to
$1.3 billion this year, roughly.

Michael J. Lisman
Chief Financial Officer

That's right. That's right. It was stronger this quarter than it'll be next quarter just because of the timing
of interest and tax payments. We have fewer payments this quarter, and next quarter, our fiscal Q2 double
payments on interest and taxes. So it's a little bit less. But that's right for the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Kevin, I think you mentioned that the biz jet aftermarket was strong in the quarter, but underlying FAA
activity is still flat. I was wondering if maybe you could perhaps explain that disconnect there, perhaps
why the number was so strong this quarter.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I wish I had some better -- it's surprising to us as well. Given the takeoffs and landings, after a few
years of strength, still not back to the pre-2008 levels, but we just haven't seen anything. And recently,
it's gone negative. So our -- what we're seeing here is a little bit of a surprise, I'll have to say, and I don't
know how long it will last. Certainly, the fundamentals of the industry don't appear to be good, but we're
still seeing solid demand. So we will continue to ship it, but I wish I had a better explanation for you on
why or where it's coming from. What we see across this business, given the aftermarket nature, whether
it's defense, it's commercial, it's biz jet, is that aftermarket orders can be lumpy, and that's part of what
we're seeing, I think.

Yes. And then on the whole MAX issue, have you actually taken -- I know you're making lots of different
products. I mean have you taken your rate down to 0? Or are you still running some of your products at
some sort of rate, so you can keep your supply chain to year long?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I -- we have had some communication with Boeing on what this will look like. We have taken our
rates down to 0, more or less where we are right now. And it'll gradually build out based on what Boeing is
communicating to us, which -- again, this is early days in the communication process. So we're following
their guidance on this. I'm not hedging it further.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from UBS.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Kevin, maybe you can clarify little bit on the cost action you're taking. Is the cost action effect to 2020 net
neutral positive or negative to EBITDA?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

I think it's too early to tell right now. We are still figuring out the downside of some of the headwinds
we're talking about and balancing this out. I think I need a little more time to comment on that, on
whether it's neutral or will add anything to the EBITDA for the year. So I just need a little more time on
that. It's too early in the year to change that.

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

But there's no reason to think the adjustments could be negative.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

I don't think -- that's right. I'm just not -- I don't want to give you an idea that it's going to be one way or
the other.

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

Yes.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Sorry. I mean is there a cost to achieve it'll be front-loaded to the second quarter or third quarter, that we
should kind of be mindful for and you catch up on the benefit in the back half of the year? That's all.

But yes, they'll -- but still, they would hit us earlier.

Walter Nicholas Howley

They'd hit us earlier next quarter.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then, Nick, a little bit off topic, but I think still relevant. Your role at Everarc. I'm just curious,
as you look at -- you're dividing your time between here. And as that business matures, can you just talk
about how you think your roles may stay the same or change over time?

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

Yes. My primary activity is here, of course. As you probably know, I'm Chairman there, not an active
manager, and an investor.

Myles Alexander Walton

Okay. So no anticipation of any role changes at all?

No.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord.

Kenneth George Herbert
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Kevin, I just -- sorry, but I just wanted to follow-up one more time on the commercial aftermarket and the
up 17% in the quarter. I mean it sounds like there wasn't anything unusual. But I just wanted to confirm
you didn't see anything in terms of maybe airline budget dumping around end of the calendar year or any
of the recent distribution agreements or anything else you've signed that could have been sort of onetime
beyond just fundamental growth in the quarter.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

No. We look for it. It was a surprise that it was as solid and strong as it was. I will say that that's -- the
17% in the quarter isn't just an artifact of the acquisition. TransDigm legacy, although I said I wouldn't
refer to this, I wanted to give you some reassurance that the TransDigm legacy business would have
still been a highlight -- a headline number that everyone would've reacted to. So we're seeing strength
across-the-board. It's not due to a program. It's not due to a single business unit, and it really wasn't any
onetimers that we saw in there.

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

That's helpful. And if I could, just bigger picture, I mean you're -- as you talked about, you're almost
a year into closing Esterline. As you think about your acquisition pipeline and as you think about
opportunities moving forward, can you just talk a little bit about maybe what you'll do differently moving
forward on acquisitions or some of the lessons learned that you can apply which would make what already
was from the outside a very good process, potentially even better?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

I'll start on it, and I'll let Mike and Nick jump in. I don't know if there's so much that we learned, except
that maybe we're a little conservative in some of our modeling. So that's good. It's good for all of us.
Good for you.

I think we've learned that we can go after a significant business, multifaceted, many moving pieces. And
with our model and the way we handle the integration, that we can tackle them and so do a nice job of
bringing them into the fold, into the fabric of TransDigm. I mean that's what I think I've learned and from
what I've seen on the operational side.

And also, the folks in the acquired company are very interested in being on a winning team. And it's
amazing, the attitude, the morale, the real positive perspective that the employees have as they're now
part of this team is really incredible, and it's why I think we're accomplishing some pretty heavy lifting so
quickly. Guys, anything?

Michael J. Lisman
Chief Financial Officer

I think that's right. One thing I'd add, too, is just on the aftermarket point. We looked at Esterline from
the outside in for years before the acquisition finally happened and looked at the aftermarket and couldn't
make sense of the low 10% to 12% rate that was published. And I think from an M&A due diligence
standpoint, one thing going forward is we might put less faith on what a company tells us just because
they might not be tracking it the way TransDigm would.

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

Yes. I guess I'd say a couple of things. I think our organizational method of keeping it separate for the first
12 months or so, I think, was a plus in that there's -- you buy something with that many operating units
and there's a lot of heavy lifting to be done in the first year. So keeping that so it didn't confuse and leak
over into our base business, I think, was a good call for us. And I think it's a model we'd probably think to
repeat again if we bought something like that.

I think we also had a combination of what I'll call good luck and good management. By the good
management, I'd say, we're in a space we know pretty well so we can make judgments even when some
of the numbers don't make sense. And I think our operating methodology is -- works well and proven over
and over. I'd say, in the good luck category, I'd say we were conservative in the forecast because we --
you don't get as much information as you usually get. And when you buy something and -- the good luck
category is there didn't turn out to be a big bomb in there somewhere. So that's the comments I have.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust.

Michael Frank Ciarmoli
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Nick or Kevin, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Esterline growth was tracking
ahead of expectations. Can you just maybe give a little bit more color there? Knowing that you're not
going to parse it out, but was it just more general end market strength that you're seeing across all of
your product line? Was it a little bit of pricing, better execution? I mean is there, are you seeing that

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

aftermarket capture that maybe Esterline didn't execute on in the past? Maybe just -- if you can give some
color there.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll take a stab at it, and then Mike has some more maybe insight. I think productivity and the value-
based pricing, I think we've seen great opportunities in both on -- specifically, on the commercial side. I --
it's encouraging what we've seen.

I -- beyond that, we have seen certainly productivity improvements. We've seen opportunities to inject
cash to get delinquencies down. There were some significant delinquencies in parts of the business. There
was some capitalization issues that needs to be addressed.

I think we've approached this on an operational front to drive the Esterline business much like we focus
the TransDigm legacy business on being the best operations performer as they can be, having the best
quality, the best on-time delivery, being an organization that you can really count on. That's really been
our focus here.

And we've seen opportunities, we've said in the past, equally split on productivity and price and winning
new business. I think that still holds. Mike, do you have any?

Michael J. Lisman
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think that's right. In addition to some of the productivity and opps points Kevin made, the Esterline
business has seen good growth. So for the TransDigm legacy business, we referenced the 8.7% organic
growth that the Esterline business is growing in that same sort of ballpark. So pretty strong revenue
growth, and it's from a mix of both price and volume.

Michael Frank Ciarmoli
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe, Mike, just one last one. The full year interest expense, I think,
$1.02 billion. Any color as to how the debt repricing might impact that expense as you sit here today and
go through the process?

Michael J. Lisman
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We're crossing Is and -- or crossing Ts and dotting Is to finish it this week. It should wrap up this
Thursday, and we'll issue an 8-K. But we expect the rate to tick down slightly on the term loans. Now we
also got that package of amendments.

Our next question comes from the line of Greg Konrad from Jefferies.

Gregory Arnold Konrad
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just to go back to the MAX really quickly, just a clarification question. You said it was 3% to 4% of sales,
and you had some headcount reductions later on this year. I mean how much of that MAX capacity is
fungible and can be reallocated to aftermarket or OE programs versus just idle capacity today?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would say not much of it. Aftermarket is built on the same lines as the OEM products for the largest
extent. So the volume occurs on the OEM side, you can't make it up in aftermarket. You can't move people
around necessarily. They're trained on certain pieces of equipment or processes. So I would say it's not

16

TRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

that fungible that you can so easily move people around. We certainly try to do that first. And where there
are needs, we try to certainly move people. It's -- you have to take a RIF or reduction when you don't see
those opportunities out there.

Gregory Arnold Konrad
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then I know it's small, but you mentioned a modest decline in the interior aftermarket. I think last
quarter, you talked about some international wins kind of converting to sales as we move forward. What
are you seeing in that particular end market?

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The -- for the quarter, for Q1, it was a little soft. So I think I commented that we saw some negative
growth there. And then the freight side, it made sense. We've seen slowing FTKs for a while.

On the interiors, I noted previously we were starting to see some orders, some interest here that would
turn things around. And that's, I think, the case when I look at the bookings for the future. And our
interior side of the business, they're starting to grow again. So that may be an indication that future
quarters will be better on the interior side of the aftermarket.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.

Michael James Maugeri
Wolfe Research, LLC

This is actually Mike on for -- Mike Maugeri on for Hunter. So you mentioned some cuts to some biz jet
programs. Are those production cuts due to end market weakness, product transitions? Or is it large cabin,
multiple market segments? Any color would help.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

I don't think I said that we were seeing any cuts in biz jet. I think what we're seeing on the OEM side is
new programs. We're on all of the important new programs here on the business jet side, and we're seeing
bookings come in. We're seeing shipments on that. On the aftermarket side, I think, pleasantly surprised
that the aftermarket and the biz jet sector is holding up so well, given the takeoff and landing cycles have
been anemic. That's what we said.

It's -- yes, business jet is a tougher market to understand. It's a small part of our business now as we've
grown other sectors faster. But it has been difficult to predict over the last -- I think even couple of years.

Michael James Maugeri
Wolfe Research, LLC

That helps. And then one for Mike. How are you thinking about taxes? And I'm thinking like over the next
3 to 5 years. So how are you thinking about changes to tax code beyond 2021? Or are there any things
that we need to be thinking about there?

Michael J. Lisman
Chief Financial Officer

I don't think so. The long-term guidance on -- across all 3 rates is still 24% to 26%. And if you are looking
for something to plug into a model, I'd encourage you to just stick in that range at this point.

Seth Michael Seifman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just with regard to the margin guide, the seasonal pattern is to see improvement off of Q1, and Q1 was
relatively strong versus the guidance. I appreciate the idea of having some caution in the guidance,
given all the unknowns out there for this year. But given that the severance is not supposed to be that
material, is there anything else that we should be aware of that would keep that kind of sequential margin
improvement from happening other than just trying to be very cautious amid MAX, coronavirus, whatever
else is happening in the world?

Michael J. Lisman
Chief Financial Officer

I think that the guidance just reflects our best judgment, and we're hopefully being a little bit cautious and
conservative, to your margin point.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

I completely agree with that. It's caution in there. There's a -- a lot of information isn't known, and we
don't want to send the wrong signals and have to change them or modify them. We'd rather be cautious
on this.

Liza Sabol
Director of Investor Relations

Yes. But also to remind you, though, that the aftermarket grew ahead of what we expected for Q1. And so
that there very well could be sequential decline in the margin from Q1 to Q2.

Kevin M. Stein
President, CEO & Director

It's a good point.

Seth Michael Seifman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then as a quick follow-up, Nick. Just when you think about the impact that the MAX
situation might have on M&A opportunities over time, do you have any initial thoughts on that, maybe
suppliers who might be more apt to be looking to sell now?

Walter Nicholas Howley
Executive Chairman of the Board

No, not that I know of. It would surprise me if it had much impact. As you know, we buy proprietary
aerospace stuff with a decent aftermarket. In other words, we buy good businesses. People usually don't
sell good businesses in times of temporary down cycle. Now if you told me this was going to drop down
like a rock and go on for a long period of time, I'd say that might stress some people. But given the
situation that exists today, I'd be surprised if it changes anyone's view of the -- either the whole period or
what they want to buy or sell for good businesses. Now I would say for nonproprietary businesses that are
very heavily weighted towards OEM or particularly the 737, it could stress the hell out of them. But that's
not the kind of stuff that we typically buy.
