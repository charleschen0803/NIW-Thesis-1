Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and thank you for joining Lincoln Financial Group's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

Now I'd like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Al Copersino. Please

Al Copersino

cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday as well as those detailed in our
2020 annual report on Form 10-K, most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and from time to time
in our other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are made only as of today, and we

We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com,
where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include full reconciliations of the

Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag,
Chief Financial Officer and Head of Individual Life. After their prepared comments, we will move to the
question-and-answer portion of the call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.

Dennis Robert Glass
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Al. Good morning, everyone. Lincoln had an excellent second quarter with record adjusted
operating earnings per share and operating revenues and earnings growth in all 4 businesses. The impact
of pandemic-related claims on earnings continues to decline and was more than offset by another quarter
of strong returns from our alternative investment portfolio. Driving these results is the execution of our
reprice, shift and add new product strategy, expense management and improving customer experience
from digital and virtual enhancements and a strong balance sheet, providing room for increased share
repurchases.

Touching on each of these. First, our product introductions are adding new consumer value propositions,
which open new market segments to us, further broadens our sales opportunities of an already strong
base of products and increases our long-term sales growth potential. Our expanding shelf space and
ongoing improvements in distribution productivity are effectively getting these new products into the
hands of consumers, and we are achieving attractive new business returns on capital deployed.

Second, we have a successful track record of increasing the expense efficiency of our product
manufacturing, back-office operations and distribution functions, while enhancing the customer and
partner experience. This quarter, we reported lower expense ratios company-wide and in most of our
businesses. As we've talked about recently, we are about to start on another program that will further

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

improve efficiency and the customer experience and enable us to achieve meaningful savings. We'll be
excited to provide you with more details next quarter.

Third, our high-quality investment portfolio, higher statutory capital and RBC ratios along with cash at the
holding company and contingent capital, all provide capital deployment flexibility.

Now turning to the business segments. Starting with Annuities. We have long been a leader in Annuities
with a diversified portfolio that provides a broad range of customer value propositions. Total annuity sales
this quarter were again strong as we grew 14% sequentially with growth across all product categories for
the second quarter in a row and a good mix of product sales.

Last year, we established ourselves as a leader in indexed variable annuities. This year, we are seeing
growth in both index variable annuities and traditional VAs without living benefits. We also see ongoing
market demand for VAs with guaranteed living benefits at attractive economics to Lincoln as protected
income solutions continue to resonate with customers.

We had projected total annuity sales to begin the year at a similar pace to what we saw in the fourth
quarter then build over the course of the year, benefiting from shelf space we added last year and are
adding this year, which is driving indexed variable annuity growth opportunities. We are pleased to see
sales year-to-date ahead of our expectations.

Looking forward, near-term sales may be impacted by typical summer seasonality, but we are confident
that full year sales will remain ahead of our earlier expectations.

Turning to flows. VA net flows were positive, and while we reported negative net fixed annuity flows, this
is a direct result of past management actions taken to maintain rigorous return standards and allow us to
direct capital to its highest and best use. We expect Annuities' earnings to continue to benefit from new
sales, growing fees on AUM from the strong stock market and our diversified high-quality in-force book.

In Retirement Plan Services, we once again reported excellent results and remain well positioned with
scale in our target markets of small and mid case 401(k), health care, government and not-for-profit A
broad suite of products, a competitive cost structure and award-winning digital technology.

Total deposits were up 21% and included double-digit growth in both first-year sales and recurring
deposits. Sales continue to benefit from the success of YourPath, our target date fund alternative. We have
continued to innovate, introducing past builder income, which includes an income solution as part of a
target date like investment option. This type of innovation will serve as a catalyst for future growth.

Finally, we once again reported positive net flows. And while flows can be lumpy, we expect this positive
momentum to persist. It was another outstanding quarter for the Retirement business. We continue to
excel in our target market segments as we benefit from our attractive competitive position, continued
investments in the planned sponsor and planned participant experience and our expanding set of solutions
aimed at helping people secure their retirement.

Within the Life Insurance business, we continue to execute our product strategy that increases consumer
value propositions while further diversifying our product risk profile. Our investment in new products
further broadens our portfolio and supports shelf space expansion with new distribution partners, including
in the P&C space.

Complementing this expansion has been our continued focus on simplifying the client and adviser
experience. Nearly all of our business is e-submitted and e-delivered, and our recently expanded online
interview capabilities are resulting in higher placement rates at a lower cost per policy. This makes it
easier for customers to do business with us and generates cost savings.

Our strategies have taken hold and are driving double-digit sequential sales growth. By product category,
Individual Life sales were up sequentially with growth seen in term life as well as across our expanded
Indexed UL, Variable UL and MoneyGuard solutions.

In addition, our executive benefit sales remained strong through the first half of the year, and we expect
momentum to continue into the second half. I'm confident that actions we have taken will result in

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

sequential sales growth, accelerating in the second half of the year as our new product offerings continue
to garner additional shelf space supported by our industry-leading distribution.

Lastly, on Group Protection, where we have been driving toward our target margin range 5% to 7%.
Our selective price increases as well as our successful efforts to raise persistency led to a 2% increase
in premiums over the prior year period. Although sales in what is a seasonally smaller quarter were
down versus the strong prior year quarter, we continue to have success expanding into higher-margin
employee paid products, which represented 56% of second quarter sales. Included within our employee
paid products is supplemental health insurance, where we will be adding a hospital indemnity solution,
another example of Lincoln expanding our already broad portfolio of high-quality offerings.

As we have communicated, we continue to take action to increase Group Protection's underlying operating
margins, excluding pandemic-related claims and excess alternative investment income, we are in the
middle of our target range and expect further expansion over time as we drive premium growth, continue
to invest in our claims organization and diligently manage expenses.

A few words on one of our key competitive advantages are industry-leading distribution. As the industry
evolves, the strength of our distribution franchise remains a constant. We are known in the marketplace
for a consistent distribution presence with broad reach across channels as demonstrated by our recent Life
Insurance shelf expansion with a large P&C insurer.

Nearly 100,000 active producers, wholesalers, group representative consultants and other distribution
professionals sell our products. And through strategic investments in technology and training, we have
positioned ourselves to influence where and how we engage with our active producers, leading with a
virtual first model for the long term.

We already see this as the distribution teams begin meeting with their clients in-person again while still
leveraging virtual tools, both to improve the service we deliver and tightly manage our expenses.

Our distribution team's productivity metrics are up, and our efforts are being recognized as we received 2
industry awards this quarter for innovation in virtual training and digital marketing.

Briefly on investment results, credit quality remains excellent. Our general account portfolio is
predominantly comprised of fixed income investments, of which approximately 97% are investment
grade. And within that, 59% are rated A, A equivalent or better. Examples of the underlying asset classes
includes corporates, commercial mortgage loans and structured securities. The commercial mortgage loan
portfolio is high quality, well diversified and continues to perform well, with nearly 100% of loans in the 2
highest CML rating categories. And within that, 85% in the highest rating category and virtually no credit
losses or loan modifications.

Additionally, the structured securities are predominantly rated AA and higher with nearly no exposure to
below investment-grade securities.

During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 2.7% with approximately 50% in
shorter duration assets, reflecting our shorter duration product sales. 60% of our purchases were in
investments other than public corporates, providing diversification and good relative value and adding
approximately 100 basis points of yield over comparably rated public corporates.

Lastly, our alternatives performance was once again strong, driven by portfolio construction that has
emphasized buyout and growth equity strategies with a 10% return in the quarter, significantly exceeding
our long-term targeted quarterly return of 2.5%.

In summary, our product strategy is helping sales momentum build at attractive returns, driven by new
product introductions, expanding shelf space and overall distribution strength. Group Protection margins
are recovering. Expense savings initiatives will continue to contribute to earnings growth, and our strong
balance sheet and free cash flow generation and potential block sale transactions, all put Lincoln in an
excellent position to fund sales growth while increasing our capital deployment. In short, we are very
confident in our ability to continue to generate good earnings growth for shareholders.

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Before I turn the call over to Randy, a brief comment on how interest rate levels affect our business
model. As we've mentioned before, low rates affect us in 3 principal ways. First is product pricing and
design and their impact on consumer demand; second, is spread compression; third, is the impact of cash
flow testing on reserve requirements.

Looking forward, first, as I've described this morning, our reprice shift and add new product strategy will
provide us with sales growth opportunities in a variety of interest rate scenarios.

Second, our focus on expenses, including the meaningful cost saving program, I mentioned earlier, is
expected to replace all earnings lost to spread compression over the next few years. Third and finally, we
have no significant cash flow testing reserve implications.

In sum, low rates have already been with us for some time. And going forward, we expect to continue to
meet or surpass our 8% to 10% long-term EPS growth target.

I will now turn the call over to Randy.

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $608 million
or $3.17 per share, both record highs for Lincoln. There were no notable items in the current or prior
year quarter. Additionally, this quarter's result was impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced
earnings by $43 million or $0.22 per share. While results benefited from strong performance in the
alternatives investment portfolio, boosting earnings by $113 million or $0.59 per share above target. It
was an extremely strong quarter that highlights our underlying earnings power.

Net income totaled $642 million or $3.34 per share, boosted by gains in the investment portfolio and
excellent performance from the variable annuity hedge program. This quarter's record bottom line result
was driven by strong top line performance with adjusted operating revenue up 16% from the prior year,
which included growth in each of the 4 businesses and a solid expense management as our expense ratio
came down 130 basis points.

Consistent with the record earnings, key financial metrics were excellent as adjusted operating return on
equity came in at 17.3% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% and stands at $75.45, an
all-time high.

Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Operating income for the quarter was $323
million compared to $237 million in the prior year quarter. The quarter's earnings were driven by record
average account values of $166 billion, up 24% over the past year and $12 million of favorable alternative
investment income. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, decreased 7 basis points
sequentially. Looking forward, we'd expect spreads to be in this range, trending up modestly over time.

Expense ratio improved 110 basis points compared to the prior year period as our focus on expenses
continues to benefit the bottom line. Return metrics remained solid with return on assets coming in at 78
basis points and return on equity at 25%. Risk metrics on the VA book once again demonstrate the quality
of our in-force with a net amount of risk at 47 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 33
basis points for death benefits.

Growing account values, a high-quality and high-return book of business and ongoing expense discipline
are all indicators of strong future performance from the Annuities business.

Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $62 million compared to $30 million in the prior
year quarter. This quarter's results were driven by higher fees on account values and included $7 million of
favorable alternative investment results.

Total deposits of $2.8 billion helped to drive $0.5 billion of net flows in the quarter. Over the trailing 12
months, net flows of $1.6 billion combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values
up 28% to $94 billion. The expense ratio improved 240 basis points over the prior year quarter as strong
revenue growth combined with diligent expense management led to an increase in profitability.

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, comprised 8 basis points versus the prior year
quarter, better than our stated 10 to 15 basis point range as crediting rate actions continue to take hold.
Strong net flow performance and great expense management position our retirement business nicely
moving forward.

Turning to Life Insurance. We reported operating income of $255 million versus a loss of $37 million in
the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings included $83 million of favorable alternative investment
experience and a return to pre-pandemic levels of mortality as pandemic-related claims of $15 million
were largely offset by favorable underlying mortality.

Earnings drivers continue to grow with average account values up 12% and average Life Insurance
in-force up 7% over the prior year. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, declined 7
basis points compared to the prior year quarter, in line with our 5 to 10 basis point expectation. The
expense ratio improved 90 basis points over the prior year quarter as our efficiency efforts continue to
benefit margins. The combination of accelerating sales, expense discipline and the declining impact from
pandemic mortality positions us well for a strong second half of the year.

Group Protection reported operating income of $46 million compared to $39 million in the prior year
quarter. This quarter's earnings included $8 million of favorable alternative investment results. Compared
to the first quarter, operating income rose from a loss of $26 million, driven primarily by improved
pandemic-related claims of $28 million, down from $90 million sequentially.

As Dennis noted, excluding pandemic claims and favorable alternative investment income, the group
margin of 6.1% was in the middle of a 5% to 7% target range, an improvement from the first quarter.
The loss ratio was 79.3% in the quarter, a 750-basis point sequential improvement. Excluding pandemic-
related claims from both periods, loss ratio improved 50 basis points to 76.1% due to better mortality
results.

Group's expense ratio rose 30 basis points year-over-year as we make ongoing investments in our claims
organization to address elevated claim volume due to the pandemic. We expect the expense ratio to
improve when the pandemic subsides, and we execute our ongoing expense savings initiatives. Growing
operating revenues, coupled with improving underlying margin performance, have flipped the Group
business on much firmer footing looking forward.

Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of statutory surplus
and estimate our RBC ratio at 483%. As a reminder, our RBC ratio includes 26 percentage points from
noneconomic goodwill associated with the Liberty acquisition that we expect will go away by year-end.

We estimate C1 factor changes being implemented by the NAIC will negatively impact our year-end RBC
ratio by approximately 15 percentage points. We are supportive of these factor changes and would note
that they have no impact on our view of credit nor do we expect them to change our capital deployment
strategy.

Cash at the holding company stands at $762 million, above our $450 million target, as we have prefunded
our $300 million 2022 debt maturity. We deployed $150 million towards buybacks in the second quarter,
in line with our goal communicated last quarter to return to pre-pandemic quarterly buyback levels.
Supported by the strength of our balance sheet, we intend to repurchase up to $200 million of stock in the
third quarter. This will position us to have full year buybacks in line with pre-pandemic levels.

To conclude, we delivered excellent results with record earnings, book value, excluding AOCI and adjusted
operating ROE. For all the reasons we discussed today, we feel great about continuing our excellent
performance looking forward.

With that, let me turn the call back over to Al.

Al Copersino
VP & Head of Investor Relations
Thank you, Dennis and Randy. [Operator Instructions] With that, let me turn the call over to Catherine to
begin Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.

Tracy Dolin-Benguigui
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just quickly looking at interest rates, I mean, it's not at the spot where most folks were thinking about
probably as you began to start speaking about entering into some type of block sale. And I'm just
wondering, as you're still exploring that avenue, where we are with interest rates? Does that deter the
progress at all in getting the deal done?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

Tracy, thanks for the question. Yes. I think interest rates are obviously down a little bit over the last
quarter or 2, but I don't see interest rates as being a material driver of any change in value that we may
have seen over that time. I'd remind you that on the other side of that, equity markets are up nicely. So
there are other factors at play.

And I also remind you, Tracy, we do have a very diverse book of Life Insurance. So the type of business
we can put into the marketplace can be influenced by a number of different factors. So we still feel very
good about the whole block sale process, I think as I've said before. I think there's a lot of demand,
especially on the Life Insurance side. And so we continue to work very fully on potentially getting
something done and we believe would be additive to shareholder value. No promises there, but I think the
environment still seems to be very attractive, especially in the Life block sales side.

Tracy Dolin-Benguigui
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So is it fair we should still hang on tight to hear more or anything you could give some hints on where you
are in that process?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

I think the reality of these situations, Tracy, that until you announce something, it seems like you're doing
nothing, right? And so that's what I can tell you. I could tell you we're working hard. We think there's a
lot of demand out there, and we have a lot of quality business here at Lincoln that we can put into that
demand. So yes, you're going to have to hold tight, but I think that -- as I said, I think the environment is
still attractive for those sorts of transactions.

Tracy Dolin-Benguigui
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And I recognize that you've introduced a bunch of new products, and I'm wondering, and you made
some traction on sales. But when you think you'll reach an inflection point to return to production levels
pre-pandemic?

Dennis Robert Glass
President, CEO & Director

Tracy, it's Dennis. As we have been saying for some quarters now and you've just pointed out, we've got
some broad suite of products. We've got great distribution, and we expect to continue to see progress on
sales growth. And it's difficult to predict in a business [ life ] what exactly that's going to be. But all the
trends are positive, and we're comfortable with our comments about continuing to escalate sales in the
intermediate and long term.

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Tracy Dolin-Benguigui
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. Just -- sorry, lastly on that, something that caught my attention. You mentioned that the market
demand for your VAs with GLBs are at attractive economics for Lincoln. Could we expect that these
protective income solutions, could that ever extend to your variable indexed annuities? I mean, at least we
saw Prudential introduce this type of rider for their structured annuity product.

Dennis Robert Glass
President, CEO & Director

That's a possibility, and we'll continue to look at what is the consumer really interested in, in a particular
product. For the most part, the IVAs are as protection, consumer value proposition. And that's where our
focus is right now, continuing to make improvements in the overall IVA offering and to the extent that
consumers demand some type of a guaranteed income. We'll look at that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Maybe building on that last question. Can you talk about competitive dynamics in the buffered annuity
market? And as companies innovate more on features and crediting rate mechanisms, is this shifting the
risk profile of the product at all?

Dennis Robert Glass
President, CEO & Director

There's certainly more people entering the market because there's so much, Erik, consumer demand for
it. The competition on ourselves, we continue to change some of the rider -- not the riders, but some of
the characteristics of the product. It is not, to answer your question, changing the risk profile to Lincoln
these product changes. And again, I'd say that on the IVA product designs, that is sort of at the margin,
not fundamental. So it's a good product for the consumer market, and it's a solid product from a risk
perspective from a Lincoln standpoint.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Got it. And then how are you thinking about the use of flow reinsurance as a way to help fund growth,
particularly in more asset-intensive lines like fixed annuities? And is this a way to accommodate your
distribution without tying up capital?

Dennis Robert Glass
President, CEO & Director

In the -- in our history, as you know, Erik, we've done flow deals from time to time. And we continue to
look at that as a way to improve the overall sales stream, capital efficiency and so forth. So we'll look at it.
And if it makes sense, we'll do it.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Got it. And I think, historically, you've done it with fixed annuities, I mean is there an opportunity to
potentially to expand that to other products?

Dennis Robert Glass
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

We've done it with fixed annuities, and we've had reinsurance transactions on guaranteed lifetime income
products as well. And so I think -- but fixed annuities and VAs are where you can see the opportunity for
those kind of opportunities or transactions.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

First question, Randy, the decision to ramp up buybacks to, I think you said $200 million in Q3. Can you
expand on how we should view this? Is this part ongoing cash flows part excess capital drawdown or is
this more based on visibility for dividends and cash flow? Maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing
between LNL and LNBar in terms of dividend flows there?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

Tom, thanks for the question. I think when you think about the strength of the earnings that we talked
about, that flows through the statutory also. And so we've seen a significant growth in our overall capital.
I think our capital has grown roughly $1 billion year-to-date, and the RBC ratio itself has grown by roughly
30 points since the beginning of the year. And I think the main driver of that is the underlying strength of
the earnings that we just talked about.

I think you do also see a little bit of benefit. Just we do benefit when the markets move, move especially
in our favor. So I think there's a lot of positive things under there, and those positive elements really what
led us to announce getting back to really full year pre-pandemic levels by the end of the third quarter,
which means we'll do a couple of hundred million here in the third quarter. And I think that's really an
indication of, for us, how we feel about the strength of our balance sheet, how we feel about the strength
of our capital generation capabilities looking forward that were back to those levels.

I think in terms of what we think for the fourth quarter, for next year, I think we'll cross those bridges
when we get there. But at this moment in time, we're in an extremely strong position, which will allow us
to go out and buy it a little bit of an elevated rate in the third quarter.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got you. And Randy, any clarity for how dividend flows you're looking at for both Lincoln National as well
as LNBar at this point? I know for some time, you didn't -- you stopped taking dividends out of LNBar. Are
you back to taking some cash out of there?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

We took some out in the first quarter. We're always looking at the different entities and where they are
at any moment in time. As I just talked about, the Life companies happen to be in an extremely strong
capital position. So that's where we took most of our dividends from in the second quarter. It's just sort of
quarter-by-quarter. What do we intend to do? And we look at the various resources, which includes LNBar,
includes the Life companies, both of which are in a very strong capital position right now. So we didn't
happen to take any in the second quarter, but that was more about the strength that we saw in the Life
company capital than anything else. So I see both of them as a resource looking forward.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got you. And then one just final one for me. The very favorable underwriting experience in Individual Life
ex-COVID, you've now had that for 2 quarters in a row. Any sort of sense for what you think is driving

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

that? Is it possible we did see a pull forward of mortality over the last year and so maybe we'll see some
continuation of the favorability? Any color on what you expect and what you're seeing there?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

It's hard to know for sure with just 1 or 2 quarters of data. But as we analyze, as we look inside, where
did the pandemic claims that we had this quarter occur once again, it was the older -- in the older ages.
But when you look in total at the older ages, they were sort of -- that's where a lot of the benefit was. So
I think when we look at that, there's probably an element of pull forward or benefiting from people who
unfortunately passed last year.

So I think it's a combination this quarter of some pullback, some pull forward and some just underlying
good experience, which was driven primarily by severity. So severity was pretty favorable this quarter. So
I think it's both elements. But to be fair, just a couple of quarters of data from a mortality standpoint is
not enough to know any answer with 100% certainty.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question, within the group, if I adjust to the table VII in COVID, you guys had a 6% margin in
the quarter, kind of the midpoint of your target range. So I was just hoping to get some more granularity
on kind of the core trends within the quarter and anything you're kind of calling out that is favorable or
unfavorable? And then I know you guys had pointed to getting to the top end of that range over the longer
term, I believe, is that still the target for the group business?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

Elyse, thank you for the question. So we made $46 million in the quarter, the 2 items we spiked out were
the pandemic of $28 million. And then going the other way, it was favorable ultimately about [ 8 ] So if
you make those 2 adjustments, you're at $66 million. And that's what drives the 6.1% underlying margin.

I didn't spike anything out in my script because I find the quarter relatively unremarkable. In that every --
all of the key drivers were sort of inside of sort of a normal confidence interval. So looking at disability, 3
big drivers, incidence, severity and resolutions. Incidence was right in line with our expectations. Severity
went a little bit high, but resolutions were a little better than we expect. So I think the overall quarter
itself, that $66 million underlying earnings par number is just very solid. And I really think really reflects
really good performance.

In terms of what takes it from 6.1% to the upper end of the range, I think it's -- that's only one point.
I think it's probably -- the reality is that the combination of continued expense improvements. Dennis
referenced another expense savings initiative and a little bit from underlying improvement in loss ratio.
So we feel great about the quarter, and I think we feel great about our ability to continue -- see continued
improvement going forward over time.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then going back to potential for a risk transfer transaction, you guys have kind of teed up within Life
Insurance area where you're focused on for the time being. You've also spoken about maybe doing a VA
deal in the past. So is it safe to assume that recognizing these deals take a lot of time and effort that the
focus will be on the Life Insurance side? And then once we perhaps get a deal there, then potentially we
shift to the VA side or you're looking into transactions simultaneously within the full book to business?

LINCOLN NATIONAL CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

I think what we said in that regard Elyse, and it continues to be a view. We just believe there's more
demand on the Life side, and that just makes something on that side more likely and otherwise. I think
this is -- at the end of the day, ruled by supply/demand. And just happen to believe there's more demand
on the Life side, so something is more likely there. And that hasn't changed.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then one last one. Sorry, if I missed it. The corporate costs were a little bit higher in the
quarter? I know sometimes they vary. Was there anything impacting that number?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

Two things I would point out, Elyse. One, there's a little bit of seasonality with some of our brand spend
that spikes a little bit in the second quarter. That's a little bit of it. But the other thing, Dennis referenced
the next expense saving initiative. And we did -- consistent with some of the analysis we've been doing,
we did book about $9 million after tax of expenses associated with some of that prework on that program
into other operations.

Operator

Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee with Dowling.

Humphrey Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

Randy, just if we were to take a step back and just look at the underlying results for the second quarter to
adjusting for the COVID claims and the favorable VII, Life, the [ $280 million ] seems very strong for your
earnings power. Obviously, there are gives and takes in any given quarter, and you highlighted some of
that in your earlier remarks. But from your perspective, any reason why it won't grow from this level going
forward?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

Humphrey, thanks for the question. Yes, you did the math on the second quarter. So reported [ $317
million]. And when you adjust for those 2 items, which were both in my script, you'd end up at [$280
million]. Humphrey, I'd point out that if you went back to the first quarter and you adjusted for the exact
same things that I mentioned in my script, you got to [ $266 million]. So [ $266 million] last quarter,
[ $280 million] this quarter.

And what do we know happen in the second quarter, I think one of the big things is that the average
equity markets were up a little over 8%. Humphrey, we've talked a number of times about the impact
of movements in the equity markets on earnings. So if you do the math there, the rules of thumb we've
given you over the years, you would get about $0.10. And then we also know that we bought back a little
over 1% of our shares.

So [ $266 million ], while a lot would end up right up at the [ $280 million] of underlying earnings power
we had this quarter. So for me, this quarter is right in line with our expectations, and we expect to
continue to grow of that level, right? I mean you can -- in any given quarter, you can always have things
bounce around inside of these businesses. I've mentioned a few this quarter, so good underlying mortality
at Life. But on the other side, you had some expenses we've booked across the organization among a
number of other things. I just think in total, all those pluses and minuses sort of added up to pretty close
to 0. So I think the [ $280 million ] number is just a good reflection of the underlying earnings power of
Lincoln.

Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

Got it. Shifting gear to RPS, flows were very good. And as you pointed out earlier, you have very strong
first year sales and recurring deposits. Just thinking about on the first-year sales perspective, some of
your peers have talked about lack of activities last year causing a little bit of a dampened kind of sales
in 2021, but that doesn't seem to be the case for Lincoln. Can you just talk about like what you've done
differently or where you're getting traction compared to some of your peers?

Dennis Robert Glass
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Humphrey, it's Dennis. Let me take that and thank you for the question. I would say it this way,
it's just excellent execution on a very strong model. And when I talk about strong model, I talk about,
we have a good product portfolio. I mentioned a couple of the strong products within that portfolio. I've
mentioned that we focus on the fastest-growing markets, and we have a top 10 position in each one
of those markets. We're leveraging some of the strength of the overall organization to add distribution
strength, LFD, in particular. We also have good reach in our consultancy channels. So just overall, it's just
execution on a model, which we think has demonstrated good growth and good sales over several years in
a row now.

Turning to total deposits, we are seeing strength in recurring deposits and that's related to more
participants and employers increasing their contributions to their employees' plans. So I would just say
there's nothing unusual about the quarter. It's just great execution on a good model that's been in place
for some time.

Operator

And we have a question from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.

John Bakewell Barnidge
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

G&A expenses were up sequentially in pretty much all segments, how should we be thinking about this
prospectively in a backdrop of probably more activity happening?

Randal Jay Freitag
Executive VP, CFO & Head of Individual Life

John, thanks for the question. I think you can always get some period-to-period noise. I think I'd point
you to the fact that, as I mentioned in my script, if you look over the last year, expenses have grown at
a significantly lower rate than revenues. And so you're seeing significant earnings leverage across the
organization. A couple of points I would make, as you sort of move quarter-to-quarter, as you might
imagine, with a quarter this strong, you start to see some of your variable expenses like incentive
compensation and that sort of stuff start to elevate a little bit. So there's a little bit of that there.

The other thing I'd mention in total, as I mentioned to an earlier question, is we did book $9 million after
tax of expenses associated with our expense initiative. I talked a little bit about some of the period noise
you can get in the branding spend. So we feel great about expense management. And when you adjust for
those things, just, I think, demonstrate that at Lincoln, we have a strong focus on expenses. We've always
had a strong focus on expenses, and it comes through in the results.

John Bakewell Barnidge
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

My other questions have been answered as well.
