COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Just a
reminder, today's conference is being recorded.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial
Officer of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks.

During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the
effect of certain discrete income tax items, foreign currency-related gains, certain income tax benefits and
payroll taxes related to the accounting for stock option exercises.

We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these
non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our
results and assessing our business trends and performance.

In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal
securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and
uncertainties in our markets, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties.

For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in
our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, and each of our subsequent quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation
to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

And now that the disclaimer is out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Thanks, John. And thank you for joining us, everyone, for our second quarter call here.

We are pleased with our -- very pleased with our results for the second quarter and look forward to
discussing the trends in our business throughout today's discussion.

As an appropriate cap to a bizarre 12 months, we are now experiencing a major weather system in the
U.S., of course, including here at headquarters in Dallas, where 4 inches of snow qualifies as a snowstorm
of epic proportions. So we start by extending our well wishes to our team, our customers and their
families. And a special thanks this week to the Copart's headquarters team, including our tech people,
operations, finance and accounting, for keeping us in business to serve our customers and, in this case,
our investors today as well without disruption.

The natural questions today will, of course, focus on the pandemic. Since our last call in November, we
have all experienced firsthand the holiday season and, therefore, the accelerating and now decelerating
caseloads across the world. We've seen new viral strains. And of course, we are observing the emerging
logistics challenges of the global vaccine distribution phenomenon as well. And therefore, we've seen
mobility modulate up and down over the course of that time as well. We have, throughout, remained
honored to be recognized an essential business -- as an essential business in serving our customers in the
communities in which we do business.

COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

The themes remain overwhelmingly consistent. We have observed reducing activity, offset by the
substitution of driving for other forms of transit, including air travel, buses, trains and the like. We
continue to [ observe ] the same frequency that remains higher than what would have historically
been projected given recent driving trends. We've also observed higher total loss frequency, in parts,
empowered by very strong returns at our auctions.

If anything, our long-run views remain very much reinforced that the 40-year trend of rising total loss
frequency remains the most important underlying driver of our business and has been a continuous trend
despite some major macroeconomic disruptions over the course of the past 12 months.

In part and to reflect almost now a full year of pandemic life, I think we've remained incredibly true to
our foundational principles. We continue to focus day to day on serving our customers exceptionally well
in both good times and bad and snowstorms and otherwise. We've been flexible in accommodating their
workflows.

We have also noted the importance of auction liquidity, that being the flywheel of our marketplace
business at a time when others may well be retrenching, we continue to invest very substantial resources
in growing our global buyer base. We continue to believe that physical capacity is a key enabler of our
business as well and have invested accordingly, including making some opportunistic purchases in -- over
the course of the past year or so.

And we certainly have seen the power of deploying technology in every corner of our business to make
ourselves more efficient, our customers more efficient and to drive superior returns as well in our
auctions, in our member recruitment and retention efforts, in customer integration, in reporting, loan
payoff tools, our vehicle valuation tools and on and on and on. There is no end to the power of technology
both past, present and future in Copart.

Our people and culture have also been remarkably durable and essential despite the disruptions of various
remote work requirements, quarantines or exposure to coronavirus. And otherwise, it is the durability of
Copart's culture I think that has proven to be the strongest thread that keeps us together. We've invested
substantial resources throughout the pandemic in all of the above in the face of massive economic
disruption. We continue to make decisions all day, every day to support our customers for 20 years. That
remains our horizon as we make day-to-day decisions.

On our business specifically, we certainly did observe volume declines in the second quarter due to
reduced driving activity and high car prices, of course, which, all else equal, would leave fewer cars to
being totaled, offset by higher-than-expected accident frequency, very strong auction and, therefore, a
total loss frequency as well.

Our global unit sales decreased by 13% for the quarter with a U.S. unit decrease of 13% and an
international unit decline of approximately 15%. We've observed a slightly more pronounced international
decline as certain countries in which [ we operate ] have implemented more severe shelter-in-place orders
due to high COVID-19 case counts and population density as well.

Within our U.S. noninsurance business, we continued the trend of seeing charities and wholesalers
volumes contracting the most significantly, perhaps affected most directly by COVID-19. Excluding those
2 categories, our noninsurance volume continued its year-over-year growth trends. And in fact, our
dealer business grew 10% year-over-year in unit volume compared to what we believe were significant
declines for other whole car auction platforms. This is both a product of our auction liquidity, the flywheel I
described a moment ago, and certainly a contributor to it as well. Every dealer car we earn the right to sell
empowers us to serve our insurance customers still better with superior returns and vice versa.

Our global inventory at the end of January decreased 1.1% versus a year ago. That is comprised of both a
slight increase in U.S. inventory of 1% and a decline of 15% for international inventory primarily driven by
those countries where we have experienced more severe COVID-19 lockdowns.

On our average selling prices, they remain robust with substantial increases year-over-year. ASPs
worldwide grew 35% for the quarter with U.S. ASPs up 36%. And while there are various offsetting mix

COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

shift considerations for that U.S. number, our insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year in the U.S. as
well.

The natural question, of course, is how durable those are. We note that there are certainly favorable
underlying drivers as well, including strong used car prices, folks like Manheim and NADA citing increases
in values of 15% or thereabouts, substantial increases, but certainly shy of the mid-30% range that we've
experienced firsthand.

Our selling prices have grown, we think, as a reflection of our ongoing marketing member recruitment
capabilities and broad global reach. With the exception of the 1 quarter at the beginning of the pandemic
last year, we've now experienced 16 straight quarters of ASP increases year-over-year.

International buyers, after experiencing a slight decline in terms of the mix of vehicles purchased at the
height of the pandemic, are now purchasing cars again at a greater rate than before the pandemic despite
logistics challenges and the headaches that might come with shipping cars in 2021, a reflection of the
decades-long trends that we've discussed at great length previously.

I think it's difficult to project any given month, any given quarter or year, but the secular trends for
ASPs, including our international buyer, recruitment and retention, total loss frequency certainly as well,
remain durable. We are grateful for our very strong financial performance this quarter, excited to continue
investing in our customers' future and our own.

And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to discuss the second quarter financial results.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everybody. I'll make a few brief comments on our operational results to
provide a little more color, and then we'll open it up for some questions.

Global revenue increased $41.9 million or 7.3%, including a $2.2 million benefit due to currency. Global
service revenue increased $22.6 million or 4.4% primarily due to higher ASPs. The U.S. service revenue
grew 4% and international experienced an increase of 7.2%.

Purchased vehicle sales increased $19.3 million or 29.7% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes,
partially offset by lower international volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 48.3% over the
prior year and international grew by 7.5%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle
sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $3.6 million overall.

Global gross profit increased by $47.6 million or 18.3%. And our gross margin percentage improved
by approximately [ 460 ] basis points to 49.8%. U.S. margins improved from 47.6% to 52.2% and
international margins increased from 32.8% to 37.6%. Both segments' margin was driven primarily
through increased ASPs, but was partially offset due to volume declines over fixed cost components,
leading to higher cost per unit processed.

I'll now move to a discussion of G&A, excluding stock compensation and depreciation expenses. We
continue to believe that we can achieve additional operating leverage over the long term, and we
encourage you to review longer-dated trend lines rather than a single quarter metric for a more accurate
view of the business, particularly given the impact of COVID.

With that said, our G&A spend was down $3.2 million from $39.2 million a year ago to $36.0 million in
2021. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 23% from $209.9 million to $258.2 million. We
delivered over 500 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs
outpacing the impact of a lower absolute volume of vehicles while controlling G&A costs.

Net interest expense increased $400,000 or 8.6% year-over-year due to reduced interest income on
collected cash balances given the current interest rate environment and an increased issuance costs and
unused line of credit fees due to the July 2020 revolver upsizing and amendment.

COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

Q2 income tax expense was $59 million at a 23.4 effective tax rate, reflecting a $2.2 million benefit to
size on the exercise of employee stock options, which has been adjusted out for purposes of non-GAAP
earnings included in our earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been
24.2%.

In summary, GAAP net income increased 14.7% from $168.7 million last year to $193.4 million this year.
Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options, non-GAAP
net income increased 24.8% from $153.5 million last year to $191.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 --
in the second quarter of 2021, excuse me. For the first 6 months of fiscal '21, GAAP net income increased
to $393.7 million and non-GAAP net income increased 23.0% to $379.8 million.

Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights. As of January 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of
liquidity comprised of $616.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility
with capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $138.7 million over July 31, 2020.

Operating cash flow for the quarter decreased modestly by $10 million year-over-year to $134.5 million
primarily driven by working capital changes. Sequentially, operating cash flow decreased $124 million
from the first quarter of 2021 due to seasonal factors that should reverse later in the year. We invested
$136.1 million in capital expenditures for the quarter and 85% of this amount was attributable to capacity
expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity for additional business and creates an
economic moat to potential market entrants given the difficulty in-sourcing appropriately zoned facilities.

In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong and durable growth enable us to continue to
make decisions for long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Victor, we're happy to open it up for some questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

Congratulations on strong operating performance.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Thanks, Bob.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

I wanted to start with one of the comments you made just to dig a little further, Jeff. You mentioned total
loss frequency is one of the -- has been rising for 40 years. It's one of the keys to the investment thesis to
the secular growth that you have. But there's also been a 30-plus percent ASP rise over the last 9 months
plus. Has total loss frequency risen proportionately? Do you think there's more to come? Do you think --
what's the correlation between those? And how do you think it's going to play out going forward?

Jeffrey Liaw
President

It's a great and very thorny question you raised. So I mentioned used car prices, which we decently track
carefully as well. So if you -- let's separate a bunch of different variables at the same. With used car prices
being high, by itself, would lead to fewer cars being totaled. To the extent that it helps to bring salvage
auction values up, that can then increase total loss frequency to some extent as well.

But your question really is to what extent are today's auction returns being incorporated by insurance
companies into their total loss decisions. And I think the answer is partially so. But I don't think, broadly
speaking, folks have fully accounted for today's auction returns in terms of the total loss frequency.

You've seen the uptick in total loss frequency, but it's in the 1% kind of range. I think if and when these
prices prove durable, I think we would see total loss frequency up meaningfully still.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

Got it. That's great. And then obviously, you guys were all [ prepared ] going into the pandemic, but it still
is a largely disruptive event for everyone. Can you talk about some of the biggest changes you've made to
the business model as a result and where that positions you going forward?

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Yes. I think the -- we have the good benefit, Bob, in some respects, of having been wired for disruptions
like this even before we could expect them, meaning we have been an online-only auction platform, as
you know, since 2003. So we didn't have to figure it out on the fly.

We have been a global online auction house for literally decades. So that's been the single biggest help
during the pandemic. Otherwise, we certainly had to make real-time accommodations to a number of our
customers who have their own evolving workflows that now -- they now wish to send fewer people to
physical locations and so forth.

COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

So we have to find ways to accommodate that workflow and some mix of -- through some mix of business
process and technology deployments. On our part to keep our own people safe and to reduce density
in our facilities, we've deployed tools that help our members, our employees and our sellers reduce
congestion, so they can go to the facilities at the right times and wait in their cars instead of coming into
the facility and waiting in line physically.

We certainly had to accommodate work-from-home arrangements for folks who have been quarantined,
exposed or in high case count areas where the restrictions are more severe. But by and large, we have, I'd
say, much more business as usual in actionable practice than not, in part, because we had already been a
digital business beforehand.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

Okay. Got it. And then last one from me, I'll get back in queue. And I know you guys are always looking
out 3, 5, 10 years in your planning. I was wondering if you could share with us the biggest changes and
opportunities you see domestically and internationally over the next 3, 5 or 10 years.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Incredibly open-ended question and probably a longer discussion than we can handle today. But we're
certainly excited about our core business being the -- I think you were citing our incumbent market
specifically.

But in the U.S., I think we believe that, that rising total loss frequency is a huge opportunity for us not just
as the passive beneficiaries of it, but because we affect those results to some extent through our auction
technology, our member recruitments. Building that global liquidity base is everything. And as we drive
returns upwards, we can for our customers continue to achieve better returns and therefore, earn the
right to sell still more of those cars. So bringing us back to the total loss frequency thesis you described a
moment ago.

Therefore, also, we can continue to grow our business in the noninsurance realms as well, including
among automotive dealers. As our auction values rise, as our liquidity grows and builds upon itself, we
are the right outlet for more whole cars as well. And that also is a large and substantial opportunity for us
here in the U.S.

Operator

Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin with Truist Financial.

Stephanie Benjamin
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Jeff, you have made an interesting comment. I don't think it's particularly unique, but you called out that
your buyers are now buying at a greater rate than pre-COVID levels. Just given what we have seen with
ASPs, I'd love to hear your thoughts on why you think the buyer base as being a little bit more active.
I know you've made a lot of strides in building and expanding the buyer base, but the frequency is an
interesting dynamic as well. So I would love to hear your thoughts.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Sure. The observation was more -- as far as that in the height of the pandemic, which I think of as the
-- or the pandemic uncertainty perhaps, the spring and summer of 2020, and also compounded then by
many of our buyer currencies having to [indiscernible] relative to the U.S. dollar, we've seen -- and these
are all in small percentage point changes. Definitely to be fair, these aren't titanic shifts of any sort. But
we've seen their buying power compressed by virtue of their currencies.

COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

Now sitting here in -- after this quarter, we've now seen international buyers purchasing the most cars
on a percentage basis relative to our total units sold that they have bought since before -- since pre-
pandemic levels. So I think it's a reflection of ongoing demand, more of the 40-year trends, more that our
wrecked cars are incredibly valuable as drivable cars to many other countries around the world.

So I think that's really the phenomenon, as you note, supported by our marketing and technology efforts
to build upon that buyer base.

Stephanie Benjamin
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit of an update on your efforts to build
out your presence in Germany.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Sure. In Germany, I think our -- the economic thesis, which we described at great length in a couple
of calls in 2019 -- or fiscal 2019, so certainly, we would direct others to go there. I know you've read it
carefully.

But the underlying thesis is that the status quo today is a disservice to insurance carriers and to their
policyholders both. Both in economic terms and experiential ones. And at the Copart auction model, which
we have deployed, as you know, at great scale in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Brazil and elsewhere, generates
better economic outcomes for everyone involved and better experiential outcomes as well.

Our experience there, including during the pandemic, has done nothing but reinforce that. We are --
as noted a few calls ago, we are selling consigned vehicles on behalf of a number of the top insurance
carriers in Germany. We are continuing to invest in our technology, our land, our people, our marketing
efforts. Ultimately, we think it is our business process, our global buyer base and our technology, which
will ultimately allow us to prevail. We have the [ votes ]. We are incredibly excited.

As you might imagine, the pandemic itself is an interesting catalyst. It is -- it shakes up the status quo
to some extent. But in other respects, it also can arrest meetings that otherwise might have happened in
working sessions and so forth with insurance carriers. But the underlying thesis is as strong as ever. Our
results -- our auction results there continue to demonstrate a superior outcome relative to the status quo,
which ultimately benefits the insurance carriers and benefits the policyholders as well because they don't
have an owner-retained wrecked vehicle and ultimately, because this will drive insurance rates down as
well.

Operator

Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to take another crack at deconstructing ARPU trends over the last several years really. To what
extent is the higher ARPU due to services that you didn't even offer 5 years ago? I'm thinking like loan
payoff or other fee-for-service opportunities that are available on the platform that maybe just weren't
available 5 years ago.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Craig, clarifying question. ARPU, what's your arithmetic?

Craig R. Kennison

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

Well, I'm just thinking, I mean you've got a big trend, obviously, a big movement in your average
selling price and overall revenue per unit, which I can't remember the number you cited on the call, but
obviously, this quarter was up a lot. We know that there are several factors driving it, and I'm trying to
just get a -- probe really one issue, which is maybe you're offering features and capabilities today that you
didn't offer in the past and that would partially explain the growth in that metric.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

It does partially but only partially. So a minority of that would be explained by additional services. We
do think we offer the best suite of seller services in the business, including the loan payoff tool. You
mentioned a moment ago, various title services and the like, but the majority of what I think you're calling
ARPU growth, which is the comparison of our revenue change relative to our units sold change, there is
some principal mix in there as well.

So principal mix can throw that math off in ways that overstate its economic importance, as you know.
But that aside, it is principally driven by strong auction returns, which then, in turn, of course, generates
higher revenue to Copart as well.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe somewhat related, but it goes to the platform itself. I'm just -- you've continued
to innovate this platform, but you don't like to talk as much about that innovation. I'd be curious to know
what you achieved in 2020 that -- what features did you develop in 2020 that your buyers or sellers
embraced.

And I'm just thinking about the tools that build confidence in the buyer, especially whether it's pictures,
sounds, facts or like inspection services. I'm just learning -- looking to learn more about innovation in
2020.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

I think as you well know, Craig, I think we are quite delighted to invest aggressively in innovation and to
talk about it at great length, but principally with the actual audiences themselves, with the sellers and the
members alike. But when it comes to building member confidence, to us, it is a matter of reducing friction
as well.

So ensuring a seamless auction platform participation for those buyers, whether it's from their desktop
or from their phones, increasingly, we are mobile versed as they are as well. So ensuring a frictionless
experience for them in purchasing cars, paying for cars, registering as a member, et cetera, there are
dozens, scores of individual innovations that I won't cite in great detail here of the audience.

But that is -- the principle of it is that, is that we want excellent visibility, excellent transparency and a
frictionless experience from both the member and the seller side as well.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

When you think about the dealer cars, I mean, still growing pretty significantly, how are they impacting
ASPs? I would imagine -- or maybe you could give us some idea, sort of the average value of the dealer
cars. And at what point does the dealer mix become large enough that it starts to support the ASP
average by itself.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

Yes. I think it's a good question. And one reason we went ahead and proactively disclosed because I think
the intuition is fair that if dealer volume is up 10% year-over-year and the ASPs are higher than those of
the insurance cars, to what extent is it contributing to ASP growth. And the answer is, yes, it contributes,
but it's offset by other mix effects as well. So that U.S. insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year, right?
So it is not, by and large, the story for ASP change year-over-year for this quarter.

Over time, it certainly could have that effect as well. As you know, the total of our noninsurance business
is in the order of the 20% kind of range. So it won't. It -- we will still be largely driven by insurance
changes for the next X quarters and years. But over time, yes, they will continue to grow that dealer
business, and it will nudge our ASPs upward as well.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then in the past, you've talked about what percentage of IP addresses were either foreign or
maybe brokers on behalf of foreign buyers. Could you give us an update on that number? Or at least
maybe some idea what -- an idea what -- maybe what percentage of vehicles sold wind up in export now?

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Yes. And a very fair question. You're describing the methodology, which we changed a few years ago. We
used to measure our exports solely by a registration address, but it became apparent that there were a
number of folks who simply register in the U.S. but actually have their principal operations outside and,
therefore, are exporters by trade.

And so that number, the more inclusive estimate for the share of our cars produced by non-U.S. buyers is
circa 40% or thereabouts. It's an imperfect science. There are international IP addresses that we know are
for buyers who intend to export cars. There are international IP addresses that we know are not. They're
literally for U.S. buyers who have outsourced or located their purchasing operations outside the U.S., and
we purposely exclude them as well.

So the output of that analysis is circa 40% of our units are purchased by those international buyers. Now
I qualify that by saying that 90% plus of our cars are -- have their values affected by international buyers
because they bid on many, many more cars still than they buy.

Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I wanted to start on a bit more of a near-term one before a longer-term question, Jeff. When we look at
the volume backdrop near term, miles driven appear to have stagnated here kind of down 10-ish percent,
but total loss rates going higher.

I guess as we look forward, do you expect the gains we've seen in total loss rate just stay this year?
We saw kind of a step function change during the pandemic. Do you think the industry holds onto the?
And then related, what is your expectation for miles driven as we look out 12 to 24 months on the U.S.
business here?

Jeffrey Liaw
President

On the first question, yes, is there some blip at some moment where somehow it is down slightly year-
over-year or quarter-over-quarter when it comes to total, that's possible. But when I look at the 40-year
trend line, which we mentioned a few moments ago, I think total loss frequency in 19 --- get my date
straight, 1980 was 4% or so. And 40 years later, it's north of 20%.

COPART, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 19, 2021

So it's a fivefold increase in the past 40 years. I think that's an inexorable march to 30%, 40% and
beyond. Whether there are near-term technical blips that caused it to change in a given quarter, I think
it's totally plausible, but I think the 40-year trend is unassailable.

To your other question about miles driven, unfortunately, I think we see tons of data. So I think since
November, we have tons of data. I'm not sure we have tons of incremental insight there beyond what you
and others would cite as well in the EIA's data, Google, Apple, INRIX, et cetera. We study those same
trends. And I think underlying them are all the same questions about the proliferation of the vaccine:
when the kids go back to school, when leisure travel resumes, air travel resumes. I think there are so
many variables that are upstream of that question. Even driving activity, to say nothing of Copart volume,
that's somewhat speculation on our part to give you any kind of number or even a range.

That said, I think we are preparing ourselves when it comes to our business, investing in technology and
in land for a growth -- ultimate growth environment. I don't know if that's coming in 6 months or more,
that remains to be seen, but I think we are prepared for it.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. Moving over to the international operations. I want to dig in, in the U.K., Brazil,
Germany, how much are you doing on the noninsurance side over there? I would think with your global
buyer base digitally native, you could probably give them a pretty good dealer-to-dealer market over there
compared to what they have. But I'm curious how that opportunity looks and how achievable you think
that will be.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

I think the answer is similar that -- in that where we have very substantial liquidity as we do here in the
U.S., Canada, Brazil, U.K., et cetera, we are, therefore, a very attractive platform for other noninsurance
cars as well. So I think your hypothesis is fair and accurate.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then last one from me. Jeff, you mentioned shipping rates and logistics headwinds are
weighing on the international buyer. Is that -- frankly, I think the buyer bears the cost of shipping. So
that's just a lack of available shipping containers. And then are you guys forecasting that sustains for a
while here? Or what kind of the shipping outlook look like from your standpoint?

Jeffrey Liaw
President

You are correct that the logistics are the responsibility of the buyer. I think the disruptions were more
severe, frankly, in the middle of last year than they are now. But that has weighed, to some extent, on
those international buyers. And that -- the reason for sharing that context is that against that backdrop,
they are now at pre-pandemic levels in terms of the share of cars they're actually purchasing in the
international markets.

So I don't -- anything I can share with you would just be anecdotal, by and large, based on what we've
heard from our members. I gather it's a consensus today, but not a major one.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Sorry, can you repeat that? You broke up a little bit.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Sorry, if I'm having connection issues. Did you give a noninsurance mix in the call?

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's about 20%.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

20%. Went down a little bit. Okay. And I guess my question was, so dealer consignment was up more
than insurance. It sounds like noninsurance was down a little bit, but what were some of the mitigating
factors that hurt the ARPU growth? You talked about mix effects. Just trying to understand the channels
that would have been weaker that would have hurt ARPU.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Well, our insurance ASPs are up in ARPU. We're probably completing a few things there, Chris. So if you
start -- let's just say ASPs, which are not revenue for us, right? And there, the insurance selling went up
36%. Dealer prices also went up. They didn't go up 36%, right? So that is a "headwind" relative to the
overall 36%. That is offset by the mix shift benefits of those dealer cars.

We did, as we noted during the prepared remarks, see a decline in sureties and wholesaler volumes to
some extent. And that is also, frankly, ASP supportive by itself, right, because there are lower-value cars
that are declining as a share of the overall mix.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Chris, this is John. Just to jump in. The X number was 22% of total volume in the quarter, not -- I said
approximately 20%, it's 22%.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. That actually went up. Okay. That makes sense. And then just big-picture question. From
what I could tell, it seems like you took more share in dealer consignment this quarter than last quarter
just based on what one of your peers reported yesterday or a few days ago. Is that what you're seeing?

And then two, is there something that COVID that's eroding the barriers to entry in dealer consignment?
Is there anything you're doing differently to win more accounts from dealers? Just want to hear your
perspective on how you're able to accelerate market share gains in dealer consignment right now.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Give me that first half of the question again, Chris. The second one I got.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. Sorry. I apologize if I'm breaking up. The snowstorm has killed my service. Yes. The first question
is, it seems that you're taking share in dealer consignment, right? It looks like relative to last quarter, your

share actually accelerated just based on your growth rate and the market growth rate. So just trying to
understand what -- if that's what you're seeing from your own data that you're taking share was the first
part.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Yes. I think based on what we can tell from publicly available information for other dealer auction
platforms, yes, we are outgrowing other participants in the industry. I would describe our practices during
the pandemic as largely a continuation of our trends. We have a terrific internal sales team that pursues
those dealers. I think we have benefited from having been this online auction platform, global auction
platform forever.

So if the right buyer for your car is 10 miles away, he or she will own it. If the right buyer for your car is
in Poland or Nigeria, he or she will own it. So that global marketplace I think has been our most important
tool in our belt when it comes to winning those dealer accounts.

It is not per se a major strategic shift. But because we were online throughout, there are certainly other
participants in the industry who are more accustomed to physical auctions or hybrid auctions, et cetera.
And we have been certainly relatively less disrupted than some of them.

Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.

Gary Frank Prestopino
Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division

Jeff, John, what was the U.S. revenue growth and the international revenue growth? I couldn't write that
down quick enough.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

U.S. service revenue was 4.4% -- sorry, global was 4.4%; U.S. was 4%; and international was 7.2%. For
purchase...

Gary Frank Prestopino
Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division

Is that your revenue growth? Yes. Go ahead.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Yes. That was for service.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

That's service revenue. For purchased vehicles, it's 29.7%; U.S. is 48.3%; and international was 7.5%.

Gary Frank Prestopino
Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Just a question on your dealer vehicles. I mean are you seeing your platform being used moving
I guess up the value channel? The impression I always had when this was initially started that you were
kind of trying to disintermediate maybe the wholesaler that was getting the 12- to 15-year-old car off the
lot. It seems that as you're gaining share here, are you seeing your platform almost play out to the extent
that it's mimicking some of the other online services that are out there on a dealer-to-dealer market
basis?

Jeffrey Liaw
President

That direct comparison is harder for us to comment on, Gary. I think your general observation is fair,
though, that as our overall pool vehicles evolves over time, if you just took a picture of what a Copart car
looked like in 1990 versus what a Copart -- the median Copart car looks like in 2020, the car in 1990 was
much more heavily wrecked, physically speaking, right? Cars were more readily repairable than they are
today. And today, if a couple of sensors are knocked out, then the cars can be totaled much more readily
in part because the returns are better on the back end as well. And therefore, the overall pool of liquidity
has evolved as well and more and more whole cars are directly addressable by our buyer base as well.

So to your overall question, yes, we are "moving up the value chain."

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I know you've gotten a number already around the noninsurance business. I thought to ask a couple
more, including if you're able to say what percent of your noninsurance volume is truly whole car as
opposed to I guess salvage cars that are sourced outside of insurance companies. And are whole cars
more profitable vehicles for you to sell because they transact at higher prices? Is there anything else to
think about? Like, for example, on the sell fee side, like if there are smaller dealers selling the vehicles,
maybe they don't get the volume discounts that your customers are selling tens of thousands of vehicles
do, making it even more profitable.

And then just finally, I'm curious if there are certain parts of the whole car market that you're targeting
now, such as dealers, but maybe there are other segments or categories of sellers that you've not gotten
into yet, which might offer future growth opportunities.

Jeffrey Liaw
President

Thanks, Ryan. Insightful questions, some we can address more transparently than others. In short, the
-- in short, we certainly believe that the -- as total loss frequency rises, as the character of the vehicles
that we sell changes and that pool of liquidity evolves over time, but yes, still more of transacted vehicles
become addressable through Copart's platform in short.

As for the profitability or the mix thereof, the dealers are not the majority of, but a very important portion
of our noninsurance business. Of course, that business is profitable to us. We won't comment on relative
fees paid by our customers, in part, because the services we provide them also vary greatly as well.

But it is a profitable business for us. It is important to us. It also -- as I noted in the prepared remarks,
also helps us serve insurance customers better as well. They are all mutually supportive of one another
because of the liquidity phenomenon.

When we win that dealer car, it attracts still more buyers who have been on insurance cars and vice versa.
And so as we total -- as we help insurance carriers total cars that are more and more marginal, from their
point of view, that also attracts more buyers, which also, therefore, attracts more dealer cars as well as
those other sources that you may have in mind.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Very helpful. And then just lastly on the winter weather outside your office window. Should investors
be thinking about that as a potential tailwind to both revenue and profits? Or is it more of a surge or cat-
type volume that also comes with a higher cost?

President

It's a fair question. I have to confess despite having grown up here to not have tremendous experience
with Texas snowstorms, to be fair. So I think we'll see how this unfolds over the course of the next few
weeks.

Typically, the major challenge in flooding, major rain storms and wind storms is that cars are stranded
in all kinds of different places that require very urgent pickups. I think in this, we have seen certainly
reduced driving activity. This pandemic affects turbocharge still in terms of driving activity and such. But
we are deploying many of our resources to address this question. Many of our own -- company-owned
trucks are people who are on [ an environment ] like this, we're deploying as well. So I don't know what
the ultimate financial impact will be. But we're I think well prepared to handle it regardless.
