AON PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's First Quarter 2021 Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has
an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments
in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature, as defined by the
Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties.
And could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information
concerning Risk Factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our
first quarter 2021 results as well as having been posted on our website.

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. I'm
joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a
detailed financial presentation on our website.

I'd like to start by acknowledging the tremendous work of our colleagues across the firm. Our team
continues to find ways to get back, not just to normal, but even better than before. We like to call it the
new better. The idea of the new better started in the second half of last year with a series of regional and
local client coalitions. There are now 10 coalitions of leading companies around the world. That we formed
to explore the societal and economic implications of the pandemic. The group rejects the idea of accepting
a suboptimal new normal and is working to find a new better. The work is ongoing and continues to offer
meaningful insights into how leading organizations will work, travel and convene in the year ahead. And
we're translating those insights into new solutions that are designated and designed to accelerate recovery
from COVID-19.

For instance, we know that widespread global vaccine distribution is a key part of the solution and one
that day on is enabling. Let me describe. Recognized in limitations with current supply chain solutions, Aon
colleagues from commercial risk, reinsurance and health solutions collaborated with insurance, reinsurance
and share tech and supply chain industry partners to develop a groundbreaking solution that uses sensors
and analytics in the transportation and storage of vaccines. The centers provide transparent, real-time
data and alerts give the temperature of a vaccine shipment falls outside the manufacturers range.
Potentially allowing for mitigation efforts and helping to maximize the number of doses administered to
the public. It's just another example of how we're creating innovative solutions to move our industry and
society forward. We're also donating all 2021 revenue from the solution to an international organization
working to help end the human and economic toll caused by the pandemic.

Turning now to financials. Our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial
metrics, including 6% organic revenue growth, a very strong start to the year on top of 5% organic in Q1
2020. Substantial operating margin expansion of 170 basis points, 16% EPS growth and 91% free cash
flow growth. Within organic revenue, we continue to see strength in our core, driven by strong retention
and net new business generation and overall growth within more discretionary areas of revenue, with
some areas coming back faster than others. Commercial risk delivered 9% organic, an outstanding result
with very strong new business growth and growth in project-related work and double-digit growth in
transaction liability. Reinsurance delivered 6% growth with strong net new business in treaty and double-
digit growth in facultative placements. Retirement Solutions delivered 5% growth, and I would highlight
strength in core retirement and double-digit growth in human capital. Health Solutions growth of 4% and
was driven by strength in the core, offset by pressure in project work. One of the areas we're seeing a
little slower bounce back, and data and analytics continued to see pressure from the travel and events

practice globally, resulting in a 2% organic decline. So against the prior Q1 quarter of pre-pandemic
results.

These results are an improvement from our Q4 earnings call outlook. During the quarter, we saw better-
than-expected macroeconomic growth, which positively impacted client buying behavior. Looking forward,
if macroeconomic conditions continue to be strong, we would expect mid-single digit or greater organic
revenue growth for the full year 2021. And while our Q1 results demonstrate, that our Aon United strategy
is driving innovative solutions that address our clients' biggest challenges, we keep seeing signs that we
must move faster. We see our clients justifiably focused on the economic impact of COVID-19, but they're
also increasingly focused on other challenges, like climate change, supply chain disruption, reimagining
and reconfiguring how and where work gets done, the growing health wealth gap and cyber. Our recent
cyber risk report highlighted findings from our proprietary cyber quotient evaluation, a comprehensive
assessment of cyber risk maturity. The 2020 data tells us that organizations across regions and industries,
are only maintaining a basic level of cyber readiness. Specifically, only 2 in 5 organizations report they're
prepared to navigate new exposures, and only 17% report having adequate application security measures
in place.

In our recent gray swan report, we looked back at 40 years of corporate crises, analyzing 300 examples
that show the significant impact on shareholder value due to lack of preparedness. The total impact
represents $1.2 trillion in destroyed value, and in 10% of the events, 50% of shareholder value was
lost. These risks and challenges are exactly what we want to help our clients assess and prepare for. In
another great example, our human capital and commercial risk teams realized that their client in the life
sciences med tech space had not done an assessment or quantification of cyber risk for their business or
products. Our team analyzes risks across infrastructure, technology, vendor and digitally enabled products
and quantify potential losses or impacts as reputation, business interruption or a hack from the direct to
their devices. In response to this prioritized and quantified risk assessment. Our clients strengthen their
own security measures and change their insurance coverage, increasing their preparedness and reducing
potential future volatility of their business. A topic that's more critical than ever for companies in the life
sciences industry.

Looking forward, this is a process and a solution offering that makes innovative cyber solutions more
accessible to our clients in the life sciences space. As we look to our pending combination with Willis
Towers Watson, we're confident their insights and capabilities will be a compelling catalyst to this work.
And this is just one example out of thousands where we see the potential for the pending combination of
Aon and Willis Towers Watson teams to drive innovation based on forward-looking analytics and insight.
As we brought together the executive committee that will be in place after the close of the combination,
the potential is clearer than ever. We have an opportunity to be more relevant to clients at a time when
they need us most. Another example, our Aon team is currently advising a client on the integration of
their largest transaction today, a complex global merger that's moving very quickly. Colleagues from
data analytics, retirement, health and benefits and human capital, came together to advise our client
on harmonizing their people programs while balancing synergies and deal objectives to drive employee
engagement and retention as well as a shared vision from day 1. Our client is relying on Aon to help them
protect their greatest asset, their people. We know that the combination with Willis Towers Watson will
enable us to bring together our combined capabilities as in each company's client insight around health,
retirement and engagement will improve and accelerate our ability to deliver projects like these for clients.

In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the continued success of our strategy and position
us with momentum to drive improvement on our key metrics over the course of the year, building on
a track record of progress that we've delivered over the past decade. The events of 2021 continue to
highlight unmet need and growing demand from clients around their biggest challenges, which we know
are best addressed by our one firm, Aon United strategy. Our ability to address client needs and accelerate
innovation will only get better in our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, which continues to
increase our commitment and excitement for the potential of the combined firm.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financials and long-term outlook for
continued shareholder value creation. Christa?

AON PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2021

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg mentioned, we delivered a strong
operational and financial performance in the first quarter to start the year. Highlighted by 6% organic
revenue growth that translated into double-digit growth in operating income, earnings per share and free
cash flow. Our Aon United strategy has enabled continued growth across our key financial metrics. We look
forward to building on this momentum through the rest of 2021 and in our pending combination with Willis
Towers Watson. As I further reflect on the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6% driven by
ongoing strength in our core business with an uneven recovery in our more discretionary areas. I would
also note that total reported revenue was up 10%, including the favorable impact from changes in FX
primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus the euro.

Second, we delivered strong operational improvement with operating income growth of 15% and operating
margin expansion of 170 basis points to 37.4%. Stepping back, our goal is to deliver a sustainable
operating margin expansion over the course of the full year as there can be volatility quarter-to-quarter
given the seasonality of our business and timing of expenses including long-term investment and growth.
In Q1, margin expansion was helped by 2 factors. First, organic revenue growth exceeded our Q4 outlook,
due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and client buying behavior. Second, Q1 2020 had higher
expenses in areas like T&E and investments in the business, which made for an easier comparable when
compared to our expectations for the rest of 2021.

Looking to the rest of 2021, we anticipate investment in the business and some potential resumption of
T&E later in the year. Looking forward to quarterly patterning of expenses for the balance of 2021. As we
described last year, we reduced certain discretionary expenses at the onset of the pandemic, given the
significant macroeconomic uncertainty. And then returned to somewhat more normalized levels of spend in
the back half of the year as macroeconomic conditions improved and the outlook stabilized.

In 2021 compared to 2020, we expect approximately $200 million less expense to be recognized in the
fourth quarter, offset by approximately $135 million more expense in Q2 and $65 million more expense
in Q3. Put another way, we expect $135 million of expense to move from Q4 to Q2 and $65 million
of expense to move from Q4 to Q3 when comparing to our expectations for the remainder of 2021 to
prior year results, prior to any growth occurring. This shift, representing about 2% of our annual cost
base is primarily due to the actions we took and highlighted last year. Including the reduction of certain
discretionary expenses, including variable compensation in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. This shift also spreads
our expense base more evenly across quarters. So we still do expect to see occasional variability and
lumpiness in expenses. This change will have an impact on quarterly margins, reducing margins in Q2 and
Q3 and increasing them in Q4. However, it does not change our expectation of full year margin expansion
for 2020/21.

As we've stated previously, our goal is to deliver sustainable margin expansion over the course of each
full year, driven by accelerating revenue growth, portfolio mix shift to higher growth, higher-margin
businesses and leverage from Aon Business Services. Aon Business Services is focused on innovation as
well as effectiveness. Recently, our Aon Business Services team saw an opportunity to improve premium
accounting with a blockchain solution. The team works with a carrier partner and the insurance industry
standard setting group to design and develop a clearinghouse for premium transactions. This process has
been live since the 1st of January 2021 and has over 13,000 transactions executed. It's already improving
the speed at which errors are identified and resolved. Over time, we expect our major carrier partners and
other brokers to join the platform. We see this as a significant opportunity to improve the client experience
with higher quality, and reduce inefficiencies across the industry. As with other Aon Business Services
process improvements, efficiencies in this new blockchain process enable our colleagues to spend more
time with clients and on higher value-added activities.

Turning back to the results of the quarter. We translated strong operational performance into EPS growth
of 16%. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.18
in the quarter. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect a $0.04 per share favorable
impact in Q2, a $0.02 per share favorable impact in Q3 and a $0.01 per share favorable impact in Q4.

AON PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2021

Finally, moving to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 91% to $532 million, primarily
driven by strong operational improvement, a decrease in restructuring cash outlays and a decrease
in CapEx. I would note that we do expect CapEx for the full year to increase modestly as we invest in
technology to drive business growth.

Looking forward, we expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our 10-year
track record of 14% CAGR growth in free cash flow. Including 64% growth to $2.6 billion free cash flow
in 2020. We remain incredibly excited for the long-term cash flow potential of the pending combination.
We make capital allocation decisions based on our ROIC framework, highlighted by $50 million of share
repurchase in the fourth -- first quarter. As a reminder, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter for free
cash flow, due primarily to incentive compensation payments. We also repaid $400 million of term debt in
February.

Looking forward, we expect to remain highly focused on closing and then successfully integrating our
combination with Willis Towers Watson. Following that, we expect to continue to invest organically and
inorganically in innovative content and capabilities in priority areas to service our clients' unmet needs.
We remain very confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-
laddered debt maturity profile. In the near term, we expect to continue to manage our leverage ratios
conservatively and return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows over the long term.

As I look towards our pending combination with Willis Towers Watson, we remain incredibly excited about
the potential for growth in innovative solutions for clients, and the shareholder value creation opportunity.
We are continuing to work collaboratively with the appropriate regulators to gain approvals, and we've
offered remedies. We continue to anticipate $800 million of cost synergies taking into account the
remedies offered. We would expect to allocate any divestiture proceeds according to our ROIC framework
in which share buyback continues to be our highest return investment. We are working towards the close
in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval.

In summary, our first quarter results reflect continued progress, building on a decade of momentum.
Driven by our Aon United strategy and underpinned by our Aon Business Services operational platform.
We remain incredibly excited about closing our pending combination and beginning the integration process
with Willis Towers Watson, which will continue to enable long-term shareholder value creation.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Okay. And our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

So last year, you guys pulled your guidance for the merger when you pulled your Aon stand alone
guidance. But now that you've reestablished guidance on a stand-alone basis, can you provide some
thoughts on your expectations for guidance for the merger?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Suneet, appreciate it. As we've said before, when we got together as a pandemic, we pulled guidance
overall, what we said today is as we think about Aon, obviously, we're talking about mid-single digit or
greater, assuming macroeconomic contingents continue. I'd remind everybody that before pandemic,
we talked about a combined mid-single-digit or greater. And what we plan to do, Suneet is when we --
as we complete the combination, we'll obviously be back to you with what we expect going forward. But
remember where we were when we started the process.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. And then just focusing on the expense guidance, I guess, for Aon, on a stand-alone basis. Christa,
I think you said you called out a couple of things that are moving from quarter-to-quarter. But is there an
assumed underlying kind of growth rate in expenses as we think about 2021 versus last year? And if so,
can you give us a sense of what that growth rate is?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Suneet, it's a great question, and thank you for asking. And so what you're really seeing is just
$200 million come out of Q4 and then of that $135 million goes into Q2 and $65 million goes into Q3.
Suneet, that is before growth. And so you should assume growth is built on top of that, and we haven't
given that growth rate. But what I would say is it's in the context of full year margin expansion for 2021
on top of a track record, as you know, Suneet, over the last 10 years of 890 basis points over the last 10
years, so approximately 90 basis points a year.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Got it. And then just the last one for me is on the free cash flow. As you mentioned, 1Q is typically your
lowest quarter. But the growth was quite strong this quarter. Was there anything sort of unusual from a
timing perspective that maybe something was pulled forward in 1Q? Or just want to get some color on
that.

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean we do expect to drive free cash flow growth annually over the long term, building on our
track record of 14% CAGR over the last 10 years. I in Q1, free cash flow was exceptionally strong, driven
by operating income growth, very strong operating income growth in the quarter. Given our pending
combination with Willis Towers Watson and especially the impact of free cash flow relating to achieving the
$800 million of cost synergies we're not providing stand-alone guidance for Aon at this time, but we do
remain incredibly excited for the long-term cash flow potential of the pending combination.

Operator

And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question, I just want to make sure I understood correctly. The $800 million -- you essentially said
that the $800 million of expense saves for the deal, you're reaffirming that even with some remedies or
divestitures, I guess, that have been offered up to regulators. Is that what you said, Christa?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

That is correct, Elyse.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then my second question, I'm not sure how much detail you guys want to go into and
we obviously read in the press in terms of what divestitures might have been offered up. I know there was
a $1.8 billion kind of divestiture cap included within the merger. Is there any way that you could speak to
that and give us a sense of whether you would be willing to go a certain amount above that level? Or any
color you can give us in reference that $1.8 billion that was laid out with the merger?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

So Elyse, we're not going to speculate on remedies. We have confirmed that we will have remedies. We're
continuing to work collaboratively with regulators and we continue to anticipate, as I mentioned, the $800
million of cost synergies considering the remedies offered, and we'd expect to allocate any divestiture
proceeds according to our ROIC framework and which share buyback continues to be our highest return
activity.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then on the tax rate, I was understanding how your tax rate was impacted by GILTI and BEAT
the last couple of years. And then also on the tax side, doubling the GILTI as Biden has proposed -- have a
tangible impact on your tax rate, all else equal?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

So Elyse, we're not giving guidance going forward. But I would say, as we look back historically, exclusive
of the impact of discrete items, which can be positive or negative in any quarter, our historical underlying
rate over the last 4 years has been 18%.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then one last one. Like I said that Q1 had a tough comp and then obviously, the
macroeconomic environment improved and helped you get to 6% for the quarter. When we think about
the mid-single-digit organic outlook or greater? Does it feel like to you that for 3 quarters, just assuming
the economy continues to improve, should be greater than the Q1, given that we would get the better
economy impacting organic as we go through the year?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. All we're really highlighting, Elyse, is as you go back really, Q1 last year, it just really pre pandemic,
there really wasn't a lot of pandemic embedded in it. And we were just observing 6% against that is a

AON PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2021

great start to the year, just really underscores the momentum we have. We're obviously not going to
give guidance other than the mid-single-digit as we proceed through the year, assuming macroeconomic
conditions continue to trend in the right direction. But we would just observe, listen, commercial risk at
9% organic and reinsurance at 6% and retirement at 5% and health at 4% was a really strong start to the
year with momentum. And the data analytics piece, Christa and I described before, obviously, is against a
pre-pandemic quarter with some pressure around travel and events, but that's going to come back very,
very strongly when it does. So we -- macroeconomic conditions hold, we're comfortable with mid-single-
digit or greater.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First, I just had a question on your overall view of the potential accretion from the Willis deal. I think when
you've previously talked publicly, you've assumed no dispositions, and obviously, you're going to have to
do some dispositions. And your $800 million target seems unchanged on expense savings. How do you
think about the overall accretion from the deal? And do you think you'll still be able to hit your previous
assumptions, given that you'll be able to do something with the proceeds from the business dispositions?
Or do you think there's downside to the initial numbers?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Jimmy, what we would say is we're not providing updated guidance at this time. Once we've closed, we'll
certainly look forward to updating it. But what we will say is that the $800 million remains regardless
of remedies. And we would note that when we originally gave the $800 million of guidance on expense
savings, that was on an EPS base that was going to grow. It was pre-pandemic and so the mass,
obviously, $800 million of expenses on a smaller basis is still a very positive outcome. And then the last
thing I'd say is clearly, none of that math assumed any upside in terms of revenue growth and meeting
unmet needs for clients, which is really the entire strategic rationale for the transaction. But Greg, perhaps
you want to talk about this.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Jimmy, to take a step back and think about where we were a little over a year ago, March 2020, as we
announced the combination. We described, by the way, an opportunity that was grounded with the $800
million, as Christa just described, but really was about opportunity, opportunity for clients, opportunity
for colleagues. Obviously, having delivered that opportunity for shareholders. And we described that
literally, if you think about that opportunity, the next 5 years, from our standpoint, from a value creation
standpoint, we think is as strong as we've ever seen anyway in our 10-plus years. And if that includes 10
years of circa almost 1,200 basis points improvement on return invest to capital and close to 1,600 basis
points improvement on free cash flow margin.

So from a real shareholder value standpoint, a year ago, we just -- we're really excited about this. I
would tell you, over the course of the year, having spent time with ours lap and colleagues that conviction
has only grown. And everything you see and we talked about externally, as Christa described very well,
doesn't include how we're thinking about accelerating innovation. And there's a lot that's kind of gone
on as we've begun the integration in terms of how this plays out, that really has been -- it's been really
exciting. I mean, the momentum that's building around us with our colleagues is quite, quite high, and
we're just looking forward to all aspects, clients, colleagues and shareholder impact.

AON PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2021

And then maybe one either for Greg or for Eric. Can you talk about -- it seems like your comments on
pricing are a little bit subdued or less upbeat than some of the underwriters. But what are you seeing in
terms of pricing change in commercial and then reinsurance as well.

Eric Andersen
President

Sure, Greg. Maybe I'll take that. But before I do, if I can make a comment on your earlier question, just
on the excitement around the combination of what we're starting to see maybe a level lower. Certainly,
the teams have been working on integration from a client experience and a revenue standpoint, culture
innovation, all those things. And we're really beginning to see the possibilities. As we go deeper into the
organization around the planning process, whether it's things like on the risk side, the cat modeling and
securitization experience that Aon has the Willis' climate capabilities and their resilient hub and they're
climatized. Those types of things, when you put them together really do provide excitement for our teams
to see what's possible. And so there's a lot of those things that we're identifying as we go through the
process, and it's really building some excitement across both organizations as they really begin to see the
value they can unlock for clients.

And so now maybe to picture question on pricing. I would say this, the dynamic of the pricing, as we say,
it's moderately positive. But it's always -- it's never a straightforward answer, right? And I'll give you some
context as to why. We engage these clients in a couple of steps before you ever get to the marketplace,
right? We do the risk analysis and identification. We work with them on mitigating strategies so that
they don't even transfer the risk, how they can finance it among themselves. And then ultimately, if they
do decide to make the transfer to a third party, they're coming at this marketplace with their own risk
appetite, their own budget capacity, the options in the market. We're using our capability to help them
make the trade offs. But ultimately, each product, there is no marketplace, right? I always get a kick out
of when people talk about the broader market. It's a series of micro markets. Each product has its own
dynamics, own claim trends, terms conditions, retention, claims, supply demand, all of that, whether
you're talking property, D&O, marine, it's a variety of different things. And ultimately, our role in this is
to help clients evaluate how to manage the risk, make the right choices that they make, they can make.
So as we see it, it's moderate, it's moderately positive, as we say. But ultimately, clients make choices in
every market that help them meet their own needs.

Operator

And our next question comes from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. I guess just a quick follow-up on the pending acquisition of Willis Towers Watson.
So there was a question earlier about the $1.8 billion revenue marker in the agreement. To me, this is a
pretty specific number. Can you give any flavor on how this number came to be that, that was the line in
the sand in which we might need to go back and get approvals?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. We step back, again, the shareholder value question was asked and answered as we did in August.
But we would -- I'll come back, Phil, to the opportunity that we see and how it's evolved over time.
What we really want you to take away is the opportunity we saw a year ago is stronger now than we
saw a year ago. By the way, that's not just the work that Eric described and how the teams have come
together and seeing all the possibilities. That's also pandemic. One of the outcomes of pandemic is really
an amplification in both awareness across the globe, literally across every company in the world has a
bigger awareness for things like pandemic, climate, intangible assets, cyber, then more than ever before,
also up into the C-suite in ways that it has a permeated before. So for us, though, we see a tremendous
opportunity. We saw that opportunity as we brought together the discussion on the combination of last
March, and we see it continuing. So from our standpoint, as Christa described at the beginning, we're

making our way through the process. And making good progress, and we're very excited about the
outcome.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Worth a shot. Christa, you had mentioned the expense guidance that you gave, and I appreciate
that. It has some potential resumption in T&E for later this year. I was hoping you could just kind of flush
out what -- how you're thinking about -- without any specifics, just kind of generally how you're thinking
about that, right? If I want to run an actual versus expected of the world opening back up and people
getting back to whatever normal business activities look like moving forward. How can I compare that to
how you were thinking about it?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Phil, I guess I'd start with -- we've got a 10-year track record of margin expansion, approximately
90 basis points for a decade every year. We expect margin expansion for the full year 2021 and we're
obviously not giving specific guidance on margin expansion for 2021. But I'd say, if you look to the rest
of 2021, we should anticipate some investment in the business and some potential of resumption of T&E
later in the year. And that's really all in the context of overall margin expense for 2021. But if you -- but
Greg, do you -- you may want to talk about this is from a client perspective and how we're thinking about
T&E and delivering for clients.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. So it's really an excellent question on sort of how the business evolves. And this idea of new better,
we're not kidding. Actually, it's been amazing. The 10 coalitions we have are literally the major cities
around the world in Chicago, in New York, in London, in Tokyo and Madrid, Singapore, et cetera. These are
the largest companies in the world, really comparing notes on how they come back together work, travel
convene in the process. And we've just taken away a huge amount from that. And in many respects, when
we think about client leadership and how we go engage with clients, obviously, the face-to-face is key and
will continue to be key, but our ability to make a difference with clients in remote environments where
we can actually amplify what it means to be Aon United, literally bringing colleagues around the world.
Obviously, in a virtual way to clients has proven to us to be unbelievably effective on both new business
with existing clients were also net new opportunities. So very, very -- Eric, you led this work around the
world. Maybe you can talk a bit about this because it's very important as you think about T&E overall.

Eric Andersen
President

Yes, sure, Greg. And look, we're going to be smart about how we do T&E in the future as business opens
up in-person meetings. And it's ultimately a positive step in the global recovery that we can interact. And
-- but we've learned a lot, right? As we've said it in the past, and just using that example, Greg, to go a
little bit deeper. Historically, if a client wanted to talk about a situation that was occurring outside their
home country, we would either try into a conference call or plan a trip. Right? And now what we do is we
open up Webex, and we actually have the leader of the country leader of the issue in that country on the
Webex, and we can solve the issue right away. Right? Certainly, there's efficiency and cost advantages to
it. But more importantly, I think there's enormous client value to unlock that expertise in an immediate
way where they're not getting an interpretation through someone else. They're talking right to the source.
And getting that value in real time. So I mean, ultimately, we're going to use what we've learned, and
we're going to meet the clients where they want to be met. But I think we've learned a lot and we're going
to apply it.

AON PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2021

One of the things that were just final points I'd add on that, Phil, because it's really -- it's important to us
because we've really worked it for a decade. Obviously, anybody can open up Webex as Eric described and
put faces on there. But when you actually put colleagues around the world from different solution lines
together, and it's clear to the client that they know each other. They're reacting to different situations.
They're supporting each other. That's nonduplicatable, right? That's taken us a decade to work through.
And so it turns out the 10 paces on the screen amplifies what it means to work Aon United together as
one firm. And that what clients see, they commented to us, which is, wow, I didn't really understand
what this meant before. And by the only way they could have seen it is, as Eric -- as Eric described,
we put 10 people in the conference room, which we're never going to do. But 10 on Webex totally
interacting on behalf of clients, really addressing their issues, that is pretty cool. The example I gave on
the commentary upfront around the the vaccine protection was exactly that. It was a group of people
together that probably wouldn't have gone together in the same way before. So we just want you to -- we
don't understand how we're thinking about our business as T&E comes back, but it's much, much broader
than that.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. I'll take a swing at one more. When I look at the -- what I would call the underlying expenses, that's
revenue less adjusted operating income in the first quarter. Is there anything abnormal in the growth rate
or anything that you'd call out that makes the growth rate we saw first quarter '21 versus first quarter '20,
not a good way to think about this?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

So if you're talking about expenses, though, what I'd note in expenses is in 2021, you have a lot less
T&E and you have a lot less investment in the business compared to Q1 2020. So the margin expansion
is much more pronounced in Q1 than you might get in the full year. We do expect full year margin
expansion. And then we did see an increase in comp and benefits due to FX but also due to investment in
the business. And so I guess they're probably the 2 unusual things I'd sort of note in Q1.

Operator

And our next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I wanted to just talk about the strong level of organic growth this quarter. So I guess I was just
wondering, is there anything one-off in this result this quarter? And just as I think about the rest of the
year. Is there any reason why we shouldn't expect an acceleration in organic growth from these levels?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

As we described, David, listen, our view is great momentum as we begin the year, no doubt. First quarter,
strong across the board on all aspects with some real standouts. And we see as macroeconomic conditions
evolve mid-single-digit or greater as we think about where we are for the year. And obviously, the first
quarter gave us real confidence growing confidence in that, assuming macroeconomic conditions hold.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And nothing one-off in that result, that would lead you to think that we should come down off the
6. Okay. That's helpful.

AON PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2021

Yes. It was really -- it was across the board in terms of sort of all the different aspects, commercial risk,
reinsurance, retirement, health across the board with real great work by the teams around the world on
new business growth and growth in project-related work, which came back a bit. Particularly in some of
the solution lines.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe just on the combination with Willis. Christa, I think you had said something to the
effect that you would expect to achieve the $800 million of cost synergies in any level of concessions. But
I guess I just wanted to sort of dig into that is like maybe just talk about, is there a level that would make
that tough to achieve and just sort of maybe just sort of peel back the onion a little bit on just what gives
you confidence that you can get to that $800 million of saves?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So David, we continue to anticipate $800 million of cost synergies, considering the remedies we've
offered. And we'd expect to allocate any divestiture proceeds according to our ROIC framework in which
share buyback continues to be our highest expected return activity. I would note that the $800 million of
cost synergies, we're very confident in achieving. It's 5.5% of the combined cost base. And we achieved
11% of the combined cost base at Aon Hewett and 18% of the combined cost base in Aon Benfield, and
there's no structural differences here. And so we feel really good about achieving that $800 million.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Helpful. That's clear. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in. Just on the margin, you
guys obviously -- I appreciate the slide you guys put in the deck. You guys have expanded margins by 90
basis points a year over the last decade, you did 170 basis points in the first quarter. Obviously, you need
comps there. And I know that you guide for the full year. But I guess, is there any reason to expect that
margin shouldn't expand here over the next 3 quarters?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

So first of all, David, we absolutely expect full year margin expansion for the year 2021. And we think
about margin expansion in the context of full year because quarter-to-quarter expenses will be lumpy.
As we sort of talked about with the repatterning of expenses. But what we would say is Q1 was unusual
in terms of margin expansion because we had a pre-pandemic comparable in Q1 2020. And so I'd think
about margin expansion over the course of the full year 2021. And as you said, we had a 10-year track
record of 890 basis points of margin expansion over the last 10 years, so 90 basis points a year. And we're
on track to do full year margin expansion again in 2021.

Operator

And our final question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I guess the beginning basic question, you talked a little bit about the blockchain for premium and
Clearinghouse. How should we expect to see that in the financials? That will be numbers, but where does
that make a difference?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, it really makes a difference in terms of margin expansion. It's driving improved quality and
therefore, reduced errors. And it's driving efficiency because it's allowing colleagues to spend more time

14

AON PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2021

on higher-value activities with their clients. So it's both reduced errors and improved efficiency. And then
utilizing client experience. But I mean, my -- the simple answer is operating margin expansion.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. No, that's perfect. I think that's what I was looking for. Second question, you never, I think,
disclosed a number of the expected revenue synergies from the innovation. I know it's the $800 million
savings guidance is still there. Is the internal number for revenues still the same?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Well, as we said before, we didn't disclose prior as you described. But the entire reason, we are bringing
the combination together really goes back to this idea of we've got to accelerate. We've got to find ways to
accelerate innovation on the plants. Continue to do what we're doing, but just keep getting better on their
behalf. And Meyer, it's not hard to find the categories where we can continue to improve and support. Look
at issues like pandemic, obviously, but how are we going to bring solutions that really matter for clients in
climate? And as they think about taking actions to go 0 carbon. How do we help them reduce volatility in
doing that?

We had a set of views back in March 2020 on that. And Eric, I think described it very well. As we spent
time with our colleague at Willis Towers Watson, we see more potential and possibilities than ever and
pandemic happened. So clients are actually more tuned, they're like, what am I going to do on this? And
how am I going to play it out? Things like intangible assets, we've made great progress on intangible
assets and how you think about defending the house on intangible assets, but not a bit stars lots and the
opportunity, we believe, is even greater, areas like cyber, et cetera. So we are -- we were excited in 2020
around the possibilities on what we can do to drive innovation, which is, in fact, net new opportunity for
clients and for colleagues, but also revenue. And we see that opportunity greater now than we saw it a
year ago.

Operator

Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Thank you, Britney. I just wanted to say to everyone, thank you very much for joining this quarter. We
appreciate it, and very much look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks so much.
