Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intuitive Surgical Q1 2020 Earnings
Release. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Calvin Darling, Senior Director of Finance, Investor
Relations for Intuitive Surgical. Please go ahead.

Calvin Darling
Senior Director of IR

Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuitive's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me
today, we have Gary Guthart, our CEO; and Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today's call may be deemed to
contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied
as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are described in detail in our
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our most recent Form 10-K filed on February 7,
2020. Our SEC filings can be found through our website or at the SEC's website. Investors are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

Please note that this conference call will be available for audio replay on our website at intuitive.com on
the Latest Events section under our Investor Relations page.

Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. In
addition, this quarter, we have also posted charts illustrating da Vinci procedure trends in Q1, which are
intended to provide additional perspective and detail regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business.

Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our first quarter results as described in our
press release announced earlier today followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the
quarter's business and operational highlights; Marshall will provide a review of our financial results; then I
will discuss procedure details; and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.

With that, I will turn it over to Gary.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2020 performance reflects the rise of COVID-19 and the
global response to it. On this call, we'll describe our experience in the quarter, our framework for engaging
those who rely on us and our priorities and actions in these challenging times. Our focus now and in the
past is the safety and well-being of patients, care teams, our communities and our employees.

For the first 2.5 months of the quarter, procedure performance was at the high end of our expectations,
with procedure trends consistent with the prior quarters. General surgery in the United States was strong
as was urology outside the United States.

As we disclosed previously, recommendations by surgical societies and health care organizations to delay
certain surgeries to conserve resources for COVID care are having a material impact on surgery broadly,
including robotic-assisted surgery. We support government and hospital policies to direct resources to
COVID care and recognize these policies vary greatly by region and by hospital system. We are analyzing
customer procedure deferrals in response to COVID.

Patients undergoing da Vinci procedures do so in response to an underlying disease. While these
procedures may be delayed in the short term, without treatment of some sort, the disease and its
impairment persists and often worsens. Said simply, the vast majority of these patients will ultimately
seek treatment. We are analyzing both the clinical drivers of return to treatment and customer plans

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

and processes to recover. The categories of benign disease and cancer are not entirely predictive of
the urgency of surgical intervention. Clearly, aggressive cancers require treatment and are delayed at
significant risk to patients. Likewise, some benign conditions require timely intervention as well. We're
working internally and with customers to understand their needs to restart surgery for those patients
whose condition requires action.

The effect of COVID on the surgical market has impacted different regions differently. Starting with China,
procedure performance was impacted by COVID earliest, with sharp declines in surgery as resources were
diverted to respond to COVID care. Procedures in China have been recovering steadily since that time.
However, steep declines in procedures that can be deferred are occurring in other regions, particularly
Europe and the United States.

For the quarter, procedures grew 10% over Q1 of 2019. Given early strength followed by sharp declines in
the last 2 weeks of the quarter, I refer you to the materials we posted to our website prior to this call to
get a better picture of the dynamics in Q1.

With regard to systems, our total number of placements for the quarter was below our expectations in
spite of having strong capital performance in the first 2 months of the quarter. In March, rapid changes
by hospitals delayed some system placements and are likely to significantly impact system contracts and
placements in future quarters.

Financial pressures exerted on hospitals in response to treating COVID patients and deferring other care
are likely to be significant and are unlikely to resolve quickly. Marshall and Calvin will take you through
procedure and capital dynamics in the quarter in greater detail later in the call.

To help articulate our priorities and actions during this period of change, we have adopted the phased
framework described in the American Enterprise Institute's national coronavirus response. In Phase I,
which is the slow the spread phase of coronavirus response, Intuitive's priorities are as follows: First,
we are focused on the health and safety of all those we serve, our customers, our communities, our
employees and our suppliers, implementing early and continuous updates to our health and safety policies
and processes. Second, we are supporting our customers according to their priorities: clinical, operational
and economic. Third, we're focused on continuity of supply by working with our suppliers and distributors.
To date, our delivery capability and inventory position are on firm footing. Fourth, we are securing our
workforce economically. We have built an outstanding team over the years, and we believe their strength
will be essential in the recovery that follows. Fifth, in partnership with our Intuitive Foundation, we
are contributing material, product and volunteers to the front lines of COVID support. We've designed,
produced and delivered PPE to local hospitals, and our staff have volunteered in several communities. And
sixth, we are eliminating avoidable spend during the stop the spread phase of the virus.

The current situation in hospitals responding to viral care is fluid, and the depth and duration of this
disruption is difficult to predict. New issues are arising with respect to surgery that will require mitigation
and time. Some hospital customers and some of our suppliers will experience significant financial stress in
this period. Regulatory agency priorities and resources are shifting globally as they devote their resources
to infectious disease detection and treatment needs.

And lastly, surgeons are being dedicated to frontline COVID work or are being idled by a lack of resources
in this period. We are adjusting quickly to the issues described, and we're confident in both the need
for surgery and in our products as the response to COVID evolves. We're planning for Phase II to return
to surgery for those patients who cannot wait. Those countries that have been managing the disease
the longest have returned to da Vinci surgery steadily over time or have been able to maintain da Vinci
surgery concurrently with COVID care. We are analyzing the order in which different procedures are likely
to return and the strategies likely to be employed by hospital systems to manage surgical practices while
still providing COVID care. For example, some health systems are dedicating specific sites to COVID care
while operating rooms for outpatient surgeries are dedicated in other locations. We will support customers
closely as they bring capabilities back online.

We're also adapting our training and Intuitive telepresence capabilities to support team training and skills
retention in a Phase II world. We're optimizing our R&D facilities and methods to allow us to progress on

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

important innovation programs while employing up-to-date workplace safety guidelines. Lastly, we look
forward to accelerating clinical trial activities and the associated regulatory work as trial sites increase
their surgical volume.

In constructing our financial plans in the current environment, we're balancing 5 objectives that reflect
our priorities mentioned above. They are, first, customer-focused economic policies that meet their needs
during this disruption; second, employee policies that secure our valuable workforce needed for hospital
recovery and to drive our innovation; third, securing and stabilizing critical supply chain resources; fourth,
eliminating spending that is not effective during this period, for example, pausing, hiring and volume-
related roles and spend on projects that cannot progress in the current phase; and finally, shareholder
policies that don't interfere with the priorities mentioned above.

We remain in close contact with our customers, our community representatives, our employees and our
suppliers during this period. While the depth and duration of the current challenges are difficult to predict,
the need for both COVID and non-COVID care is clear. Given time and resources, health systems have
continued to choose da Vinci. The collaborations and solutions orientation among our stakeholders is
clear and inspiring. I believe our long-term opportunity is substantial and our business is well positioned
financially and organizationally to weather this COVID outbreak.

I'll now turn the call over to Marshall, who will take you through financial matters in greater detail.

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will
also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro
forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.

Procedures and shipments are consistent with our preliminary press release of April 8. Key business
metrics for the first quarter were as follows: First quarter 2020 procedures increased approximately 10%
compared with the first quarter of 2019 and decreased approximately 9% compared with last quarter.
Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide. Calvin will
review details of procedure growth later in this call.

First quarter system placements of 237 systems increased 1% compared with 235 systems last year and
decreased 29% compared with 336 systems last quarter. We expanded our installed base of da Vinci
Systems by 11% to approximately 5,669 systems. This growth rate compares with 12% in the last quarter
and 13% last year. Utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, declined
approximately 2% compared with 6% growth last quarter and 5% growth last year.

Let me walk through the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on procedures and system placements and
how it varied by market. Prior to the spread of COVID-19, we experienced procedure growth trends
consistent with those experienced in the fourth quarter, including strength in general surgery, growth in
mature procedures in the U.S. and growth in U.S. -- OUS urology. We also saw early strength in capital
placements particularly in the U.S., with over half the systems placed in the quarter being arrangements
where the sales cycle was mostly completed in the fourth quarter.

Beginning in January, we saw a substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures in China. And by early
February, procedures per week in China had declined by 90% compared with the weekly rates experienced
in early January. As the COVID-19 subsided in China in March, da Vinci procedures began to recover. And
by the end of the quarter, China procedures per week were approximately 70% of the early January rate.

We saw varied impacts on da Vinci procedures in some other early countries affected by COVID-19.
COVID-19 had little impact in Korea and Japan in the quarter and severe impact in Italy.

In summary, the COVID-19 disruption to da Vinci procedures varied by country, and the disruption to
worldwide da Vinci procedures was not significant through the middle of March.

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

As the pandemic spread to Western Europe and to the U.S., we experienced a significant decline in
da Vinci procedures in the last half of March. Procedures per week in the U.S., which represented
approximately 70% of our procedures in 2019, declined approximately 65% relative to earlier in the
quarter. Procedures in France, Germany and the U.K. also declined but to a lesser extent than the U.S.
We have provided you with supplemental information on our website to enable you to understand the
magnitude of the impacts on procedures and the variation between countries.

As I indicated, most of the sales cycle for approximately half of the system placements in the quarter
were completed in the fourth quarter. As we progress through the quarter and the impact of the pandemic
progressed, customers deferred decisions to purchase or lease systems into future quarters and, in some
cases, indefinitely.

The depth and extent to which COVID-19 will impact the individual markets will vary based on the
availability of testing capabilities, PPE, ICUs and ORs, medical staff and government interventions. As
COVID-19 continues to spread, it is likely that da Vinci procedures will decline from those experienced
in the first quarter. In addition, we would expect that system placements will follow the decline in
procedures. While some markets like China appear to be recovering, it is possible that a recurrence of
COVID-19 will negatively impact da Vinci procedures and not all markets will recover at the same pace.

Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Utilization of the installed base declined by 2%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on procedures coupled
with the fourth quarter system placement strength. When procedures increase, customers will first look
to utilize existing da Vinci capacity, which is likely to depress capital placements. First quarter placements
included a higher concentration of multiple system arrangements with hospitals and IDNs seeking to
standardize on fourth-generation systems. Many of these replacements were completed as capital leases.
As a result, first quarter trade-ins were higher and operating leases were lower as a percentage of total
placements than in the fourth quarter of 2019. We would anticipate in an environment of COVID-19, as
economic pressures increase, more customers will seek leasing or alternative financing arrangements
than purchases. Trade-in activity can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. However, given the impacts of
COVID-19, we expect the number of trade-ins to decrease.

We recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the first quarter compared with $34 million last
quarter and $12 million last year. There were no returns of da Vinci systems for leases that ended in the
quarter. Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter-to-quarter and will likely continue to
do so.

Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure grew to just over $2,000 per procedure compared with
$1,980 in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting instruments and accessory purchases prior to the decline
in procedures. We expect that as hospitals adjust inventory levels for lower surgery volumes instrument
and accessory revenue will decrease.

Three of the systems placed in the first quarter were SP systems, reflecting both our measured rollout of
SP and the impact of COVID-19. Our rollout of SP Surgical System will continue to be measured, putting
systems in the hands of experienced da Vinci users while we pursue additional indications and optimize
training pathways in our supply chain. Given the impact of COVID-19, our ability to perform a clinical trial
associated with an SP colorectal procedure is likely delayed.

We placed 8 Ion systems in the quarter. Ion system placements were also impacted by COVID-19.
Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately.
Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be
reported separately when they become material. Our rollout of Ion will continue to be measured while we
optimize training pathways in our supply chain. The completion of the precise study will be delayed due to
COVID-19. We cannot predict when the precise clinical study will be completed.

Outside the U.S., we placed 55 systems in the first quarter compared with 81 in the first quarter of 2019
and 140 systems last quarter. Current quarter system placements included 25 in Europe, 10 into Japan
and 9 into China compared with 49 into Europe, 13 into Japan and 3 into China in the first quarter of
2019.

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Pro forma gross margin for the first quarter was
69.7% compared with 71.2% for the first quarter of 2019, and 72.2% last quarter. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2019 and last quarter primarily reflects product mix, higher fixed costs
on lower production and costs associated with Si product transitions partially offset by cost reductions. As
revenues are pressured by COVID-19, we will reduce production levels, which will result in higher labor
costs and underabsorbed overhead and a significant reduction of product margin.

Pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with the first quarter of 2019 and decreased 8%
compared with last quarter. Spending in the first quarter reflected normal business activities into March
and then curtailment of costs associated with the impact of COVID-19.

While certain spending will decrease in the second quarter as a result of the reduction in revenue and
activities limited by the pandemic, much of our spending will continue. Major categories of spending
and likely trends for the second quarter are as follows: We will continue to support our customers. We
will continue to invest in innovation focused on the Quadruple Aim. We will invest in manufacturing in
our supply chain to ensure supply for our customers. We will ensure we are prepared for periods when
the spread of COVID-19 is contained. Certain costs will decline as underlying activities are restricted
by COVID-19, including travel and related expenses, clinical trials, surgeon training and customer data
collection. We will eliminate spending that is ineffective due to COVID-19, like surgeon and hospital
events. We are pausing the hiring of volume-related roles like sales reps and manufacturing employees.
We continue to believe that we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer-aided
surgery and acute interventions around the world and will continue to invest in the business for the long
term.

Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20% compared with our expectations of 20%
to 21%, reflecting geographic mix. Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in geographic mix of
income, changes in taxation made by local authorities and with the impact of onetime items.

Our first quarter 2020 pro forma net income was $323 million or $2.69 per share compared with $312
million or $2.61 per share for the first quarter of 2019 and $417 million or $3.48 per share for last quarter.

I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $314 million or $2.62 per share for the
fourth -- first quarter of 2020 compared with GAAP net income of $307 million or $2.56 per share for the
first quarter of 2019 and GAAP net income of $358 million or $2.99 per share for last quarter.

The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and qualified -- or quantified in
our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-
based compensation and IP charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related items and legal
settlements.

We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $5.9 billion compared with $5.8 billion at December
31, 2019. Cash generated from operations was partially offset by stock repurchases and investments in
working capital in our infrastructure. We repurchased approximately 192,000 shares for $100 million at an
average price of $522 per share.

Our current thoughts on capital deployment are in the following order: We recognize the hardship that
COVID-19 places on our customers, and we'll work with customers to ease the burden of lower device
utilization, including providing customers with more flexible financing. We will work to secure a supply
chain and build appropriate levels of inventory to ensure customer supply, particularly as procedures
resume. We will invest in securing our employees. We will continue to -- our open market repurchase
program consistent with our prior practice.

And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Calvin, who will go over procedure performance.

Calvin Darling
Senior Director of IR

Thank you, Marshall. Our overall first quarter procedure growth was approximately 10% compared to 18%
during the first quarter of 2019 and 19% last quarter. Our Q1 procedure growth was driven by 9% growth

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

in U.S. procedures and 11% growth in OUS markets. Our lower first quarter 2020 procedure growth rates
were a direct result of hospitals reallocating resources to meet the increasing demands of managing
COVID-19. Hospitals postponed deferrable surgical procedures to make more resources available to treat
COVID-19 patients.

Impact to da Vinci procedure volumes were first felt in China in January and moved to other OUS markets
as the quarter progressed. As of mid-March, our overall procedures were trending towards the higher end
of our expectations, including the benefit of an extra working day in Q1 2020. At this stage of the quarter,
the impacts of COVID-19 in the earlier-impacted countries were offset by strength in U.S. general surgery
and mature procedures.

Beginning in mid-March, we saw significant declines in procedure volume in the U.S. and Western Europe.
On a worldwide basis, weekly procedures performed exiting Q1 were approximately 50% lower than
the run rate through mid-March. In the U.S., weekly procedures exiting the quarter were approximately
65% below the run rate through mid-March. Procedure categories realizing significant declines were
hernia repair, benign gynecology and bariatric procedures. Lesser-impacted procedures were thoracic and
colorectal surgeries.

Outside of the United States, weekly procedures exiting the quarter were approximately 25% below
the run rate through mid-March. The lower OUS decline primarily reflects procedure volume recoveries
in China offset by broad declines in Western Europe. In Q1, procedures in Japan were less affected by
COVID-19. Growth in Japan procedures continued at a growth rate over 40%. We provide these data
points to inform investors of the procedure dynamics experienced during the first quarter, which were
unprecedented.

Due to the uncertain scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertain timing of global
recovery and economic normalization, we withdrew our financial and procedure guidance on April 8, and
these Q1 procedure results aren't necessarily indicative of any forward-looking trend.
That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

We can.

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

We can.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Can you hear me now?

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Sorry about that. I'm not sure what happened. So Gary, I just want to talk about capital cycle a
little bit. I mean, I know we're not going to get specifics on 2020. But if I think about the 2008 financial
crisis, the strain in hospitals is certainly different today than it was back in 2008, and your business
model, frankly, is very different today than it was back in 2008. How would you compare and contrast sort
of the impact on your business through COVID '19 relative to what we saw in the last major financial crisis
impacting hospitals? And then I have a quick follow-up.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you. I'd start with I think they are apples and oranges from underlying costs. So clearly, this
is health care related and policy-driven in terms of deferrals, as a result, a little bit hard to predict how
the capital cycle will recover. You had mentioned, and it's true, we have a lot more flexible approaches
that are available to us with regard to making systems available. Marshall mentioned in his script, they'll
consume existing capacity first as they go.

We've been in contact with our customers routinely. There's a backlog growing for surgery. These folks are
going to need surgery. And really, our opportunity, our job as a company is to make sure we can support
them however we can in terms of access to systems or motion of systems to allow them to use what they
have out there. And as those systems become full again, we can think about how to increase capacity
going forward, and we have a few tools in the toolkit.

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Marshall, anything you'd like to add?

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

No, I think you hit it. I think you'll see more financing, more leases and alternative financing
arrangements.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That made perfect sense to me. Just a quick follow-up on capital, Marshall, for you. You talked
about in your script a couple of things, but you talked about certain orders that are being delayed or
canceled versus sort of pushed indefinitely. Can you give us any sense from a percentage perspective
what percent of the order book was, in your mind, delayed versus sort of what was either canceled or
indefinitely delayed?

And then you just mentioned lease rate. You've been hovering around the 40% level. Is there reason to
assume we should see a more material step-up in the lease rate? You said it would fluctuate as it has
normally, but in my view would be that lease rate could hike up more materially now because you're
incentivized to provide flexible financing for hospitals to get these systems in. So any color there would be
very helpful, and I'll jump back in queue.

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. For leasing, yes, the -- in the quarter, what happened, we had a number of customers that had
started the sales cycle back in Q4 and were interested in standardizing on fourth-generation systems. And
it so happens that a number of those customers wanted to do -- wanted to structure the arrangement
such that they were purchases, they were accounted for as purchases. And as a result, we had fewer
leases this quarter. So I don't think this quarter is indicative of our normal sort of run rate for leases as
a result. Leasing going forward probably is more akin to what we were experiencing more in the 38%
range. That's under normal circumstances. And I actually believe given the COVID virus and its impacts
that it will increase from there. So -- and it's -- but it's hard to predict depending on the customer and the
circumstances.

As far as how many customers may have postponed indefinitely or may have postponed a quarter. The
conversations with them are always a little bit, "Hey, we're going to postpone," and then they sort of
throw in words about maybe another quarter, maybe another couple of quarters. And some say, "Well,
we'll get back to it, but we don't have a specific timetable." And for those that say that they don't have
a specific timetable, that's what I'm referring to as indefinitely. I don't think that there are customers
running from robotic surgery. I think they actually want to do robotic surgery, and I think that they'll come
back sometime when COVID virus is handled and the procedures come back.

Operator

The next question will come from Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Sure. I want to thank you for the incremental data that you provided this quarter on the trends
throughout the quarter by geography. That was very helpful to see.

And so my first question is really on the chart on China. We're showing a pretty nice recovery from trough
to where you are right now. I was wondering if you could just walk through your views on how good a
proxy China might be for a U.S. recovery. Like, why or why not? How could that be different? Just your
general thoughts on that would be great.

President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Bob. Yes, you see in that chart China. You see other countries as well, Japan and so on. And
what you can really see is that country policy changes the shape. I think we're encouraged by a couple of
things. One is people's interest -- our customers' interest in using da Vinci is durable. That's been great.

You had asked a specific question of how predictive is China. And I think the answer there is too soon to
tell for the rest of the regions. I'm encouraged by it. I think it indicates the durability of demand. Having
said that, I think policy matters, and I think how people allocate their health care resources are going to
change, too. You can see in Japan already that the progress of their approach to disease is evolving, and
what that looks like on procedures will evolve. So stay tuned is the short answer.

Calvin, anything you'd like to add?

Calvin Darling
Senior Director of IR

No, I think that described it pretty well.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. Yes, just maybe a comment on why Japan has been so resilient.
And then you did mention in the prepared remarks something about -- I think I missed it -- on one of the
clinical trials that's been delayed. I was wondering if you could just highlight or reiterate exactly what you
were communicating there.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Okay. On the Japan side, I think that their -- in general, their system for managing the coronavirus is
a little bit different than we've seen in other countries, and it's evolving in time. So to date, hospital
operations were relatively lightly impacted as it relates to surgery relative to other countries. What that
will look like in the future, I don't know. We'll see how that evolves. It's been interesting and instructive
for us to look at data from Japan, look at data from Korea, from China, from Europe, Germany, Italy, U.K.,
France, and that informs us going forward in terms of getting prepared for the reopening of some of those
hospital wings and surgical wings as they happen. So too soon to make the final call, but we have, I think,
pretty good real-time information.

I'm going to refer to Marshall the question about clinical trial.

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

The clinical trial, what I was referring to was SP. We planned on doing a -- we believe we have to do a
clinical trial to get the next indication, which is colorectal. Doing a clinical trial when -- at this point in
time is probably not going to happen right away. Having said that, I don't think we had plans to do it right
away. We had several steps we had to go through before we got there. So I say it's delayed -- could be
delayed and don't know exactly when it will get done.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Calvin, you had more to add.

Calvin Darling
Senior Director of IR

Yes. And on the Ion side as well, data capture for the Ion PRECISE study that we've talked about on these
calls is currently delayed. We believe that positive clinical data will be an important catalyst for broader

usage of the platform. But given the lack of visibility, we're not in a position to provide a definitive revised
time line, but it's unlikely that the PRECISE study will read out this year.

But you look at the new platforms, both Ion and SP are both in the measured rollout phases of market
introduction, and early-stage utilization rates for both platforms has been encouraging. Ion commercial
procedure rates were up over 110% from Q4 of '19 to Q1 of 2020. SP procedure rates grew 14% from
the fourth quarter, and they're up about 190% year-over-year. So yes, really encouraging in these early
phases. In Korea, specifically, where we have a broad clearance for SP, the utilization per system is at this
point in time higher than it is for Xi.

Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about procedure mix, the types of procedures that
may come back a little bit faster versus others. Presumably, low-score price state cases may lag and
nonemergent hernias may lag. But I'm just curious, even based on your experience in China in terms of
the procedures that came back a little bit faster, if you could comment on that at all.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Just as a broad brush, clearly, high-risk cancers are things delayed at real risk to patients and
emergent or inflamed benign disease likewise. One caution, each country has a little bit different mix of
procedures going into 2020 prior to COVID becoming a bigger issue. So the mixes are a little bit different.

Calvin, why don't you speak a little bit to what we've seen today?

Calvin Darling
Senior Director of IR

Oh yes. And again, procedures, it's really they're following a continuum of urgency that are applied
situationally. Like you say, clearly, the aggressive cancers require treatment and are delayed at significant
risk of patients. And likewise, some benign conditions require timely intervention as well. We're working
with customers to best understand the segments and our future plans and elaborate thing -- we'll
elaborate further as the things progress.

I've mentioned in the prepared comments the -- at least in the ending parts of the first quarter, the more
impacted procedures were things like hernia repair, benign gynecology and bariatrics with lesser impacts
on things like thoracic procedures and colorectal procedures.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

On my just personal channel checks, hospitals are now creating large backlogs of patients who are going
to need surgery. And there's -- I'm encouraged about their commitment to da Vinci as they go through
that. So I think at some point, the logistics, the availability of PPE and other resources will start to free up
a little bit. And as they have time, then they'll have to attend to that group of patients, and we'll be there
to support.

Tycho W. Peterson
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then maybe a follow-up on capital comments. I appreciate the nature and the tone of the discussions
may shift more toward alternative financing. But can you just talk maybe to the degree to which hospitals
are actually engaging in capital discussions at this point as opposed to still dealing with COVID work? And
also curious on your thoughts on Europe just given capital outlook there.

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

Like I said in prepared remarks, capital demand, we saw a deferral of purchase decisions at the end of the
quarter. I would expect that to continue. I would expect that -- also that hospitals as COVID -- as they are
able to dedicate resources to the procedures that may be in backlog that they'll use up existing capacity,
and therefore, it won't immediately result in capital demand. We still have conversations with some of the
hospitals on capital. It's just not possible to predict exactly where it's going to come out for the quarter.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

With regard to Europe, any color you want to give, Marshall?

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

Europe. Europe, we didn't see quite the same level of reduction in terms of procedures at the end of the
quarter. That's not -- that doesn't mean to say that, that will sustain itself. It's possible that as the virus
spreads that there could be additional pressures on procedures.

And having said that, capital, as you know, we did 25 systems this quarter in -- which is what I reported in
my prepared remarks. That's far lower than what we had anticipated for the quarter. And so we're still --
we're seeing the same kinds of interactions with customers in Europe as we are in U.S.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Tycho, you've heard us say this before, and it's really true in the data this quarter as well. Europe doesn't
act as one. So what's happening in Italy feels and looks different than in Germany from our perspective,
from France and from the U.K. So each will progress a little bit -- on a little bit different pathway.

Operator

Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

One on procedures, one just on systems. On procedures, I appreciate the numbers, the percentages you
provided us. I think those were exit rates from March, and the slides look like those percentages continue
to go down. So I apologize if I missed this, but did -- would you be willing to provide any color on what
you've seen in the first couple of weeks here in April, just to give us a better sense to how to think about
Q2? And I did have one follow-up.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

We're not ready to publish what's happened thus far in April. I don't think it's shockingly different from
what the beginnings of you're seeing -- of what you're seeing in the charts we've given you there. But I'd
also say that I don't think the next 2 weeks are particularly predictive of anything. I think this will flow
globally here over the next weeks and months, and we're really focused on how to make sure that we're
supporting our customers well and flow out of it.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And Gary, thinking ahead, hospitals are going to be faced with 2 challenges: I think one is capacity
constraints to handle postponed procedures; and second, moving procedures to alternative sites. I think
you mentioned in your prepared remarks like ASCs, potentially, to isolate non-COVID patients or vice
versa. What can you do to help hospitals with these 2 challenges?

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, I appreciate it. Well, a couple of things. We are well represented in outpatient departments and
hospitals already. We are absolutely able and willing to move systems to locations of care wherever they
might be. We do have experience with systems and ASCs to the extent that people want to move into ASC
environments. We work fine in those environments.

We will be working on getting training and other resources geographically positioned where we think that
folks can need additional support as they start to ramp up, recognizing that we don't think a lot of people
will be jumping on planes in Phase II. So we can sort of forward deploy our resources to help people as
they get ready.

And lastly, it's staying in touch with our customers and surgery departments and making sure that we
have inventory forward deployed for them for the kind of procedures they want to do.

Operator

Our next question will come from Rick Wise, Stifel.

Frederick Allen Wise
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Gary, Marshall, a couple of things. Maybe let's start with thinking about the slowdown in capital you've
talked about and obviously related procedure decline. And I know I'm looking ahead -- far ahead and
you're not comfortable really predicting the next quarter. But I just want to think about the recovery. Gary,
how do we think about, let's say, if the slowdown in capital persists throughout 2020 or well into 2020,
does that suggest that 2020 recovery won't be back to, let's say, 2019 levels and it's going to -- it would
take probably possibly until 2022 for us to see you get back at sort of a historical growth because of that
slowdown in capital, which might be slower to recover and, therefore, procedure is slower to accelerate
overall, if you follow what I'm trying to get at?

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

No, I think the way I'd have you think about it is from the point of view of demand for surgery -- demand
for robotic-assisted surgery. In that setting, I think the world is queuing up a set of patients who will need
care. Makes sense. I understand it. I think conserving of PPE and ICUs and other valuable resources at
this time makes sense. As some of those constraints start to loosen, I think everybody will have to adjust
and adapt to caring for patients who have other conditions. That is the demand that will drive everything
behind it, from I&A and other inventory to access to capital and systems.

We are well positioned from an inventory point of view. We are well positioned operationally and financially
to move systems where they need to go, to put systems out on lease or usage-based models or other
things to support customers the way they want to be supported, and we'll be quite agile.

So on the capital side, you may see shifts in the way capital is deployed and the way that we're
compensated for that capital relative to prior quarters sort of historical norms. But we'll be leaning
forward to help people when they need that help. How fast that happens, I think that has a lot to do with
government policy and health system policy, is to when they pivot to go treat other patients. That will
determine everything else.

Frederick Allen Wise
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Got you. And just a sort of a separate but related question, Gary. Several of our ongoing physician
conversations sort of suggests that as things recover, actually, robotic capacity won't be sufficient to
meet demand, which is an interesting thought. And they've suggested actually that on a recovery, robotic
surgery will lose market share, so to speak, of some of those deferred patients to laparoscopic surgery,

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

to open surgery. I have no idea. I'd be curious to know if you have any high-level thoughts about that --
those physician comments.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Rick. It's possible. I think that folks rotating into open surgery patients who are great
candidates for MIS is doing that set of patients a disservice. So we will see. That may happen, hard for us
to control.

With regard to capacity for robotics, remember, there are a lot of robots out there, and they are right
now underutilized. As that flows back, we can help. Will some folks want to use lap? Maybe. From the
point of view of surgeon preference, surgeon comfort, what their choices are, just remember, surgeons
are intentional about the method of surgery they choose. They don't accidentally fall into robotic surgery
training. They make those commitments and time investments for a reason, and they have a preference.
So if we can fulfill their preference, great. That will be great. If we're unable to do so and they choose lap
because they couldn't get access where they wanted, well, that may happen. But that's really, I think,
Intuitive's job to make those systems available to them if they would like to use them.

Operator

Our next question will come from Larry Keusch, Raymond James.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I guess, Gary, to start with, just curious, thinking about R&D. What changes are you making to allow the
innovation engine to not stall out here? I'm just curious how you're accomplishing that and what sort of
processes, procedures you're putting in place.

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Yes, thank you. First thing has been to employ the -- to ensure to protect the safety of our staff and
those who supply us while we do our R&D. So step 1 has been to stay up-to-date on the latest employee
work safety methods. We started our incident response team relatively early. We were up and running
at full speed in terms of our incident response team in early January. And so they started looking at best
practice, relaying out our on-site facilities as they need to be relayed out, enabling work from home
where we can. We were pretty capable at remote work capabilities just given the distributed nature of our
campuses. So it's really flexing in that regard. And then we've put in place a robust process for allowing
on-site work where we think it can't be done otherwise for training our staff and staying with it. And so
we've done that. Of course, there's a loss of efficiency as you go through this. And so there's no doubt
that in the first weeks of this, you start to slow down.

And then we're fighting hard to recover. Team attitudes have been fantastic. The agility and creativity of
teams to get the work done, their willingness and desire to do so has been really encouraging. So, so far,
so good.

Some things will go slower. To the extent that we have clinical trials out there and those are being
conducted in hospitals that are being impacted by COVID, those things will slow down. The principal
investigators in those places are highly committed, first, to patient care and then, as a second priority, to
doing the research they'd like to do. And so that will come back as time permits for them to do so.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay, terrific. And then I guess the other question is, you guys are obviously having a lot of conversations
with surgeons, with hospitals. I'm just sort of curious if you can comment on what you are hearing relative
to maybe some of the bigger geographies in Europe or in the U.S. when they may be able to start to
get some of these surgeries going. As you guys have indicated multiple times on this call, there is a

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

continuum, and there are procedures that can be deferred but not for potentially long periods of time. So
I'm just curious. I know it's a fluid situation, but just anything you might be hearing as to when this might
start up again?

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Clearly varies by country. And it's the reason that we put a couple of those charts on our website for you
to look at, is just to see the difference in how different countries are doing it. The places that are able
to engage earliest have taken strategies where they have put COVID care in one location and allowed
surgery to occur in a different location or hot and cold zones within their own institutions that have
allowed them to manage both concurrently so long as they have staff and PPE to do it. Giving you a
general answer is really not possible at this time because of the puts and takes by region.

What I will say is surgeons are there for a reason. They are -- it's impressive. They are both community
oriented and clearly understanding the need to support their communities as they flex into this crisis. At
the same time, they're surgeons, and they're looking forward to going back to surgery. The backlogs that
you hear about are significant, and they are concerned about those patients who are surgical patients who
need care.

The last comment I'd make is that very few of the procedures that are done using robotic-assisted surgery
are easily resolved by nonsurgical means, that we are in a part of surgery that -- where surgery is, by and
large, the first choice. And as a result, I don't think a lot of these procedures are going to dissolve in time
just by waiting. I think they're going to have to be done surgically. So it really will be a question of where
do they get done, when do they get done and what kind of technology is used to do it.

Operator

Our next question will come from Amit Hazan, Goldman Sachs.

Amit Hazan
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And just a quick follow-up on the European system side. Just thinking about operating leases out there
and how that situation might evolve, can you just kind of maybe remind us of the tendency of certain
countries to adopt via leases out there and whether you're sensing any kind of a change or improvement
in that outlook as we think about them being more constrained to spend on capital potentially over the
next year or so?

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Marshall, will you take that?

Marshall L. Mohr
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, there were -- there are limitations as to what you can do within each European country. All of them
have different rules as to registration and with different regulators around financing. Having said that, we
really had launched leasing in Germany and the U.K. a year or 2 years ago or so and France a little bit
after that. And we did see a nice uptick in leasing in -- particularly in Germany.

I think going forward, we'll be doing -- you'll see leasing in all those markets. We're prepared to be able
to offer it. We now understand structures we can do and what the requirements are from a reporting
perspective, and I think we're set. So I would anticipate given the impact of the COVID-19 that we would
see additional leasing there.

INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 16, 2020

And then just one quick kind of bigger question, bigger-picture, longer term one for Gary. It's early days,
but how are you thinking, if at all, about secular changes for hospital systems and health care more
broadly after this crisis is over as it kind of relates to your markets?

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I think it's a little too soon to tell. We certainly are thinking about how customers might adapt, and
you can think about a few things. I guess I'd focus you on really kind of Phase II and Phase III of this
coronavirus response: the economy starts opening back up, and we have a fair amount of testing, but
you're still dealing with COVID as it -- as an uncured disease. How do hospitals manage that? I think that's
a lot of where our thoughts are now. That may have to do with site of care and other kind of flexible ways.

We think minimally invasive surgery broadly and robotic-assisted surgery is important in that setting.
Keeping people out of the hospital, allowing them to recover quickly at home, these are things that I think
are generally good for the health care system, and there may be some adaptation by health systems to
be flexible about how to deliver that. And we're working through that internally and with them, and it gets
exciting.

What happens after that, as this goes on a couple of years, I think we'll all have to wait and see.

Last questioner, please.

Operator

Yes, that will come from Matt Taylor, UBS.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on some of the things you were talking about qualitatively
earlier in regards to helping systems when they get back to working normally and helping them be
efficient and flex up on the upside. I know you've done some work there with your internal consulting
groups to make systems more efficient. It seems to be working. And I was just wondering if you could
offer some thoughts on how much more they could flex up in the short run? And what are some of the
best practices? And what are the best systems doing with regards to utilization today?

Gary S. Guthart
President, CEO & Director

Yes. If you think forward, the major things here have been really making sure that teams are consistent;
teams that know how to work together, work together frequently; they know how to parallelize tasks; and
they use kind of best practices. It is not limited to robotic surgery but works really well therein.

With regard to how we can help, making sure that training resources are available. We have been
investing, as you know, in Intuitive telemedicine network. I'm really pleased that we made that set of
investments. And in the future, that allows us to project expertise in at a distance. That means people
don't have to be on planes. In a post-COVID world, that's probably helpful for us and something that we
want to rotate towards as we go. As I said earlier in the call, I think we can forward deploy some of our
training resources and help get teams up and running and trained that would help people work through
backlogs as best as they can.

All right. Well, thank you. That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there's a
substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. During this
period, our continued -- our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and care teams to
support them in their mission, wherever that may lead. We believe value creation in surgery and acute
care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams,
their needs and their environment.

Thank you for your support. We look forward to talking with you again in 3 months. Thank you.
