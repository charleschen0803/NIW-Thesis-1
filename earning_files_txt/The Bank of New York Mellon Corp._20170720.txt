Thanks, Gerald and good morning everyone
It was a good quarter as we continue to execute our strategy and build a foundation for future growth
When you look at the results for the earlier quarter, a few things stand out
First, we experienced solid revenue growth in both segments with investment management and performance fees of 6% and investment services fees of 4%
Second, we grew total revenue by 5% and that's at a time when FX is under a bit of pressure due to low volatility and I think that demonstrates our well diversified lower risk model is positioned to create increased value through the most environments that we face
Third, our net interest revenue and our net interest margin benefited from the rate increases
And finally expenses were a little higher
Yet we still generated excellent positive operating leverage and increased our operating margins
Now, if you turn to our financial highlights document
I'll continue my commentary starting on Slide 5, which gives an overview of our results for the quarter
Our second quarter EPS was $0.88 at 17% higher than a year ago
And if you look at the underlying performance on a year-over-year basis, the second quarter fee revenue was up 5%
Expenses were up 1% and we generated more than 340 basis points of positive operating leverage
Our adjusted pretax operating margin was up 2 percentage points to 35%
Net interest revenue also increased a strong 8% and that was driven by higher interest rates
As we've noted in prior quarters, the strength of the U.S
dollar continues to impact the results negatively for revenue and positively for expense
On a consolidated basis, however, the net impact from currency translation was essentially neutral once again
Income before taxes was up 12% and our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22% for the quarter and that compares to 20% in the year ago quarter
Moving ahead to Slide 7, I'll discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue primarily on a year-over-year basis
Total investment services fees were up 4%
Asset servicing was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially
Both increases reflect net new business including the continued growth of our collateral management solutions and businesses, as well as higher equity market values
The year-over-year increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger dollar and the impact of downsizing the retail U.K
transfer agency business
Clearing services fees increased 13% year-over-year and they were up 5% sequentially
They were driven primarily by higher money market fees, as well as growth in our long-term mutual fund assets on the platform
Issuer service fees were up 3% year-over-year and that reflects higher depository receipt fees
On a sequential basis, issuer service fees were down 4% and that's primarily due to seasonality in depositary receipt revenue
Treasury services fees increased 1% year-over-year and sequentially and that reflects higher payment volumes, while that's partially offset by higher compensating balance credits
If you adjust for the compensating balance credits, treasury service fee revenue would have been an additional 4% higher
Investment management and performance fees increased 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially
That reflects higher market values, money market fees, and performance fees
The year-over-year increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S
dollar and that's principally driven by the British pound
On a constant-currency basis, investment management and performance fees increased 9% year-over-year
Investment management's focused approach delivering profitable revenue growth that centers on expanding our product offering to meet the evolving client demand and high value active strategies coupled with ongoing improvements to business processes, as well as increased efficiencies
As a result of the actions that we've taken over the last year, the adjusted pretax operating margin for the quarter increased 397 basis points to 34% year-over-year
Foreign exchange and other trading revenue on a consolidated base was down 9% year-over-year and it was up1% sequentially
FX revenue of $151 million was 9% lower and 2% lower sequentially reflecting the lower volatility that we saw in both periods
The year-over-year decrease was partially offset by increases in volumes
Investment and other income of $122 million compared with $74 million in the year ago quarter and $77 million in the prior quarter, both of those comparisons primarily lease-related gains in the second quarter
Slide 8 shows the driver of our investment management business and I think it will help explain some of the underlying performance
We achieved record asset under management of 1.77 trillion that's up 6% year-over-year that benefited from higher market values, net inflows that will offset a little bit by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar once again against the British pound for the most part
Long-term active flows were $16 billion that was driven by the second consecutive quarter of positive LDI inflows with $15 billion in Q2 and continue momentum in fixed income flows where we saw $2 billion of inflows
While we experienced outflows of $2 billion in active equities, outflows this quarter were among the lowest we've seen over the past few years
We had index outflows of $13 billion
Those were primarily due to portfolio rebalancing from several large international clients and similar to last quarter and in contrast to the industry trend, we experienced cash inflows of 11 billion and that's benefiting from our strong performance from core money market funds
Off note client assets and wealth management reached record levels this quarter that's up 10% year-on-year
And turning to our investment services metrics on Slide 9, we achieved record assets under custody and/or administration of $31.1 trillion, up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, mostly driven by higher market values
We estimate total new assets under custody and/or administration business wins were $152 billion in the second quarter, once again a pretty good result
Looking at the other key investment metrics, you'll see average deposits declined 10% year-over-year that reflects the impact of the rate increase, as well as our efforts to proactively manage our balance sheet to meet the current liquidity and capital requirements
Given the strength that we've been seeing in our capital ratios, we were able to accommodate some additional client deposit for this quarter and our average deposit balance has actually increased 1% sequentially and that contributes a little to our net interest income
Tri-party balances grew a strong 19% year-over-year and they were up 5% sequentially and volume increased with the additional businesses we are on boarding
Turning to net interest revenue that's on Slide 10, you will see that on a fully taxable equivalent bases, NIR was at $838 million that's up 7% versus the year ago quarter and 4% sequentially
Both increases primarily reflect the benefit of higher interest rates
Year-over-year increase also reflects lower premium amortization that's partially offset by lower interest earning assets and higher average long-term debt
The sequential increase also reflects an additional interest earning day, as well as a modest increase in interest earning assets
Turning to Slide 11 you will see that adjusted non-interest expense increased 1% year-over-year and was up slightly sequentially
Expenses were a little higher in the second quarter than we had guided in our first quarter earnings call
About half of that increase was due to the weakening of the U.S
dollar in the quarter
Although it's up on a year-over-year basis, it was actually weaker in the quarter
The other half was due to higher incentive expense and that was both due to performance of the businesses, as well as the impact of a higher share price and the mark-to-market impact on the variable compensation component of incentives
The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher professional, legal, and other purchase services that were partially offset by the stronger U.S
dollar, as well as lower net occupancy expense
The increase in professional, legal, and other purchase services is primarily related to regulatory and compliance cost, especially the 2017 resolution plan
Earlier this month we delivered that plan, which we believe makes us more resilient and resolvable
We incurred significant cost due to the construction of the plan itself, which has made us more resolvable and we continue to expect some of these expenses to be phased out over the coming quarters
Net occupancy expense decreased as we continue to benefit from the savings we generated from the execution of the business improvement process and sequentially lower staff expense was offset by higher other business development and software and equipment expenses
The decrease in staff expense was driven by the impact of investing of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees that we recorded in the first quarter as we've done in previous years
Turning to capital on Slide 12, our fully phased-in supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6% and that makes the upcoming 2018 regulatory requirements, plus it has what we now believe is a very reasonable buffer
We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio
A few additional notes about the quarter, our effective cash rate of 25.4% is in line with guidance
On Page 9 of our press release, we show investment securities portfolio highlights
At quarter end our net unrealized pretax gain on our portfolio was $151 million that compared with a pretax loss of $23 million in the last quarter with the improvement primarily driven by the decrease in market interest rates for the period, in summary a strong quarter performance as we continue to execute well against our three-year goals
Now, let me provide you with some color on how we are thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you with your modeling
Third quarter earnings are typically impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes and market-related revenue, particularly things like foreign exchange, collateral services, and securities lending
That all is often offset by the seasonally higher activity that we see in depositary receipts
However, for this coming quarter we would expect the seasonal bump in the yards to be about half of what it was last year and that's around $50 million, reflecting a somewhat less favorable market environment
During our first quarter call, we indicated that our net interest revenue should be up in the range of 2% to 4% for the second quarter
As you can see, we came in at the high end of that range
We had also indicated at that time that we expected to be in the 4% to 6% range for the full year
NIR would be up in that range
Given the performance that we've seen in the second quarter, as well as our outlook now for NIR, it has improved and we think we should be at the high end of that 4% to 6% range
Another item back in January, I told you that investment in other income should be in the range of $60 million to $80 million each quarter
In this quarter it was elevated quite a bit because of the lease-related gains that I mentioned earlier
As you have seen over many quarters, this line does tend to be a little bit bumpy, but for the full year we still expect the average to high end of the $60 million $80 million range per quarter
On expenses, as we noted last quarter, we expect to see $10 million decline and each of the last two quarters were about $20 million in total, mainly from reduced consulting fees related to the resolution plan
For the full year we expect our total adjusted expenses to be up around 1%, although the improved revenue performance and the recent decline of the dollar may make this a bit more challenging
Regarding taxes, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% along the lines of what we've previously guided and finally we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the entire year of 2017. With that, let me turn it over to Charlie to say a few words
Sure, Ken
Good morning
So, the securities book, it does have about 30% of it that is floating, so that reprices regularly and it is a little bit of lag to that, but we see that reflected in the numbers over the past couple of quarters
The other 70% is being reinvested in similar duration securities and there's a flat yield curve
So, those rates really haven't gone up much
So, it's not really benefiting from a change in the rate environment
As we look forward, we would expect to see those yields continue to grind up if they follow the forward yield curve
You probably could see the entire securities portfolio continue to grind up maybe in the range of six or seven basis points a quarter
The comment I made was we typically see in the second quarter a fairly substantial bump
We expect to see that in this quarter, but not as large as what we've seen in the past
I think Brian you can kind of point out what the factors that are driving that
And corporate actions in the space tend to be episodic anyway
So, you are going to get some swings there from period to period
I want to talk to - talk about a couple of points here
If you look at Page 8 of our earnings release, we disclosed what the cost of our interest bearing deposits and the change in the quarter and you can see in this quarter went from three basis points to nine basis points
So, we had about a 29 basis point increase on average in the interest on excess reserves
So, if you take into consideration that about 75% of our deposits are US dollar denominated that equates to the core of somewhere between 25% and 30% data
We do think that data with future rate increases will increase, but it will continue to add positively to our NIM
So, we do anticipate base moving up above the 50% range with the next few movements
In terms of deposit behaviors, they've probably have performed our expectations a little bit in the second quarter
In terms of the total deposits they are up a little bit
US deposits are just about dead flat on a sequential basis both in the noninterest bearing and in the interest bearing
And we do believe depending on how the Fed dose it's tapering that we might continue to see some modest runoff in noninterest bearing deposits
I think what goes on in the interest bearings is going to be just related to data's
So, there is no reason that we'd have to see that kind of a runoff
But the net impact is still a positive one with our NIM increasing more than the impact of the runoff
That's what we are currently modeling
How about if I start and Brian? So, one of the things that I want to make clear is, if you look at the asset servicing line for the enterprise, that does include some fee revenue that's generated in the investment management and some fee revenue that's generated and most of it obviously is generated in the Investment Services business
So, on the Investment Management side, we have seen in our boutiques a little lower securities lending and - in that kind of the custody related business and wealth management, it's been relatively flat
The remainder of it is running through - through investment services and Brian you can speak to that
I think just as a reminder to - our business mix is a little bit different, so we are much more fixed income oriented as you know with - fixed incomes are actually down a little bit year-over-year, but we are benefitting from the expertise that we have in the collateral management side of that
So, I think that's - so we do get a market bump
There is no question about it, but it's probably not as high as you might see as somebody that was more oriented toward equities
We don't have that number handy, but it's not a huge number though at this point
Todd, I'll have to ask a follow up question of your question on the second question, but as to the balance size Brian, if we do get really from the treasury recommendations, we are going to have to think through what to do that would relieve a fair amount of our capital requirements
And so we have been pretty disciplined in the past and I expect that we will be in the future and so if putting that - if growing the balance sheet makes sense, we will do that
If not, we will buy back our shares
And so we will have to compare with the alternatives or with that incremental cash
We would love to see it because we think it would propel behavior and we would love the optionality that it would provide, but again that activity would have to be contingent in our making a decent return because ultimately it's freed up capital
So, we got to do something with capital and so that's how we are thinking about
I didn't completely understand your second question, Brian
Yeah
I don't know of the top of my head
The reason to a lot of premium amortization impact so, I don't think that's going to be driving it, but I don't
If you recall back in the fourth quarter, we adopted what we call the prepayment method for amortization - the premium amortization and under that method I think we have reduced quite a bit of the volatility out of the numbers
So, we are going to have to look into that
I don't have that detail Brian
So one at it, I take the stab at this and the bridges both of our major sectors
First of all on the clearing side the further consolidation of mutual fund assets under our platforms is increasing and it's very gratifying to see that our platforms are being used more extensively as that consolidation process occurs and we are winning business from brokers and accelerating at pace and more importantly advisors as we shift to an advisory model utilizing our platform to capture assets and that's one of the reasons why you are seeing the clearing business pick up as nicely as it did as well as the fee waiver impact
Second part of your question is, we are seeing and capturing more cash through our various portals and platforms
So whether its purging platform or liquidity services platform, we are capturing and internalizing more of that flow and that's why I think we are outperforming capturing cash in our money market business and that flows into the Investment Management area
And I think our performance in the management of the money market funds has also improved
So we are now very, very competitive on the returns in the money market fund
So the combination of the increased performance on the funds and the capture of the cash is allowing us to outperform
If you look at it on average, interest bearing deposits on a year-over-year basis are down about 25 billion, so we are pretty far along the way
Most of that is in dollars
Now when we gave that indication, we assumed a parallel shift in all currencies
We haven't seen that so, we are not seeing any decline in the non-dollar deposits at this point Gerard
So I think we pretty much tract along our expectations and we could see a modest additional decline
Now that all being said, the markets are growing and so with the growth the natural underlying growth may offset some of what the interest impact and the Fed tapering impact would otherwise have
Yeah, I'll make a brief comment and Mitchell can jump out
We're seeing a little bit of a decline in the wealth deposits and I don't know if I can comment on that
A - Mitchell Harris Just on the wealth deposits, you have a couple of things, I think going on
You have seasonality that happens in the second quarter with tax payments and with interest rates moving up, at least private clients are moving into other products right now
So they're shifting out
With respect to the other revenue and it's really primarily an abatement of the cash waivers that we pay out to Investment Services, so it's more of an internal transfer from us over to Investment Services
And Michael were you refereeing to the segment line or the enterprise line for other investment, other income
Okay, alright
Yeah, you would adjust - take the number on average we should - on average for the aggregate for the year it should be on the high end of that 60 to 80, so four times 80 is 320, so that -
That's what I was pointing towards
Well, there's a substantial amount of those that are non-dollar and so right now on the non-dollar category interest rates are extraordinarily low or negative in some instances
In US dollars it tends to be frictional cash, I mean most of us leave a little money in our checking accounts and it looks a lot like a retail business when you have many thousands upon thousands of accounts and people - and our clients are trying to make sure that they don't incur over drafts in those accounts
So they leave a little bit of a cushion for that frictional activity
And then the final point, in some of our payments businesses we actually give an earnings credit, so we don't pay interest on the account, but we credit fees for the account
So that's still denominated as a noninterest bearing account, but it effectively offsets fees for the services provided
This quarter alone, we saw pretty healthy payments business, it was only up - the fees were only up 1%, but if we reflected what the credits that they got from noninterest bearing balances, that would have added another 4%, so the actual underlying activity was up a pretty healthy number
I wouldn't say that that there is obviously the value of managing that tighter and tighter would go up as interest rates go up and that's why we would expect in our models and we've reflected that that is probably going to be the case
If you kind or look back at us prior to the crisis we're running those numbers somewhere around 16% of the balance sheet
It's probably a little bit higher than that now, but I believe the non-dollar component of it has contributed a fair amount of that as well
Okay, thank you Geoffrey
