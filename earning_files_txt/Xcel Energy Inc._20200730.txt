XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Questions
will only be taken from institutional investors, reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, and
individual investors and others can reach out to investor relations. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead, sir.

Paul Andrew Johnson
VP & Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2020 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me
today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating
Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive
Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we'll review our second quarter results, share recent
business and regulatory developments and discuss how we're managing through uncertainty around
COVID. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.

As a reminder, some of the comments we make during today's call may contain forward-looking
information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described
in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP
measures, including items: ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable
GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.

I'll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Well, thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter. Booking earnings of $0.54 per
share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings
are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are
reaffirming our 2020 guidance. We continue to help our customers and protect our employees during the
pandemic. We're stepping up our charitable giving to help our communities. Our business continuity plans
have been executed extremely well. We're keeping employees safe while providing reliable service to our
customers, and we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs that create
jobs in our communities.

Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities
in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump-start the economy. In
June, we filed a plan that proposes $3 billion of capital investment. This includes approximately $1.8
billion of incremental CapEx for wind repowering, a 460-megawatt solar facility, [ band ] 540 at EV
infrastructure and about $1.2 billion of accelerated transmission, distribution and natural gas investments.
We recently announced a solicitation for repowering of wind projects that are either owned by Xcel Energy
or under PPAs. We estimate 800 to 1,000 megawatts of potential repowering projects and expect to make
a commission recommendation by year-end. We're also proposing options to mitigate customer bills.
Overall, feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to working through the process with the
commission. Now as you might have heard, the U.S. Treasury recently announced a 1-year extension
of the safe harbor for renewable projects. Wind projects that began construction in 2016 now have until
the end of 2021 to complete construction and receive PTCs at the 100% level. While we were confident
that our projects would qualify for 100% PTC level regardless of this change, the extension assures us
benefit for our customers should any projects slip into 2021. Importantly, this change also presents the
opportunity to move to quota range from the originally planned 80% PTC level to 100% PTC level. While
this will not impact earnings, it will significantly reduce costs, which is a great outcome for our customers.

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Advancing our strategic priority of leading the clean energy transition, we and our co-owners recently
announced the early retirement of the second coal unit at Craig. While we only have a small ownership
stake in Craig, we are proud to help drive the early retirement of another coal unit. We're also making
significant strides to improve ESG transparency and disclosure, we recently issued our TCFD report and
risk assessment, which describes the resilience of our climate strategy using different scenarios. The
addition of this report enhance our disclosures and results in a full TCFD compliance for Xcel Energy.

Another strategic priority is to keep our customer bills low. As a result, it was very satisfying to see that
SPS' electric rates in Texas and New Mexico were the lowest in the country for 2019, as recently reported
by S&P Global. Providing strong customer service and reliability at an attractive price is a hallmark of Xcel
Energy and we're very proud of this recognition. We're also excited that after 10 years, we've reached a
settlement agreement with Boulder, that will result in a new franchise agreement and also a partnership
to explore grid side options to meet our carbon goals. The approval process for this settlement will include
a vote by City Council in August, a ballot referendum and vote by the people of Boulder in November. If
approved, the franchise will go into effect in January of 2021.

Finally, I was recently elected Chairman of EEI. It'll be an honor to lead the industry in such an important
and challenging time, and I tend to focus on 3 areas. My first priority is the industry's ongoing COVID-19
response related to the workforce, customers and recovery from the pandemic. Second, I intend to
focus on clean energy innovation. I'm asking EEI to develop federal and state policy proposals that
will bring dispatchable 0 carbon technologies into the marketplace to enable the industry to meet our
long-term carbon goals. Finally, I've asked EEI to focus on what our industry can do to promote racial
justice and increasing our commitment to advance diversity and inclusion. Like our country, our entire
industry has been shaken by the death of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd died only a few miles from our corporate
headquarters, and Minneapolis was the first city to experience widespread protest and rioting. I think as
society, we have a lot of work to do. We need to look hard at ourselves, our unconscious biases and our
business practices. They have some hard questions about how we can improve our diversity. I'm confident
that Xcel Energy can play a leadership role in driving positive change for our country and our communities.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on our financial results and
our outlook. Brian?

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the
second quarter of 2020 compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers
for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expenses, primarily driven by our cost management
efforts, increased earnings by $0.05 per share; higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.02 per
share, which reflects rises in rate increases that offset the negative $0.07 per share impact from declining
sales largely due to COVID-19; higher AFUDC equity increased earnings by $0.03 per share; and finally,
our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. However, the majority of the lower
ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin
and is largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest
expense, reflecting our capital investment program and other items, which combined reduced earnings by
$0.09 per share.

Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19
had a major impact on second quarter sales. Our second quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined
by 7.1%. However, these impacts are better than projected in our base case scenario, which is embedded
in our guidance assumptions. On a weather-adjusted basis, April retail electric sales declined 9.6%. May
showed improvements as retail electric sales declined 6.7%. And June showed further improvement as
retail electric sales declined 4.7%. This monthly trend reflects the economic shutdown that started in mid-
March and the gradual opening up of the economy in May and June. As a reminder, we have a sales true-
up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-
demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. In second
quarter, sales came in better than projected in our base case scenario. We have additional cushion should

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

an economic relapse occur or the recovery falter. Conversely, if sales continue to come in better than
expected, we'll adjust our contingency plans accordingly.

We're also closely monitoring bad debt expense and working with customers on payment plans. While
it is difficult to project where we'll end, bad debt expense increased approximately $25 million in the
2008-2009 time period as a reference point. Our commissions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico
and Michigan have issued orders to differ pandemic-related expenses. We also reached a settlement in
Colorado with the staff and OCC that would allow us to defer COVID-19 related bad debt expense pending
a commission decision. Finally, our filings in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under commission
review. We've also made strong progress in our efforts to reduce O&M costs to mitigate the impacts of
COVID-19. Based on our contingency plans, we expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in
2020, which would offset COVID-19 impacts in the base case scenario. We're also prepared to implement
additional contingency plans if the impact exceed our base case scenario. But as we've discussed in the
first quarter, there are limitations to what we can offset. We remain focused on providing strong customer
service and reliability and will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on
our customers or shareholders. The last COVID-19 topic I want cover is liquidity. We finished our planned
debt issuances for the year, and we were able to access the capital markets on strong terms and issue
bonds at record local bonds. We also closed on the sale of the Mankato energy center, which provided
approximately $650 million of cash proceeds after carving out the gain for charitable contributions. As
a result, we now have available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. And finally, we issued an equity
forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year, bringing our total liquidity to approximately
$5.2 billion.

Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In New Mexico, the commission approved our constructive
settlement that reflects a rate increase of $31 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and
accelerated depreciation of the coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. In Texas, we reached a
constructive unopposed black box settlement, which reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a
ROE of 9.45% and an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes, an acceleration of the depreciation
life of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. And in July, we also
reached a constructive settlement in our Colorado natural gas rate case, which reflects a net rate increase
of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and a historic test year of an adjustment for
the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. On our last
call, we discussed our preference to avoid rate case is impossible, especially in light of COVID-19. So we
recently filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing
a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. And
as part of our Minnesota release and recovery filing, we expressed our interest in seeking an alternative
path to avoid a rate case filing this year. We think this will be a constructive outcome for all parties, we've
had initial discussions and we'll keep you posted.

With that, I'll wrap up. We are effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable
energy service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and
communities. We reached constructive settlements in our Texas and Colorado rate cases. We avoided
an electric rate case in Colorado by filing for wildfire and advanced grid riders. We filed our relief and
recovery proposal in Minnesota, which will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result
in significant customer benefits. We announced the early retirement of another coal plant and achieved
TCFD full compliance. We reached a settlement with Boulder that should end their municipalization efforts.
We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our solid year-to-date
results and progress and contingency plans. And finally, we remain committed to delivering long-term
earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to touch base, I guess, on your retail sales expectations at this point. Didn't know if you had
any data from July, if you could provide us any more color? It seems so far in the second quarter, you guys
are trended somewhere between the base case and the mild case. I'm just wondering if you could give
us any feeling, I guess, from what you can see so far, how the third quarter might be shaping up initially
between those 2 scenarios?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Yes, happy to. But as you know, we don't have AMI. So we have some visibility into July information, and
particularly we have some sample customers. And what we're seeing on the C&I side is we're seeing a
slight improvement as we look at some of the specific data that we have. We've seen some improvement
in the oil and gas flow down in SPS, something we're watching closely. If you look at results down, they
kind of bottom out in May, and we've seen improvements relative, still below, about 5% from where it
was pre-COVID levels, but good to see the C&I improvement there. We're also watching Colorado C&I.
If you look at our earnings release in our presentation, you can see that the C&I sales from May to June
didn't improve as much as they did from April to May. So that's something we're focusing on in Q3, but
we are seeing positive trend there. In the residential, I think we're still continuing to see the strength that
we saw in Q2. So overall positive trends going into Q3. But if you look at our base scenario, we did have
significant improvement from the depths in Q2 to Q3. So some are watching closely.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And just with regards to the Minnesota relief and recovery proposal, just
wondering if you might be able to share any more as far as any early feedback that you might have
received so far or just kind of expectations going forward at this point?

Robert C. Frenzel
President & COO

Jeremy, it's Bob, and thanks for the question. Coincidentally, we actually had a Minnesota planning
meeting yesterday with the department and the commission to talk through the Relief and Recovery Act.
We think this is a really interesting example of coordination between the investor-owned utilities and the
political community to try and solve some of the problems that are affecting our communities from the
pandemic. I think the commentary yesterday was kicked off by Lieutenant Governor with a positive tone. I
feel like we had some positive tone from some of the commissioners with special interest to an expeditious
resolution and time line. So we'll know more as we work through the rest of the summer in terms of time
line. But I think yesterday's planning meeting felt fairly positive.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's encouraging. That's great. And if I could just sneak in a last one here. It seemed like your guide,
D&A interest and AFUDC equity all kind of changed a little bit there. I was wondering if you could help us
with some of the drivers?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

7

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Yes. Certainly. I mean, when you put them all together, bottom line impact is pretty immaterial for the
year. Puts and takes, depreciation changes -- coming out of our rate cases, we had some depreciation
rate changes that were implemented. Obviously, interest expense. We set record low coupons. Minnesota,
we issued a 30-year bond at 2.6%, which is the lowest 30-year first mortgage bond for utilities. So really
good results there out of the team. And then on the other pieces of rider revenue, right, just a little bit of
delays in implementation of our wind farms. But net-net, pretty immaterial impact when you take them all
together.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So let me take the other side of what Jeremy was just talking about. Let's talk about cost reductions, and
let's talk about that in the context of your progress year-to-date, and what this means going forward in
the future years, right? I hear you guys talking about staying out in Colorado, for instance, leveraging
riders a little bit more, but give a little bit of context in where you are against the plan, given the 4% to
5% articulated? And then what that means for sustainability and prospects to stay out in these states?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Let me -- I'm going to let Brian give you the details on that, Julien. But let me just say, we're really
proud of how the entire team -- entire Xcel workforce has really stepped up to mitigate the impacts of
COVID-19, while still providing this important, obviously, product that we deliver. And we've done it in
a number of different ways, but what most impressed me is the innovation, the creativity, the use of
technology to improve our business. So I'm optimistic that a lot of -- we've got to work through, but a lot
of this will give us a lot of momentum as we go into 2021. And with that, I'll ask Brian to give some more
details.

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Ben. Yes, so from a run rate, right, we put in the contingency plans in essentially the end
of March as we saw this hit. And so we had 9 months from a year-to-date perspective, we're about a
little over $50 million ahead of 2019. So executing, obviously, slightly ahead of plan when we look at
what our plans were for Q2. So that puts us in a good position for the balance of the year. Obviously, if
sales come in a little bit better, we can adjust those contingency plans for the year. And Ben said it well,
the team has done a great job of developing and executing those plans for this year, and we've really
turned our attention to what is sustainable in 2021 and beyond. But I think you got -- when you talk about
regulatory flexibility and rate case sales, through also -- the other side of equation is we're -- everything
we've learned over the past few months from the impact of COVID-19 is we're incorporating into our sales
forecast for 2021 -- and incorporating revenue to our sales forecast for 2021. And so we're looking at both
sides of the equation. And so big focus for the team in Q3 from an O&M sustainability perspective, which
will deliver further guidance and clarity in Q3 on that.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. But net-net, fairly confident to consistently earn at authorized levels to the extent to which that
you're successful in staying out in these cases, inclusive of, for instance, the Colorado rider?

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think that's a fair assumption. You broke up a little bit. I think you said we'd expect to earn at our
authorized levels with regulatory proceedings, just to make sure I heard you correctly?

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes.

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Where exactly are you, Julien?

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

We'll talk about that later.

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

We have enjoyed your notes from the road, Julien.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

There we go. So in Colorado, and speaking of Colorado, what are your prospects for stimulus here as you
think about the -- potentially mirroring your efforts in Minnesota?

Robert C. Frenzel
President & COO

Julien, it's Bob. So if you're in Colorado, hope you're having good weather out there. We've had a nice
warm summer. I think you saw some of our weather-adjusted sales were pretty strong in Colorado. As
far as relief and recovery goes, what we've done in Minnesota, we believe, has been relatively unique for
the country. But we're certainly open to the ideas and trying to partner in other jurisdictions. I'll give a lot
of credit to the administration and the commission and the department in Minnesota for their leadership
and their partnership with us on the R&R plan and getting utilities in the state to step up and try and
help our communities and our customers. And if we could find that kind of partnership, we are absolutely
looking and willing to do that. If the pandemic continues or if we see some resurgence, there may be more
opportunities down the road for us on something similar in other jurisdictions. I wouldn't rule it out.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Travis Miller with Morningstar.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I wonder if you could talk a little bit more when you said, in Minnesota, the alternative path, what that
might look like in lieu of one of the full 3-year rate cycle filing?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Travis, as we kind of put in our relief and recovery plan, the alternative path is really looking at a
potential stay out for 2021. Going into 2020, we were able to reach a constructive stale with the parties,
which the commission approved, and that was really focused a couple of key components around sales
true-up and deferral of the annuity amortization, a couple of key components. And now we're just starting
-- we put that in the relief and recovery plan. I think there's another path there, and we've just started
the initial discussions around that. And certainly, we'll look to see if we can find a good constructive
settlement that works for our customers and us.

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Okay. Would it include potentially something like a rate base true-up, something like that as well? Or are
there other mechanisms in there that keep you at that allowed or slightly below the allowed ROE?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Well, for Minnesota, the 2 big components, look similar to -- at least sitting here today, similar to the
settlement that we reached for this year, the big component is a sales true-up and then the deferral
of some amortizations. We do have riders to recover a lot of our investments. With our renewable
investments flowing through our renewable rider. And we have our transmission cost rider, which covers
some investments. So we have rider mechanisms that help recover the investments we're making for our
customers.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just confirming that you guys are still on track for that 5-year 7% rate base growth
and the $22 billion CapEx, any changes to those numbers?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I would say -- Travis, this is Ben. Yes, we are on track, and we're targeting the upper half. And we'll
update all of that in the third quarter when we update you on our 5-year capital forecast. But I think you'll
be pleased with what we're projecting.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just real quick, does that include the $3 billion in Minnesota? Or would that be
incremental?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

So that would be -- well, first of all, $1.8 billion is incremental, the other is an acceleration. But yes, I
mean that's not necessary to -- for us. So that would be incremental.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just good to hear your voice, Ben. And have fun being the chair of EEI.

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

The virtual chair, I suppose.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So the -- on the Minnesota kind of recovery investment, has the commission give some indication on the
basis for the decisions they're going to make in terms of, like, is it based on the amount of jobs created
versus the rate impact? Or just how are they going to make that decision?

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Well, I think we'll take a number of factors into consideration. But I think, as you know, our steel for
fuel strategy accomplishes capital investment, job growth and helps with rates. So to the extent we can
emphasize that, I think the better we'll be. There will be a solicitation, and we'll bring those projects in.
We are anticipating that we'll have a very good price point for the solar that we're planning. And Brian or
Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything else?

Robert C. Frenzel
President & COO

Steve, I think it's still just a little bit early innings, but I think the comfort level with the investment, the
economic development, the job creation, that portfolio coupled with the relief opportunities that Brian
mentioned on rates and stay out mechanisms, I think, is a big package. We haven't got a full-time line
out of them. We had a big planning meeting yesterday, which was favorable with some positive comments
from the commission and even the administration. And so we're comfortable and confident where we sit.
We don't have a lot of details other than that to share with you right now.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Do you have any sense of the rate impact of the $3 billion? Or you're kind of waiting to see your
bidding and all that?

Robert C. Frenzel
President & COO

I think we still need to run through the solicitation process on the renewable portions for sure, which will
run through August and into September before we make some decisions. But we're pretty confident that
we know the impacts of the things we would put forward, and we know a little bit of what other people
would do as well. So we're pretty comfortable with the cost side of it.

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Steve, we wouldn't put forward a wind repowering if it wasn't NPV positive to the consumer. So I think
the reality is will that offset the acceleration of some of the distribution and transmission spend that we're
talking about. And I think likely it will, but to Bob's point, we'll run through those numbers.

Robert C. Frenzel
President & COO

Yes. Steve, just some further color on the repowering. We had the long road repowering approved and
we have [ modeled, ] it should be upfront in the commission, hopefully, in Q3, and those show front end
customer savings and you go through the repowering, which is really good in this environment. And so
we're working through a similar analysis on our currently owned wind farms that we think would be good
candidates for that.

Okay. And since most of these things are related to things that you own and like you are pre -- assuming
it gets approved, pretty highly likely it would be you who actually makes the investment?

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Steve, one thing to be clear on, though, there are third parties that could submit PPAs for either a PPA
extension or a BOT. So it'll be some combination of our investment plus others.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. And I apologize, last question on this, which is just how should we think about financing plan for if
-- as much as the incremental, more time?

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Steve, as we talked about before. And really, in the filing, we think about $1.8 billion, it's the
incremental part. The other, the $1.2 billion roughly, is accelerated. But as we go through this process,
we expect, as the commission indicated yesterday, they'll look to find a way to move through this pretty
quickly. And at the same time, we're developing our 5-year capital plans for '21 through '25. And so we'll
put that all together and roll out a 5-year financing plan, if we have enough clarity to include this in our
5-year capital plan by October. But generally, what we've spoken about before, timing and size matters
for incremental capital. And if it's significant enough and it lines up, we'll generally fund that with -- at
our consolidated capital structure. As we've spoken about before, it's important to maintain that financial
strength and the credit quality of the company.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. So just to build on the rate strategy here and the questions around that. I'm
wondering if we think about more, I guess, payout rate since, obviously, your right decision, given the
COVID situation. But if this continues to be the case and the COVID is kind of here to stay and it looks the
economic consequences will be lingering for a while? Could we see a pivot in your overall strategy where
you move away from periodic rate cases and kind of switch on a more permanent basis to alternative
mechanisms and just kind of move away from the strategy of being a rate case [ filer to more of a paying
outflow on the period for longer? ] So that's my question.

Robert C. Frenzel
President & COO

Sophie, it's Bob. Good to hear your voice. You were a little broke up there, but let me try and address the
question, which I think is, how do you think strategically about rate cases in the context of the pandemic
and longer term, is sort of my takeaway. And we have a lot of rider mechanisms in our various states
and we're making billions of dollars of investments on behalf of our customers and infrastructure around
clean energy transition and grid modernization. And we also have to keep the utility financially healthy.
So that's the backdrop that we work with. We are obviously working with our regulators right now on
mechanisms by which we wouldn't need to file rate cases, and we're actively engaged in conversations
with stakeholders in Minnesota. In Colorado, I think, you saw us settle our gas case and then file a couple
of riders, which we think would allow us to stay out of our electric case in Colorado. And that's a bit of the
strategy is to continue to invest in areas that have real-time and rider recovery. You've seen us execute on
decoupling in sales true-up mechanisms in our businesses, and that's helpful as well. And so strategically,
I think you're in the right place as we're always going to look for mechanisms by which we can mitigate
our cost structure, keep our bills low for our customers, that's why we keep -- continue to invest in the
infrastructure that we need to. So we'll continue to be creative there and partner with our commissions.
And the goal would be to not go into rate cases, if we could avoid them, but we have to keep the utility
financially healthy. And so we balance all of that.

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And Sophie, just building on what Bob said, I mean, whether it's traditional rate cases or expansion of
riders or some combinations, the bottom line is we are going to achieve our clean energy objectives, our
levels of reliability and our customer improvements and customer experience, all while keeping total bills
below the pace of CPI. That's our objective, and that's what we're on track for, and that's what I think we
still remain on forecast to do, so -- because that's the key thing is to make these investments while not --
while keeping our products affordable.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then a follow-up, if I may, on the O&M. So you entered this year guiding for O&M
growth year-over-year and then the COVID situation, you had to switch that and basically find cost cuts,
right, to offset the impact, and it seems like it's going well. Could you give us some sense on the shape
of that throughout the year? Are you kind of into it now and trying to ramp-up in the second half? Or
are you pretty much trying a run rate at this point and we should expect a steady kind of O&M trajectory
throughout the year? How should we think about that?

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

Sophie, this is Brian. I think the way you said it, you assumed a steady run rate pretty ratably over the
quarter. So I think you're thinking about it right, that continues to be that run rate.

Operator

We'll go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Just a few quick follow-ups. So back in Minnesota -- and I'm sorry if I didn't completely understand this.
How much did you guys -- were you guys saying that this CapEx might be going to third parties through
contracts? How much of the total is subject to that?

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

The $1.8 billion incremental is -- that's our spend. But what Paul was saying is when we do a solicitation,
we'll have our own wind projects that we own that we bid into that. And -- but we will also encourage
independents to bid in as well, and they can bid in either as a build own transfer, which would result in our
ownership, they could bid in with an extension of a power purchase agreement, and we'll take a look at all
of those. But at the end of the day, our incremental CapEx will come from ownership and wind projects,
perhaps our own and perhaps BOTs, the solar facility that we're talking about at our coal plant and Becker,
Minnesota, advances in EV infrastructure. And I think that covers the incremental and then we look at the
acceleration of that $1.2 billion of grid spend.

Robert C. Frenzel
President & COO

We're not going to know what other parties are going to build in until we get through the process, which
would be more towards the end of August.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then -- but when we say incremental, just to be clear, that doesn't mean bringing something
in from the future, this is just incremental. In other words, it wouldn't happen anyway, it doesn't change
the trajectory of your CapEx outlook from -- in other words, you're not moving something from the future

to now? It's -- as an accelerator would suggest when you say incremental, it wouldn't have occurred
otherwise, is that the way to think about it?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think that...

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. I think I understand it. And then with respect to the...

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Paul, just on a -- I mean, look, I think the way to think about it is the $1.2 billion that we're not calling
incremental, that's an acceleration of something that's already in our forecast. The $1.8 billion would not
be in our existing forecast. Now over the course of 15 years, might it have happened? Yes. But that's how
we're defining that.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

That's really helpful. I appreciate it. And then with respect to the CPI of [ goal, ] is that still 2%?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, I think it extends a little bit by jurisdiction. Is that...

Robert C. Frenzel
President & COO

Yes. That's roughly, at Xcel level, a good way to think about it.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then just in general, I mean, this has been sort of touched on by other people, but I'm just sort
of wondering, if this -- if things continue down this road, is there any potential maybe to upsize this, if we
have a weaker economy, if -- do you follow what I'm saying? Is there any sort of discussion of a potential,
like, hey, maybe this is a good jobs idea or economic stimulus idea? And we could see something maybe
even bigger than this?

Benjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke
Chairman & CEO

I think I'll let the team weigh in on this, Paul, but I think it probably would come from other jurisdictions.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And -- okay, you already sort of addressed that.

We'll go to Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.

XCEL ENERGY INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

I just have one quick question. In your guidance for the year-end base case assumption, what type of, I
guess, assumption are you making on deferral treatment of corporate-related costs?

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

Around -- yes, bad debt. This is Brian. As we talked about in Q1, we assume that we get constructive
treatment around the regulatory deferrals. When we think about our bad debt expense, we have roughly
about $25 million increase, and we look at what happened in 2008 and 2009, and that's everything we've
seen for the 3 months of impact. So that remains pretty consistent as our thinking going into this. And if
we think about it right, we have about 95% of our business is covered with our 6 deferral orders, the 2
we're waiting for are the Dakotas. So we feel like we've reached a constructive place with those deferral
orders, and we'll continue to evaluate the deferrals as we go through the balance of the year.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. So the -- at least the bulk of what's happened in terms of the approvals were somewhat embedded
in making that guidance then?

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, that's correct.

Operator

That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian Van Abel for
any additional or closing remarks.

Brian J. Van Abel
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations
team with any follow-up questions. Have a good day. Thank you.

Operator
And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
