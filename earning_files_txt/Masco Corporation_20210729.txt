MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Masco's second quarter conference call. My name
is Dorothy, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being
recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice
President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.

David Chaika
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2021 Second Quarter Conference
Call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer.

Our second quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available
on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst
questions. Please limit yourself to 1 question with 1 follow-up. If we can't take your question now, please
call me directly at (313) 792-5500.

Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-
looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and
uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics. Our references to operating profit and
earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted metrics to
GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor
Relations.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying
safe and healthy.

We performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong. This
resulted in our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth, and sixth consecutive quarter of
both margin expansion and double-digit earnings per share growth. I'm extremely proud of our entire
team as we successfully navigated numerous supply chain challenges to enable this growth.

For the quarter, sales increased 24%. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency, sales increased
18%. Operating profit increased 27% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 20.1%, principally due to
strong volume leverage. Earnings per share increased an outstanding 34%.

Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel
products that are diversified across geographies and channels, serving both the consumer and the
professional.

Turning to our plumbing segment. Sales increased 48%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth
from our North American and international faucet and shower businesses and our spa business.
International plumbing grew 50% in the quarter, excluding currency as Hansgrohe sales rebounded
sharply in nearly all of its markets. Strong operational execution and new products such as Hansgrohe's
Rainfinity shower systems led to share gains in many of these markets.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

New product introductions will continue as we launched the award-winning AXOR One collection in the
second half of the year. This collection was designed by Barber Osgerby, an award-winning internationally
acclaimed London-based industrial design studio. This continues Hansgrohe's legacy of combining leading
contemporary design with innovative functionality.

North American plumbing posted strong growth of 47%, excluding currency in the second quarter, led by
approximately 75% growth at Watkins Wellness and robust double-digit growth at Delta.

Delta Faucet delivered another record quarter with growth across all channels and particular strength
in the professionally oriented trade channel. We continue to invest in new products in North American
plumbing as well. And 2 days ago, we introduced a Frank Lloyd Wright by Brizo that furthers the brand's
commitment to distinctive design and innovative products.

Lastly, in plumbing, at the beginning of July, we acquired Steamist, another bolt-on acquisition for Delta.
Steamist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong
trade and e-commerce product offering and is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy.

In our decorative architectural segment, sales declined 5% against a healthy 8% comp for the second
quarter of 2020. While bath and cabinet hardware, lighting and pro paint grew in the quarter, demand
moderated for DIY paint.

Material availability and other supply chain issues also impacted our overall coatings business, as nearly
all of our resin suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration during the second quarter.
Because of these issues, sell-through on our coatings products was better than sell-in and inventories in
the channel were reduced during the quarter.

Due to lower-than-expected second quarter sales, and our expectation that material availability issues will
persist but slowly improve, we are lowering our DIY sales expectation from flat to down low single digits
for the full year. However, with the acceleration we saw in our pro paint business in the quarter, we are
incrementally more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low double-digit growth from high single
digit for the full year for our pro paint business.

For the decorative segment overall, we now expect growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the full
year.

With respect to innovation in the decorative segment, we continue to invest in new products and are
excited to launch a new high-end line of paint in the third quarter at The Home Depot called BEHR
DYNASTY for both DIY and pro painters. DYNASTY is our most durable, stain-resistant, scuff-resistant,
one-coat hide paint ever. It's low VOC, GREENGUARD and LEED-certified, fast-drying and has an
antimicrobial mildew-resistant paint finish. This is yet another example of how our innovation teams
continue to focus on the voice of the customer to deliver leading innovation and value for both the
consumer and the professional.

Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our aggressive share buyback during the quarter by
repurchasing 6.6 million shares for $447 million. As part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement
that we executed during the quarter, we will additionally receive approximately 900,000 shares in July to
complete that agreement, bringing our total shares repurchased year-to-date to 13.1 million shares for
$750 million. This is approximately 5% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year.

Underscoring our strong financial position and confidence in the future, we now anticipate deploying
another $250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions for a full year
total of approximately $1 billion.

Finally, like I did last quarter, let me give you an update of what we are experiencing with inflation and
supply chain tightness. We continue to see escalating inflation across most of our cost basket, including
freight, resins, TiO2 and packaging.

Inbound freight container costs nearly tripled during the quarter. We now expect our all-in cost inflation to
be in the high single-digit range for the full year for both our plumbing and decorative segments, with low

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

double-digit inflation in the second half of the year. Inflation in coatings will likely be in the mid-teens later
in the fourth quarter.

To mitigate this inflation, we have secured price increases across both segments and are taking further
pricing action across our business to address these continued cost escalations. We are also working with
our suppliers, customers and internal teams to implement further productivity measures to help offset
these costs.

Despite the increased inflation, we still expect to achieve price/cost neutrality by year-end. While cost
inflation has clearly been an issue, material availability has also impacted our business. Our teams
have done a tremendous job of qualifying new suppliers, developing material substitutions and shifting
production to adapt to this dynamic environment and to serve our customers.

However, these raw material constraints have limited our ability to build inventory of many of our products
in the channels that we serve. We anticipate material availability to slowly improve in the second half of
the year, and we expect to replenish inventory to the appropriate levels over this time.

The demand for our products remained strong, and with an improved outlook for plumbing based on
the continued strength of both our North American and international operations, we are increasing our
full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, up from our
previous expectations of $3.50 to $3.70.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional detail on our second quarter results. John?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on
adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.

Turning to Slide 7. We delivered another exceptional quarter as we capitalized on strong consumer
demand, resulting in continued growth and increased backlogs. As a result, sales increased 24% with
currency and net acquisitions each contributing 3% to growth.

In local currency, North American sales increased 15% or 12% excluding acquisitions. Strong volume
growth in North American faucets, showers and spas led this outstanding performance.

In local currency, international sales increased a robust 50% or 49% excluding acquisitions and
divestitures. Gross margin was 36.3% in the quarter, up 50 basis points as we leveraged the strong
volume growth.

Our SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 16.2% due to our operating leverage.

During the quarter, certain expenses such as headcount, marketing and travel and entertainment
increased as planned. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in the third and fourth quarters as
these costs normalize.

We delivered strong second quarter operating profit of $438 million, up $94 million or 27% from last year,
with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 20.1%.

Our EPS was $1.14 in the quarter, a 34% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to volume
leverage, lower interest expense and lower share count.

Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing growth accelerated in the quarter, with sales up 53%. Currency contributed
5% to this growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed another 4%.

North American sales increased 47% in local currency or 41% excluding acquisitions. Delta led this
outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth. With its strong brand
recognition and market leadership, Delta continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product
categories and channels.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Watkins Wellness also significantly contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog
remains strong.

International plumbing sales increased 50% in local currency or 49% excluding the acquisitions and
divestitures. Hansgrohe delivered robust growth as demand continues to improve across Europe and
numerous other countries. Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China, U.K. and France, all grew strong
double digits in the quarter.

Segment operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter, with operating profit of
$274 million, up $115 million or 72%. This strong performance was driven by incremental volume and
favorable mix and cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable price/cost relationship and
higher spend on items such as travel and entertainment, marketing and growth initiatives.

During the quarter, we also completed the divestiture of HÜPPE, a small shower enclosure business based
in Germany. HÜPPE sales were approximately EUR 70 million in 2020. This transaction closed on May 31
and net proceeds were not material.

Given our second quarter results and current demand trends, we now expect plumbing segment sales
growth for 2021 to be in the 22% to 24% range, up from our previous guidance of 15% to 18%.

Finally, due to our improved sales outlook, we are increasing our full year margin expectations to
approximately 18.5%, up from our previous guide of approximately 18%.

Turning to Slide 9. Decorative architectural declined 5% for the second quarter or 6% excluding the
benefit from acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined double digits in the quarter against a healthy
high teens comp due to moderating demand and raw material supply tightness as resin plants affected
by storms in the Texas Gulf Coast region in the first quarter continue to face production challenges. We
expect these raw material headwinds to persist in the third quarter and now anticipate our DIY paint
business to be down low single digits for the full year.

To help mitigate these challenges, we are working with our existing suppliers and qualifying new sources
for materials to meet the demand of our customers, which remains strong. I want to thank our supply
chain teams, which have done an outstanding job managing through these challenges.

Our pro paint business delivered strong double-digits growth in the quarter as consumers are increasingly
willing to allow professional paint contractors in their homes. We expect demand in this channel to remain
strong and now anticipate low double-digit growth for the pro paint business for the full year, up from our
previous expectation of high single digits as pro paint contractors' order books continue to grow.

Our builders' hardware and lighting businesses each delivered growth in the quarter as they continue to
capitalize on increased consumer demand.

Segment operating margins were 22.1% and operating profit in the quarter was $188 million due to lower
volume, partially offset by cost productivity initiatives.

For full year 2021, we now expect decorative architectural segment's sales growth will be in the range of
2% to 5%, down from 4% to 9% due to lower-than-expected second quarter sales and persistent raw
material constraints.

We continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19% as productivity initiatives and
pricing help offset higher input costs.

And turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the
quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1
billion revolver.

Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 16.9%, an improvement of
120 basis points over prior year.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

As we discussed last quarter, we had terminated and annuitized our U.S. qualified -- defined benefit
plans in the second quarter and had an approximate $100 million final cash contribution to the plans to
complete this activity. This removes approximately $140 million of pension liabilities from our balance
sheet and will benefit our free cash flow by approximately $50 million to reduce cash contributions starting
in 2022.

Also, we received approximately $166 million from the redemption of our preferred stock related to the
recent sale of our former cabinet business.

Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, as of today, we repurchased 13.1 million shares in 2021 for $750
million. We expect to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the
remainder of this year.

Collectively, these actions demonstrate our confidence in our business and our commitment and ability to
further strengthen our balance sheet while aggressively returning capital to our shareholders.

Turning to our full year guidance. We have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on Slide 11.
Based on our second quarter performance and continued robust demand, we now anticipate overall sales
growth of 14% to 16%, up from 10% to 14%, with operating margins of approximately 17.5%, up from
17%.

Lastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our updated 2021 EPS estimate range of $3.65 to $3.75, represents
19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million average diluted share count for
the full year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 in our earnings deck.

With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, John. We had an outstanding second quarter, driven by our strong brands, our innovation
pipelines and most of all, our people, as demonstrated by outstanding execution by our supply chain
teams.

Our strong performance demonstrates the strength of Masco's balanced and diversified business. Masco is
a broad portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel-oriented home improvement products. Our products
are broadly distributed across geographies and channels for both consumers and professionals.

Additionally, our markets remain strong, and we expect home remodeling expenditures to drive growth in
2022.

The fundamentals of our repair and remodel business are strong, with year-over-year home price
appreciation of over 15% in May and existing home sales up over 23%. Both metrics have a strong
correlation with our sales on a lag basis. And the consumer is strong with nearly $2 trillion in savings and
an increased desire to invest in their homes.

Lastly, we continue to invest in our business and are well positioned for long-term growth. We are bringing
new, innovative products to market, fueling our growth and expanding our leading market share. And
with our leading margins and strong free cash flow, we will continue to deploy capital to reinvesting in our
business, acquiring complementary bolt-on companies and returning cash to shareholders in the form of
dividends and share repurchases, all to drive long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll now open up the call to questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I could start on, I guess, DIY coatings. It sounded like you're attributing the reduction in the revenue
guide more so to supply chain than to a real change in your demand outlook. I think you said sell-through
was better than sell-in.

So if you could just provide a little more color on that, I guess, have you found that demand in DIY
specifically is really not that different than what you previously thought? Or do you think the consumer is
pulling back a little bit more than expected there as well?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Matt, I would say that demand did moderate a bit more than we expected, but certainly, material
availability and other supply chain challenges played a role in the decline in the quarter. And of course, we
had some tough comps.

The impact of the storms in Texas in the Gulf Coast region continue to limit resin supply. But really,
this is an industry-wide phenomenon. And nearly all of our resins, as I mentioned, where suppliers
were operating under a force majeure declaration in the second quarter. There was a plant explosion, in
addition, at a supplier that supplies our [ alkyd resin ], really for the industry, but that affected us.

So we do expect -- while they're not over yet, we do expect these material availability issues to persist in
the third quarter and then slowly improve. So we now expect, as I mentioned, our sales growth to be in
the range of 2% to 5%, down from our previous expectation of 4% to 9%. I would like to reiterate that
our supply chain teams have done an outstanding job, and they'll continue to do so.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Understood. Really helpful color there. Second one is on a similar topic, but just thinking about raw
material constraints broadly. It sounded like it really did constrain your ability to build inventory beyond
just paint, if I heard you correctly, perhaps paint was most acute.

But I'm curious if you could outline kind of where else beyond paint that you think demand may have been
running ahead of what you were able to produce. And maybe any color around the timing of when you
think you can catch up from a production perspective.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

It's been pretty broad-based. I think we'd like to have more inventory in our channel, to put it very
directly.

When we think about spas, we have never had a backlog of this size in spas, and the demand continues to
be real robust.

We're doing a good job in our international front, but there's pockets in certain products where we could
afford to have some more inventory in the channel. The same is true in North American plumbing.

And we're getting in better shape. We're not all the way there yet, but we do expect to, throughout the
back half of the year, put our inventory positions in the channel back to where they belong.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is around -- you mentioned that as a result of some of the supply chain issues that you
are seeing inventories that are obviously continuing to fall and are really lean in the channel.

Can you give us sense of what this means in terms of your ability to get those inventories back up? And is
it something that potentially could kind of bleed into early 2022 now as you think about all the headwinds
that are out there?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

It's difficult to prognosticate on the future. We've seen more than just the Texas Gulf issue that we had in
resins, there was a plant explosion, as I mentioned. But I would tell you that we intend over the back half
of the year to get our inventory back in shape.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. All right. My next question is around the margins in the plumbing segment. You've delivered about
20.5% or so in the first half of the year there. The guidance though implies that the second half will come
down relative to the first half, and understanding that you've got some price cost headwinds in there and
things.

But can you just give us some more color on how we should be thinking about that relative step down?
And any thoughts on third quarter versus fourth quarter in there and some of those trends?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Susan, it's John. Maybe I'll take this one and -- so you're right, we obviously delivered very strong
margins here in the first half of the year and in the second quarter as well.

Given our guide, it does imply a little bit of a step down in margin in the back half of the year. We're
pleased with how we've executed so far.

But as we mentioned on previous calls, we do need to put some money back into the business in the form
of investments. And they'll take the form of travel and entertainment, as I mentioned, but they also take
the form of some growth initiatives.

And you may recall in some of our prior calls, we said that we thought in 2020 that we may have delayed
as much as $40 million of investment spend, just to make sure we appropriately contain costs as we were
going through the pandemic. And so as we see things begin to improve here significantly, we continue
to expect that some of that spend will return. And as I mentioned in my remarks, some of that spend
actually started to return in the second quarter as we began to make some investments in marketing and
growth initiatives.

So we believe that a lot of that spend will start to come back in the second half of the year. And that will
take additional investment in our leading brands. Some of the innovation that Keith mentioned in his
prepared remarks in service to ensure that our customers are in full supply of our products.

And so we think that, that will also contribute to future growth of the business to better meet our
customers' needs. At the same time, as we kind of alluded to in our prepared remarks, there's going
to be a little bit of a price/cost headwind as we go into the back half of the year. We've always talked
about a little bit of a lag in getting price and cost flowing through our P&L. And generally, in the plumbing

10

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

segment, it's about a 2-quarter lag. And so that's the second piece that will impact the margins in the
back half of the year.

So those 2, a little bit of an incremental spend and then also that price/cost lag. That said, we are very
confident that we'll be price/cost-neutral as we exit the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

So amazing environment you guys are operating in. Could you talk to -- obviously, there was a larger
coatings company that reported. Is there a way for you to talk to or quantify how supply/inventory is
affecting your coatings business, whether it's DIY or pro? A.

And then are you seeing -- because of those constraints, are you seeing channel shifts at all within the pro
perhaps because of those type of constraints or limited availability of coatings?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I would say that our inability to have our inventory position where we want it, say, first half compared to
what we expect in the second half was an -- had an impact on revenue. I'm going to fall short of going
down specifically quantifying [ my math ].

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's understood.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

But we think that inventory is going to help us in the back half. In terms of channel shift, we pride
ourselves on having broad distribution across multiple channels. When you look at our -- you're talking
coatings now, but if we look at plumbing, we have very strong position in retail, which is both a pro and a
consumer channel. We have a leading position in trade, which is principally more oriented towards the pro.
And then in e-commerce, which is mainly consumer, we have a leading position there.

Similar story when we look at coatings, where we have a strong pro franchise as well as we always talk
about, the strong DIY.

So we like our positioning of where we are in terms of broad channel distribution. So that if there are
particular shifts, be it pro to DIY, or online to trade, et cetera, we have it covered. And I think that's a
good, significant reason why we're able to perform in this dynamic environment.

In addition to our strong teams that have been able to address these issues, we're where our customer
wants to buy, and we're quite agnostic to these kind of shifts if they happen.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Ken, the one thing I would...

KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

But I guess...

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Keith's comments is with respect specifically to the pro, we're continuing to invest in that pro initiative. We
think that's a really strong growth driver for us over the course of the next several years. And we and our
channel partner, The Home Depot, look to continue to invest to grow the pro paint business.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes. Just sticking with that on a simple question. It seems like there might be, right, higher margins from
pro versus DIY. And could you kind of describe it? Seems like these paid initiatives, I know you always
have them, but this -- the SCUFF, I think, is how you described it.

I remember when Behr did the primer and paint, one coating, and that was quite a leadership
introduction. Do you think these latest -- like the SCUFF and some of the pro stuff is really able to pull in
more demand on that pro due to the quality compared to perhaps other competitors?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We're really proud of the Behr product development teams, research and development. We have been
on the leading edge of development really since that company started. And paint-and-primer-in-one was
a big one. We also work on commercial developments as it relates to the color selection center and being
able to match colors and those sorts of things.

So this DYNASTY introduction is one of another of a long line of things that we have demonstrated the
ability to do and will continue to do. Whether or not this is going to be as groundbreaking as paint-and-
primer-in-one, we'll see. But this is our best paint ever, no question about it. In terms of scuff resistance,
the number of one-coat hides that we have, the coatings that we have on it in terms of mildew and
antibacterial and all those other sorts of things.

So this is a very big deal for us, and I'm extremely proud of it. And I'm also -- it's what we expect and
also what we're going to continue to do.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Keith, John, I just wanted to -- first, a quick follow-up along the same lines of kind of the cadence that
was asked about margins, I guess, side, specifically with respect to dec arc.

Is the thought, given some of the supply constraints you're talking about, that 3Q ends up looking a little
similar to 2Q and then a bit of a rebound in 4Q? Or should we expect more even performance between 3Q
and 4Q because it seems like overall, the back half is expected, plus or minus, flat in that segment?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Mike. Good question. So as we look at the back half of the year, we think it's going to be a pretty
even performance across the last 6 months based on what we're seeing out in the marketplace, based
on the supply that Keith was just talking about and understanding how seasonally things flow through in
terms of demand.

So it looks like to us right now like a pretty even back half of the year.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And my second question is on capital allocation. It's great to see the buyback and the increased
guide. It does seem like just broadly speaking, there's been an uptick in M&A.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

I was wondering if you could comment about just specifically in your segments there, it seems like there
may be some assets that shake loose. What are you seeing in the pipeline? And what are you seeing in
terms of the competition for deals? Because it seems like right now, your guide is still predicated mostly
on buybacks.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Really, Mike, not a whole lot of change in terms of what we're seeing. It's been pretty similar to what
we've seen now for third part of the year.

What we have and what we're doing here at Masco is we have a new deal team. And we have a new
business development team that's been moved under John's leadership, and they're building momentum,
clearly. And doing a good job, both in terms of cultivation as well as executing the deals.

The valuations, I would say, as is broadly understood and seen is still quite high compared to historical
averages. And that really, I think, informs and was a key driver of our strategy of focusing on bolt-ons
where we need to have synergies.

So the pipeline is robust. We're moving various assets through that pipeline in terms of the evaluation. We
continue to do that, and it continues to look robust.

Having said that, we're patient. And we will make sure that these acquisitions are the right strategic fit for
us, like you see with Work Tools International's or with Kraus in plumbing on the e-commerce side that
bolsters our leadership in that channel.

So we're going to continue with our strategy. We've got an outstanding team that's working it, and we
expect to continue with this type of deal flow.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Mike, maybe just a couple of extra comments to supplement Keith. I would say that the 3 acquisitions
that we did at the end of last year are all on plan.

I mean so the working teams that -- the integration has gone well. The interaction with our existing
businesses has gone very well. And so we're -- they're right on the business case. And so we're very, very
pleased with those results.

And maybe some -- as Keith was talking about, there's a lot of activity. The pipeline is robust. And part of
the reason we've been playing at a lower -- the smaller bolt-ons is we see better value down there at this
point. As Keith mentioned, very, very robust pricing at -- in some of the larger transactions that have been
seen in the industry. And so we just think there's better value at the lower end of the middle market right
now. And so we're going to continue to play down there, I think.

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I guess a bigger picture looking out to 2022, you do have tougher comps. Certainly, a lot of favorable
secular drivers.

Do you see your growth algorithm returning back to that mid-single-digit range for the overall comp for
next year? And how do you think about growth in your DIY paint business next year?

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Well, there's no really returning to the growth algorithm, we haven't changed it. Our long-term growth
algorithm is the same. It's 3% to 5% organic growth, 1% to 3% acquisition growth. We're committed to
buy back in that range of 2% to 4% of our shares. And that puts us into that 10% EPS growth through
cycles on average, plus the dividend yield of 1% to 2%. So 11% to 12% return on our name. So that
hasn't changed.

And we believe strongly in that. We believe that we will do that and execute that from the 2021 levels.
And we'll do it in a way that we continue to expand our margins. And as we've talked before, we're not
talking multiple hundreds of basis points of margins improvement, but we continue to have very solid
drop-down in both of our businesses, call it, in that 25% to 30% range, and we don't see that changing.

And we're going to continue to generate strong free cash flow and reinvest that in our business, and
return it to the shareholder in a very careful manner that drives shareholder value. So no real change in
our algorithm, and we expect growth to continue.

What we're seeing in our product demand continues to be strong. And as I've talked about consistently
and continue to believe it and we're seeing it, the millennial entry into the home market, moving out of
the more congested cities into larger homes as families form, et cetera, is a real deal, and that's a tailwind
for us.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Any color on the outlook for DIY next year?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Phil, I guess, from my perspective, I'd think of it more of a -- as a low single-digit growth for DIY
because of the trends that Keith just cited. I mean I do think that there's a good fundamental underlying
demand out there driven by these trends.

And so returning to that kind of pre-pandemic, which we've been -- we were guiding low single-digit
growth for DIY is what we probably -- is what we expect for next year.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's super helpful. And then any color on how your channel is performing. We've seen some data points
out there that suggest retail might be seeing some normalization of trends after a pretty strong year and
perhaps a pickup in wholesale.

So just curious what you're seeing out there in terms of the channels and what that means for Masco,
appreciating you're very diversified.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Well, that's probably a good question for our channel partners, but I'll tell you that in general, we're
seeing strong demand across the board.

Certainly, in plumbing, we maintain our leadership in the retail space. Very strong position and strong
growth in trade. International, we've seen broad pickup across our international businesses, particularly in
our main markets in Central Europe and in China. So that's strong. So it's really broad-based in terms of
demand drivers, channels, geographies. We're in a good spot.

Yes, Phil, maybe a little bit more color to Keith's comments. I'd say, demand's probably -- strong growth
spread has been a little bit stronger on our trade side of our business, partly because if you think about
the second quarter of last year, most of those outlets were closed.

And so that growth is -- here in the second quarter has been quite strong. So maybe just a little bit more
color there for you.

Your next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'll start out with a broad question. As things start to return to normalcy post-COVID, especially in the last
1.5 months or so, any trends or end markets that surprised you to the positive or perhaps underpaced
your expectations? We can start there.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I think on the positive, our international growth is really solid, and that was nice to see and probably, I
would say, even a little more robust than we expected. So that was -- broadly speaking, that was positive
in terms of the overall.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Any trends that underpins your expectations?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

I'd say, Deepa, there's a couple of things that continue to, I think, trended favorably for us. The demand
for spas has been consistently strong over the course of the last several quarters. And that demand
continued here into Q2. And so we've got a good look for the balance of the year at that business.

And then even like we just mentioned, our North American trade plumbing business was extremely strong
and e-commerce as well. Those trends continue to remain very strong for us. So we're very pleased with
how the businesses are performing pretty much across the board here in the second quarter.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

In terms of -- on the downside, I think it was a little lower than we had thought. There was some
significant supply chain constrictions that we didn't anticipate.

But our pro paint was stronger than we expected. So when we look at, say, where we're going to finish '21
compared to '19 in paint, we're still up mid-teens. So it's healthy. The demand is strong, but I will say DIY
paint was a little lighter than I thought it would be.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. My follow-up is on your price/cost equation. How much of this inflation that you're talking about in
2021, you are going to take into 2022, given the lag?

Should we think about price/cost heading into 2022 would turn positive, like early 2022 probably turns
positive price/cost? Am I right in thinking that way? And two, how much -- is there a quantification of how
much inflation you're carrying into 2022 if you snap the line here on inflation?

VP & CFO

Yes, Deepa, we probably won't go into that level of specificity that you're requesting on how much we
carry into 2022. But to your general point, could -- as we look going into '22, see a little bit of a tailwind
because we got pricing costs have moderated. If they indeed just stay at the current levels, yes. I mean
that's definitely a possibility as we go into the first part of next year.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I think the main point we'd like to make and leave with is price/cost neutrality at the end of the year. And
by that, I mean that we will have actions in place, productivity improvements, working with our suppliers
to drive cost down, material substitutions and, of course, price. We will have that in place at the end of the
year that matches the inflation that we're currently seeing.

So to your point about snapping the line, at the end of the year, we'll be price/cost neutral.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with Truist.

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Within Decorative Architectural Products, could you just comment on the performance of Kichler or Liberty
Hardware? Any kind of growth number you're seeing from them in the quarter and expectations for the
second half?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Keith, both Liberty and Kichler grew in the second quarter. So they're continuing to trend.

As we laid out at our Investor Day in 2019, particularly for Kichler, we kind of identified 2020 as a year for
it to return to growth, and that's exactly what's going on in that business through the second -- end of the
second quarter. So we feel good about how Kichler and Jai are driving that business. And so we're pleased
with that.

As we look at the back half of the year, you may recall that on our third quarter call last year, we did cite
the fact that Liberty had a very, very strong quarter. And so they're going to be up against some tough
comps as they go into the back half of the year.

That said, the team down at Liberty is looking to continue to drive that business, and we're pushing them
for growth. So we'll continue to see how that plays out. But we do know that they've got a very tough
comp here in the third quarter coming up.

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then final question. I know we talked about inflation a lot but if you -- in '20 -- based on your
expectations right now in '21, if we add up all the pricing you've got, all the raw material pricing you're
seeing, will price/cost in dollars in '21 be negative? I know the run rate sounds like it's going to be at
parity to end of the year, but what about for the full year?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. Yes, Keith, I would guide you to think that, yes, that we will be negative because as we've been
saying, we think we'll be price/cost neutral towards the end of the year. So I think we've got a little bit of
price/cost to absorb here in the back half of the year before we get to that neutral position.

Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

You mentioned the investment back into the product and into the marketing. And I'm just wondering on
DIY is we're heading into a period of tougher compares. How are retailer expectations evolving, if at all,
with regards to your level of promotional channel support?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Again, that's a decision that's made by our channel partner. And obviously, we support that and we
develop that strategy together. But ultimately, it's their decision.

I would say that our promotional activity is about the same, and we'll finish out this year at about the
same as it was last year. And we, generally speaking, our channel partner likes to compete on quality and
service and brand because we're leaders in all 3 of those categories. And I don't see that changing much.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. And second question, just with respect to pricing, how much pricing should be -- or should be
achievable, I guess, through just new product introductions? It sounds like you've got a pretty substantial
new product introduction calendar lined up here. Just wondering how much pricing you should be able to
get from that as opposed to price increases on legacy product?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It varies across category. And it really is from a segment or from a channel to channel, there's
differences.

But I think if you think about it in terms of general price increases across all of our categories for the year,
in the high single-digit range for the full year, I think that's where we'll be.

And then in terms of new products, it's really not so much a price increase. It's really pricing for value,
and it depends on the new products. Some of the new stuff that we're coming out on the high end with
Axor that I talked about in my prepared remarks and in Brizo in our high-end plumbing, that is a very
high-priced segment that has good margin with it.

In other cases, where we're launching in a leaner, maybe lower price point segment, there wouldn't be as
much, let's say, pricing, if you will. So it varies.

But clearly, the lifeblood of our system here is innovation. And we continue to drive that, as you heard
from all of our new product introductions that we have in play at the moment, and that will continue.

see out of that business. And so we feel like we're in a really good position to continue to the growth
of that business, as we continue to invest in feet on the street and relationships with contractors and
getting more share of wallet with the existing contractors. So we feel really good about how that growth is
developing here.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just on Watkins, just given the strength that we saw in the quarter, I know you had
headwinds last year given the production issues in Mexico and some of the regulations that the
government was putting in place there due to COVID.

Just any color on if you're back to normal, it seems like you are and just the capacity in Watkins and what
the plan is there, just given the strength in the business?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, we're definitely starting to get back on our feet. And the production system is dialed in, and we'll
continue to increase our output.

But boy, demand is strong, and our backlog continues to be at record levels. So I think as we have the
aging population in America and a -- clearly, a more tuned in population as it relates to overall wellness,
both physical, emotional and mental health, this is a tool that really aids that. So we think there's some
fundamental tailwinds here.

And as we do across our entire business, we look at capacity and capacity expansion, and I would expect
that we'll be adding capacity here.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.

Adam Michael Baumgarten
Zelman & Associates LLC

Just curious on the paint side with raw materials, wasn't a major call out this quarter. How impactful were
higher raw materials in 2Q? And is the way to think about it that the back half is going to be where you
feel the brunt of the increases?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. So there is modest headwind in the Q2, but the more impactful part of the price/cost relationship will
be felt in the back half of the year, Adam, on that one. Because I think what Keith mentioned was we're
continuing to see escalation in costs, not only in the resin side but on TiO2, in packaging, in transportation
and logistics has been going up. So there's a lot of cost pressures that we're seeing there.

But as we continue to say, we do think that we'll continue our pricing conversations and we do believe we
can exit the year at a price/cost neutral level.

Adam Michael Baumgarten
Zelman & Associates LLC

Got it. And then just sticking with paint. You gave last quarter in 1Q, DIY was up in the teens. You kind of
talked about double-digit declines in 2Q.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

In the decorative architectural segment, curious on the sell-in expectations in the back half of the year. I
know, Keith, you commented you thought you'd make progress on inventory in the back half.

But do you expect to ship in more? And is that -- how does that link between your ability and the demand
from your retail customers to bring in more inventory?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, it's directly linked. I mean it's the relationship between that -- the retail demand and the POS and our
production capabilities.

And as we believe these challenges will get relieved over the course of the year that we'll be able to build
back -- build inventory in the channel. We also have a little bit of benefit from the DYNASTY load in.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

So does the net of that means that you -- you commented that the sell-in was less than the sell-through
in the second quarter, is there a path for that to reverse in the back half of the year or for you to make
that up in the back half of the year? Or what should we expect in terms of the relationship between those
2?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, that's right. We do expect to build inventory in the back half.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, in terms of the sell-through momentum in paint for the back half
of the year, is the expectation that it looks similar to the experience of 2Q or that it improves relative to
2Q? How should we think about that?

Yes. I think it would be similar to Q2, Eric, from what we're seeing right now in the market. Perhaps up a
little bit, maybe even a little bit better in the second half.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just want to clarify one thing with respect to your comment about sell-through being a little bit better
than sell-in. Typically, when you got supply shortages and lack of inventory on the shelves, there's a
sense that demand is materially better than what you were able to provide. But you actually said that you
thought that demand had weakened in DIY more than you had thought.

And so I was curious as to how you know that? How did you know the demand moderated if you didn't
have actually enough product to sell. And so you actually feel like you could have sold more if you have
more product. Just trying to reconcile those 2. Was it that you had an inventory decline, particularly
severe in like your most popular categories, but then in some other SKUs you just simply undersold your
expectations? Just trying to understand that a little bit better. And where do you think the customers
actually bought if they didn't buy your product because it seems like these are industry-wide supply chain
challenges?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. There was a slight impact of lost sales due to lower inventories. But I don't think we are missing a ton
of sales due to stock-out conditions.

So my point on the inventory sell-through mismatch is that there's an opportunity for us to build inventory
and to have better service. But I'm not so sure -- I wouldn't tag a whole lot of lost sales onto the
inventory position. It's more of an inventory being lower than we want. Certainly, there was some of that,
but not a whole lot.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That's clear. And then secondly, Keith, you talked about how there's a lag historically to home price
appreciation into R&R demand. But clearly, if there's anything -- one particular metric in the housing
market that is -- has completely blown away any historical comp, it is the home price appreciation, the
rapidity of it -- I mean, the broadness of it and the magnitude that we've seen already.

And I'm curious as to how you think the impact on R&R may be different as a result of this abruptness in
magnitude. Do you think that it may manifest itself a little bit more quickly? Do you think it may manifest
itself more at the high end or certain large ticket versus smaller ticket? Just wondering if you could give us
some color on how you're thinking about that now.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think a couple of things. For sure, when a family's asset in their home is worth more, they're more
likely to spend to remodel it.

And when you look at the effect of COVID, and I think that while certainly, there is some waning impacts
that will go away, there are some impacts here that are staying. And that is really how we believe the
consumer is viewing their home, that there will not be a 100% return to work. And the environment at
home is different. People are doing more things in their home, they're doing them differently, and they're
spending more time in their home.

So we think there's a couple of lasting things here in that these are catalysts. And part of the reason
why we're so robust and so happy with how we've positioned our portfolio with regards to our price point
where we enjoy small projects, do-it-yourself, and we're clearly part of the large projects that are done by
the professional.

We're in markets in Europe that are pulling up, and we're obviously well penetrated here in North America.
So the home price appreciation is a very strong indicator of a robust DIY market as is the changing view of
the consumer as it relates to the purpose of their home.

Your last question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Clearly, an interesting quarter. I was curious, a lot of focus on the paint side. I was hoping to get a little
bit more breakout of the North American plumbing business, if you could talk to -- and I apologize if I
missed this earlier in the call, talk to the trends that you've seen in retail, maybe things closer to the DIY
spectrum versus wholesale channels and how the trends have progressed there, maybe comparing it to
the -- obviously, the DIY and pro in paint?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Well, real strong trade business for us in the past quarter, and we expect that to continue. People are
more comfortable with pros coming into their home for a longer time. So it's -- we're in the throes of the
pandemic, maybe you'd let an appliance repair person in for a quick repair, but you certainly wouldn't want
someone in for a major remodel. That's changing.

And that principally, not totally, but principally flows through our trade channel. So we're seeing a nice
pickup in the trade channel.

Having said that, the dynamic of more and more pros buying in retail is very real. Certainly seeing good
foot traffic in retail. And our e-commerce business continues to do very well. And our acquisition, as
John spoke about, of Kraus is really going well. We've continued to invest in that. For example, we just
launched the Delta-branded sinks online, utilizing the Kraus' offering with the Delta brand. That's real
leverage, and that's going well.

So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing broad-based solid market demand and growth,
international, domestic, trade, retail, e-commerce, we're really hitting on all cylinders.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just for the second question to take a step back. I was hoping maybe you
could just give us a sense of the e-commerce as a possibly even as a percent of revenue across your 2
different segments.

Obviously, it lends itself a lot more to the plumbing side, decorative, and in particular, paint, a heavier
product, maybe more difficult to ship. But maybe just give us a state of where you are in both segments
and where you think you might be able to take the business over the next 2 or 3 years?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Mike, it's John. And you're right, e-commerce has been a good growth vehicle for us over the course of the
last several years. And actually, it's grown quite significantly.

And so if you think about 2019, our e-commerce sales as a percent of our total sales were roughly 5%.
And in 2020, that grew nicely. It's now -- we finished 2020 at about 9%.

And if you break that down by segment, our plumbing product sales were roughly 12% on the e-
commerce platform or channel. And as you might expect, and you kind of alluded to in your question, a
little bit lower than that in the decorative architectural segment, about 4% because of all the things you
cited. Color selection is a challenge for people still to order paint online. So we do have -- I would say that
the Behr team has done a nice job of investing in shipping and distribution and fulfillment. And so that's
not going to be a limiter to our ability to transact online. It's more of the consumer choosing to select the

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

And as we look forward, we think we're well positioned to continue to grow our e-commerce presence.
Because if you consider plumbing products, they're packaged perfectly to ship onesies, twosies to
consumers as they -- or their faucets or showerheads online. And so we think we're in a great position to
do that. The folks on at Delta have done a great job of adding the capability of the Jackson distribution
centers, they fulfill online. So we feel really good about how we were set to serve plumbing growth going
forward.

And to the extent that the paint continues to become more [ sought ] online, we're well positioned to
continue to fulfill there as well. So we really like how we're set up as this trend continues to grow here in
North America.

David Chaika
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on the call today and for your continued interest in Masco. This
concludes today's call. Thank you.
