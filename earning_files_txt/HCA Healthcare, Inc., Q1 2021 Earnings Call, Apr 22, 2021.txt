HCA HEALTHCARE, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the HCA Healthcare First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being
recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to your
Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.

W. Mark Kimbrough
Vice President of Investor Relations

All right. Thank you, Kara. Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning
is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and
then we'll take questions afterwards.

Before I turn the call over to Sam and Bill, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any
forward-looking statements. They are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks,
uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from these -- from those that
might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in
today's press release as well as in our various SEC filings.

On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP
financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net
income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release.

This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

All right. Thank you, Mark. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us. As the COVID-19
pandemic continued to surge, we started the year with strong financial results in the first quarter. The
results were driven by better-than-expected revenue growth and improved operating margins.

Revenues grew over $1.1 billion or 8.7% as compared to the prior year. This growth was generated by
highly acute inpatient volumes, better payer mix and a rebound in surgical and outpatient volumes in
March.

Generally speaking, March trends are continuing into April. Inpatient revenues increased by 12%. The
acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both case mix index, which increased 7%
and length of stay, which grew by 6%.

Additionally, commercial admits inside of our domestic operations represented 29% of total admits
compared to 26.5% last year. Commercial payer mix has been consistently around this level for the past
4 quarters. These 2 factors combined explain the 17% increase in inpatient revenue per admission. Total
admits were down 4.2% year-over-year. In comparison to 2019, admits were down approximately 3%,
which was in line with our expectations.

In the quarter, we treated almost 50,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented 10% of total
admissions. Throughout the quarter, the percentage of COVID-19 admits to total admits declined. January
was 17%; February was 8%; and March was down to almost 5%.

Outpatient revenues increased 4.7% as compared to prior year. This result is better performance than
the previous 2 quarters in which outpatient revenue was down approximately 5%. Outpatient revenues
declined in January and February, consistent with that trend, but March, which had 1 additional weekday
this year, increased by 30% as outpatient surgery and other procedures recovered strongly. Same-facility
outpatient surgery volumes grew 2.3% as compared to last year. As compared to 2019, they declined

HCA HEALTHCARE, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

3%. ER visits declined 18%. This decrease is generally consistent with the trends we experienced in the
previous 2 quarters. ER visits were down 19% compared to 2019.

Our teams continue to focus and deliver on our operating agenda. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the
company grew on a year-over-year basis and was consistent on a sequential basis with the prior quarter.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales as well as losses on debt retirement
increased 78% to $4.14.

During the quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in the home
health and hospice business of Brookdale Senior Living. This business provides us with a large platform
that complements our local provider systems. It will expand the services we offer across our networks
and provide us with more enterprise capabilities to coordinate care for our patients and improve their
experiences.

Additionally, we believe the home will become a more important setting for health care in the future with
continuing growth in demand. We anticipate this transaction will close in the third quarter, and we look
forward to our new partnership with Brookdale.

Also during the quarter, we opened 2 new hospitals, one in Denver and one in Orlando. Each of these
hospitals will strengthen our system offerings in these communities. In the second quarter, we expect to
close on the acquisitions of 2 small hospitals both of which complement our networks in Nashville and
Savannah.

And lastly, we continue to invest broadly across our networks to improve convenience, access and value
for patients by developing more outpatient facilities. The pipeline for development and acquisition in
this category remains strong. As we look to the rest of the year, we have increased our annual guidance
to reflect the first quarter's performance and better perspective on important macro factors, mainly
governmental reimbursement and economic outlooks for our markets, including uninsured assumptions.
Bill will provide more details on our guidance in his comments.

The first quarter is yet another period where the disciplined operating culture and strong execution by
our teams were on display. I want to thank our 275,000 colleagues and 50,000 physicians for their
tremendous work. We could not have performed at this level without their unwavering commitment to our
patients and the communities we serve. As we continue to resource and execute on our strategic agenda,
we will remain true to our mission of improving lives and delivering on the responsibilities we have to all
our stakeholders.

And now I'll turn the call over to Bill.

William B. Rutherford
Executive VP & CFO

Good morning, everyone. Sam spoke to many of our operating metrics and results. So I will discuss our
cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter, then review our updated 2021 guidance. As
a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.99
billion, as compared to $1.375 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Capital spending for the quarter was
$654 million, and we completed just over $1.5 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have
approximately $7.3 billion remaining on our authorization. And consistent with our year-end discussion,
we are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021, subject to market conditions. Our debt to
adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.85x, and we had approximately $5.6 billion of available liquidity at the
end of the quarter.

As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We expect
revenue to range between $54 billion and $55.5 billion. We expect full year EBITDA to range between
$10.85 billion and $11.35 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $13.30
and $14.30 and our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion. Our revised guidance
considers the strong results in the first quarter and also considers the extension of the public health
emergency and the deferral of sequestration reductions through the end of the year.

HCA HEALTHCARE, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

In summary, we recognize some uncertainties remain as we go through the rest of the year, but we are
confident in the company's ability to manage through various business cycles, and we are well positioned
to continue to invest capital to capture growth opportunities and execute on acquisition opportunities if
they become available.

So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and then open up for Q&A.

W. Mark Kimbrough
Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

[Operator Instructions]

Your first question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

[Technical Difficulty]

W. Mark Kimbrough
Vice President of Investor Relations

Pito, you're breaking up, I can't hear you. Kara, let's try the next one. Pito, try calling back in.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess my question would be on guidance. I guess, first a clarification. Your guidance, I assume, does
not include the 2 deals you expect in Q2 or the Brookdale acquisition, but then more to the point as far
as guidance. How do you think about the upside? Because it sounded like a lot of the raise is because of
sequestration and the extension of the health emergency. I mean how much of this outperformance and
guidance rate do you think of as kind of onetime versus things that we should be thinking about as you
having a better visibility into future growth in 2022 and 2023.

William B. Rutherford
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Kevin. Kevin, let me answer that. First, you're right. The acquisitions for the balance of the
year are not included in our expectations, but we don't expect that material contribution from those for
this year. Relative to our increase in guidance, largely due to the strong performance that we had in the
first quarter is the driver of that. As Sam talked, we have some insight into March and the read-through
through April. And then we did consider the continuation of the deferral of sequestration through the
balance of the year. And we know the public health emergency got extended at least through 90 days
through July. So the majority of the guidance range is a result of our performance from the first quarter
and considers the extension of the sequestration on there. So as we've talked about at our year-end call,
there's still big variables out there, but the way we're reading the environment right now is generally
positive.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.

Frank George Morgan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Obviously, big expansion year-over-year and you sustained nice margins from the previous quarter. But
can you just give us any more color around the dynamics of your ability to continue to manage costs
this way? I mean it really looked like it was across everything, labor supplies, other. Is it more a function
of just the top line growth? Or is there something structural on the cost side that's allowing you to take
advantage of having flex labor. Just any color there would be appreciated.

HCA HEALTHCARE, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Frank, this is Bill. I'll start. I think the margin is primarily attributable to the top line with the revenue
and the acuity and the payer mix that we had. But we continue to be focused on looking for efficiencies
throughout the company, as we've talked about our resiliency plans in the past. And so those efforts
continue, and many of them are well underway in almost every category. And so that is a part of the
performance of the company. But the margins clearly are being helped by both the acuity and the payer
mix and the revenue per adjusted admission that we're seeing. But as we've talked about multiple times,
we are continuing to look for as much efficiency as we can as we go through different cycles. And many of
those efforts continue to be underway.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

Bill, if I can just add to that. Our cost per adjusted patient day was in line with our expectations and
actually slightly underneath that. And so we were only seeing in the face of really a difficult labor market,
3% growth in cost per adjusted patient day. So I think It's a combination of both, but obviously, with the
mix, that helps, Frank.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Maybe just ask a little bit more about the capital deployment opportunities. I know last quarterly call,
you guys had mentioned potentially looking at some post-acute care dynamic. And then obviously, you've
had the announcement about Brookdale. Perhaps that was what you were alluding to last quarter. But
maybe talk about your appetite there and whether you're seeing broader health system. I know you got
2 hospital deals, but maybe broader health systems, there was some thought that they might look to
partner up coming out of the pandemic? Or have you seen any uptick in activity there?

And then finally, on this capital deployment, spending around your CapEx. Are you moving -- I mean
you're still emphasizing access points, but I wondered whether investments in ER, for example, might be
diminished given what we've seen coming out of the pandemic and less ER activity, maybe you've diverted
some of that money elsewhere. So just some comments on capital deployment opportunities.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

Okay. A.J., this is Sam. I'll try to respond to those. I remember all the elements. On post-acute, let
me speak to that. Obviously, home care opportunity and hospice opportunity to us, we believe, is a
significant expansion of the services we offer. And the opportunities for integrating those patients who
are discharged and we discharge about 250,000 patients a year into home care creates an opportunity
for us to coordinate care better, stay connected to the patient after they leave our facilities and ultimately
integrate them more effectively in the HCA health care system. So we see a nice broad opportunity. We
believe home care provides multiple channels of value for us some of which are in the discharges that we
talked about, some of it's in better case management and discharge planning and some of it is staying
connected to the patient when they repurchase health care.

Also on post-acute, we mentioned before because of the CON relaxation in Florida, we have made a
large commitment to inpatient rehabilitation facilities in the state of Florida, where we have the greatest
opportunity to do the same thing with rehab. So we've invested somewhere between $250 million and
$300 million or we are investing rather in developing rehab services in the state of Florida, which will
expand the offerings in those markets to our patients and support our systems. So we still see potential
in both of those areas to expand into more significant relationships with Medicare Advantage payers
potentially on post-acute. So it creates opportunities for us in multiple ways.

HCA HEALTHCARE, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

As it relates to our capital spending, as we mentioned in our guidance for 2021, we are increasing our
capital budget to somewhere around $3.7 billion. Much of that increase is related to growth projects where
we are expanding at facilities where we need to expand. We're still running the company north of 70%
inpatient occupancy and many of our facilities are north of that. And so in order for us to capitalize on this
differentiated portfolio we have, where we believe our markets have unique growth prospects because
of great economies, population growth and so forth, we need to create capacity both on the inpatient in
certain circumstances and build out the networks additionally with outpatient facilities as we mentioned.

With respect to ER specifically, we do see ample supply, generally speaking, with our ER beds today. We
will have some continued investments in emergency room supply and capacity across certain markets
because: number one, in some cases, we need it. We continue to operate at high levels; or two, we
have freestanding emergency room opportunities. And we will invest in those, but they're not nearly as
significant as they were 5 years ago when we were investing more heavily in that. So that flexibility will
allow us to invest in ambulatory surgery centers where we have a tremendously strong pipeline for new
development. I think we have 10 or 12 new ambulatory surgery centers that are under development.
We have a robust pipeline in that particular category as well. And then we will also invest in urgent care,
recognizing that, that continues to serve a role in building out the capabilities inside of our markets.

As it pertains to M&A, I do think there are going to be opportunities. As we've mentioned in the past, they
come when they come. It's hard for us to predict. We are fortunate to have a balance sheet that can take
advantage of those opportunities as presented. We have an enterprise chassis, if you will, that is built to
be bigger and to bolt on new opportunities and create synergies and value inside of those systems. And so
we will continue to look for those as they develop and hopefully find opportunities that make sense for us.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Can you guys hear me now?

W. Mark Kimbrough
Vice President of Investor Relations

We can hear you.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Can you give us the components of the 2021 guidance raise? How much is due to the strong first quarter?
How much is due to additional government funding and any changes to the back half of the year? And as
you look at the margins in the back half of the year, you'll face tough comps and good pricing and mix due
to COVID. Can you help us walk through the gives and takes that are on the assumptions for margins,
including the payer mix, cyclical trends and labor costs?

William B. Rutherford
Executive VP & CFO

Pito, so this is Bill. Let me try to zero in on that. As I answered Kevin's, majority was due to the strong
performance. We understand we beat our expectations and depending on your number anywhere from
$300 million to $400 million that we expected the first half of the year to be stronger than the second
half, but it still outpaced our expectations. The sequestration extension for the end of the year is probably
worth anywhere from $40 million to $50 million a quarter. So that added. We originally did not anticipate
that continuing past the first quarter. So that's an element of the raise, too. So if you look at the midpoint,
our raise was $500 million. You could say it's probably $350 million to $400 million from our performance
and then the balance through these government extensions, if you want to have specifics on that. But we
also have a range with variables that are -- that continue to play out.

HCA HEALTHCARE, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

On the margin question, yes, you're right. And when we gave our year-end guidance, we said we
anticipate our margins to likely look a lot like the full year 2020 as we began to kind of see the second
half of 2020, really with the strength of the payer mix and acuity. So we're very pleased with where we
stand with that. We'll continue to evaluate as the year goes on. But I think the balance of our guidance, I
reflect back to our discussion at the end of the year. So the raise really is the consideration of the strong
performance in the first quarter plus the continuation of the government support.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

And Bill, this is Sam. Let me add one thing to that. I mentioned just a second ago that I think we have a
differentiated portfolio. And inside of that differentiation, we believe that the growth prospects for Austin,
Texas; Dallas, Texas; Miami, Florida, places like that are much better than the national average and so we
continue to see job growth.

The other thing I would point to is that the increase in enrollment through the exchanges is a very positive
dynamic, and we see further opportunities for improvement in that particular dynamic as there's more
money supporting navigation and other support for individuals who have lost their jobs. Our participation
in exchange product has improved year-over-year and actually significantly improved over 2, 3, 4 years to
where we have roughly 80% access to exchange lives across HCA markets today which is quite different
than what it was maybe 3, 4 years ago. So as more people get enrolled there, we think the support, and
this is one of the things we've talked about in the past, how does the Affordable Care Act provides support
in a recessionary cycle, and it seems to be providing solid support. And as we look forward, that is an area
that we find to be a positive dynamic as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So outpatient surgery, up 2.3% stands out. Maybe just what's driving that category to kind of buck the
negative volume trends? And then I think, Sam, you mentioned 30% on the outpatient side in March.
Obviously, that's a pretty hefty number. So just hoping you can give more detail on the categories there
and maybe the impact of the influence of weather? I'm assuming some of that may be pulled forward from
week of February. But any commentary on that would be helpful.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

I think, obviously, the March this year had a favorable calendar. We had one more work day than we did
last year. Last year, obviously, we shut down the company for the most part, midway through the month.
But when we look at March 2019, we saw activity levels that were consistent on a per business day. So the
outpatient surgery activity in March of 2019 per business day was pretty much identical to the outpatient
surgical volume per business day in 2021. It's probably a little bit of pull-through from February storms.
But for the most part, we were up and operational in a week in the state of Texas, which was a remarkable
feat on the part of our teams. And so I don't know exactly how much of that was storm related. It's hard
to really pinpoint that.

But we're seeing, obviously, a little migration from inpatient to outpatient, which has continued from
1 year to the next, and that's influencing our outpatient statistics also. But when I look broadly across
outpatient volumes, not just surgical, cardiac volume, very strong performance in electrophysiology on
the cardiac side, recovery in endoscopic procedures on the outpatient side. So some of the diagnostic
activity, which we believed had been deferred, it showed itself a little bit in March in ways that we hadn't
seen maybe in other months in the latter part of 2020. So we're encouraged by that. As I mentioned in my
comments, we're seeing some pull-through into April that's very similar. And we'll continue to monitor this
and report out on it and give you a better feel as we get further into the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So I just want to ask about 2 things as we're starting to move into a kind of post-COVID impacted period.
Was interested in both what are you able to do from a capacity expansion standpoint kind of within
facilities and within outpatient to accommodate more volumes, kind of the catch up on deferred care
maybe for the second half of the year to understand how that capacity could expand?

And then just also interested in bad debt, how that's performed during this period. And any activities
you've taken as far as kind of collection or other sort of processes to deal with that and how that looks
going forward?

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

Okay. Let me take the first one. I'll kick the second one to Bill. I think with respect to capacity
management, a couple of things. One, as I mentioned, we're investing to expand capacity where we
believe appropriate, both inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, whatever the case may be, we have a
very sophisticated analytical methodology to determining where do we have constraints and where do we
have opportunities to relieve those constraints with investments and so forth.

But the second thing I would say, and I think this is an important point, and it's a learning that we
experienced during the COVID year, I'll call it, 2020 in the first part of this year. The ability to manage our
capacity in order to deal with the different surges that we experienced required us to hone our discharge
planning process and case management functions at time to create flexibility with the capacity that
we do have. So if we were to see a spike in deferred care starting to show itself, I think the learnings
operationally and from a capacity management standpoint, that we experienced and gained during the
COVID surges will help us in responding to that particular situation. So those are the 2 approaches that
we're doing to deal with potential growth in demand. And we still continue to believe that long-term health
care demand is there. And it will be there in the future and our systems are durable and built for that as
we continue to move through these different periods. Bill?

William B. Rutherford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the bad debt and the uninsured, I think as we reported in the past, we've continued to see
declines in our uninsured volume as the COVID pandemic began to show itself all throughout the last
3 quarters of last year, and that continues into the first quarter. And those uninsured declines were
greater than our total. So some of that is also due to we are receiving some HRSA payments for some
reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients. So all of those have resulted that our uncompensated care
levels are actually below where we were running prior year. And we don't see any material developing
trends in that category. So we're very pleased with where we stand relative to the bad debts and the
uncompensated care position.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I had a follow-up question actually on just on the home health strategy. I'm interested if you guys had
mentioned the interesting statistic that you have around 250,000 patients to start annually directly into
the home. Interested if you've been able to evaluate what percentage of those patients would be covered
by the existing Brookdale Home Health footprint. And then as you think about markets where you have

-- don't have the overlap with Brookdale, whether you would look to scale up that asset or whether you
would consider pursuing additional strategic relationships with other HH providers?

William B. Rutherford
Executive VP & CFO

Scott, on the Brookdale, roughly 60% to 70% of their agencies have overlap in our markets. So obviously,
that was an attractive strategic component of the acquisition. And as we work through the acquisition
integration, we're going to explore that even further. Relative to agencies that reside in non-HCA markets,
we'll still evaluate what is the appropriate course of action. And if there are partnership opportunities,
we may pursue those, but we'll still take that and consider that as we go through the completion of the
transaction.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.

Brian Gil Tanquilut
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I guess my question for you, Sam, as we start seeing this pace of recovery, how are you thinking about
remaining pent-up demand in the market? And then as we talked about payer mix earlier, what can you
share with us in terms of the mix of patients you're seeing both on the kinds of procedures we're seeing
with the recovery in March and April and the payer mix bucket that we're seeing? Is it shifting back to
more Medicare, more uninsured, more Medicaid. I just want to see if you can give us some color on what
the recovery looks like right now.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think it's still early to land on exactly what the recovery is looking like. If you look at the 2
elements of our business where we saw significant drop-off, pediatric activity on one side and then
obviously, Medicare activity on the other. So the middle piece, if you want to call it that, is what has been
most durable. Having said that, most of our outpatient business that was deferred is that middle piece.
Some of the inpatient that we have lost is the outer shoulders, the pediatric and the Medicare side of
the equation. So I don't really have a good sense of what's going to happen on the Medicare side. We're
starting to see more pediatric activity in the month of March. It wasn't down as much as it was in previous
periods. which reflects, I think, kids going back to school in many communities, activity starting to happen
again with spring sports and such, and we're seeing a little bit more traffic in our emergency rooms
related to pediatric volume.

But I think on the outpatient side, which is where most of the deferred care, we believe, was, that is
largely a commercial book of business. 55% of our revenues or so on the outpatient side is commercial
related. And as that starts to develop, we think that will be probably what shows itself from the deferred
care, but it's still early. Obviously, there's still uptake with vaccines. There's still concerns with COVID
from one community to the other. And all of that could create some choppiness to it all, but we need a few
more months to really judge exactly what that rebound is going to be, but we're encouraged, again, by
March. We're encouraged by the early view into April and we're hopeful that, that sustains itself over the
remainder of this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.

Wolfe Research, LLC

I am going to try to squeeze in 2 quick numbers questions here if that's okay. First, given the meaningful
shift in 2021 numbers, obviously, they're positive. Wanted to ask about the right jumping off point going in
2022 in terms of moving parts. I mean, obviously, what I could think of is sequestration is probably going

to come back, maybe offset by some acquisition benefits, et cetera. So If you can run through that, that
would be great. And then on the commercial mix shift, given how dramatic it's been. I was wondering if
you have any ability to parse that out in terms of market share gains versus just the population shift in
younger people moving south into your markets? And simply just less deferred care among commercial
populations versus maybe Medicare?

William B. Rutherford
Executive VP & CFO

Justin, I'll start with the first one. It's early for us to be thinking about the variables going into 2022 as we
were just talking about trying to get a read on how the recovery period, if you will, or how the business
settles once COVID gets to a normalized level. So it's just a little early to think about the puts and takes
of 2022. We don't have insight into government funding beyond this year at this stage. So give us another
quarter or 2. And then as we near the completion of the year, we'll be able to talk to you about our view of
the trends we're seeing currently as far as how they roll into 2022.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

And Justin, this is Sam. On the market share, we are operating at an all-time high on market share based
upon the most currently available data we have, which is the end of the third quarter for 2020, and we're
pushing the overall market share for the company across the 43 domestic markets into the low 27%
zone, so very high watermark. On the commercial side of the equation, We have, in fact, gained market
share on the commercial at an even faster pace. I don't know exactly how that's playing out in the fourth
quarter, in the first quarter. But we have seen trends that are more positive for our company on that
particular front than our overall trends. And I think that's been part of our results. And we continue to
evolve our physician strategy, our service line strategies, our outreach strategies and so forth toward the
commercial book of business as you would expect, and we believe it's yielding positive results for the
company.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

Just had a quick one on CapEx. It looks like CapEx was actually down almost $200 million year-over-year
in the first quarter, even though you are guiding to considerably higher CapEx for the full year? So I was
just wondering what caused that decline this quarter. And I wanted to see what the thinking was on how
CapEx would ramp through the balance of 2021.

William B. Rutherford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. This is Bill. We understand it was below. Some of that is the capital program starting. We're
repopulating the pipeline with approvals and so the spending of that you didn't see in the first quarter. We
still believe that our capital spending will approximate this $3.7 billion, maybe a little bit on either side
of that. And so we do anticipate the capital, the actual spend to ramp as we go throughout the year, and
we'll just have to continue to evaluate that. So ultimately, I think what you're seeing in the first quarter is
as we slowed down capital in 2020, as we began reimplementing some of our capital programs, just the
spending didn't occur at that same level. But we still believe $3.7 billion is the right number here. Just
timing on how the capital gets spent.

I have an exciting opportunity for you. I'm going to ask 2 questions, and you can either answer both or
pick one. We'll catch up on the other offline. So dealers choice.

So my first question is, if we look at your assumptions for the back half of the year, my hypothesis is
that certainly, Medicare will grow faster than commercial, but both buckets, if we measure by adjusted
admissions will grow just commercial at a lower rate. Is that consistent with your assumptions?

And my second question is what is -- what are your top 2 or 3 public policy priorities in D.C. given the new
administration?

William B. Rutherford
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. John, let me take the first one. Our assumptions throughout the year, just consistent with our year-
end is that we do expect a recovery of our historical business to return. As we see COVID settle to a level,
as we hope broader populations get vaccinated, that we'll begin to see this return. So we do expect some
growth to occur from where we are now as we go through the year. And I think that is reflected in our full
year guidance.

The exact timing and the pacing of that is unclear. But we do expect throughout the year, there will be a
recovery, and we'll return to some historical level of pattern for us. And that would likely occur through all
payer classes in Medicare as well as the commercial as we've talked about.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

And we're going to play both of your cards. So the question around...

John Wilson Ransom
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Like a dream come -- it's like a dream come true for me.

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

Just for you, John, just for you. You should have asked 3 questions. On the public policy front, I think,
obviously, we're focused in on health policy. And it's our belief that the Affordable Care Act is providing the
support for the country that it was intended to do, and we're hopeful that we can maintain policies that
provide that kind of protection for people so they have the coverage and access they need.

And then the second area would be around tax policy. Obviously, we're a taxpaying health care system as
compared to many of our competitors who aren't and paying and focusing in on getting to the right tax
policy is important to us. This has been the 2 categories that we're focused on.

Your final question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.

Jamie Aaron Perse
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

You mentioned the March trends and that continuing into April. I wanted to try, does that mean the
volume levels were similar in March and heading into April or that the recovery curve is progressing in
April.

And then more forward-looking, just what leading indicators do you look at, whether it's primary care
utilization or non-COVID diagnostic trends that might give us some color on where volumes might go from
here.

I think for the comment around April is a general observation about our business as a whole. And some of
the aspects of our March activity and results is carrying forward into April. That's really all I'm going to say
at this particular point in time. What was the second question again about?

W. Mark Kimbrough
Vice President of Investor Relations

Leading indicators?

Samuel N. Hazen
Chief Executive Officer

Okay. We use our physician practices as a source of leading indicators, if you will. And we're starting to
see new patient activity grow. I want to say, in the month of March, new patient activity. Some of this is
business day driven, was up 17% over the previous year. And that's a pretty significant indicator of future
activity. That occurred across a variety of specialties. We employ roughly 7,500 to 8,000 physicians. And
so we're seeing activity within new patient rosters and new patient activity show up in our clinics. And as
I mentioned also, our emergency room activity has started to grow a little bit from where it was in the low
point in 2020 and during the COVID periods. So those are 2 leading indicators that I would suggest are
indicative of maybe more activity starting to percolate in the markets.

Operator

And there are no more questions at this time.

W. Mark Kimbrough

there are additional questions that you might have. But have a safe day. Thank you.
