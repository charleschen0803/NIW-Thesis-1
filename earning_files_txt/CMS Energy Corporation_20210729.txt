CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy Second Quarter 2021 Results. The earnings
news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's
website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Just a
reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12 p.m. Eastern Time,
running through August 5. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's
website in the Investor Relations section.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Srikanth Maddipati
VP of IR & Treasurer

Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick
Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer.

This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please
refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially.

This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most
directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.

Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. It's great to be with you, and we thank you for
your continued interest and support. I'm going to start today with the end in mind, strong quarter and a
great first half of the year, giving us confidence as we target the high end of the guidance range. Rejji will
walk through the details of the quarter, and I'll share what the strong results mean for 2021 earnings.

Needless to say, I'm very pleased. An important gene sale of EnerBank at 3x book value, moving from
noncore to the core business with a strong focus on regulated utility growth. The sale of the bank provides
for greater financial flexibility, eliminating planned equity issuance from 2022 to 2024. And in the end,
Reggie will share how we have reduced our equity issuance need for 2021 in today's remarks.

Furthermore, with the filing of our integrated resource plan, you can see the path for more than $1
billion into the utility, again, without equity issuance. Not only is there visibility to that investment, that's
certainly in the time line for review. I'm excited about this IRP. It's a remarkable plan. Many have set net
zero goals. We have industry-leading net 0 goals and this IRP provides a path and is an important proof
point in our commitment. We are leading the clean energy transformation. It starts with our investment
thesis. This simple but intentional approach has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach
going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue
to deliver on our financial objectives. With the sale of EnerBank and the plan to exit coal by 2025, our
investment thesis gets even simpler. But now it's also cleaner and leaner. We continue to mature and
strengthen our lean operating system, the CE Way, which delivers value by reducing cost and improving
quality, ensuring affordability for our customers, and our thesis is further strengthened by Michigan's
[ supportive ] regulatory construct. All of this supports our long-term adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%,
and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. All of this
remains solidly grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. As I
mentioned, our integrated resource plan provides the proof points to our investment thesis, our net 0

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

commitments and highlights our commitment to the triple bottom line by accelerating our decarbonization
efforts, making us one of the first utility in the nation to exit coal or increasing our renewable build-out,
adding about 8 gigawatts of solar by 2040, 2 gigawatts from the previous plan.

Furthermore, this plan ensures reliability, a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on
the grid. The purchase of over 2 gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and
dramatically reduces our carbon footprint. Existing natural gas generation is key. And like we've done
historically with the purchases of our Zeeland and Jackson generating stations. This is a sweet spot for us
where we reduce permitting, construction and start-up risk. It is also thoughtful and that is not a 40- to
50-year commitment that you would get with a new asset, which we believe is important, as we transition
to net 0 carbon.

And, yes, on other hand, our plan is affordable for our customers. It will generate $650 million of savings,
essentially paying for our transition to clean energy. This is truly a remarkable plan. It is carefully
considered and data-driven. We've analyzed hundreds of scenarios with different sensitivities and our
plan was thoughtfully developed with extensive stakeholder engagement. I couldn't be more proud of this
plan and especially the team that put it together. We've done our homework, and I'm confident it is the
best plan for our customers, our coworkers, for great state of Michigan, of course, you, our investors to
hit the triple bottom line. The Integrated Resource Plan is a key element of Michigan's strong regulatory
construct, which is known across the industry as one of the best. It is a result of legislation designed to
ensure a primary recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe and reliable energy in our state.
Michigan's forward-looking test years and the 3-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process is visibility
on our future growth. It enables us and the commission to align on long-term generation planning and
provide greater certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. We anticipate an initial order for
the IRP from the commission in April and a final order in June of next year.

The visibility provided by Michigan's regulatory construct enables us to grow our capital plan to make the
needed investments on our system. On Slide 6, you can see that our 5-year capital plan has grown every
year. Our current 5-year plan, which we'll update on our year-end call includes $13.2 billion of needed
customer investment. It does not contain the upside in our IRP. The IRP provides a clear line of sight to
the timing and composition of an incremental $1.3 billion of opportunity. And as I shared on the previous
slide, the regulatory construct provides timely approval of future capital expenditures. I really like this
path forward.

And beyond our IRP, there is plenty of opportunity for our 5-year capital plan to grow given the customer
investment opportunities we have in our 10-year plan. Our backlog of needing investments is as vast as
our system, which serves nearly 7 million people in all

68 counties of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We see industry-leading growth continuing well into the future.

So where does that put us today? As I stated in my opening remarks, we had a strong quarter and a great
first half of the year. The bank sale and now the IRP filing provide important context for our future growth
and positioning of the business. Let me share my confidence. For 2021, we are focused on delivering
adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.61 to $2.65 per share, and we expect to deliver
toward the high end of that range. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85
to $2.87 per share. Given the strong performance we are seeing this year, the reduced financing needs
next year and continued investments in the utility, there is upward momentum as we move forward.

Now many of you have asked about the dividend. We are reaffirming again no change to the $1.74
dividend for 2021. As we move forward, we are committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings
with a target payout ratio of about 60%.

While we are not going to provide 2022 dividend guidance on this call, I want to be very clear, we are
committed to growing the dividend in 2022. It's what you expect, it's what you own it, and it is big part
of our value. I will offer this. Our target payout ratio does not need to be achieved immediately, it will
happen naturally, as we grow our earning.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Finally, I want to touch on long-term growth rate, which is 6% to 8%. This has not changed. It's driven
by the capital investment needs of our system, our customers' affordability and the need for a healthy
balance sheet to fund those investments. Historically, we've grown at 7%. But as we redeploy the
proceeds from the bank, we will deliver toward the high end through 2025. I'll also remind you that we
tend to rebase higher off of actuals. We have historically either met or exceeded our guidance. All in, a
strong quarter, positioned well for 2021 with upward momentum and with EnerBank and the IRP, it all
comes together nicely positioned for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to discuss the
details of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings. Rejji?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. Before I walk through the details of our financial results
for the quarter, you'll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance
of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment and adjusting
our quarterly and year-to-date results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. And
while we're on EnerBank, I'll share that the sale process continues to progress nicely, as the merger
application was filed in June with the various federal and state regulators will be evaluating the transaction
for approval, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year.

Moving on to continuing operations. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $158
million or $0.55 per share, which excludes $0.07 from EnerBank. For comparative purposes, our second
quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.09 above our second quarter 2020 results,
exclusive of EnerBank's EPS contribution last year.

The key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter were rate relief, net of investment-related
expenses, recovering commercial and industrial sales and the usual strong tax planning. Year-to-date,
we delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of $472 million or $1.64 per share, which
excludes $0.19 per share from EnerBank and is up $0.37 per share versus the first half of 2020, assuming
a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations.

All in, we're tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date, which offers great
financial flexibility for the second half of the year. The waterfall chart on Slide 9 provides more detail on
the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. As a reminder, this walk excludes
the financial performance of EnerBank.

For the first half of 2021, rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance
to the tune of $0.36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of
2020 for electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-
related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs [ at ] the utility.
The rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating
and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and
decarbonization.

As a reminder, these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to $0.06 per share of negative
variance versus 2020. It is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings realized to
date, largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the CE Way, which are ahead of plan. We also
benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.06 per
share and recovering commercial and industrial sales, which coupled with solid tax planning provided
$0.01 per share of positive variance in aggregate. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we
feel quite good about the glide path to delivering towards the high end of our EPS guidance range, as
Garrick noted. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.02 per share
of negative variance, given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020.
We'll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief, which equates to $0.12 per share of
pickup. And I'll remind you, is not subject to any further MPSC actions. We also continue to execute on
our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate will have a financial impact of $0.21
per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments
in the second half of the year. We have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility nonweather sales

assumptions and our nonutility segment performance, which as a reminder, now excludes EnerBank. All in,
we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021.

Turning to our financing plan for the year. I'm pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of $230
million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4.2%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred
offering of its kind. This transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs of CMS Energy, our parent
company for the year and given the high level of equity content ascribed to the security by the rating
agencies, we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to $100 million from up
to $250 million. As a reminder, over half of the $100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year
are already contracted via equity forwards.

It is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the EnerBank merger agreement in the event
EnerBank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction, we would have
a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing, which could
further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022. Closing out
the financing plan, I'll also highlight that we recently extended our long-term credit facilities by 1 year to
2024, both at the parent and the utility.

Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that later today, we'll file our 10-Q, which will be the last 10-Q
owned by Glenn Barba, our Chief Accounting Officer, who most of you know from his days leading our IR
team. Glenn announced his retirement earlier this year after serving admirably for nearly 25 years at CMS,
which included him signing over 75 quarterly SEC filings during his tenure.

Glenn, thank you for your wonderful service to CMS. You certainly left it better than you found it, and we
wish you the very best in this next chapter in your life. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for
some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A.

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Rejji, and thank you, Glenn, for your service. As we've highlighted today, we've had a great first
half of the year. We are pleased to have delivered such strong results. We're positioned well to continue
that momentum into the second half of the year as we focus on finalizing the sale of the bank and moving
through the IRP process. I'm proud to lead this great team, and we can't wait to share our success as we
move forward together. This is an exciting time at CMS Energy. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for
Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to start, you mentioned growing earnings at the high end of the 6% to 8% range, and kind
of as the proceeds get redeployed here over time. Just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more.
If there's any more color you can provide on how to think about the timing here? It seems like a lot of
opportunity with the IRP. But how should we think about the high end? I mean basically, I'm trying to
think what type of glide path could we see where the earnings trajectory could overlap, I guess, pre
EnerBank guide at that point?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Jerry, I think you said some key words, opportunity in one word I'd add -- or 2 words, I guess, I would
add to that is, upward momentum. And so off of 2022, 6% to 8%, we're going to [ lever ] toward the high
end of that through 2025. And then when I think about the IRP, there's obviously 2 big tranches, let's
say, Covert in 2023 and the acquisition of that facility and also the enterprise facilities on 2025. Those are
incremental to the plan, to the capital plan. And those strengthen and lengthen that growth through that
time period. And so again, I feel confident in our ability to deliver on that. And I think this is a great plan
with upward momentum as we look at that time period from 2022 to 2025.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And then I know we're early in the IRP process here. But just wondering if you
could expand a bit more, I guess, on early stakeholder feedback and just your thoughts at this point?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Jeremy, I wish you could see my face. I've got a big grin on my face. I'm smiling. I'd love to have a case
leader, there's no pushback and there's no intervenors. That happened with every case, as you well know.
But here's why I see the IRP.

There's a win in here. And this is why it's a remarkable plan. There is a win for everyone of the interveners
or stakeholders. When I think about the environmental community, 60% reduction in CO2, well above and
beyond the requirements of the Paris accord, the 2-degree and the 1.5-degree scenario, well above and
beyond what Biden proposed for 2030. So a big win for the environmental community in there.

And big win for our customers, affordability $650 million of savings. That's a great opportunity. Reliability
of maybe better stated resiliency of the electric grid. This is a more reliable plan than our previous IRP.
We've done more homework to ensure that we don't have Texas like situation as we look forward to the
future with intermittent resource. I feel really great about that. And then for our investors, over $1 billion
incremental investment, the ability to treat these assets -- [indiscernible] securitization is [indiscernible],
the ability to treat these assets, the existing assets and the book value as a regulatory asset process. I
feel really good there's a winning here for everyone. And then there's a win for everyone. The opportunity
to reach settlement. And even if it's not settlement to go to a whole distance, I feel really good about that.
And just one last reminder on this. 2018 IRP

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Our next question today comes from Insoo Kim Goldman Sachs.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just first question is on.

[Audio Gap]

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

That's exactly what we stated 6 to 8. We expect to deliver toward the high end and the IRP cohort and
those enterprises assets strengthen and lengthen that path. So absolutely.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then just -- so picking the IRP [ side ], you've been so consistent in achieving that 10%
range like clockwork for a long time. I guess, going to that upper end, again, excluding the IRP, what kind
of gives you confidence that maybe that could -- what the longer-term run rate could be of that type of
growth rate?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'd actually started with this year in 2021. This momentum that we have right now carries into 2022.
Hopefully, you heard that in our comments from the $2.85 to $2.87, and we'll continue to revisit that on
the quarterly calls. But again, that carries into this plan. And remember what we do, we rebase off that
source. So we deliver, we either meet or exceed guidance. And then that's the point where we rebase off
of. And so it's that compounding effect that you've seen time and time again. And so that's an important
piece of it. But also we think about the entire triple bottom line. And so I think a great example of this
IRP, we're going to put $1.3 billion in, and it saves our customers $650 million. That's at CE Way mindset
coming play, making these investments, attacking the cost stack, share of wallets 3%. It was 4% went
to 3% share wallet. So we balance all those things, the affordability, the balance sheet and make this
come together. So again, I feel really confident about our glide path forward. And Rejji, might have some
comments on that as well.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Insoo, the only thing I would add to Garrick's good comments is, as you think longer term, we noted in
the IRP that we intend to do about 8 gigawatts of solar new build, and that's about 2 gigawatts higher
than the prior plan. And so that creates additional capital investment opportunities. We're assuming it's a
similar construct where it's about 50% owned and 50% contracted.

However, if we continue to be more and more cost competitive, that could create additional upside to own
more of that opportunity over time. You couple that with the fact that we've talked about the $3 billion
to $4 billion of upside opportunities in our 10-year capital plan, a portion of which we think will be in our
next 5-year plan, but there'll still be balance after that. And so as we continue to take costs, whether
it's through the CE Way or some of these episodic opportunities like PPAs, repricing and so on, well, that
creates more headroom to bring in that additional capital. So we feel very good about the long-term glide
path for capital growth, which drives rate base growth and then earnings.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Understood. That's definitely helpful. Just one more, if I could. Going back to that IRP plan, I think a lot
of the questions that people have is whether this plan, which basically swaps out coal for at least in the
interim, gassing the portfolio, and how that will be received by the various stakeholders. I appreciate

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

your comments on working with the various stakeholders as well as the commission on this type of
plan. But how confident are you in this time being the best one? And if there are some, I guess, room
for negotiation, if this doesn't end up being the best plan for the commission, what are some of the
alternatives that could potentially also work?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Well, this is the best plan for Michigan. One of the things that our first IRP taught us is that -- we
learned a lot from that. And this is, I would just say, a great plan, remarkable plan for all the reasons I
mentioned a few minutes ago. And so there's a win in here for everyone. And when there's a win, there's
an opportunity to reach settlement or go the whole distance. And so again, I would just reference 2018.
We were very successful with a number of interveners and being able to get to a settlement. But that's
what's great about this regulatory construct. We're working with these interveners in the process. And if
there's an opportunity to settle where there's an outcome that is good for all, we will do that. And so we're
early on into -- and again, I'm very optimistic we have a great plan. And I don't know Rejji, do you want
to add to that?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Insoo, the only thing I would add to that is that [ trust ] that we evaluated the number of different
permutations that as instructed for the IRP construct. And so we certainly looked at whether we could
transition to renewable power more rapidly or fully in as a substitute for the retirements and the
economics just don't get you there, plus you also introduce significant reliability and resilience trends
given the lack of really long-term storage solutions.

And so we certainly evaluated it. But as Garrick noted, we deem this plan where it sits today as the best
plan for Michigan. And also with the gas facilities and obviously foregoing the O&M and capital we know
we would have on our coal facilities, you take that into account with the fuel arbitrage you get from gas
versus coal and just less purchases you now have controllable dispatch. It just brings substantial cost
savings to customers, which would not be offered if we went to a full renewable solution in lieu of gas as a
bridge fuel. So we feel like this is the most economic opportunity for all stakeholders.

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'm going to add to that. I just want to be just crystal clear on this, not only affordability piece, but
those natural gas plants are required for resiliency in the state. You can't get here from there. That's just
bottom line. And so it's that crystal clear. And that's why I have just a high degree of confidence.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Just one quick question on the dividend. You've laid out a nice plan for earnings growth rate, and you're
pretty confident in that 2025 high end. But you -- what's your concern over providing that type of detail
on the dividend growth rate?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Well, you said pretty confident. I would change that word to really confident. And so there's a little bit
[indiscernible] your question. But I'm equally confident in our dividend piece. And what you heard from
me is that confidence in dividend growth for 2022, we recognize the importance of it, and we have it built
into our financial plan. I really want to hand it over to Rejji here because there is an important piece that's
associated with the sale of the bank and closure in Q4 that also shapes that dividend. And so that's why

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

we're -- most pieces have to come together so that we can share that potential here at the end of the
year. But go ahead, Rejji.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, that's right. So if you think about some of the dynamism we might see in the second half of the
year, the closing and the timing of the closing of the EnerBank transaction could certainly impact what we
might plan to do for 2022 dividend. But to go back to Garrick's comments, our commitment is to grow the
dividend beyond the $1.74 per share, where it is today. And then longer term, again, we'll certainly have
that dividend grow commensurate with earnings. But certainly, the bank sale and the timing of that will
have an impact in the near term and then longer term, again, right in line with earnings growth. And so
we feel highly confident that we will have a competitive dividend. And we know that it's a core part of our
value proposition, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks.

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

And just add to that. There's -- with the sale and that closure there, there's upside potential there from
a dividend perspective, again. So we want to be able to -- our investors to be able to share some of that
positive news.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

If I could just jump in with one last question related to the IRP. Is there any part of the IRP you think
maybe be the most challenging or may generate the most concern with the interveners?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

I don't know about most challenging. I think that's -- I'll just tell you this, Anthony. Back in 2014 and
2015, I was a policy witness. I've been on the stand with interveners been crossed by attorneys. They
go after a lot of different things in the case. And here's -- again, we've got strong testimony. We got
great precedent. We're used to this stuff. We do this all the time with our rate cases. We've done it with a
previous IRP. I don't think there's anything this team can't handle, frankly. And so -- and we're prepared
to do that. As Rejji alluded to a minute ago, there's a lot of detail, a lot of modeling and data that went
into this. And so it's a very strong case.

Operator

And our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Maybe just on the IRP. I noticed that you proposed a couple of coal plant shutdowns but then including
them in the rate base post their shutdown, just kind of curious as to sort of if the state has done that
previously, or are there some precedent there that you feel comfortable with that proposal?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

Well, I do feel comfortable with it. There's a precedent set in Colorado, Florida, Wisconsin for a similar
approach in Michigan. We do have a nice ability to securitize, but it is voluntary, and that's an important
piece of this. And so it's essentially -- in 2025, it's about $1.2 billion of remaining book value, to going
through and securitize that just doesn't make sense. This is going to be a drag in credit metrics. They
have an impact on cost of capital, which ultimately shows up on the customers' bill. That's -- I mean,
that doesn't make sense. And so we've really got a good approach there. It's different than how we've

approached it previously. But again, there's a nice precedent that's been set, and I'm really -- the
testimony -- I've reviewed the testimony, it's -- we're in a good spot.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. I appreciate the color there. And obviously, you can always fall back to securitization if that
leads -- if that ends up being the case. But I appreciate the color there. And then just maybe to Rejji, can
you clarify sort of the -- I'm trying to see the equity elimination through 2024. You don't talk about 2025.
So should we assume sort of the normal cadence of equity, I believe that was $250 million per year, to go
back to that starting in 2025. I'm just trying to reconcile that to the comment that the $1 billion additional
in the IRP, you don't need to finance that with equity. Just any color there, Rejji, would be helpful.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Happy to, Durgesh. First, let me just circle back to your closing comment just to be unambiguous
around this. And so the notion of falling back on this securitization. As we noted when we rolled out
the IRP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, this is the proposed plan. This is not a buffet. We're not
thinking about any type of fallback option. And again, from a securitization perspective, to Garrick's
comments, given the impact it could have on our balance sheet, we've already done with the inclusion of
Con 1 and 2 in the retirement and securitization there, we will already have $1 billion of securitized debt
on our balance sheet as of 2023. So we really cannot accommodate alternatives like that. So I want to be
very clear, we do not view that as a fallback option and the proposed plan is what it is.

So with respect to the question around equity, yes, you're right in that as we disclosed when we
announced the EnerBank sale, we are not planning to issue any equity from 2022 through 2024, even
with the capital opportunities that we've announced today with the IRP and potentially some of that
upside opportunity. So no additional equity. For 2025, you can assume the up to $250 million level that we
articulated when we first rolled out our 5-year plan. So that's still a good working assumption for now. But
obviously, there's a lot of time left. And if we can recalibrate and see the data moving away that supports
reducing that, at some point, we may revisit that. But for now, assume $250 million in that out of year of
2025. Is that helpful?

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Very helpful. And thanks for clarifying that securitization comment.

Operator

And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.

Constantine Lednev
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

This is actually Constantine here for Shar. But I think if I may -- if I can just follow up on kind of one
more kind of, I guess, IRP CapEx-related question. What are some of the constructs that are -- that
the incremental portion of CapEx fall under? Is it all fully covered by the IRP as proposed, plus kind of
the annual rate case process that you have? Any kind of -- does any of the non-IRP work can need any
incremental trackers? But does any of this incremental work can start prompting more equity needs down
the line? Or is it fully kind of baked in at this point?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

I think Rejji and I will tag team this one. And so let me just kind of frame up when I think about our
capital plans. And I think we'll talk about our current work across our utility but also this IRP. And so
at the end of the year, in our January call, we're going to add another year to that 5-year capital plan,
and that's going to be more capital opportunity. That 5-year plan is going to grow. And it's going to be

12

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

in our gas business, it's going to be in our electric distribution business. And so there's some growth
opportunity there. Then we'll continue to follow this IRP through the process through that 10-month
process. Again, we feel confident in the outcome of that. And then that's an incremental 1.3. And so you
can imagine in Q2 of 2022, we're going to -- with a successful outcome, there will be an adjustment in
2023 to accommodate the Covert facility. And then also an adjustment in 2025. And so you can see some
of that play out over the 5 years and into the 10-year because when you look at this integrated resource
plan, it goes from '25 to '27. And so some of that [ still will be able ] to fall in the 10-year piece as well.
And so there's some update that will take place along those lines. So that's kind of the capital layout. But,
Rejji, certainly, tag team this with me.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, happy to. So Constantine, I appreciate the question. We're pretty methodical. So I'll put the IRP
aside, we're pretty methodical in how we think about the capital plan of the utility. And we really spend
a lot of time providing long-term visibility on customer investment opportunities across each of the
businesses. And so the current 5-year plan has around $2.5 billion of what I'll call clean energy generation
spend. And then the balance is electric and gas infrastructure spend.

And so we noted when we filed our gas case a couple of years ago that we had about $10 billion of gas
infrastructure-related investments for safety, reliability and decarbonization of about $1 billion per year
of run rate. And so you can expect an extension of that capital investment opportunity and subsequent
iterations of 5-year plans. And so we'll do more gas infrastructure. And again, we run about $1 billion per
year run rate in that regard. Electric infrastructure is comparable, where we're doing a little over $1 billion
per year of electric infrastructure work to improve reliability. And the IRP is also where we're seeing capital
investment opportunities. So the existing IRP, remember, we're still executing on a 1.1-gigawatt tranche,
and we're going to own half of that.

And so all of that is going to be part of the next iteration. And so those are the sort of non-new IRP
opportunities. Again, we'll see those come in, and we also talked about starting to take on some of those
upside opportunities, which in our 10-year plan of $3 billion to $4 billion, we wouldn't do all of that in
the next vintage, but a portion of it. And again, it's more electric and gas infrastructure, as well as clean
energy generation related spend. And so those would be some of the projects that we would invest in
beyond this new IRP. We're highly confident that we'll be able to create the headroom to introduce those
into the capital plan. You asked about trackers. The only thing I would mention in that regard is in our gas
infrastructure capital plan, we do have the equivalent or comparable structure, like a tracker and that's in
our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And so we have that on the gas side, but we don't have
any other say sort of a historical type trackers like that. And so we obviously put them into the cases we
filed on a serial basis and then that dictates what ends up in the final plan. Does that make sense?

Constantine Lednev
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

It does. I think that's very helpful. And if I may shift a little bit to more of a fundamental question. So
the electric sales volumes seem to be normalizing with reopening more or less and especially with the
strong kind of C&I growth and residential coming down a bit, can you kind of talk about your thoughts
on the residential load and how sticky it is versus expectations? And maybe kind of the reversion of the
residential load causing headwinds in terms of earnings for '21 or expectations in '22?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

I'm going to have Rejji start with some of the specifics and then I'll talk about some macro at the end. So
Rejji, why don't you grab it.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. Constantine, we've been quite pleased with what we've seen really across all of the customer classes
to date. And so we have good detail on the 15-page guide [ just ] we distributed. Also in the appendix,
you can see the year-to-date trends in the presentation today. And so we've got residential year-to-date
down a little over 1%. That compares favorably to plan. We had much more bearish expectations because
we were assuming a more rapid return to facilities. And so our full year plan was something closer to down
roughly 5% and we're ahead of plan. So that does imply that we're seeing a good level of stickiness to
this mass teleworking trend, which I do think will be part of a post-pandemic normal. And obviously, that's
higher-margin load.

And so residential continues to outperform our expectations. And then we're also seeing commercial and
industrial, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, come back nicely. And so year-to-date, commercial is
up around 3.5%. And we had in our plan about that level and then industrials at 13% year-to-date, 2021
versus 2020. And our plan, we said on a full year basis, about 6% up. And so we're seeing surprise to
the upside across all fronts. And so intra-year, that obviously creates upside and potential contingencies
as we go into the second half of the year. But longer term, as you roll that into your rate cases, that
creates headroom because you're introducing more kilowatt hours [ into ] the denominator of your rate
calculation. So we feel very good about the road ahead to date. It's still early days, the pandemic is not
behind us yet.

But again, we're still seeing very encouraging trends on the load side. The other leading indicators we've
talked about in the past are just interconnection activities, new service requests, they're up over 30%
year-to-date versus where they were in 2020. And 2020 may not be the best comp given the pandemic.
So we also look at 2019, again, up 30% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So interconnections are
strong, staking requests are strong. Customer counts are quite good with commercial up 1%. And so
again, everything seems to be trending from a load perspective in the right direction.

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

I'll just add to that, just a little bit of clarification. So those new service connections -- interconnections,
those are installs. Those aren't someone dreaming of a house or thinking about a business. Those are
actually in the ground. And so again, it gives you some idea of the momentum here. We continue to have
unemployment rates well below the national average here in Michigan in the heart of our service territory.
Grand Rapids, it's even better. And just to give you a little flavor over the quarter, we've even seen growth
in, again, macro trends and people opening new business in Michigan. In fact, we're under an NDA right
now with the company. But it's $300 million investment, 30 megawatts, 150 jobs that are locating here in
our service territory in Michigan. And I could [indiscernible] 2 other examples of that. And so coming out
of the pandemic here, and we're seeing a nice economic development growth here in Michigan as well.

Next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So most of my questions have been answered. But just back on that securitization question, could you
remind me the size of the asset that's now going to be amortized as opposed to securitized?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

The remaining book value in 2025 of those coal plants would be $1.2 billion that is under consideration in
this filing.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And you guys mentioned that the securitization you thought would be credit negative in comparison
to the plan that you're putting forward. And could you -- I mean, just to sort of walk just sort of very high

level, the reason for that is because you'll be amortizing the cash flow faster. Is that the way to sort of
think about the -- excuse me, you'll be amortizing the assets faster and the cash flow will be stronger, is
that how you're looking at this? Or is there something else I should be thinking about?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

So Paul, this is Rejji. So a couple of things there. So Moody's, as you may recall, treat securitized debt
as debt in their metric calculations. And so you have that levering effect of securitizations because they
are effectively nonrecourse debt, but Moody's is the one rating agency that does impute it as debt. And
so that $1.2 billion that Garrick noted would be dollar-for-dollar accounted as debt in our credit metric
calculations. So you've got credit dilution there. And then you couple that with the fact that you're going
to forego earnings on $1.2 billion of rate base over time. And so you couple sort of the impact on the
denominator where you just have dollar for dollar debt of $1.2 billion, and then you have the dilution in
your numerator because you're foregoing earnings on that equity portion of that rate base over that period
of time. That's what offers that levering effect.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. I follow you on that. Of course, you're getting the cash upfront though with the securitization.
So I mean, I'm just sort of -- maybe we can take that off-line, but okay, I understand that. And then in
terms of the plan, I mean, it sounds like it really is a win-win-win. I'm just wondering, has there been any
change in the trajectory or your -- what you're expecting in terms of customer rates going forward, as a
result of the IRP? Or is it too early to sort of tell? Are you guys pretty much on track as you were thinking
before, and this is just going to be some incremental savings that will help you meet your goals? Do you
follow what I'm saying?

Garrick J. Rochow
President, CEO & Director

I do follow what you're saying. And so we look at -- across that 5-year plan of investments we look at the
rate impact and two, the bill impact, which is also critically important for our residential and commercial
customers. And so that is part of the 5 year. And as we -- again, this incremental capital of $1.3 billion,
it provides $650 million of savings over our current plan. And so this is -- so again, this comes together
nicely to your point, Paul, from an affordability perspective for our customers.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference
back over to Garrick Rochow for closing remarks.

Well, again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Again, a strong quarter, a great first half of the
year and upward momentum. And just, again, I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in person here as
we -- again, safely as we move through the latter half of the year. Take care and be safe.
