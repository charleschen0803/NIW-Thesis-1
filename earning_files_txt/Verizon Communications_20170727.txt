Thanks, Mike
Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today
We had a strong quarter of execution
First, we invested in our 4G network leadership position, resulting in a sweep of third-party network performance surveys for the first half of 2017, while prepositioning for 5G services
Second, we delivered solid wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment with an increase in both postpaid and prepaid accounts
Third, we successfully completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets to scale our media business
Network leadership is the central element of our strategy, and we are continually investing in our network to extend our leadership in 4G capacity growth with densification using small cells, which includes expanding our fiber capabilities
As we prepare for the network of the future, we announced the acquisition of Straight Path for $3.1 billion, which we expect will close by the end of first quarter 2018. Straight Path complements our spectrum portfolio and positions us to lead and further drive 5G technology and its ecosystem
We have begun the precommercial fixed wireless trials in eight out of the 11 markets and have our first batch of customers on this technology
As we have previously highlighted, we will have trial results later in the year, and I look forward to sharing them with you
We had a strong quarter, adding and retaining wireless customers as the momentum from the launch of our unlimited plans was sustained throughout the quarter
We delivered a strong wireless operational performance that reflects customer demand for our high-quality network in a highly competitive market
Finally, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and immediately began executing on integration plans that we've been working on for over a year
We are confident in the execution of our strategy, which we expect to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows, and return long-term value to our shareholders
Let's go deeper into the second quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by wireless and wireline results, media and telematics progress, and network and technology updates
Now on to slide 6. In the second quarter, total operating revenue was in line with last year
On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined 2.0%
The primary driver was the decrease in wireless service revenue, which was consistent with our expectation
On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%
We remain focused on improving our overall cost structure through operating efficiencies across network, distribution, and care
As we shift more transactions toward a digital model, we can improve the customer experience and further enhance operating efficiencies
Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 7. Our operating segments continue to generate substantial cash flows
During the first half of 2017, cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.9 billion and included a net after-tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion
Our high-quality cash generation is driven by the diverse base of wireless and wireline customers
Our ongoing asset-backed securitization program provided $2.9 billion of cash, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement
The impact of the transition to device payment plans and on-balance-sheet securitization should approach a steady state around the end of 2017. Thereafter, the sequential impacts will primarily reflect seasonality of new device launches
As a result, we expect the working capital headwind to subside in 2018. For the first half of the year, capital spending was $7.0 billion, which was in line with last year
On a year-to-date basis, our reported free cash flow of $2.9 billion includes the discretionary pension contribution net of tax of $2.1 billion, which flowed through our cash flow from operations
In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset-backed securitization, which was introduced in the third quarter of last year
Our balance sheet is solid and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business
We ended the quarter with $117.5 billion of total debt, which comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on-balance-sheet securitizations
We have not changed our capital allocation plan or our expectation for cash availability, and we remain focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders
Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide 8. In a highly competitive wireless environment, we delivered a strong operational performance, protecting and expanding our high-valued postpaid customer relationships while balancing profitability
With a clear and comparable offer, our value proposition highlighted the strength of our network, resulting in industry-leading customer retention and improved new demand during the quarter as our offer appealed to customers in underpenetrated segments
Wireless operational performance was sustained throughout the second quarter, building on the customer momentum at the end of the first quarter with improvements in both sequential and year-over-year net phone add performance
Net phone additions were 358,000, compared to 86,000 in the prior year
Smartphone net additions were 590,000, versus 336,000 last year
Postpaid net adds totaled 614,000, including tablet net adds of 2,000 and other connected devices of 254,000, led by Verizon Wireless retail home devices
We added 64,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 83,000 last year, and we grew our postpaid account base for the first time in the past six quarters
Our postpaid phone churn reflects customer demand for network quality and reliability, while pricing provided choices to meet customer needs
Postpaid phone churn not only continued recent trends below 0.9% but also established a new low in the LTE era at 0.70%
Total retail postpaid churn of 0.94% was consistent year over year and down 21 basis points sequentially
Total postpaid device activations were up 3.0%, of which 82% were phones
Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.6%, up from 5.4% year over year, and was 43 basis points higher sequentially
During the quarter, 6.2 million phones were activated on device payment plans
Prepaid net adds of 19,000 were up year over year and sequentially due to our stronger value proposition
Let's turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability
Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.9% in the second quarter as compared to a 5.1% decline in the first quarter
Service revenue declined 6.7% versus a 6.1% decrease in the previous quarter
This trend was primarily due to the lost overage revenue driven by plans introduced during summer of 2016 and the introductory unlimited offer
As we discussed during our last earnings call, we expected weaker year-over-year service revenue through the first half of the year, primarily due to line access and overage revenue trends
At the end of the second quarter, about 59% of our accounts have tools that offer customers the ability to self-manage their usage experience
During the second quarter, we experienced an improvement in the rate of decline in line access revenue, as we now have roughly 75% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans
We expect this trend will continue which, combined with adding new accounts and migrating customers to higher access points, will mitigate the lost overage revenue
Therefore, we believe the service revenue trend has flattened, and we expect that there will be an improving trend in the second half, and we should exit the fourth quarter inside a decline of 4.0%
In the second quarter, equipment revenue increased 16%
The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, as compared to approximately 76% in the first quarter
We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience
Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan at the end of the quarter
Our wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 45.8%
The movement in the service revenue trend will also positively impact wireless EBITDA margin
Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total wireline revenue on a reported basis grew 1.2%, including the recently acquired XO operations
On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.8% compared to a decline of 3.2% last quarter
This shift in the wireline revenue trend towards fiber is growing
Organically, fiber based products grew more than 3%, which supports our plans to further invest in fiber
Our emphasis on delivering value to all business customers, from the very small to the large enterprise, was recognized recently in a leading third-party study
More importantly, we won the large enterprise business award for the second consecutive year in the same study
Consumer markets revenue increased 0.6%, driven by Fios Internet activity
Consumer Fios revenue growth of 4.1% was consistent with the past several quarters
During the quarter, we launched Fios Gigabit Connection in certain markets, which offers symmetrical speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second
In Fios Internet, we added 49,000 customers
Fios Video results were pressured due to softer secular demand for traditional linear video, given growth in the over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity
Fios Video losses were 15,000 in the quarter
For the second quarter, Enterprise Solutions revenue fell 4.1% on an organic basis, which was due to persistent trends in our legacy products and pricing compression in the marketplace
On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 3.5%
Partner Solutions revenue declined 6.8% on an organic basis, while the revenue mix towards fiber has been trending higher
Within business markets, fiber revenue is expanding, driven by Fios broadband demand, offset by continued pressure in legacy products
On an organic basis, revenue declined 4.9% and improved slightly sequentially
On a comparable basis, the second quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 20.8%, compared to 13.3%, which included the work stoppage, last year
Sequentially, wireline EBITDA margin was down 120 basis points, primarily due to lower revenue from Enterprise Solutions and Partner Solutions and an increase in operating expense as a result of leasing data center space related to the sale to Equinix
Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media
On June 13, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets
Upon closing, we launched Oath, which is a combination of AOL and Yahoo brands, serving approximately 1 billion unique monthly users globally, and currently represents about $7 billion in annual revenue
We have been planning the integration of AOL and Yahoo for the past year and immediately began executing on integration plans upon closing
We expect to realize over $1 billion in cumulative operating expense synergies through 2020. We are in the very early stages of leveraging the scale of the combined assets to distribute and monetize content through programmatic advertising across our Sports, Finance, News, and Entertainment properties
These properties will provide unique advertising opportunities to targeted global audiences
Organically, AOL's revenue net of traffic acquisition costs was consistent with prior year's results in the quarter
As the integration progresses, we will provide additional information on the Oath business
Organically, IoT revenue, including telematics, increased approximately 20% in the second quarter
Telematics revenue was approximately $220 million in the quarter
Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology
We consistently invest in our wireless and wireline assets to ensure that we have capacity, reduce the cost to serve, and to preposition the networks for the future
Our value proposition to our wireless customers is to provide a full network experience including reliability, coverage, and speed
We are on our wireless network plan to deliver the industry's best overall experience for our customers
Our network experience continues to be recognized by multiple third-party studies as the industry leader
Since the launch of unlimited, two of these studies have reconfirmed our network leadership in overall performance, including speed and voice quality over LTE
As expected, the introduction of the unlimited pricing plan increased the LTE network usage as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day on the industry-leading wireless network
We are confident in our network and have been engineering the network based on a long-term integrated plan to extend our high-quality experience while expanding our value proposition to customers
We remain focused on delivering increasing capacity over the long-term, utilizing a three-pronged approach: first, network features; second, densification; and, third, spectrum
Let's discuss each of these in detail
First, we are methodically deploying LTE Advanced features to increase capacity on our network resources and align with the timing of smartphone introductions that can take advantage of these features
Second, small cells are playing a vital role in creating capacity
The densification efforts have been a focal point of our network strategy over the past several years
This density also creates increased spectral efficiency and offers the best wireless experience
Finally, with nearly all of our network traffic now on the 4G LTE Advanced network, we are utilizing just over 50% of our low and mid-band spectrum portfolio for this network
We expect to use more of our PCS spectrum for LTE and are just beginning to redeploy 850 megahertz spectrum in certain markets
In addition, we are deploying AWS-3 and will start to add unlicensed spectrum later this year
Our spectrum deployments in conjunction with multicarrier aggregation technology are enabling us to increase network capacity
Our overall wireless network integrates features, densification, and spectrum to enable a step function increase in wireless network capacity over the long term
Fiber is a critical element in transforming both wireless and wireline networks to reduce costs and expand future capabilities
To enhance this strategy, our recent announcements to secure fiber demonstrates our commitment to increase our multiuse fiber footprint and build fiber deeper into the network
On the 5G wireless front, we are up and running in eight out of the 11 precommercial fixed wireless broadband trials on the millimeter-wave spectrum
We have the first batch of customers on the network
We will have trial results towards the end of the year that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments
Let's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth
We are executing on our plan to lead in network, preserve and grow our customer relationships, and expand our presence in digital media and telematics to deliver fundamental results while allocating capital to continue to invest in our operations and return value to our shareholders
We delivered strong wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment
We evolved our wireless value proposition while driving profitable growth and reconfirming network leadership based on third-party study results
We expect that we will create incremental capital and operational efficiencies that result in additional cash generation
Our 5G strategy is progressing for fixed and mobility use cases, standards, spectrum resources, and fiber investments
Now that we have completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and introduced the Oath brand, our media business is focused on the integration plans, and we'll look to increase engagement on our platforms
In telematics, we see additional growth opportunities with our Fleetmatics and Telogis assets
We remain confident in our strategy, which puts us in a strong position to compete today and into the future while delivering long-term value to our shareholders
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions
Thanks, Mike
Appreciate the question
So on the competitive environment through the quarter, I would say we saw it – outperformance in the quarter was pretty even
You saw the churn number; we came in at 0.70%
That certainly contributed to the net adds and shows that once we had a comparable offer out there against the competition, I mean, by being unlimited where the other guys are unlimited
Even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver, and we saw that throughout the quarter
So even as we headed into the back end of the quarter and the competitive environment picked up and some of the other offers that came out there, whether that be large bounties to switch carrier or offering free service, our performance in the back end of the quarter was consistent with where we saw it in the first part of the quarter
So we saw a great result from customers on both the gross adds side and the loyalty side once they had that comparable offer to do
So very excited about how that played out
As we head forward, second quarter is typically, seasonally, the low quarter for churn
So while we certainly expect churn to continue to be at low levels, we'll see if we get a normal seasonal uptick as we go forward
But from a competitive environment standpoint, I think we showed that we competed throughout the quarter without having to put any aggressive promotions in place in the market at any time during the quarter
In terms of 5G, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, we now have the trials up and running
It's going to be later in the year before we start to see results out of those trials
And then, in terms of the business model and economics that may come of that, it will be driven by the results we see from the trials
So too early right now to be more definitive on that, but we're still confident that we'll have a commercial product in market during 2018 and look forward to providing more details on what's coming out of the trials and the overall economics that we see when we get into the latter part of the year
Thanks, Phil
So on the small cell rollout, we're exactly where we planned to be
I mean, our capital plan for the year, we're right on where we planned to be at the start of the year
And we are now – I would say we have small cell builds in all of the top metro markets at this point, and that's one of the reasons we have the network performance that we've had
We saw confirmation of that as recently as yesterday with another one of the third-party surveys that proves that during the first quarter of 2017, even once we were on unlimited, our network performs better than anybody else's, and that's in large part due to what we've been doing for the past number of years on small cell densification
I know you hear a lot of other people talk a lot about small cell densification now
Remember that we've been doing that for a longer time period than anyone else, and that's why we're in all of the top metro markets
And we will continue to do that
That will be a continued part of our network capacity plan
As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have the long-term network plan that's based off continuing to deploy the spectrum that we own against the LTE network, densification, and the LTE tools that are available
So densification continues to be a very important part of our network plan
From a competitive environment (28:09) in the broadband and TV space, I think what you saw is we had a continued strong performance on the broadband side, but we also see the ongoing secular trend around video
So we continue to add high-quality broadband customers and will continue to compete on the video side, but certainly we do that in the face of the secular trends that are ongoing
I think it continues
It's not just around 4G, as we've talked in the past
As we see 5G being deployed on millimeter-wave spectrum, that's going to require a small cell deployment, and so as we put the densification in place of 4G, we're doing it in mind knowing that we've got the 5G that will be using the same dark fiber in other assets
So the densification activity will continue here for a good number of years
Thanks, John
So on the service revenue, I think consistent with what we said earlier in the year, we see second quarter as being the low point and the 6.7% for 2Q will become something better then in 3Q
And in my prepared remarks I believe I – you heard me say that we'll be inside of negative 4% in the fourth quarter
So in terms of how do we get there, we talked about that 75% of the base in second quarter was on unsubsidized pricing
That compares to 53% a year ago
So there's north of a 20-point movement from second quarter last year to second quarter this year
As you get into the back half of the year – I'll use fourth quarter as an example
Fourth quarter year-ago, that number was 67%
This year, that number is going top out in the upper 70s
So we're at 75% now
We'll get up to, let's say, 77%
That will only be a 10-point delta in the fourth quarter year over year
So that pressure that's come from taking customers from the subsidized model down to the unsubsidized pricing is starting to wane, and really the second quarter is where we reached the point, we've got essentially the vast majority of the consumer base now on unsubsidized pricing
And then overage revenues also being, obviously, part of the story here over the past few quarters, first with the introduction of the price plans last year that had the Safety Mode feature and then bringing on unlimited
As we said, we now have 59% of accounts on one of those two plans
Overage was actually down 34% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis
Now represents a low single digit percentage part of total service revenues
So we're working through that headwind
We'll work through that headwind a lot faster
And so, as I say, based off that, I am very confident we'll be inside negative 4% in fourth quarter, and by the time we get on this call a year from now and our comparison is against this year being 75% on unsubsidized pricing, we'll be having a very different conversation about the service revenue trajectory next year
And then on margin improvement, as you know, service revenue is the highest margin component of our business, so as the trajectory on service revenue improves, the trajectory on margin will improve as well
Yeah, good morning, David
So the inputs to service revenue
Really as you think about that trajectory changing, when you've got growing accounts, growing net adds, when you see the continued improvement in the delta on the non-subsidized pricing and as we work through the overage, all of that will combine to a much stronger trend as we go forward from where we have been
In terms of the impact of any new devices coming along, look, we assume that we'll see something later in the year
We typically have very strong results when we have new devices come out because when customers get a new device with new functions, they want it on the best network, but we'll see what happens there
And certainly would expect that to be accretive to the overall revenue story
But our guidance for the year doesn't require any major uplift as a result of that
And then the media side, look, I will say it was very early in the process of integrating those two businesses
As we said, the revenue of AOL less TAC was flat year over year in the quarter
Tim and the team are just getting started integrating those two businesses
They're about 45 days in at this point
The integration is going well, and I look forward to being able to provide more color and commentary about exactly what they're seeing as they go forward
But as you heard Tim say a couple of months ago, the goal here is to grow this to north of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, and nothing that's happened since we closed has changed our view on that
Thanks, Brett
So the guide, if you look at the language on the revenue side, we said we'd be reasonably consistent on an organic basis
So as we think about that, we would remove out anything that wasn't in the business for all of 2016-2017. So certainly the impact of those businesses have been having about $0.02 a quarter on EPS, so when I think about the guide going forward, it's on an organic basis
Still feel very confident organically we'll be in a consistent place to where we were a year ago, and then we'll bake in the impact of the various acquisitions as we go forward
As we get into each of those businesses, certainly from a revenue standpoint they are additive to the outlook
From an earnings standpoint, some of those businesses have an initial pressure as we integrate them, but not material to the earnings outlook
Yeah, absolutely
I mean, certainly with customers on unlimited they have fewer reasons to call
But we continue to want to improve the customer experience, and when customers can do things by themselves through a digital channel at the time they want to do it, that increases overall satisfaction, and it certainly allows us to improve the efficiency of the business
So we're continuing to do that, and we think unlimited certainly helps us do that as well
Look, we continue to look at that trade-off
It really comes down to taking a view on the most efficient way to add the capacity that we need, and we've talked for two or three years now about the fact that we believe based off of the valuations that spectrum have reached in some places, it's more efficient to densify
And certainly the costs of densification, just like with any technology, have come down to some degree since we started densifying with small cell
So the overall analysis we do hasn't fundamentally changed
Look, we continue to add spectrum from the secondary markets, too
So when spectrum is priced at the right level, we continue to be active in that space, too
And we just look at the relative economics between densifying and adding spectrum
But densification has proved to be a very effective way of adding capacity into what places we need to and from a cost efficiency standpoint as well
Look, I think the results speak for themselves on this one, Craig, and whether it be the third-party results that you've seen, again, just in the last 24 hours
But even in an unlimited world, the third-party results clearly show that Verizon has the best network
And then when you look at our subscriber metrics for the quarter, once we were on a comparable basis, we saw record low churn down 0.70%, and we also saw a strong net add number
So the idea that network differentiation doesn't matter to customers – quite frankly, the results from our base show that that's not true and customers do value the benefit of a differentiated network experience even when it's at a premium pricing, which is where ours is
We wouldn't get those results if a better network experience didn't matter to customers
Yeah
So on the churn, look, there's no magic in here
It's not that we've got more customers on EIP or we've been doing things behind the scenes to protect the base
It's around the quality of the experience
And customers see that quality of the experience, and they want to be on that experience rather than something else
So we're very, very happy with that number there, and it's just a reflection of what we give customers
In terms of the guide on service revenue, I think the biggest piece that you have in there is the continued migration of the base to the non-subsidized pricing plans
In the back half of the year, the year-over-year comps are against higher numbers there versus the first half of the year, and that's going to drive improvement in service revenue
Certainly net account growth is an important contribution, but I think just, though, the movement of the base and in unsubsidized, that's the trend we've been talking about, and we certainly see that ahead of us
We continue to look at all ways to manage the network at the most efficient pricing that we have, whether that be how we talk to towers or all the other resources we have in front of us
Thanks, Jennifer
So on the spectrum wish list, look, we're very confident in the portfolio of spectrum that we have, certainly in low band and mid-band, and we have a significant amount of spectrum still to deploy against the LTE network
We'd certainly be interested in the 3.5 [gigahertz] and look forward to that coming forward, but as I say, we're very confident in the spectrum that we still have to deploy
From a CapEx standpoint next year, look, it's too early to get into the guide next year, but as we think about how we deploy fiber and so on, that will be part of the plans, and we'll share those as we get towards the latter part of the year and certainly into January, when we provide the full-year guide
Thanks for the question, Simon
So on over-the-top, look, nothing to say
We're always looking, but we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to be competitive in that space and if it needs to be part of the portfolio or not
From a convergence standpoint, again, we're very comfortable with the product offerings we have today, and if there is more convergence, we certainly believe that will take place on our networks, and we'll be effective as being part of that
And then from an M&A standpoint, look, we're very comfortable with the assets we have today
If there's an opportunity to add something that accelerates the strategy at a reasonable price, we will
But we think we have the assets we need to be effective at this point in time
Yeah, thank you
So as we think about the fiber we need for the business, certainly we need more going forward, as we've discussed in the past
The way that we're going to add that capacity will be probably through a combination of buying fiber that already exists if it's the right type of fiber
We can build fiber, and we can certainly lease
And we were doing that on top of some of the assets we already own, and add in the XO, those fiber metro rings earlier in the year gives us the base on which we will continue to do some of that
So fiber will continue to be very important the higher we build the network, not just for wireless but also various wireline applications, including Smart City deployments
So more to come there as we go forward
I'd say there's no change to our strategy at this point in time
So, look, I absolutely think the trend on unlimited is sustainable
Once we gave customers that clear and comparable offer, we see the value of our network and our offering compared to what else is in the marketplace
And, look, we'll see how the marketplace evolves going forward
But we're very confident that we will be competitive as that happens
From a margin improvement standpoint, look, as service revenue trends improve, we would expect that to flow through into margins
And then also we continue to have ways to take cost out of the business and improve efficiencies in the business, too
So you should think about that as you think about how we go forward in the wireless performance
Thanks, Mike
I'd like to close the call with a few key points
We remain confident in our strategy of investing in our networks while maintaining and expanding our high-quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions
We are well-positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry in the 5G ecosystem with our strong network assets
We have the opportunity to do the things at scale while delivering value across our portfolio in order to generate shareholder value
We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy
Thank you for your time today
