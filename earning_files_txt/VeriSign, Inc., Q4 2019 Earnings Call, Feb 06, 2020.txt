Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Call. Today's
conference is being recorded. Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. At this time, I'd
like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate
Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.

David Atchley
VP & Corporate Treasurer

Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year
2019 Earnings Call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe,
Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and
presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About
VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings release.
At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of
the call will be posted.

Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking
statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed
with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the
quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.

The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-
GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our
earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found in the Investor
Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and
afterward, we will open the call for your questions.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign
that caps off not only a solid year, but also a strong decade in which we focused on our core business,
expanded the domain name base and returned value to our shareholders. In 2019, we marked more
than 22 years of uninterrupted availability for the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 2019 was also a
strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as we processed a record 40.3 million registrations
and concluded the year with 158.8 million names. Finally, 2019 was characterized by solid financial
performance with revenues of $1.232 billion and free cash flow of $714 million.

On January 3, VeriSign and ICANN announced a proposed agreement to amend the .com Registry
Agreement and a new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security,
stability and resiliency of the domain name system in the form of a binding letter of intent between
the 2 organizations. Together, these agreements fulfill commitments that ICANN and VeriSign made
in 2016 when the .com Registry Agreement was previously amended. The new proposed amendment
updates the .com Registry Agreement to reflect certain changes under Amendment 35 to the Cooperative
Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes.

According to the terms of the proposed letter of intent, VeriSign will have a onetime commitment to
provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to

VERISIGN, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that
the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community.

ICANN's public comment period for these 2 documents closes February 14. The steps that follow the
comment period's closing, according to ICANN's website, are that ICANN staff will prepare a report of the
public comments by March 6, 2020, and then ICANN will submit the report to its Board of Directors.

Now I'll discuss fourth quarter operational highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base
in .com and .net totaled 158.8 million consisting of 145.4 million names for .com and 13.4 million names
for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.9%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.3 million
new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates
are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the
fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.3% achieved in
the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Looking forward to 2020, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4%. During
the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for $195 million. During the full year
2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $738 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased
the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $743 million to a
total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.

Our financial position remains strong with $1.218 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the
business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.

Lastly, regarding .web, as we mentioned last quarter, a hearing on VeriSign and NDC's request to
participate in the arbitration process was held last year. We expected a ruling on our request in 2019, but
we have been told by the panel that it now hopes to issue its ruling this month.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to George.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company
generated revenue of $1.232 billion, up 1.4% from 2018; and delivered GAAP operating income of $806
million, up 5% from $767 million a year ago. As a reminder, revenue growth during 2019 was partially
offset by lower revenue from our divested Security Services business as most customers' contracts
transitioned to the buyer during the year.

For the full year 2019, revenue from U.S. customers was 63% of total, with 37% coming from foreign
customers. Fourth quarter revenue came to $311 million, up 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating expense
totaled $112 million compared to $103 million last quarter and $113 million in the fourth quarter a year
ago.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased investment in
our business, including increased sales and marketing programs as well as investments in our operational
infrastructure and security capabilities.

Fourth quarter operating income totaled $199 million compared with $194 million in the same quarter
of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9% compared to 63.1% in the same quarter a
year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $182 million a year earlier, which produced diluted
earnings per share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.5 for the same quarter last
year. For the year-over-year comparative results, remember that 2018 results included the gain of our --
on the sale of our Security Services business, which increased fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income by
$52 million and earnings per share by $0.43.

VERISIGN, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

Related to non-GAAP results, fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12
million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million and was higher sequentially for the reasons I
discussed earlier and slightly lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels.

Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 67.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was
$154 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31. Finally, the full year 2019 non-
GAAP operating margin was 69.6%.

As a reminder, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 results, we will no longer be presenting nor
discussing non-GAAP metrics, with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. As of December
31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.854 billion and total liabilities of $3.344 billion.
Assets included $1.218 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $194 million, and free cash flow was $185 million compared
with $219 million and $211 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. The year-over-year
difference was primarily related to higher cash taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a lower working
capital benefit.

I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance, which is now based solely on GAAP metrics. Revenue is
expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects a
growth rate slightly below the expected domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4% as 2020
revenue no longer reflects any residual revenue from the Security Services business, which in 2019 was
about $10 million.

GAAP operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is expected to be between 64.5%
and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental investment in our operational
infrastructure and security capabilities during 2020.

Interest expense and nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $68 million and
$75 million. This range reflects both lower nonoperating income from the transition services agreement,
which will cease during the first quarter, and lower expected interest income on cash balances. Capital
expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million.

The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 21%. We expect the cash tax rate for
2020 to also be within the same range.

In summary, VeriSign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during 2019, and we look
forward to continuing strong execution in 2020.

Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Thank you, George. The fourth quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, capping a solid year for
the company. There was further expansion of the domain name base and year-over-year revenue growth.
We generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders. We continued our work to protect, grow and
manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders.
We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Rob Oliver with Baird.

Robert Cooney Oliver
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

A question for you, George. Just on the full year guidance, just curious if you could help us understand
what might be in there in terms of -- because we're expecting price increases to roll in starting later this
year and if that's been factored in. And additionally, on .web, I know tough to know exactly when that
closes, but expecting that it would in '20, obviously less meaningful, but just curious whether those were
included in the guide. And then I just had a quick follow-up.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Rob, we don't guide to price increases. But I can tell you, in our guidance, there are no price
increases in the guidance.

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

And there's no -- none of the guidance that you've been given includes any revenue from .web at this
point.

Robert Cooney Oliver
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you also mentioned in your prepared
remarks increase in sales and marketing. And just was wondering if -- and domain growth obviously was
strong, coming in stronger than expected. Just wondering if that's just kind of normal channel incentive
activity or if there's anything else structural going on in terms of driving increased sales and marketing
and potential increased spend going forward.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Rob. So from a marketing perspective, I would say, in general, the programs and types of programs
that we ran this year were similar to last year. So there's really not a huge change in what we're doing.
Again, if you recall last year, we also had some seasonal increase in sales and marketing in the fourth
quarter, and we articulated that in our 10-Q that we filed last quarter, that we expected that to go up as a
percent of sales as well.

Operator

Next, we'll hear from Nick Jones with Citi.

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

First, I guess, is there anything noteworthy as far as geographic mix goes? I know China has had an
impact on renewal rates. And I guess, given kind of the coronavirus issue there, is that creating any
challenges with registrations in that region?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

I'm sorry, I didn't catch the second part of the question.

VERISIGN, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I'm just wondering if the kind of health care issues in China is having an impact on registrations or
renewals.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So yes, I mean, in the fourth quarter, we had a very strong fourth quarter. As Jim alluded to, 10.3
million new additions, which was up from 9.5 million in the fourth quarter of '18. When we look at where
that demand came from, it came from registrars based in the United States, Asia Pacific region and EMEA.
So as far as renewal rates, again, they vary by geography. It's something we keep an eye on. But as it
relates to any virus over in China, we're not seeing any impact to date, but it's something we'll keep an
eye on.

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Got it. And then one more. The investment with ICANN, can you provide a little more color around kind
of what needs improvement and preservation? Is it mostly on going CapEx? Or is there anything kind of
figure that you can call out?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

So the question, Nick, that was about spend on the infrastructure? Was that the question?

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Yes. The $4 million per year over 5 years.

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. The...

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes, I'm sorry. Can you just...

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

The question about the letter of intent, the $4 million over 5 years.

Nicholas Freeman Jones
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Yes. If you can give a little more color on what exactly the money is going to be going towards and what
needs to be improved, what needs to be preserved. Is there any kind of additional color you can provide
there?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Well, it's security and stability for both the DNS and for the Internet. There's a broad variety of areas
where that funding will go. There's things such as root governance, which impacts everybody, every
relying party on the global Internet. ICANN's core mission is security and stability, and that's where this
funding is going. That -- you may have followed last year, for example, ICANN executed on something

VERISIGN, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

called the KSK rollover, refreshing a critical part of the global security system for the Internet. There's
a broad variety of areas that need additional funding that everybody, including VeriSign, that the entire
global Internet community will benefit from. And so the funding in the LOI is specifically targeted in that
broad security, stability and resiliency area in ICANN's core mission.

Operator

We will take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.

Sterling Auty
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got a couple of questions. First one, to revisit the renewal rate. I know you mentioned that renewal rate
varies by geography. But given that it was down year-on-year, any more color that you can give? Is it just
mix-driven, where the renewal rates in each of the geography is consistent with last year? Or did you see
any changes in any of the renewal rates in those geographies?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Sterling, I mean, as you know, renewal rates vacillate period to period. But I think from a big picture
perspective, as we articulated last quarter, it really is -- it seems to be a mixture of the names that we
sold in the prior year coming up for renewal. We had more names being sold last year in the Asia Pacific
and China region that are becoming a slightly larger proportion of the base, and so they are having a
slight impact there. But other than that, we're not seeing huge variances. Again, I would just remind you,
if you look back over the last couple of years, the company's renewal rate has been around 72% and has
recently increased up into the 74% range. And while it is down year-over-year by about 60 basis points,
it's still in general improving as the base ages. So I would just remind folks that we have a pretty stable
renewal rate within the company.

Sterling Auty
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then following up on the 10.3 million gross additions. You basically said there's growth out of
U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA. But can you peel that back a little bit more? So 10.3 million is better than
what we have been seeing. I think it's the first time you've done over 10 million in quite some time. Which
area contributed more than what you have been seeing? In other words, which geography generated
incremental growth this quarter?

George E. Kilguss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as I said, those 3 were the largest contributors to the growth. Again, recall, we're a FIN registry. So
what we're reporting on is the registrations by our registrars, where they are domiciled to do business.
So to some degree, it may not be completely transparent to where the end users are. The registrars have
that information, not necessarily us. But our customers, the registrars, in the fourth quarter, the U.S.
continued to remain strong, as did Asia Pacific and EMEA.

And the other thing I'll just comment on is, also, what happens sometimes from year-to-year is you have
new companies becoming registrars, and they tend to pop up in new markets. And we have sometimes
consolidation in a market where one registrar may acquire some business from another registrar. So -- but
those 3 regions performed well for us in the quarter.

Sterling Auty
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then I wanted to clarify. Jim, you mentioned in terms of the panel decision on .web,
that's just the final decision as to whether you can be a party to the process? Or what is that decision that
you're waiting for this month on?

VERISIGN, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes, Sterling, that's the issue before the panel. They indicated that they could rule before the end of the
year. That didn't happen. The indication now is that they hope to rule this month. But the issue before
them that they will be ruling on is the active participation by VeriSign in this process.

Sterling Auty
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then back -- operationally, you mentioned the investments that you're making both in sales and
marketing as well as some infrastructure investments. Can you kind of parse out, where was the bigger
portion of that investment, in which of those 2 areas?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

We're not prepared to talk about that level of detail. There are a lot of different components to the security
infrastructure investments. As you know, Sterling, we're very different than most other registries. Many
of them are actually marketing registries rather than operating registries. We operate the common net
infrastructure, which requires stringent performance requirements. So we make investments that are, I
think, far beyond what most others do. There are a lot of scheduled investments that we make. But as
you know, the cybersecurity threat environment is dynamic and ever-changing. If there are new threats,
if there are new technologies, new products that strengthen our infrastructure and our core mission, we're
not going to hesitate to make those investments. We had all of the above in the corner -- in the quarter,
along with sales and marketing. But we haven't, and I don't think we're prepared now, to break that out in
any detail.

Sterling Auty
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Last question is, one of the questions I get frequently from investors is what your appetite and what your
view would be on acquisitions and being a consolidator in the market, especially now that you've got the
ability to be a vertically integrated company outside of .com. What's your interest level in pursuing those
opportunities?

D. James Bidzos
Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO

I don't think there's any update we can provide you. There's certainly no guidance or particular interest.
As you know, our focus is on .com and .net. We've actually made divestments in our VSS business. We
are pursuing .web as a growth opportunity. We do have additional IDNs that we expect to deploy in the
future. I think security and stability in our current growth plans that we've talked about are what we're
prepared to talk about. There's not anything else that I would speculate about or guide to. I would just say
that, as you heard George and myself commented earlier, the guidance that we've given for 2020 does not
include any provision for price increases, doesn't include any revenue from .web. So we tend to be more
conservative in those areas, and that's probably as much as I can tell you at this time.

Operator

That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. David
Atchley for any additional closing remarks.

David Atchley
VP & Corporate Treasurer

Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this
call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.

Operator
That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
