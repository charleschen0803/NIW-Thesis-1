Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Mariama, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would
like to welcome everyone to Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator
Instructions] I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is
yours.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings
call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Bayley,
President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor
Relations.

During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website,
www.rclinvestor.com.

Before we get started, I'd like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our
first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward looking. These statements do
not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our
SEC filing and other disclosures. Please note that we do not undertake to update this information in our
filings as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which
are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website.
Unless you state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency-adjusted basis. Richard will begin by
providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow up with a recap of our fourth quarter and full
year results for 2019. I will then provide an update on the current booking environment and then provide
guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of 2020. Richard?

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Obviously, the biggest issue of the day is the Wuhan
coronavirus. And as you all know, this virus has infected over 20,000 people in China, and they have
taken unprecedented steps to contain it. They've essentially locked down the country and they're acting
quickly and aggressively to combat the spread, so have other countries. Unfortunately, no one knows how
this outbreak will play out, and we don't know how it will ultimately impact us. So far, we've canceled
some sailings, and we've modified some itineraries that extend through March 4. These actions will cost
us approximately $0.25 per share. But it seems likely that we will have to cancel more, but we don't
yet know how many. We also expect that there will be an impact on future bookings in China, especially
in the immediate aftermath of the illness. But again, we just don't know. One important bright spot is
that looking beyond the current outbreak, we aren't seeing a big impact on overall bookings elsewhere.
But again, and here I'm sounding like a broken record, we just don't know. To put things in context,
China was expected to account for about 6% of our full year capacity and 4% of the capacity in the first
quarter. Spectrum of the Seas is currently our only ship in China with 2 other ships scheduled to enter the
market in May and July, respectively. Spectrum was doing very well before this outbreak. So this is all very
disappointing to us. So far, we've had to cancel 8 China sailings and modified several itineraries that go
through March 4. Unfortunately, there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the situation
to calculate the overall impact on the business or give you a good estimate of what the ultimate impact
will be. That said, we continue to feel positive about and committed to the long-term growth potential in
China, a market that we've been in for more than 10 years.

In conjunction with CLIA, our industry trade group, we have initiated strong safeguards to help contain
the spread of the disease and to protect our guests and crew. These include regardless of nationality, the
company will deny boarding to any individual who's traveled from, to or through Mainland China or Hong

Kong in the past 15 days. These guests will receive full refunds. There will be mandatory specialized health
screenings performed on guests who have been in contact with individuals who have traveled from, to or
through Mainland China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days; all holders of China or Hong Kong passports,
regardless of when they were last in China or Hong Kong; guests who report feeling unwell or demonstrate
any flu-like symptoms. And these standards also apply to employees, crewmembers and contractors. All
these steps that we are taking and others are taking are expected to ultimately contain the virus, but we
don't know how long that will take.

Now returning to 2019, I'd start out by saying that it was another incredibly busy and successful year. Our
teams achieved all-time record financial results, delivering an adjusted EPS of $9.54 while introducing 3
new vessels, launching the very successful Perfect Day destination, consolidating Silversea, modernizing
6 ships and implementing a Excalibur on most of the fleet. Our guest satisfaction scores are at an all-time
high, and so are our employee engagement scores. I'm gratified to note that our teams achieved these
record results while also having more than their fair share of unique incidents like the Oasis dry dock,
Cuba, Hurricane Dorian, et cetera.

I believe that this is a testament to a strategy that works, a product that's great and a group of people
that is the best at what they do.

Now this particular earnings call is special as we are once again announcing a new set of long-term goals.
Our management team is very goal oriented, and we have found that establishing clear, simple and
ambitious targets motivates our people and drives superior results. This worked successfully with projects
as diverse as Double-Double, Perfect Day and Project EDGE. Our people are amazing and when we get all
of them pulling in the same direction, nothing stops us. In this case, our idea is to focus on what we're
calling the 3 Ps: People, Profit and Planet. We strongly believe that if we attend to these 3 elements, we
can achieve even greater heights. We're calling the program 20>25 by 2025. The program consists of 5
goals. The first 2 of which are reflected in the title. Slide 1 shows the logo we're using internally for this
program. The first goal is to reach adjusted earnings per share of $20 per share by 2025. We think that's
a worthy goal on its own. But I remind all of you on this call that our real objective is not to reach these
goals but to exceed them. It's a bit like tennis where they always say you not to hit -- not to hit the ball,
but to hit through the ball. Our goal is not just to improve 2025 results, it is to use that as a stepping-
stone to a new base that will take us to new and better highs.

The second goal is to reduce our carbon footprint by an additional 25%. That's on top of what we've
already achieved with our WWF commitment today. Now this goal that we're announcing today is 10%
greater and will be achieved 5 years earlier than the International Maritime Organization's goal. It's a big
deal.

The third and fourth goals are to increase our employee engagement from the record levels we're
currently enjoying. We always emphasize that our success is based on the awesome work of our
employees, and we want to ensure that we are taking the steps necessary to generate their continued
commitment. We are also proud of the level of guest satisfaction that this commitment produces.

Our fourth goal, therefore, is to continue to raise those satisfaction metrics.

Lastly, we need to accomplish all this while ensuring that we keep our focus on the returns we generate on
invested capital. This involves maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and on operating
leverage. We believe that we will do well even without such a program. Nevertheless, adopting the clear
and simple 20>25 by '25 goals will help guide our decision-making every day. That will focus our attention
on Peoples, Profits and Planet. These 2025 goals really motivate and drive performance, which, in turn,
not only make these goals -- makes achieving these goals more likely, it makes exceeding these goals
more likely too. We do intend to provide greater detail on the specifics of the 20>25 by 2025 program in
our 10-K, which will be out in a few weeks.

Now I'd like to update you on the booking environment for the year. Jason will give a little more, but I
want to focus on it. And given the uncertainties around the virus, all of my comments will exclude the
impact of that. We're always eager to start the year and see what WAVE season brings. It's an important
part of our volume, but it also serves as a harbinger for the rest of the year. And I'm happy to say that

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

this year's WAVE makes us very optimistic about 2020. I'm always amazed by how accurate our revenue
management teams have been in the past. And this year, they expect yields to increase broadly in the
range of 2.25% to 4.25%. As always, there are some areas that do better than others in some special
circumstances; for example, the bushfires in Australia. But overall, our forecast was for a nice bump to our
already excellent 2019 yields.

Now it's also important to look at the cost side of the equation, and we estimate that our net cruise
cost, excluding fuel, will be up 1.75% to 2.25%. Our cost outlook reflects our culture of continuous
improvement and innovation. Nevertheless, as I've mentioned in the past, costs are not always perfectly
aligned with the benefits they carry. For example, we continue to invest in our people, in new technology
and our sustainability efforts as well as digital. In all these cases, we have spent money in the past
2 years, and we will continue to spend money in 2020. Something similar can be said regarding the
employment of our capital. These decisions are focused on the long term of our business, and I believe
they are very much in our investors' best interest.

Lastly, I will brag a little bit about our stunning new ships in 2020. Among them is the first full year of
operation of Spectrum of the Seas, Celebrity Flora in the Galapagos and new Mein Schiff 2 in the German
market. All these ships had a phenomenal inaugural season in their respective markets, and we're very
happy with their performance. However, during 2020, we'll deliver 4 additional new ships: Celebrity Apex
for the celebrity brand, Silversea Moon and Silver Origin for Silversea Cruises and Odyssey of the Seas for
Royal Caribbean International. All these new vessels attract significant premiums and will help position
2020 for another year of strong yield growth and success.

With that, I will now turn the microphone back to Jason. Jason?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Richard. I will now take you through our results for the fourth quarter of 2019. These results
are summarized on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $1.42 per share, which
is slightly higher than the midpoint of our guidance. In summary, revenue came in as planned and better-
than-expected performance from our joint ventures and below-the-line activities more than offset the
increased costs. On the revenue side, net yields were up 6.8% for the quarter, in line with our guidance.
Approximately, 300 basis points of the yield growth was driven by the benefits of Silversea, Perfect Day
and Terminal A. New hardware and like-for-like yield improvement drove the other 380 basis points of
yield growth for the quarter.

On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD, were up 15.9%, which was higher than
guidance, driven mainly by marine-related costs and employee-related expenses. In addition, during this
quarter, we repurchased $100 million in shares.

I will now discuss our full year results, which we have summarized on Slide 4. By all accounts, 2019 was
another year of very strong performance.

We generated over $2 billion in adjusted net income, resulting in earnings per share of $9.54, making
2019 another record year. This record result was achieved despite the unfavorable impact from the
incident in the Grand Bahama Shipyard, the abrupt cancellation of voyages to Cuba and the operational
disruption generated by Hurricane Dorian. Our leading brands and world-class workforce delivered
the strong financial performance while also driving record Net Promoter Scores and record employee
engagement metrics.

To summarize the revenue performance for the year, yields were up 8%, crowning a decade of
uninterrupted revenue growth. This result was almost 50 basis points higher than our initial January
guidance despite an 80 basis point headwind from the combination of Cuba policy change, Hurricane
Dorian and the Grand Bahama incident. Strong demand from our core products for our key markets and
higher pricing related to our private destinations in the Bahamas drove the overall outperformance for the
year.

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Now the main driver of the year-over-year improvement were strong like-for-like yield growth, our
incredible new hardware, the launching of Perfect Day and the consolidation of Silversea. On the cost
side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were up 11.4%. The main driver behind the year-over-year increase
were the consolidation of Silversea's operations, the new operations of Perfect Day and our terminal in
Miami. Lost APCDs due to the Grand Bahama Shipyard incident and investments in technology and digital
capabilities drove the balance.

Now I'll update you on what we are seeing in the demand environment. Over the last 3 months, bookings
have been consistently outpacing same time last year, and WAVE is off to an excellent start with 2020
booking trends ahead for each of our 4 brands. In fact, the second full week of January was a record
booking week for the company. Pricing has also been strong, and as a result, 2020 is booked ahead of
same time last year in both APD and load factor on a like-for-like basis. We've been highlighting ongoing
strength in demand from North America for at least 2 years, and I'm happy to say that there are no signs
of a slowdown. In fact, we are seeing better overall pricing and demand from North America than ever
before, with Perfect Day and our ship modernization program providing a clear boost. We are sensitive
to the fact that this is an election year in the U.S. Consequently, we have modified our booking curves to
reflect the short-lived slowdown that we typically see during the second or third week surrounding the
election.

Now I'll give you a brief overview of our capacity and deployment changes for 2020. Our overall capacity
will increase 4.8% year-over-year. Itineraries in North America account for close to 60% of our capacity
and are trending very well. We've slightly increased our capacity in the Caribbean, driven by inaugural
winter season for Celebrity Apex and Odyssey of the Seas, and therefore, the product will represent just
over half of our overall deployment. Other key itinerary changes include a year-round short Caribbean
program on Independence of the Seas visiting Perfect Day and a summer program for the modernized
Oasis of the Seas in the Northeast. Bookings for the Caribbean have been nicely higher than last year, and
all signs point to this year being our best Caribbean season yet.

Alaska sailings account for about 5% of our capacity and are booked nicely ahead of same time last year.
We've said we increased our 2020 capacity with an incremental ship for Royal Caribbean, more than
offsetting the redeployment of an Azamara ship. As it pertains to Bermuda, this product only accounts for
a small portion of our overall capacity and is also booked well ahead of same time last year.

Now the robust booking environment trends from North American guests are also benefiting itineraries
in Europe. We also expect trends in the U.K. to be more predictable this year, given the recent Brexit
withdrawal agreement. That being said, we have made some changes to our European itineraries to
reduce dependence on European markets and provide even more global appeal. Overall, European sailings
will account for 17% of our capacity this year, with dry dock timing and inaugural seasons for Celebrity
Apex and Silver Moon driving capacity up year-over-year. Bookings were similar to same time last year
over the past 3 months and have been up nicely during WAVE.

Now moving to Asia Pacific. These itineraries account for 17% of our full year capacity and account for
21% in the first quarter. China, in particular, represents 6% of our capacity for the full year and 4% in the
first quarter with 1 ship, Spectrum of the Seas that homeports in Shanghai. China sailings were trending
particularly well prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus with APDs up nicely year-over-year and load
factors in line with our expectations.

As I've noted, it's clear that the virus will impact revenue in China, at least in the short term. But
nevertheless, our plan to continue to growing in this profitable market remains unchanged. Australia
sailings account for 7% of our capacity and are booked slightly behind for the year. However, recent trends
in Q1 and Q2 have been better with particular strong close-in demand from the Australian market during
WAVE.

Taking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 5, you will see our guidance for 2020. As a reminder,
and as Richard mentioned, there remains too many variables and uncertainties to reasonably estimate
the overall financial impact relating to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. As such, our guidance and key
metrics for the full year and the first quarter do not include any financial impact that relates to this very
fluid situation. Our yield outlook for 2020 is very strong. We expect net revenue yield growth of 2.25% to

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

4.25% for the full year, which makes 2020 our 11th consecutive year of yield growth. The underlying yield
improvement is driven by new hardware, strong demand for our core products and continued growth from
our onboard revenue areas. As I previously mentioned, we are very excited about the introduction of our 4
new ships during 2020 as they will be important contributors to the overall net yield growth.

Now the timing of the new ship deliveries will result in more significant yield growth in the second half
of the year than in the first half. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 1.75% to 2.25%
for the full year. Cost control continues to be a focus. However, this metric will have an uneven cadence
throughout the year, mainly driven by the dry dock schedule, the new ship deliveries and year-over-year
comparables. This will result in a more significant cost increase in the first half of the year than in the
second half.

Our depreciation for the year will be in the range of $1.376 billion and $1.392 billion. As a result, our
investment in technology and digital projects are becoming a larger mix of our capital program and
generally have a shorter useful life than our typical capital investments.

Also, this year, we'll deliver 2 new Silversea ships. As I mentioned in the past, being in the luxury
expedition segment, Silversea's depreciation per berth is significantly higher than our corporate average.
We have included $744 million of fuel expense for the year, and we are 54% hedged. Based on current
fuel pricing, currency exchange and interest rates and excluding the impact from the coronavirus, we
expect another record-breaking year with earnings per share between $10.40 and $10.70.

Now I'd like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 6. Net revenue yields are expected to
be down approximately 0.5%. Demand for the core products is very strong, and our core Caribbean yields
are up nicely for the quarter despite a difficult comparable. Now while WAVE bookings trends have been
strong for itineraries based in North America and Europe, recent events around the globe have impacted
demand for some of our international itineraries. Specifically, the unprecedented bushfires in Australia
and recent activities in Hong Kong and the Middle East are each having an outsized impact on revenue for
the first quarter. Moreover, it is important to highlight that first quarter is also being negatively impacted
by other structural elements such as the discontinuation of Cuba sailings, which equals a headwind of
approximately 120 basis points; the lack of new ship deliveries and a tough year-over-year comparable
as we are lapping the inaugural season of 2 new ships during the first quarter of 2019. Notably, both
Symphony of the Seas and Celebrity Edge had very successful inaugural seasons in the Caribbean last
year. Additionally, FX and fuel are negatively impacting the quarter year-over-year by approximately
$0.15. All these issues make for a tough first quarter in terms of revenue growth. Net cruise costs,
excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 3% for the quarter.

Taking all this into account, and excluding any impacts from coronavirus, we expect adjusted earnings to
be in the range of $0.80 to $0.85 per share.

Before we open up the session for the Q&A, I will highlight that we are very excited about the introduction
of our 20>25 By 2025 goals that will further support our focus on our people, driving profit and taking
care of our planet. We have stressed before that our strong financial performance is driven by modestly
growing our yields, effectively managing our costs and moderately growing our business. With that
formula in mind, we have now set a goal of $20 in earnings per share by 2025, which equates to a
compound annual growth rate of almost 14% while delivering strong returns on invested capital. This
is a meaningful growth trajectory, but we believe that we have the right formula and the right people
to get this done. At the same time, we are pairing these ambitious financial goals with environmental
targets, specifically with reducing our carbon emission by 25%. This does not happen overnight. We
have been working on this for some time already with our world-class design, engineering and operation
teams, developing new and different products and processes to meaningfully and positively affect our
environmental impact.
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So I know you're going to get a bunch of questions about China and I know this virus noise is a total
unknown. But have you guys thought about any contingency plans in case this virus impact lasts longer
than expected? And I guess, what I mean by that is what options do you have for those ships that are in
affected markets? Can you move those? Would you try to move those? Or could you actually take them
out of service for a period of time?

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Steve, it's Michael. Yes, I mean, obviously, we have contingency plans for all of our ships deployed globally
and it's part of our overall planning process. So in the case of -- at the moment, it's really Spectrum that's
being removed from the China market and that's safely sailing with our crew. We have plans, obviously.
But I think, as we've all said, it's really difficult to understand what is going to happen. I think we're all
waiting to see. But we do have alternative plans in place, and we can either redeploy regionally or outside
of the region, but we do have plans in place.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay, got you. And then, Richard or Jason, you gave a lot of good details about your new 2025 program.
But can you help us think a little bit about -- think about what some of your underlying assumptions are
that go into that? Now I guess, what I mean is you're basically assuming around kind of 14%-ish earnings
growth per year, which is obviously very, very strong. Are your yield assumptions for the next couple of
years kind of still inside that normal, what you guys would call a normal 2% to 4% yield range?

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

Steve, we set up these programs really to motivate our management, and I emphasize that these aren't
-- we're not making predictions here. We're setting goals. And our focus is to try and not only get people
to focus on doing their job more effectively, but also to use innovation to find new and different ways
to do it. So I don't think the -- I'm in a position to say, well, we're going to do this by yields and this
by cost and this by new investments, et cetera. We're looking at the whole panoply. And again, I would
also emphasize, we're looking at 5 goals, and we think these are all very much interrelated. We're not
going to get the earnings we want if we don't get good returns on our invested capital. We're not going
to get good growth in our yields if our guests aren't happy and our crewmembers aren't engaged and
our people aren't focused. So all these things work together, and we think, together, that's the way to
achieve our best outcome. But we haven't broken it out in terms of this much from yield and this much
from something else.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay, got you. And then, Jason, 1 quick housekeeping question, if I could. Your capacity growth for the
first quarter is 4.5%. Any idea what that would look like once you remove the 8 sailings that have been
canceled right now? Is that material to that number?

Jason T. Liberty

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

It will certainly decrease. I think it will decrease it by about 100 basis points for those 8 canceled sailings
based off of what goes through the March 4 date.

Operator

Your next question comes from Harry Curtis with Institute (sic) [ Instinet ].

Harry Croyle Curtis
Instinet, LLC, Research Division

My first question has to do with the first quarter. You had given us a great deal of detail, but there seems
to be a fair difference in the equity pickup line item in 2020 versus last year. Can you speak to what the
extent of that is and to what degree the Grand Bahama JV contributed last year? And your expectations
that have been built in for 2020?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Harry, actually, you really hit on the main driver below the line is the Grand Bahama shipyard and the loss
of the dock for that yard. And so we do not expect that dock to be back online in 2020, likely in 2021. So
the income that we were receiving, which, of course, since it's a joint venture and is an equity pickup,
that's where we had expected it to be and that's what's affecting us.

Harry Croyle Curtis
Instinet, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And the second question, going -- looking out to 2025. How much cash do you think you should be
able to generate after all CapEx over the next 5 years? And are you in this goal, not necessarily guidance,
are you assuming any share repurchase in this?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we're not going to get into the ebbs and flows of what's there. I mean, I think, our formula for
success, which is moderate yield growth, good cost control while investing in our business and growing
our business. And, I think, at least for the next 3 or 4 years there's a very good understanding on how our
capacity is going to grow is part of that. I think when you look at -- if you run that 14% CAGR and you
keep in mind that our goal is to maintain our leverage between 3x and 3.5x, that, that will leave you with

Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.

Jared H. Shojaian
Wolfe Research, LLC

So in the prepared remarks, you noted that you're not really seeing a big impact on the non-China
bookings since the virus. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what you've seen with
bookings or cancellations in the last week? And then can you also just update us on what percentage of

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

your deposits today are nonrefundable versus what that was maybe 5 years ago and how that could be
helping in this environment?

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Jared, this is Michael. Yes, I think we're kind of pleased with what we're seeing in all of our markets
around the world with, of course, the exception of what's occurring in China. When you look at the call
center inbound activity as it relates to questions, concerns that both our trade partners and our customers
are asking us, any issue related to the virus is relatively small. There are inquiries asking what our policies
and practices are, et cetera. But it's really a tiny percentage. It's under 1.5% of the calls coming in. And
we feel good about the booking activity for Caribbean, Alaska and Europe and generally international. With
regards to the second question on the nonrefundables, we didn't have them in place 5 years ago. I think,
if I recall, we introduced them about 3 -- 2, 3 years ago. I'm very pleased with the results that we have. I
don't think we've ever given an actual percentage number of nonrefundables, but they're very attractive to
the customers. And of course, they're very sticky bookings. So we're pleased. Year-over-year, we've seen
improvement in the number of customers who choose that option.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Just to add on to it, I think last week, just remember that it was a Chinese New Year. So our
expectations on booking activity was actually pretty low. Our commentary -- or my commentary around
the booking environment is really what we're seeing to date. So when we think about being in a strong
rate position, load factor position, our commentary is strength around North America's -- demand for
North American products and European products, on the positive commentary about Europe is all kind of
incorporating what we've been seeing. If you actually look at our 2020 bookings since our last call, our
booking activity is up 6% versus the percent at that point in time. So if you take out the coronavirus just
here for a moment, what you're seeing is really kind of continued strength in demand for our brands and
for our products.

Jared H. Shojaian
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Last year, you were talking about double-digit
premiums for itineraries that had CocoCay. Are you still seeing that right now? Or is there some degree of
-- when you bring a new ship on, there's inaugural pricing and then you start lapping that? Are you still
getting those same type of premiums today? And then in your yield guide of 2.25% to 4.25%, how much
of that is because of CocoCay, both the ticket and the nonticket assumptions?

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Jared, it's Michael. I'll let Jason respond to the question on the yield guide, but with regards to Perfect Day
and the demand that we're seeing coming through, we're very pleased with both demand and rate. And
I think the volume that we're expecting out of Perfect Day this year is close to 2.4 million guests. We've
deployed more ships into Perfect Day. And we've been really pleased with both the demand and the pricing
for the product.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Taking the midpoint of our guide, about 100 basis points is going to be driven by the new hardware
that's coming on and the balance of that, which also includes Perfect Day, is coming from like-for-like
improvement. So we're -- as we said, we're very, very kind of encouraging -- and we're not going to break
out the 5 months of Perfect Day in terms of our yield guidance.

Just to add to that, on Friday, we opened up the Coco Beach Club in Perfect Day, and that is another new
element of the experience and the overwater cabanas is selling for $1,500 a day and they're pretty much
booked at.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Jason, I was just wondering if you could dissect for us the $0.25 impact or the anticipated, I should say,
$0.25 EPS impact from the canceled 8 cruises? Just wanted to clarify or ask if that's mostly cost? I know
that when you cancel cruises, there's usually not -- there's usually not a corresponding yield impact since
you're removing the APCDs, but in this case, especially the Chinese New Year cruises were some of those
yield -- I'm wondering if some of those yielded higher than your corporate average, and if so, if there was
any yield impact or if you're anticipating any yield impact from the cancellations?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So on that $0.25, the vast majority of it -- so maybe a couple of pennies of it is cost related. The
balance of it really is going to be top line driven. As you pointed out, Felicia, yes, we did lose 2 sailings
that were during that very high-yielding New Year's week. So we do expect it to play a little bit on the
yield, especially in the first quarter and less so on the balance of the year as those APCDs get taken out.
And obviously, in the absolute revenue side, the vast majority of that $0.25 will come out of our top line.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Right. But so for -- is there any way to kind of help us understand in your guidance, how you -- or, I
guess, it's not in your guidance, but how to maybe think about the higher-yielding -- the loss of the
higher-yielding cruises, because like if they were lower-yielding than your corporate average, they would
not have an impact on the yield, right?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Right. But in the first quarter, they are slightly higher than our quarter average. But as it is for the full
year, it's pretty close to the overall average.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. Okay. So -- but there's no way to help us figure out if we wanted to layer it in our estimates what's
it...

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

No, we're not going to be guiding for the first quarter or the full year as it relates to this.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

All right. And then just regarding your commentary on Australia, just wondering if you could help us
understand what your deployment to Australia is specifically on a quarterly basis and for the full year?
And maybe help us know what are you doing to mitigate the lower demand you're seeing for the region
or any alterations you're making to accommodate for the situation there? And then also, just hoping you
can reconcile the comment that close-in bookings were strong for Australia with the impact you're seeing
in Australia?

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So Australia for the year, Q1 and Q4 are the heavy periods. There's a little bit that happens in Q2.
So in the first quarter, Australia is about 12% of our capacity. In the fourth quarter, it's about 11% of our
capacity. In the second quarter, it's about 4% of our capacity. So really, the commentary was, during those
bushfires, what we saw was, obviously, the consumer -- the local consumer was very focused on what was
happening there in their country. So we saw a little bit of pullback in terms of activity for close-in. What
we did see as things kind of settled down there is an acceleration of demand and so we were able to fill
the ships. We were able to fill the ships but at a slightly lower pricing just due to the timing of all of it.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Are you seeing more normalized behavior now?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.

Jaime M. Katz
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

You guys had made some commentary that you were reducing dependence on European markets. I think
that's not surprising given some of the commentary we've heard in recent quarters. But do you have any
additional insight on the implied weakness that, that would, for us, maybe what you're seeing on a more
country or regional specific basis?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

I'll just make a few comments and Michael can jump in. It's not a question of us shifting our sourcing
based off of what we're seeing today. Based off of what we were seeing in last year, our brands made
changes to their deployment that really may be the global appeal greater, meaning that you can source
from more markets versus maybe having a ship that was significantly dependent on the U.K. market, as
an example. So our sourcing is a little bit different for Europe this year, but a lot of that's just driven by us
globalizing the sourcing markets for our brands and our products that are based in Europe.

Jaime M. Katz
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then can I just get a clarification on Alaska. I think you had said that it was ahead in bookings,
but I don't know that there was a commentary on pricing and I know for Carnival that was sort of a dodgy
area last year. So if you have any insight on the pricing in the region, that would be helpful.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would just comment, in general. If you take out Azamara, because Azamara won't be in Alaska this
year, it's one of our higher-yielding brands, we expect yield improvement in that product this year.

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

So obviously, pretty encouraging to hear that the coronavirus issue hasn't impacted any of -- or it doesn't
seem to have impacted the western bookings. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Fly
Cruise market coming out of China. How big is that? And is there any impact in that $0.25 number from
the potential passengers flying out of China getting on ships elsewhere?

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

James, it's Michael. Yes, I mean, we've actually been quite active in developing the outbound market and,
of course, this kind of really hit during the spring festival week. So we had some outbound business going
to ships around the world. But of course, a lot of that ended up canceling. That number is built into the
$0.25 that we've already spoken about. And now, obviously, there are no -- there's really no outbound
business, but it peaked during the spring week and it dropped down significantly after that. So there's
really minimal impact at the moment.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

And James, just to add into it, the benefits -- obviously, the ships like Spectrum of the Seas which is really
dedicated to the Chinese market has a greater impact to us because 99.5% of those guests are Chinese.
With the outbound space, we have the opportunity to be able to source guests from other markets, which
will help abate some of that risk.

James Lloyd Hardiman
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, and this might be difficult at this point, obviously. But are
there any rules of thumb as we think about modeling your earnings power, not just as of today, but as
news develops? Is there any sort of rule of thumb, every time a voyage gets canceled, the $0.25, 8
voyages would get us to about $0.03 per ship? Is it that simple? I'm assuming that it's not, but how do we
think about that? And have you thought about your communication strategy as we move forward? And you
learn more, are we going to be getting sort of updates, press releases or are we likely not going to hear
from you for the next sort of 3 months as news develops?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So it's not that linear or you can just take a certain number per voyage. There is variations depending
on the timing of those sailings inside the months that are out there. And obviously, we don't have a
second ship coming in now for several months. I think in terms of our communication strategy, I don't
think we have a set time line to it, but I think that we kind of pride ourselves with being transparent to the
investment community. And as we learn more, I think we would try to take the opportunity to share that
impact.

Your next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.

Timothy Andrew Conder
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a couple more. Jason, you had said that, obviously, as you continue to ramp up the technology
component of your CapEx, that does have a shorter depreciable life and then that's where some of the
additional spending is occurring along with some employee cost in 2020. But is there anything you're
doing maybe amping up a little bit of marketing, just given everything that's gone on here year-to-date
and maybe the increased uncertainty as to how that could or could not impact other areas. Thankfully, it
hasn't so far. Is there any component of that in your spending? And then also related to the cost, can you
quantify for us the Grand Bahama impact to the equity income or just some ballpark area as well as the
wildfires and the other geopolitical items?

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So on the marketing side, there's certainly more marketing costs in the first half of the year. Most of
that is just driven due to the election coming up. So we are trying to get ahead of that cycle. As it relates
to Grand Bahama, as I said, in the first quarter, there's about $0.12 or $0.13 -- I'm sorry, $12 million to
$13 million of equity pickup loss due to that dry dock being closed.

Timothy Andrew Conder
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then any quantification on the Australian wildfire impact or Hong Kong and Middle East impacts?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

No. But certainly, Dubai due to the Middle East, Australia and Hong Kong have -- are weighing on our
yields in the first quarter.

Timothy Andrew Conder
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And if I may throw one other. TUI Cruise, how is that looking at this point, the demand from that JV
on a year-over-year basis?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So 2019 was a more challenging top line year for the German market. But as we look into 2020,
we're seeing a lot of strength in booking on both a rate and volume basis.

Your next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

2 questions. [indiscernible]

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

Robin, we're having trouble hearing you. It's very -- it's very in and out. So I didn't even hear the
question.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Your -- that longer-term guidance. I know you're not very specific to the yield range and that is that you
guys historically talked about 2% to 3% growth. And I'm just wondering, given that you've been coming
in ahead of that for the last couple of years, even outside of the added drivers, is it fair to think that if you
came in at the range where you've been growing yield for last 3 years, that there would be upside to that
2025 number?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, sure. So first, as Richard says, we're -- we're not just trying to hit the ball, we're trying to swing
through the ball. And if you look at -- or in my commentary, I think what we're looking for here is to
leverage the investments we're making, to have moderate yield growth and continue to have good cost to
someone.

Operator

Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

2 follow-ups. So first on TUI, how do you think about the value or opportunity in Continental Europe
brands, whether organically through TUI or via M&A longer term? And then second, on the near-term first
quarter targets, can you just talk to what is embedded in the net cruise costs kind of across dry dock, puts
and takes, marketing costs, et cetera?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as it relates to -- TUI Cruise is, obviously, I mean, the performance of that brand has been
exceptional, and we really believe that in the German market and TUI Cruise's position in that market,
how it's trading, how it's growing in its demand, we're very happy and which makes us very excited about
the German market and the overall European market. As it relates to -- on the cost, I think you were
talking about the first quarter, your cost piece. The main drivers in that first quarter are really just driven
by investments in marketing, in technology and in G&A. Certainly, Perfect Day plays into that a little bit.
It's about 60 basis points of the first quarter cost increase.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

So I guess, a quick follow-up on that. So can you -- is there any way you can help quantify the dry dock
puts and takes as we think about the ships that are in and out and maybe the cost of each?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Well, the dry docks for the first quarter in itself, it's lighter in the first half of the year than it is -- I'm
sorry, there's more dry docks in the first half of the year than there is in the first. So probably about 1
point of that cost increase, more or less about 1 point of the cost increase is driven by months having
more dry dock days in the first half of the year -- or in the first quarter.

Your next question comes from Brandt Montour with JPMorgan.

Brandt Antoine Montour

Great. So you noted the contingency plans that you have in place in China. I was just wondering if

play into your strategy?

So Brandt, obviously, we're monitoring events and we're looking at competitors. We have our plans in
place. We have alternatives. We filled it through. I really don't actually want to go into detail on this call
about what those plans are because we are in a very competitive environment. So we don't want to start
talking about where we're planning on deploying if this really does play out to a much longer time spend.

Brandt Antoine Montour
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Fair enough. Okay. And then on fuel, just given the mix shift and the way that your hedge book has
probably changed now versus 12 months ago, could you either give us sort of sensitivity between the 2
fuel grades or a fuel grade mix on the -- at the pump portion of your exposure?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Well, our goal is to mainly have a similar mix of our fuel to the balance of 2020 as we had in 2019. We are
more hedged on the MGO side, and those schedules will get published in our -- by Carola later in the day
for you to be able to have the mix of fuel and those hedge positions. And then from there, you should be
able to look at the flex in MGO and IFO fuels.

Your next question comes from Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.

Assia Plamenova Georgieva
Infinity Research

A couple of questions. The first one, in terms of China and enforcement of people who have traveled to
China in the past, within the past 15 days, that seems to be somewhat easy, looking at their passports.
But it seems that a couple of the other items that you intend to enforce seem to be on honor system,
whether they've been in contact with individuals or report feeling unwell. That would be enough to prevent
a negative event where you have even, let's say, 1 passenger reported with the virus because we saw
what happened with Costa, and that was a significant hit.

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Yes, it's Michael. Obviously, it's a very dynamic and moving situation. We're monitoring this on a daily
basis. We have a medical team as part of our company and we're very connected to the World Health
Organization and CDC. I think you'll see that as each day passes, different countries enforce different
rules, protocols and regulations. We implemented protocols early last week, about -- almost up to 2 weeks
ago. And we're monitoring all of these different protocols. So I think with regards to people who from, to
or transited through Mainland China or Hong Kong, nearly all countries now are adopting the same kind
of protocols, generally. We also have, as you say, part of it is an honor system, but we have a secondary
screening system in place on our fleet that's been in place now for quite some time, which monitors
activity in passports and, of course, the passport holder themselves, and we are taking temperatures,
et cetera, et cetera. So yes, you're right. I mean, I think, it's, of course, a possibility but not only are
countries, but our company itself are taking a series of what we believe to be very prudent and sensible
actions that will not entirely eliminate the risk but massively minimize this risk.

Assia Plamenova Georgieva
Infinity Research

Michael, and I definitely will not be allowed on the ship because I'm wondering whether -- as you might
be able to hear from my voice, but it's good to know that you're monitoring temperatures, et cetera.
And as a follow-up, airlift that has been limited, could that affect voyages that sail out of Japan or other
destinations in the Pacific, including to Australia?

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Yes. I mean, I think, again, to my previous comment, it's really a dynamic, moving situation. There are
various changes that are being put into place by different countries, et cetera. We've seen change with
airlift from the -- for example, the Western American Airlines, where they did suspend flights in and out
of China until the end of March. We're not really seeing a lot of regional disruption in terms of flights,
et cetera. What we are seeing is different countries adopting these various protocols, which seem to be
moving to a similar protocol. I think the World Health Organization made a point last week when they
spoke about the smaller countries that obviously have less resources to deal with this, and they tend to
still be making different decisions as it relates to their individual protocols. But that's more of an impact on
individual itineraries. And of course, we always have alternative ports of call to visit. So again, it's difficult
to answer specifically. I think it's just a dynamic, moving situation. The good thing is that there is a really
universal effort to work together to contain and minimize the impact of this situation.

Assia Plamenova Georgieva
Infinity Research

Fair enough. And if I can sneak one last one in. And here's my wishful thinking possibly, with IMO 2020
now in place, do you think -- and maybe, Jason, you might be able to answer this best, do you think that
we might see a decline in IFO prices, which would offset the increased demand for MGO to a point where
we're not going to see quite as much of a pickup in fuel prices post hedge?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Well, I think that is a working theory. It's also why if you look at our hedge position, we're hedged
more in MGO than we are in IFO is that it is rational that as time goes on here, demand for IFO is going to
drop -- continue to drop and, of course, demand for MGO is going to continue to rise.

Your last question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.

Vince Charles Ciepiel
Cleveland Research Company

Just big picture. Just curious how you feel today versus back in November setting aside the impact of
coronavirus kind of across your core North American or European markets? How do you feel about the
trajectory of bookings and pricing growth? And maybe specifically, I think it was in November that you
noted pricing was tracking ahead for all quarters. I'm just trying to reconcile that with 1Q, which, I guess,
it's kind of guided flat. But has anything changed in the last 90 days with 1Q specifically?

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

No, this is Richard. I think we were feeling quite good then, and we have been reassured by seeing the
call volume and the response on bookings in the WAVE period. As we said, there are some exceptions, and
we've pointed out a couple in the Gulf and in Australia. But the strength of the bookings, frankly, we have
found -- outside of the Coronavirus, we have found really very reassuring. So I think just from an overall
point of view, we feel quite good about the year.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

And Vince, just to add, in our last call, when we talked about the cadence of our yield growth, we did point
that we expected Q1 to be lighter because our yields last year were up over 9%. And then, of course,
we had Cuba we were going to have to deal with which is impacting us by 120 basis points. So we knew
that Q1 was going to be a more challenging quarter, which is why we said it at that point in time. But if
you look into our -- just to our -- when we say since our last call our bookings have trended up by 6% for
2020, that would just show that our sentiment broadly is very, very good.

We've made this point in previous calls. Most industries, when you look to the calendarization, it is the --
cycle is time to define and so you expect a certain sequence between the quarters. Our quarters within the
year tend to be more defined by specific events, the delivery of a new ship when the dry docks take place.
So ours is more episodic, and we have known and tried to telegraph for a while that the first quarter of
this year episodically is low, but that doesn't impact our overall position for the year.
