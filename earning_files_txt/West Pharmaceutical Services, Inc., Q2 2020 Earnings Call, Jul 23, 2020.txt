I now turn the call over to West's CEO and President, Eric Green.

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin
by saying that I'm incredibly proud of how our team members across the globe have remained steadfast
in our commitment to supply the much-needed components and solutions to our customers under tough
circumstances. Our Q2 performance emphasizes the continued resolve of our talented team members, the
strength of our company and the criticality of the role West plays during these unprecedented times.

We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the
lives of patients, which could be more meaningful than at times like today. Driven by our mission, we
experienced another solid quarter reinforced by the right market-led strategy to continuously deliver value
for our customers and the patients we jointly serve.

Moving to Slide 4. The pandemic remains our priority. Given the ever-changing situation, there's a huge
sense of urgency in vaccine development. As the market leader, our teams are working tirelessly with
our customers to ensure we supply the right components and solutions to help resolve this pandemic.
The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines,
including vaccines, is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered. We're
helping our customers in the selection, testing and verification of components. We're doing this in a way
that prepares our customers for the future commercial scale up and launch of any successful vaccine

candidates. As we stated during our first quarter earnings call, we have seen a high adoption rate of
our fluoropolymer coated stoppers made by both West and our partner, Daikyo. These are the industry
standard for packaging-sensitive molecules with an outstanding track record of quality and reliability.

Notably, some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made this decision to use the best-
in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety. As our customers' vaccine
development rapidly moves into clinical trials, the entire West team has stepped up to make certain
we can supply the demand for our high-value products as well as any immediate surge in request for
therapeutics. The organization is also preparing for the potential volume surges that could come if and
when vaccines are approved for human use. All the work over the past few years across the enterprise to
drive commercial and operational excellence, along with globalizing West's manufacturing operations, has
put us in the best possible position to meet the future pandemic demand.

We are accelerating our capacity expansion to manufacture FluroTec and NovaPure components. These
investments were in our 5-year plan, and we have brought them forward to address the expected increase
in demand the latter part of this year and into 2021. From our perspective, it is still too early to estimate
how much volume could be generated by vaccine packaging. However, whether it's hundreds of millions or
billions of doses, our West team is prepared and ready when the time comes.

Turning to Slide 5 and our performance in the second quarter. Our financial position remains strong. I'm
pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters have continued
in the second quarter, and the outlook for the balance of the year remains positive. We had 14% organic
sales growth in the second quarter, driven again by robust high-value product sales. And with HVP sales
growth, we have experienced strong gross and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong
adjusted EPS for the second quarter.

To be clear, the majority of the organic growth in the second quarter was from our base business with
some incremental growth coming from COVID-19 sales related to therapeutics. As for guidance, we
believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year. That said, because of the strength and
resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support
our customers with COVID-19 solutions, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year.

Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our second quarter
financial performance and the outlook. Bernard?

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Eric, and good morning. I hope everyone continues to be healthy and safe during this time. So
let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw
strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics
market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter
as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review guidance for 2020.

First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 6, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP
measures are described in Slides 13 to 17. We recorded net sales of $527.2 million, representing organic
sales growth of 14.3%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $19 million
in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with treatment and
diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers, affected by lower volumes due to the
pandemic and stay-at-home restrictions, such as dental, veterinary and elective procedures.

We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $195.1 million in gross profit, $37.2 million
or 23.6% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 37% was a 340 basis point expansion from
the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $106 million recorded
this quarter compared to $81.9 million in the same period last year for a 29.4% increase. Our adjusted
operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point increase from the same period last year.

Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 40% for Q2. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2, EPS grew by
approximately 38%.

WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Moving to Slide 7. Our proprietary product sales grew organically by 13.3% in the quarter. High-value
products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double digits
and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q2. Looking at the performance of the
market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with
many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings.

The generics market unit experienced double-digit growth led by FluroTec and film-coated products sales.
Our Pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth, with sales led by high-value products and services,
including Westar and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales
growth for the second quarter, led, once again, by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection
devices.

So what's driving the growth in both revenue and profit? On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales
growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $59.4 million or 12.6 percentage points of growth,
including approximately $19 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price
increases contributed $7.8 million or 1.7 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency
exchange rates reduced sales by $9.6 million or a reduction of 2 percentage points.

Looking at margin performance. Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 37% for Q2 2020,
up from 33.6% in Q2 2019. Proprietary products second quarter gross profit margin of 42.8% was 330
basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2019. The key drivers for the continued
improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven
by high-value products; production efficiencies; and sales price increases, partially offset by increased
overhead costs.

Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 19% was 470 basis points above the margin
achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Improvement is a result of improved efficiencies and plant
utilization. There was approximately 180 to 200 basis points positive impact on margin, primarily due to
a onetime engineering project work. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.1% was a 270 basis point
increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our gross profit expansion. One point to
note, we took a onetime charge of $6.3 million for asset impairment. This is included in other operating
expenses.

Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for
the business. On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $205.2
million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $52.5 million compared to the same period last year, a
34% increase. Our year-to-date capital spending was $69.2 million, $12.1 million higher than the same
period last year and in line with guidance. Working capital of $735.4 million at June 30, 2020 was $18.3
million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in inventory, mainly as a result of
increasing our safety stock levels and accounts receivable due to increased sales activity.

Both DSO and DPO improved in the quarter. Our cash balance at June 30 of $445.9 million was $6.8
million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. Our capital
and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong.

Turning to guidance. Slide 11 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be
in a range of between $2.035 billion and $2.055 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental
revenues of $60 million. There is an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange
rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 12.5%. This compares to prior guidance of
$1.95 billion to $1.97 billion and growth of 8%. We do expect growth in Contract Manufacturing to be less
in H2 versus H1 as a result of tougher comps. We expect our full year 2020 reported diluted EPS guidance
to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared to prior guidance of $3.52 to $3.62.

As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet
anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand. CapEx guidance has raised to $170 million to $180 million.
This compares to previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million.

WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated
FX headwind on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange
rates. The revised guidance also includes $0.16 EPS impact from our H1 tax benefits from stock-based
compensation.

So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary
and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth
in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow. Our long-term construct remains at
approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and continued EPS expansion.

I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric.

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Bernard. We have a rich history of leading in times of great challenge. Our customers
expect this of us, and this is what we're committed and prepared to do. I want to emphasize that across
West, we are leveraging our global manufacturing capabilities, size and scale to innovate, lead and operate
with a sense of urgency to make a positive impact in health care and society. Our performance continue to
reaffirm that our market-led strategy is delivering unique value propositions to our customers. Our global
operations team is efficiently manufacturing and delivering products with market-leading service and
quality. And we're continuing to invest in our business with digital technology and automation across our
operations to field an even brighter future. We remain committed to deliver value to all our stakeholders
on a sustainable basis as well as to maintain and build upon the values that make up our One West team.
On behalf of the team members at West, we continue to wish you good health in the days ahead. Josh,
we're ready to take questions. Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Avendano with Bank of America.

Juan Esteban Avendano
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Congratulations on the quarter and the role that you're planning in the COVID response. My first -- yes.
My first question is, what is the mix between FluroTec and NovaPure components that you're seeing being
evaluated by the COVID vaccine players? And any thoughts on the most likely packaging format, such as
single dose or multi dose and how many doses in the multi dose?

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Juan, let me take these 2 questions. One is, in regards to FluroTec and NovaPure components,
primarily most of the interest with -- and again, we have a pretty healthy participation rate with the
number of companies working on a vaccine solution. In the vaccine area, we're seeing more interest
around FluroTec as the primary technology and -- versus NovaPure. Now there are certain situations
where NovaPure is a better solution, and customers have elected to go in that direction, but the majority,
I would say, is in FluroTec. In some of the therapeutics that we're working on, where they're already
marketed or being labeled expanded, that's using the combination, mostly NovaPure and some FluroTec.

In regards to the second part, that's a tough question where we stand today. As you think about how our
customers are looking at vial configuration, whether it's one dose or multiple doses per vial. And it's a
little bit uncertain at this point in time. But the way that we've mapped out all these opportunities with
our customers, each one is a little different from a number of doses, the volumes that we're looking at
would accommodate either one dose or multiple doses per vial. But at this point in time, I think it's pretty
difficult to pinpoint exactly number of doses per vial that our customers will be going with.

Juan Esteban Avendano
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Appreciate the responses and the color there. And my second question is, we've seen a number of public
announcements from Corning silicon oxide or SiO2 and ApiJect on the glass vial supply side for COVID-19.
I would have expected to have seen something on Crystal Zenith from West. And so my short question
is, what can you tell us about Crystal Zenith, how it compares competitively versus some of the other
solutions out there that have gotten government grants for the COVID response? And what sort of COVID
opportunities are you seeing for Crystal Zenith?

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's -- we look at it a little differently. I think when you think about the preferred solution in the
market right now, it's still glass. And so I know that the companies that are manufacturing glass are
working on making sure they have the appropriate volumes, but I can't speak to them specifically.
When you think about Crystal Zenith, it's already a proven technology in the marketplace with a number
of critical drugs, specifically around the biologics. And the demand that we have for Crystal Zenith is
increasing. In fact, we are in process of increasing capacity in our Scottsdale, Arizona facility to address
the increase around our 1mL Insert Needle technology.

We do see certain customers that require the Crystal Zenith technology in the areas of vaccine exploring
that option. But I would say, at this point, we have not gone out and sought government grants. Frankly,
I think our company, as the market leader, we're leading from the front, and we've worked with a number
of customers around the CZ technology. But I would say right now, what it looks like is that the preferred
solution on the immediate phase would be around glass.

Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.

John Charles Kreger
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Can you talk a bit more about your CapEx expansion plans? Are you -- can we assume you're running sort
of at full tilt at this point, or do you have the ability to flex your output with your current configuration?
And when can we expect the new capacity to come online that you talked about with the higher CapEx
budget?

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes, John, what we have done is we decided to bring forward capital in regards to specifically equipment
that will be placed strategically in 3 of our center of excellence sites of high-value products. We had these
-- this equipment earmarked for latter years based on trajectory of our current business and our current
portfolio. But due to our discussions with customers, we are preparing to make sure that we'll be able to
address this surge that we'll see, specifically around FluroTec stoppers in the marketplace.

Now in regards to the timing, we're looking at towards the end of this year of having the capacity installed
and validated, and we will be able to start the expansion of volume at that point in time. Bernard, do you
want to talk a little bit more on the…

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, on the timing, John, some of the capacity will be in -- at the end of this year, and it's particularly
related to FluroTec products, and then we will be layering in incremental capacity early on in 2021. And
so all of the commitments that we have needed to put in place are actually in place with our equipment
suppliers at the moment. So we'll have a phased introduction of that equipment so it won't have any -- it
won't disrupt our business in any way. All of the equipment that we're ordering is replicating equipment
that we already have in place at West, so we're really set up well to make sure that we can onboard that
equipment quickly and meet customer demand.

John Charles Kreger
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Excellent. Just a follow-up to that. What sort of capacity boost will that give you for FluroTec, if you're
willing to say?

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We haven't revealed exactly the amount, but it's significant, in the areas around FluroTec, specifically.

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, so based on all of the discussions we've had with customers and analyzing where -- a number of
different models, and we believe that we will have sufficient equipment in place to meet any customer
demand when it comes.

John Charles Kreger
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Excellent. I guess one last one. Anything you can add on the sustainability of the pickup in growth in
Contract Manufacturing?

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Yes. What's happening with the Contract Manufacturing really is around the diagnostics area and also
injectables, auto injectors. And what we're finding is this -- a lot of this is installed capacity that we've
been ramping up for the last couple of years. We do see that the growth rate of high single digits to low
double digits is more in line with what we expect of Contract Manufacturing, and it has been running a
little bit stronger over the last several quarters.

But on the other side, we continue to have discussions about future installed capacity of similar products.
So we see the second half of this year a little bit softer than the first half from a Contract Manufacturing
perspective.

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

But that's purely a comp issue on the growth rates. From a dollar perspective, we don't see any softening
in Contract Manufacturing. You can see the revenue itself growing, but it will grow at slower rates, purely
because of the comps that we're facing in the back half of the year. And you can see the positive impact
that's having, John, on margins, where we were able to report 19%.

Now, there were some onetime gains in there regarding certain engineering work that we were doing,
which we would not expect to repeat in the second half of the year, but we forecast to see strong quarter-
over-quarter growth when we compare to last year on the margin front. And this is something that we've
been talking about for a while as we continue to improve the efficiencies and the utilizations within the
Contract Manufacturing network and taking a lot of the learnings that we've had in Proprietary over the
last number of years and really starting to implement those within Contract Manufacturing. So I would
continue to see -- expect to see margin expansion, but not to the levels of 19%.

Operator

Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the nice acceleration. I wanted to ask a couple of questions around your COVID vaccine
comments. We are hearing from some other vendors that are involved in the development, whether it
be in clinical trial space or maybe contract manufacturing space, about the government's involvement
in the overall funding -- or various governments, I guess I should say, in the overall funding of these
development activities and discounting as a result. And I guess I want -- you're clearly calling out FluroTec
and NovaPure and you have for a little bit. Are you getting or expecting to get full price on those volumes
when they ultimately scale up and go commercial, hopefully?

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Dave, our agreements with our customers are based on historic and also current price points, so we
are looking to obtain what we traditionally have received for those products. I realize that there's some
funding going into certain manufacturing or R&D side, but we're not seeing the money really going into
the percentage of COGs or the money going into the COGs of the supply base, so it's low. If you think
about our product on a configuration, could be anywhere between $0.15 to $0.35. And if it's one dose
or 5 dose, you can see how, from a per dose perspective, it's not a significant percentage of the COGs.
So I think we're well positioned, and the expectation is to continue with our policies around how we price
according to the value we create to support our customers.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So on the -- you anticipated where I might go next, Quintin may have tipped you off. The -- I guess the
curiosity that I have is that the -- that historical argument has been one that you've made. I've certainly
made that the cost of these components as a percentage of, in most cases, a very high-priced, maybe
even 4 figure per dose type price on a biologic is a very, very small percentage. When we're talking about

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

a price per dose at what some of these companies are promising at like $10 or if it's a 4 or 5 dose per
vial, it's -- maybe it's $40 or $50 of value, is a very different equation than $1,000 dose biologic. How
is it that the interest level or the sensitivity to that price is as low as it is -- or appears to be as low as
it is? And I guess to spin the question the other way, if customers are able to get over that so easily in
this environment, is that a signal that the adoption rate outside of COVID for high-value products should
significantly accelerate because the price sensitivity is really as low as it is?

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

I can take the first part of the question, and maybe Eric might want to cover the second part of the
question, Dave. So -- just so we're clear, we have -- we're not getting support from any government.
West is investing an extra $40 million essentially this year in CapEx and even some into 2020. We've --
obviously, we're funding that ourselves. And when you look at -- you're comparing the cost of our product
to the selling -- the end selling price. What we're saying is the cost of our product is a percentage of their
COGS. So their COGS doesn't change no matter what they sell the product at, the cost of producing is
still the same. And we're still a relatively low part of that. And then if you work out the price per dose,
potentially, there could be 5, 10, 20 doses in a vial. Well, we sell one stopper per vial, so you got to divide
back the cost of the stopper by the number of doses, so it becomes a really small part of the COGS.

Regarding pricing, we haven't gone and tried to jack-up prices in this whole process. We're maintaining
the pricing essentially that we've had in place on many of these products. Now, pricing changes a lot of
times regarding configuration, but I think that's the way to look at it rather than saying as a percentage of
their price, if that's helpful for you, and then the number of doses per vial.

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

And Dave, when you think about our customers have been and will -- have been using our -- if they're
using FluroTec or they're using NovaPure, are very comfortable with it because they have used our
components on other molecules they have in the marketplace for other purposes, especially around
biologics. And so there's a comfort of when they think about how they can go to the market fast. When
you think about regulatory, you think about safety, you think about quality and scale, and we have the
scale. We can manufacture the volumes that we're speaking of in a very, very short period of time. So I
think, Dave, that's where that gives the customers confidence and comfort to continue to go after that
part of our portfolio versus using this basic standard product. And -- so I'll stop there, but that's the
reason why we're seeing the demand in that area.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And maybe a last question. In the news, at least, I'm sure by numbers and perhaps the ones that
don't get as much interest or press, the smaller companies are numerous. Some of the highest profile
of these players chasing the vaccine and the ones in work seed, for example, I would think would be
classified in your pharma segment. Can you speak to differences in growth rate that you're seeing? Is
that something perhaps as simple as timing as to where those inquiries and adoption rates and sampling
demand might come from in regard to, again, like just to name a couple, of the AstraZenecas and J&Js of
the world that are in this vaccine chase?

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, Dave, when you think about, whether it's small or large, because of the nature of the molecule,
we classify that as biologic.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay, okay.

WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So when we talk about vaccines, we're all encompassing. I wouldn't try to split out the vaccine
opportunities between the 3 units from our performance perspective.

Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Just a couple of follow-ups. Eric, you mentioned the $0.15 to $0.35 per vial, would that be just for
FluroTec? Or what is that sort of range discussing? And you mentioned some companies -- some
customers have chosen NovaPure, which I get encompasses sort of all the HVPs. Is there anybody just
choosing FluroTec and maybe would Westar also potentially get into that equation?

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Larry, it does vary on what the final configuration and all the additional services we provide. That
number that was referenced is more around the FluroTec portfolio versus NovaPure. NovaPure is higher.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Right. Okay. And the $19 million you guys referred to in the quarter, $19 million in the quarter and the
$60 million for COVID-related revenue, is that the full year number?

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. That's the full year.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

That includes the…

Eric M. Green
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Yes, that's the full year number, about $60 million that we see right now.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Got it. And I imagine some -- you'd mentioned a little bit on the therapeutic side [indiscernible] I guess.
And then the vaccines, I guess, obviously, it's just verification of components and testing and whatnot and
then inevitably, if something is commercialized and scaled, then you would -- obviously, number would
grow a lot more. Is that how we look at that?

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Larry, the way I look at it -- yes, I think you're right. It's the way we break it out. And the way we're
looking at -- we don't give out the numbers, but we're very -- we're segmented, so we understand what's
around hospital enablement, so this is like the IV and blood tubes. You think about supporting therapies,
particularly in the ICU. And then therapeutic treatments, which we have a very high participation rate
because of our biologics position. Those are really the key areas when you think about more near term.
As we think about vaccines, as we work with our customers, obviously, there is some element of providing

product for trials, but that is obviously low volume. And therefore, we don't -- we can't -- it's very difficult
to predict when and how much and by whom. So we're holding off at this point. But as we've said in our
capital investment is that we are going ahead to ensure that we have the capacity in hand -- on hand by
the end of this year, so we can handle the surge if it is as early as early 2021 or late 2020.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Got it. And then the margins in the quarter sort of really demonstrate the power of the operating model
with 37% and 20% operating. Was there anything unusual? I know you called out a couple of hundred
bps on the Contract Manufacturing side. Was there anything else unusual in the quarter that could have
benefited those margins?

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

Other than the piece on Contract Manufacturing that I called out, Larry, all of the COVID-related costs
have been recorded in COGs. They're all included in that margin number. So it's pretty clean other
than the CM piece. And I think the Contract Manufacturing piece -- yes, that's about it. And then within
operating margin, we called out the impairments of certain assets and that's a onetime.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Right. But you took that out on the adjusted number, right? Or is that in the adjusted number too, the
write off?

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

Sorry, I can't hear you.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Is the write-off in your adjusted number or you adjusted out?

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

In the adjusted number, it's in there.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Oh, it is in there. Okay.

Bernard J. Birkett
Senior VP & CFO

We didn't back it out.

Lawrence Scott Solow
CJS Securities, Inc.

Okay. And then you mentioned some -- the increased overhead, which impacted your margins a little
bit. Is that in reference to FluroTec and NovaPure or that capacity or that hasn't come online yet? It's
something else I guess, right?

Senior VP & CFO

WEST PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Yes. Well, there is costs around PPE. There's incremental costs supporting a lot of the workforce at our
plants. We've gone to split shifts, so -- and we're obviously paying shift premiums to keep the plants up
and running. So -- and then also, there was some incremental freight costs.

Operator
