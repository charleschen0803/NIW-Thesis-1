Operator

Welcome to Franklin Resources' Earnings Conference Call for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2020. My
name is Roshay, and I will be your operator -- call operator today.

Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of
1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other
important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commissions, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A section of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-
Q filings.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn
your call over to Franklin Resources President and CEO, Jenny Johnson. Ms. Johnson, you may begin.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Hello and thank you for joining us to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our first fiscal quarter of
2021. Following the close of the Legg Mason transaction on July 31, the results we announced earlier
this morning include the first full quarter of the combined organization. On the call with me today is Greg
Johnson, our Executive Chairman; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO.

And joining the call for the first time is Adam Spector. Adam joined our firm last July as managing partner
of Brandywine Global and additionally became our Executive Vice President and Head of Global Distribution
on October 1.

To start, we hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. We'd also like to recognize our incredible
employees who continue to work hard every day on behalf of our clients and firm.

It has been 6 months since we closed our acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment
managers. And over that time all while under a remote work environment, we've made significant
progress in bringing our teams together to maximize our collective potential. We're seeing a high degree
of stability within the organization as well as a number of encouraging trends across the business.

First off, assets under management reached a record high of approximately $1.5 trillion this quarter,
driven primarily by strong market performance. That's an increase of $79 billion or 6% during the quarter.

Turning next to operating and financial results. Adjusted revenues increased by 20% to $1.5 billion,
primarily due to an additional month of Legg Mason results. Higher revenues and continued expense
discipline resulted in a 28% increase in adjusted operating income to $550 million and an increase in
operating margin to 37.2%.

On the performance front, our investment results improved this quarter with 61%, 66%, 68% and 75%
of our strategy composites outperforming their respective benchmarks for the 4 key time periods. Looking
deeper into those numbers, Western Asset continues to have standout performance and reached $423
billion in long-term assets and $480 billion in total assets, its highest level on both fronts in over a decade.
Brandywine performance rebounded strongly and saw net inflows into global multi-sector products in the
latter part of the quarter.

And as we saw improvement in performance at ClearBridge and across many Franklin Templeton
strategies, ClearBridge is another example of one of our specialized investment managers reaching a
record in AUM, which was $176 billion at quarter end. Likewise, our Fiduciary Trust net worth AUM is at

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

an all-time high of $32 billion, while the business also generated positive net flows for the quarter. Record
AUM levels were also reached for Clarion Partners at $58.1 billion.

Long-term relative investment performance of our U.S. and international mutual funds also improved this
quarter. A significant driver of the improvement was our Franklin Income Fund, and several of our value-
oriented equity strategies also generated noteworthy results. We continue to see strong performance in
U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income. Our mutual funds that are rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar increased
during the quarter and now number 140 funds.

On the distribution front, long-term net outflows were $4.5 billion, which includes $12.6 billion of
reinvested distributions. But notably, momentum continued to build with positive flows into a number of
our specialized investment managers, including Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge,
Fiduciary Trust, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income; Martin Currie, Royce, and
Western Asset Management. Franklin Equity Group saw strong inflows, which were led by the Franklin
Biotech Fund, which reached a record $22.5 billion in AUM.

As of quarter end, we have a promising institutional pipeline of opportunities and a combined total of one
but unfunded wins of $11 billion. As we've noted on previous calls, a strategic focus for the firm has been
to expand our alternatives platform to offer strategies that do not lend themselves to passive replication.
With $127 billion in assets under management in alternatives and robust relationships across the retail
channel, we've seen demand for our retail alternative offerings increase. Our EMEA region led the way
with a focus on multi-strategy, social infrastructure and real estate.

Also importantly as we look to deliver investment expertise through our clients' investment vehicle of
choice, we now have a top 3 market position in the retail SMA business, which saw positive net flows this
quarter and increased to $113 billion in assets.

In other news, we were excited to launch our new Franklin Templeton Investment Institute, an innovative
hub for research and knowledge sharing. Steven Dover will be leading that effort. With the launch of
the institute, we're doubling down on what sets our firm apart: unmatched insight and research from
experts on the ground in over 70 locations around the world, at the same time tapping into the strength
of our collective leadership talent, we've expanded Terrence Murphy's role to become head of equities for
Franklin Templeton, while retaining his existing role as CEO of ClearBridge Investments. While our equity
teams will continue to maintain their individual investment processes and autonomy, Terrence will facilitate
collaboration across the groups to drive results and growth.

Looking at another key area, capital management remains an important focus. Our strong balance sheet
continues to provide us with financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business. Cash and investments
totaled $6.3 billion following the public offering of 750 million aggregate principal senior notes due 2030
issued at a 1.6% coupon. As previously explained, it is our intention to pay down more expensive debt
with the proceeds of the offering.

Excluding net proceeds from the senior note offerings, we have $5.5 billion in cash and investments. We
also continue our track record of dividend growth for the 40th consecutive year, with a 4% increase to our
regular dividend in December.

To wrap things up, over the past 6 months, we've created a stronger firm that combines the best of both
worlds: global strength and boutique specialization. Our global presence has expanded in key growth
markets around the world with a greater range of specialized high-quality investment capabilities, and we
think that all points to a positive future.
Now I'd like to open up the call to your questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question, line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I'm curious. You talked about cross-selling initiatives have started to yield positive results. You talked
about Adam being new Head of Global Distribution. Can we drill down a little further, get some color on
what Adam's mandate is? What new initiatives are producing these cross-sells? And what's being cross
sold?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I mean there's nothing better than hearing it from the horse's mouth, so fortunately, we have Adam
on the line. So Adam, take it away.

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

I think I was just called a horse there. So if I think about what we're trying to do, it's really 3 priorities:
growth...

[Technical Difficulty]

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

I think Adam is dialing back in. So why don't I start?

I mean we are -- for example, our largest distributor has just added 10 new funds. Many of them are Legg
Mason funds, and we -- so we're seeing good penetration that is really cross-selling. And again as we
talked about, Franklin was much stronger on the independent side; Legg Mason was much stronger on the
wirehouse side. And so we've been able to basically cross-sell platform listings and getting through the
gatekeepers on those platforms, so that's worked well.

And just to give you an idea from a diversification of flows, if you look at the top 9, I don't know why
I have the top 9 instead of the top 10. But the top 9 of -- it accounts for about 38% of our flows. 5 of
those are Legg Mason funds. 4 are Franklin funds, 3 of them are fixed income, 5 are equities, and one
is balanced. So we're seeing both diversification by getting products on the platforms, cross-selling on
platforms and getting through the gatekeepers and getting them listed. So we'll continue to see more
penetration as well as good diversification with the types of products so that we don't have kind of the risk
of a single large product that potentially gets out of favor. So it's much more diversified.

I don't know, Greg, if you want to add anything there?

Gregory Eugene Johnson
Executive Chairman

Adam [ will cover it ].

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Adam, you're back on? Great.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

Yes, I don't know how I got cut off on a landline with a cellphone. That's it, but that's a new one in this
day and age of working from home.

So I did not have the ability to hear what Jenny said, so I'm going to maybe overlap a bit with her
comments.

But in terms of cross-selling, there are a couple of things I would point to. One, the firm's legacy Franklin
and legacy Legg Mason had different strength. Franklin was really strong, for instance, in the regional
broker-dealers, and we've been able to get Western and ClearBridge products on the platform there. We're
seeing positive momentum there.

At the same time, when we look at something like the wires where Legg Mason traditionally was a little
stronger, we've been able to have some real success with BSP there through legacy Legg Mason.

The same thing is really true if we look outside of the United States where Franklin, for instance was much
stronger in Canada, Legg Mason had a real strength in Japan. So we've been able to start some cross-
selling initiatives there that are really quite positive.

And even within countries where outside of the U.S. where both firms were strong like Germany, we had a
situation where Franklin was much stronger in the retail banking world, Legg Mason in the private banking
world. And again, that lets us sell one set of products into the other legacy distribution system. Those are
the types of cross-selling efforts that have been really strong. I would also say that cross-selling comes
into play on defense as well where we've had clients, for instance, that are in particular strategies that
might be higher alpha, higher tracking error strategies. When they want to derisk, what we've seen is
that that money, instead of leaving our system, can shift to another lower-vol strategy that's within the
system. So we're actually doing a better job retaining assets through cross-selling as well.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I think that's a lot of progress and a lot on to come, and you combine that with all your new product
offerings. I hate to be too forward leading, but do you have a shot at getting back towards flat flows like
sometime towards the end of this year? Are we trending that much in that direction?

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

I think we're trending really well. We see momentum. We see it month over month. Sales are strong.
Redemptions are getting better.

And the other thing is we now have a combined sales force that's been in place for its first full quarter. And
let's face it, it takes people a little bit of time to hit their stride. And they're hitting it now, so I'm feeling
very good about the future.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.

Craig William Siegenthaler
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wanted to come back and dig a little bit deeper on your comments on rising demand for alternatives
in the European retail channel. Can you talk about what markets and channels are driving the demand?
And also, what type of products or characteristics are they looking for, things like yield or low correlation
downside protection?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

Adam, do you want to take that? I mean...

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

Sure.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Well, go ahead.

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

I think we're really seeing a push for alternatives in all regions and all countries. And that's one of our
strengths as we think about our core priorities of grow, defend and diversify, diversify is all about moving
more forcefully into alternatives. We have 120-some billion in our alternatives spoke. We're probably the
sleepiest quietest alternatives firm you've never heard of.

And we're making progress. You mentioned Europe, I think there's strong demand there. The other
thing we see in Europe is strong demand for ESG, and we've got some alternative products that combine
alternatives with ESG. That combination has been really strong for us.

The other thing we're working to do is given that we now can offer so many different vehicle types, we're
really trying to take alternatives that used to be predominantly sold in the institutional market in more
of a separate account mandate and package them so that they're much more salable to the broad retail
market.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

And just to add to that, I mean obviously everybody in this low rate environment is looking for yield. And
so you see a lot more searches, both on the institutional side and as Adam mentioned, gaining traction
on the retail side for private credit with BSP perfectly positioned, great performance, traditionally just an
institutional manager, so being well received on the -- and actually have gotten some traction in the retail
side. As well as Clarion. Clarion is coming out of this in the real estate space. There's uncertainty in certain
spaces for real estate, but they've been large industrial tech. They're one of the largest -- I think they are
the largest lessor to the cloud storage environment. And so they performed very, very well.

So in a low yield environment, people are looking for assets with yield. And that has served both Clarion
and BSP well.

Craig William Siegenthaler
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And then I just had a quick follow-up, coming back to Glenn's question on net flows. You guys just
did a big merger. You reduced the size of your sales force, not a lot, but a little bit. So I imagine there
could be some dissynergies out there that you're seeing.

If there are any dissynergies or any kind of redemptions driven by the merger and they're in the flow run
rate today, do you see them dropping off in the future, which should actually help your net flow trajectory?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

I would say that -- let me just start and then Adam will pick up. I would say a couple of things.

One is we're only really aware of 2, we'll call them deal-based redemptions. One in Korea, which we talked
about on the last earnings call; and the most recently, Legg Mason's 529 plan. And part of the issue there
was there was just an agreement that they would only have one 529 plan, and Franklin obviously has one

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

already with the New Jersey 529 plan. Otherwise, we are not seeing any kind of deal issues with respect
to -- look you go from 2 sales forces to one. You're talking about relationships on the retail side, just to
give you an example of say, 150,000 financial advisers. So we're talking like less than 0.1% or so. I mean
just teeny number of complaints with the change of adviser. We've been really surprised by how little
complaints we've had in, ultimately, when you're having to pick kind of who's going to win out a territory.
And that's really because of Legg Mason's strength again in the the big wirehouses and Franklin's in the
independent. So there wasn't kind of overlap you would have expected on many deals. So there was not
really product overlap and not really distribution overlap. Adam, you want to -- anything else...

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

Yes, Jenny hit all the right points. Out of the tens of thousands of advisers we contacted, she's right, we
had less than 10 basis points of negative reaction that we track.

The other thing I would say is that following in the U.S., the sales force is essentially 50-50 legacy Franklin
and legacy Legg. That's not true by channel. Our regional channel is predominantly Franklin Templeton
people. Our wired channel is predominantly Legg Mason. So that really limited the disruption that we had
because we kept the folks who were strongest in specific channels and moved to a channelized approach
in sales, which we did not have before at Franklin Templeton.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

And just it might help to just try and put a little bit of data around this, we -- in the executive
commentary, what we did is in a footnote in some of the charts, we did some -- a little bit of pro forma-
ing assuming we closed the transaction a month earlier to include a full 3 months of Legg Mason. And
when you look at that, you'll notice that the sales are roughly the same and the redemptions are a little bit
lower.

So obviously we want redemptions to come down further. We want sales to go up. But in terms of trying
to understand and quantify attrition risk, when we look at the pattern quarter by quarter, it's looking quite
encouraging so far.

Operator

Your next question, the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I guess one more question just kind of on distribution and sales, and you guys have been discussing
the retail opportunity and the momentum you have. I guess can you talk about the consultants and the
institutional potential opportunity? Maybe also just get into the one but unfunded pipeline, the diversity
there, but also kind of those gatekeepers and how progress in terms of opening up those channels might
be going.

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

Sure. The way I look at one but unfunded is it's good news. It's essentially staying steady. I think the
number is around $11 billion. And it's staying steady, not because we're not adding, but because we're
actually funding deals out of that. So that's going strong.

What I would say in terms of consultants is that Franklin Templeton's central distribution has historically
distributed to the consultant community, the institutional community for the Franklin investment team.
Many of the Legg Mason Investment affiliates, in fact I believe all of them, did that on their own. Going
forward, we're having a differentiated approach where the Legg Mason SIMs will continue to call on the
consultants as they always have. That's been a really successful channel for them. Remember Legg
was much stronger in the institutional business historically, so we're not changing that approach to the

9

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

investment consultants. Outside of the U.S., some of the smaller former Legg Mason SIMs are beginning
to leverage Franklin Templeton's resources, especially in the coverage of field consultants where those
SIMs may cover the research centers on their own but will have much more connectivity with the field
consultant.

I would say in general, what we're trying to do with consultants is similar to what we're trying to do with
global financial institutions, is recognizing that many of these large consultants are global firms, and we
have to face off them holistically as a global firm. So that's how we've organized ourselves, and we are
really allowing each investment team to tap into our centralized coverage of consultants as they see fit. In
general, the larger [ companies ] like Western might not need help at all in that area, where some of the
smaller groups definitely rely on the central distribution team.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the expense outlook, and understand the movement
in assets and higher markets drove a bit of the increase. But just curious about your assumption for
normalization of travel and marketing and spending that kind of went away this past year as you think
about the progress for this year?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So in our numbers and in the guidance that we've given, we've assumed that there will be a pickup in
travel and some other G&A items like advertising in terms of the combined company and what we need to
do there. In the third and fourth quarters in particular, we have moved that forward a bit, but we haven't
taken the money out of our assumptions. So we would expect G&A to creep up a little bit in the next -- in
the last 2 quarters in particular, I would say.

But that's included in the $3.75 billion of guidance. So I think the number that's more likely to move a
little bit, which is what caused the change a little bit in the guidance, is the comp and benefits in line with
revenue. And we expect we're selling more, so there's some more commissions involved in that. It's all
linked with the growth of the business. So I think we could expect the compensation line on an adjusted
basis to go up a couple or so percent, maybe up 3% in the next quarter. But then because of the cost
saves from the transaction, I would expect that to come down in the third quarter by about 1% or 2%,
and then down again in the fourth quarter by about 4%, probably maybe a little bit more than that, which
then gets us to the $3.7 billion to $3.75 billion, maybe a little bit more if the markets stay stable.

Next question from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

First, just a follow-up on the distribution question. Can you provide maybe some context on the process,
and importantly just the timing of getting like the full line of a product or as much as you can throughout
the distribution channels? And maybe for context, what has happened maybe thus far, and what do we
expect in '21 versus longer term?

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

Yes. I think the way I think about this is we had to go about this in several stages. So the first stage was
really selecting the team, getting them settled into their territories, and that happened.

The next stage that we're in the middle of right now is -- because they're all trained, the sales teams are
trained. But in order for them to really cross-sell effectively, we have to get all of our products cross-listed
on the different platforms and research-approved.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

That's really what we're doing now. We've started where you might expect that our largest distribution
partners where we think we can get the most bang. We've got 2 of them already where we've onboarded a
number of products. We are kind of marching through that, and it's going pretty well.

So it's really a question of getting the back offices set up correctly and getting things on the platform. The
distributors themselves are eager to have it. One of the things we're seeing that across the board is that
people want to do more business with fewer bigger players. So the fact that we're able to bring such an
array of investment styles, and not only investment styles but different vehicles from fund to SMAs to ETFs
to these partners, that makes us much more attractive to them. So they're really working as quickly as
they can with us to get our products onboarded.

As we get onboarded, what we're seeing is that we're able to start to sell more. So for instance at some of
the regionals, we've seen a real uptick in December and January for some legacy Legg Mason product on
the regional platforms because those are just getting onboarded now. It's continuing work, but it's going
well and we're a bit ahead of schedule.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then Matt, just on expenses, you provided a helpful update. You also mentioned looking
at additional ways to operate the business more efficiently. Maybe just [ split ] out some of these areas as
well as areas that you're looking at from an investment standpoint?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Mike. So I think there's 2 things there.

First of all, as we spend more time together as a joint company, I think just naturally speaking, we find
interesting ways to improve how we work together. That's not just operational things. It's how we can
share information and improve price of that information from various vendors. We spend a lot of money
on data and information across the investment teams and across the specialized investment managers.
There's a natural embedded leverage in that system in terms of being a safe money, and we're just really
frankly just scratching the surface on that. And that also benefits the teams away from just costs -- away
from just cost, but the cost is a good output from that work.

And then we have been working very hard on our operations side and technology side on the future and
how to position the firm in terms of capital expenditures, understanding what that is, risk management
and potential cost efficiencies with different partners externally. And we've seen some very interesting
things there. So nothing specific to report now, but I think over the next 6 months to a year, we're going
to see some very interesting opportunities for the firm, and we're likely to take action.

And that -- and to put some numbers around it, we don't have any specific guidance today, but we're
talking $20 million, $25 million per annum at least on some of the things we're looking at. And we'll
provide more guidance to that in the next quarter.

Operator

Next question, the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Guys, I wanted to follow up with respect to cross-selling opportunities. And given the combined franchise,
you guys have a really robust set of products and capabilities. And you named quite a bit in terms of
where you're seeing cross-selling opportunities for the combined firm.

I was wondering if you could just kind of maybe narrow this down a little bit. And if we were to focus on 3
affiliates where you're seeing sort of the most incremental dollars of net inflows from cross-selling, what
are those affiliates?

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

I guess I don't really think about it in terms of the most dollars. I think about it as where is there
significant demand. So obviously given Western's broad exposure to everything fixed income and their size
and breadth, we're seeing a lot there.

ClearBridge I would say has a very strong capability in ESG, and that's across the board. With that in
favor, ClearBridge has seen real growth.

Brandywine has a few income-oriented funds that are global. Given the demand for income, that's strong.

Royce, Martin Currie, we saw inflows for them that were more than 5% of the firm, so strong demand
there. If you take a look at a group like Clarion, what's more in demand than alternatives? And they're the
top of their game in real estate.

So really across the board, we're seeing demand for all of our firms.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Well, and I would just add that that's sort of giving the Legg Mason crossing into a lot of the traditional
Franklin. And the reverse of that is in some of the big wirehouses, we're getting interest on BSP. DynaTech
is getting phenomenal, so the Franklin Equity Group support.

And so it's really about bringing the entire firm to where we have deep relationships. And again, it just
wasn't the overlap. So any of those kind of key products across the board are making sense at any of the
firms, it's just filling in and complementing where say, we didn't have the representation.

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

Yes, Jenny, and I misunderstood the question. I thought it was a one-way question. You're right. So
there's equal strength going both directions.

And the other thing we're seeing is that for instance, there are some products that have been around for
decades that we're able to offer in new vehicle types. And that's another way to cross-sell that's really
attractive, and we're seeing significant growth in our SME business there.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great, and I guess along similar lines of new business. Sorry if I missed this, but $11 billion pipeline, can
you specify which affiliates comprise the pipeline and what the fee rate associated with that AUM base?

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

I do not have that data. I have to get back to you from IR on that.

Gregory Eugene Johnson
Executive Chairman

I mean most of it's fixed income with Western, which you'd expect. And some Franklin Templeton fixed
income as well would be the top 2 of the pipeline of funded wins.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

It's Patrick Davitt. First question on the fee rate, obviously already came in a little bit above what you
guided to last quarter, probably I guess because the market came in so much better than you expected.
So is it still fair to assume kind of 36 to 38 with a more normal market? Or do you think it could track even
higher, given you're already above what you guided to last quarter?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

I think look, the way that we'd just sort of describe that, I mean the reason why it was higher is because
of the -- mainly that the increase in equities in the quarter because of the strength of the equity markets.
And then we grew in alternatives also. And I think the right way to answer the question is when we think
about the things that push up the fee, [ typically ] higher in equities and alternatives and lower global
bond outflows. In any of our outflowing areas that we've experienced over the last several quarters that
you're very familiar with, if any of those turn in just -- just a little way, that also helps with the fee rate.
And we saw that in the last quarter also in having less outflows in those areas.

What pushes the fee rate down is if we scale up much faster in institutional fixed income and/or if we see
outflows in the higher -- the areas that I just talked about. I think we model out, and I think we've talked
about this, a fairly steady fee rate for the year, all else remaining equal. We don't see any reason why we
shouldn't be in the 38 area. But there could be a continued significant momentum in institutional fixed
income, which could be a very positive reason for the fee rate going down, [ a lot of ] -- all else remaining
equal.

So that's -- I think 36 is pretty -- very, very much on the low end of things. And I think we would -- we
wouldn't say guide to higher, but I'd certainly say we would expect to be close to where we are today for
the year.

Patrick Davitt
Autonomous Research LLP

Very helpful. My follow ups on the India situation, which looks like it's finally getting close to resolution.
So could you update us on how much AUM we could see come out as those funds open up again that's
already been turned off? So we can kind of adjust our estimates when you report AUM. And then I guess
more broadly, the news was been pretty negative. So any update on the impacts to the broader Indian
franchise would be helpful.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

So I mean first of all, we're thankful that the shareholders voted overwhelmingly in support of winding
up those funds. And then most recently, the Supreme Court came out and approved our being able to
distribute the cash in them, which I think is maybe 42%, if I'm remembering the right percentage of
assets. So that will go out pretty soon.

We are taking a fee on those assets right now, so it's already out from a fee standpoint. And then the --
we continue to see flows, decent flows, but also redemptions in the remainder portion of our business,
both the equity and the liquid assets. We're very much committed to India, and we continue to see
support in that market.

Our next question, line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Yes. [ Take it away ].

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Great. Great. Okay. Just one on the -- just to extend on the fee guidance of the approximately
38 basis points. What is the expectation for money market fund, money market or cash management
product, fee waivers in that, I guess, coming into the year -- coming into the year and this quarter?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, again, the -- yes. So it's embedded in that already. We currently have about something like an $8
million fee waiver at the holding company level or the corporate level. Because of the revenue share with
those involved, principally with the money market fund business, that moves our -- the impact on the
overall firm. It's $8 million. Now we expect that to probably be close to $10 million by the end of the year,
but that's all embedded within the fee rate guidance we just gave.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it. Perfect. And then maybe a follow-up for both Adam and Jenny on the ESG progress, obviously you
said a pretty strong demand in Europe and within alternative products as well. And it sounds like ESG is
fairly well integrated in the research process based on how you're describing it.

But maybe if you could talk about whether you still think there is more integration to happen across the
research investment portfolio management research process, and especially the plan for leveraging that
and launching new ESG dedicated products. And if you can also comment on the AUM that you see right
now in your ESG dedicated products?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

So I always find it interesting. I was talking recently. And somebody gave me a fact or a stat that
something like 1/3 of asset managers' assets are ESG. And the reality is, and I think maybe we have an
advantage as a real global player or anybody who's a global player and has operated in markets in Europe
or Australia, has had to have this very focused and incorporated into their investment process.

So it's our belief that there's going to be no credible manager out there, certainly at an institutional level,
without being able to clearly articulate how they're considering ESG risks in their investment process. And
we feel very good about all of our teams, and they're having incorporated their consideration of those risks
in their investment processes.

As a matter of fact, we've talked about our investment data lake where we have unique sources of data
that are contributed by various teams, and they're available for any teams for their analysis. We've done
the same thing on ESG. So we have a portion of our investment data lake that is dedicated to ESG. So for
example, our global macro team gets 14 different feeds. It goes into the ESG data lake, and that data is
now cleansed and available for any of the teams to consider it in their process.

And that's important as we all know because ESG -- the top 5 ESG providers only correlate 57% of the
time. So you can imagine that it really takes active management and engagement to get accurate ESG
information.

So to answer your question, it is absolutely well incorporated in all of our processes. We also -- Europe is
coming out with something, Article 6, Article 8 and Article 9. And we have been very focused on ensuring,
I think it's the March date, that the products that are selling there and the ones in our pipeline to sell
there qualify for those. So Article 6 is -- it is ESG evaluated and considered. Article 8 is overweight ESG
considerations in like portfolio construction. And Article 9 is really kind of impact investing. And so we have
products like our [ Paris line ], we're the first active global green bond ETF. We have a social infrastructure,
and those are getting good flows there, as well as they qualified the Article 9.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

So we think ESG remains to be seen. And I just anecdotally, prior to lockdown I had visited U.S.
institutions a year before the lockdown. And it was very mixed in the U.S whether or not they were
focused on ESG. And right before the lockdown, I visited institutional investors, and every single one was
talking about ESG.

So that's why we are focused and committed. Adam, I don't know if you want to add to that.

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

I would only say that one of the advantages here of being a global firm is that while this is kind of a
trend that is strong and developed, but a little bit newer in the U.S. We've been active in France and
the Nordics and Australia for years, and it's just part of what you do. It has to be 100% integrated into
your investment process. So all of our investment teams have ESG that's integrated. What we're moving
to do is to create more impact funds kind of at the far extreme of the ESG sector, but we're completely
integrated with ESG across all of their teams at this point.

Next question, line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.

Michael J. Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just want to circle back on the retail SMAs. I think you had mentioned you have about 113 billion of retail
SMAs. I was hoping you can kind of give us a sense of maybe how that breaks down by asset class and
channel, if you could just talk about some of your initiatives to accelerate growth with the retail SMAs, and
which strategies are you most optimistic on growth in the SMA vehicle?

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

I think the places where we're most optimistic about SMAs as a vehicle are for those strategies that
are most in demand. So Franklin Income Fund is still something we sell a lot of, DynaTech, Franklin
Technology, all of those products have very good flows, very good sales, and I think we can move more
from a fund sale to offering different vehicles.

On the Legg Mason side, ClearBridge and Western have been leaders in that for years. From a channel
perspective, we've had the most strength with the SMA business in the wires, and we're starting to expand
more of our SMA.

Michael J. Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Just maybe as a quick follow-up on the SMA side, I guess just any color you could share around
the fee rate and margin profile for your SMA business, maybe how that compares versus say, the 40 Act
mutual fund vehicles. And I imagine it's lower fee, maybe a little bit more costly to serve but arguably
probably, duration of the assets is probably a little bit longer, a little bit more stickier. So I was just curious
any color you could elaborate around that.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

We'll come back to you on that with specifics. I just don't...

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Yes, and I -- the thing I would just highlight there, I mean SMAs are gaining great traction because
in a fee-based environment, it allows the financial adviser to appear to be much more active in their

investment decision. So we think that trend is really important. It's also why direct indexing, we think, it
will be important in the future.

Remember that there are not a lot of those kind of embedded fees that are arguably distribution or service
fees in an SMA that you may have in a mutual fund. So that's why it's -- you can't look at the top line fee
rate and compare it apples to apples because it isn't quite that. But we will come back with more details.

Michael J. Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Right. But is it fair to say that it is longer duration capital that the assets are stickier? Just any thoughts
on that last point?

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

Yes. Yes.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean I think when you think of it as being a minimum of -- it's an average. I can't remember the
exact. I think it's like 5 years or something, something like that as you think about the average across the
industry. But we'll come back to you on that -- on details around that specifics.

Operator

Next question, line of Robert Lee with KBW.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Sorry about that. Maybe, Jenny, can you possibly drill in a little bit more into this GOE [ cost ] optimization
engine? Just trying to get a sense of what that is precisely, because it seems like there's different aspects
to it. And while still early days, how you're thinking about that is helping to drive demand. Like what
should we be looking for to see if that's working as anticipated?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Sure. So let me -- so first of all, think of it as a really good financial planning tool that's cloud-based
so it can be tied into any platform out there. But we think [ if you move ] -- and that's why we filed a
patent on it. Because -- so let's say Rob, you have 3 goals, and your goals are, "I want to retire. I want to
put some money aside for my kids. And I want to -- if there's enough left over and I'm doing really well,
I'd like to buy that second home on the beach. I must have enough money to retire. It'd be nice if I can
help my kids. And what the heck, I'm rolling the die on that second home."

If you think about traditional kind of financial planning model, they interview you, you'd come up with a
portfolio based on your risk and it would be a single portfolio. What goal does is it follows your guide path
trajectory to your likelihood of achieving that goal. And if you're doing really well and ahead, it rolls the
money down -- think of it as a waterfall into your next goal. When you achieve that, it rolls it down into
your final goal or however many you have.

And if you think about how you structure those portfolios, they're very different. You're not going to get
the second home unless you stay high octane all out. But your glide path on retirement as you're getting
older and closer, you're going to want to be more conservative.

So it adds that dimension. We worked with universities on doing it. I have to tell you, we -- our data
analytics team came up with it. Our AI team came up with it. We pitched the idea, they were a little
skeptical. When they looked at the data, they said, this really works.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

And so as it has resonated very well as we've shown, because it's a very simple sort of way to think about
and it resonates with clients well. Because you're not talking about benchmarks and things. You're talking
about things that absolutely mean something to them.

And we've built it with easy APIs to connect into various platforms. And we find global demand where we
are talking to a firm in China who are interested in it. So we see Asia, Europe. It's just really resonated
well with the platforms.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And would I be correct to assuming this is less about it being a source of incremental revenue, and it's
all about kind of driving -- assumed that private demand for your own products and strengthening these
relationships?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Right. We do have the choice of either closed architecture. All our products or an open architecture. And I
think that's some fee if we -- for the assets that are open architecture. But it just depends and we could
be flexible with that. But yes, it's a way to create a solution-based sale of our investment piece.

And as Adam pointed, I mean we really view ourselves as a -- we're an investment manager. We're
fundamental across all different types of investment capabilities. We want to deliver it in whatever way in
which our clients want to receive it so vehicle-agnostic, whether it's a traditional mutual funds, CIT, SMA,
ETF, or in a solutions-based kind of model portfolio like GOE provides, or we'll build them individually for
our distributors.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And maybe a follow-up, this kind of connecting the ETF, ESG. I mean you've talked in length about some
of your ESG capabilities. And if you look in the marketplace certainly in the U.S., it seems like it's through
the ETFs product that a lot of the investors have initially been kind of trying to capture their exposure.
So you kind of talk about how -- what your own plans are for -- you now have about $12 billion of AUM,
but how you're thinking of trying to drive ETF growth through ESG? Or is there like a significant product
launch ahead of us to try to get a feel for how those 2 connect for you?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's fair to say that there are a set of financial advisers that just like to sell ETFs. And if you
don't have products in that category, you are not going to resonate with those financial advisers. And so
we are focused on being able to provide kind of flexibility or whatever the vehicles are.

In our $12 billion, our largest category is active. Our second, I think, is smart beta. And the third is
passive. Although our country ETFs were starting to get traction on their low price, but they're significantly
-- they're somewhere between 40 and 60 basis points cheaper than their competitive country. They've
been small, but as we get more traction, we think we'll even pick up more on the institutional side.

Matt, did you want to add anything to that? I don't know if you were...

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

I'd just add one thing to that, Jenny.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Okay, Adam.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive VP & Head of Global Distribution

And that's that we think of ETFS, and I think this is different than some as a way to offer a different
vehicle to clients, not a specific investment strategy. So just to put a little more data behind what Jenny
said, of our $12 billion, roughly 6 of it is active, 3 of it is smart beta, and only 3 of it is market as weighted
passive. That's a little different than some others, and I think that's going to guide our growth in the
future.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And maybe one last quick one for Matt, performance fees, $25 million and change this
quarter. Of course, it's difficult to predict. Any guidance you can give on how we should think of where you
sit now, how we should think of that kind of rolling in the next couple of quarters?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I do think it was seasonably quite high for us in this quarter. So I think you could expect it to be a
bit lower next quarter. Maybe $10 million is a good estimate, and then rising again at the end of the year
back to say, 20 million. And then because of the arrangement with Clarion, our performance fees in 2022
will become larger again, because we end up getting a larger share of those performance fees.

Sure. So it -- just -- sorry, just before we start next question, I just wanted to address the SMA question
because we got the answer to that. So I think it was Mike [indiscernible] the question.

So the average fee is in the mid-30s for the SMAs, and the life that you're asking about is between 6 and
8 years. So it's lower fee, but we generally hold them for a longer period. So that's why it's a very good
business for us. I just wanted to make sure we answered that question.

Operator

And your final question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.

William Raymond Katz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So Matt, just one for you just going back to the fiscal '21 expense guide. I think last quarter, you sort of
[ felt ] that $3.7 billion was a pretty firm number regardless of market action. I may be paraphrasing.

Is that still the case? Because I heard $3.7 billion to $3.75 billion, and I appreciate some moving parts
on the comp and the G&A line. But is $3.7 billion still the anchor number, or is there some now upside to
that?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. So Bill, thank you for the question. So I said $3.7 billion as long as the market increase was
within sort of the low single -- low to mid-single digit. Obviously, we've gone quite considerably above
that, which does put some pressure on increasing compensation.

As I mentioned, for the second quarter we can expect compensation line to go up by 2% to 3%. But then
that should come down again based on the expense discipline that we've communicated, so 1% to 2%
down in the third quarter, another 4% down in the fourth quarter, all else remaining equal. So that's if the
assets under managements that -- it's sort of roughly the levels they're at today.

So I'd say that the -- on all the other line items, very little change. I think if anything, we're finding ways
to create more expense opportunities to bring expenses down as I communicated a moment ago. But I
think that the $3.7 billion mostly is a function of the markets being up in the high single digits to double
digits is -- low double digits is leading us to guide a little bit higher than the $3.7 billion to $3.75 billion.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 02, 2021

If it comes back down again, it will be $3.7 billion again, but that's the range. We're trying to keep that as
tight as possible as also communicated.

William Raymond Katz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay, perfect. Thank you for the clarification.

And then Jenny, just one for you just as you sort of been talking through a lot of the cross-sell
momentum. Do you think at the big picture level now Franklin is where they need to be in terms of its
footprint? I guess more specifically, is there any sort of appetite for M&A? And if so, what or where you
might be thinking about filling in any residual gaps?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

So I would say that, look first and foremost, we are going to catch this fall. We are going to make sure
that the 4 deals that we did last year are well integrated. And that is absolutely our focus, and we're laser-
focused on that.

Now having said that, we feel really good with where they are. The 2 acquisitions by Fiduciary Trust have
already are getting flows. That surprised us how quickly they worked out. We feel very good where with
Legg Mason, [ adviser yields ] technology when they were pretty independent. So the first focus is just
making sure those continue to do well.

Having said that, we've said that we will continue to grow. We want to double our size of Fiduciary Trust.

So as opportunities come up, I think we do some smaller bolt-on acquisitions there. We'd love to continue
to expand in the alternative space if something made sense there. That's just a hard space to acquire. And
we think that fintech is disrupting traditional distribution.

So you'll see us continuing to make investments, whether they're acquisitions. It just has to be the right
one, but we'll certainly make investments in places where we think there's greater distribution opportunity
with some fintech investments.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's a -- I would just add to Jenny's point about alternatives. It's difficult to find the exact right one for
us, given the breadth of the alternatives we have. But there are quite a few out there that we've met that
we think will be a great fit for our firm and a great fit for our alternative asset strategy.

We have revenues in the alternative asset space of over 550 million or something like that for the year.
And we would absolutely like to grow that, and we see plenty of opportunities out there. It's a matter of
timing and finding the right ones that fits with the rest of the pieces we've already got.

Operator

And I would like to hand the call back over to CEO, Jenny Johnson, for final comments.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. We're really proud of what we've been
able to achieve in this truly unique environment. And we are excited to see the opportunities that lie
ahead. Once again, I'd like to thank all our employees for their significant efforts, dedication and client
