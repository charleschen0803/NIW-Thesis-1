Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2020 Third Quarter Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions]

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Stefanie Layton, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you.
You may begin.

Stefanie A. Layton
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast
to review our third quarter 2020 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our
speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our CFO, Ted Geisler. Jim Hatfield, Chief
Administrative Officer; Daniel Froetscher, APS' President and COO; and Barbara Lockwood, Senior Vice
President, Public Policy, are also here with us.

First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor
Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain
reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.

Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and
actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our third quarter 2020 Form 10-Q was filed this
morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements' cautionary language as well as the
Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.

A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by
telephone through November 6, 2020.

I will now turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Great. Thanks, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today. We continue to navigate through the
extraordinary events of 2020. And so as part of my operations update, I'll share with you our success in
managing the hottest July and August on record in the valley. I'll also provide an update on our regulatory
dockets and our focus as we prepare for 2021. As Ted will explain, our earnings expectations for the year
are higher due to the significantly above-average temperatures.

And so first, I want to recognize our field team for doing an exceptional job in maintaining reliable service
for our customers this summer. The extreme heat this year contributed to a challenging energy market
across the entire Desert Southwest. The lack of available capacity and the resulting declarations of
energy emergencies by other utilities across the West served as a reminder of the importance of long-
term resource portfolio planning, vigilance over day-to-day energy supply and responsible energy policy.
Our ability to avoid an energy emergency this summer was the result of careful long-term planning,
resource adequacy, flexibility and innovative customer programs. We relied heavily on our baseload and
fast-ramping assets, including Four Corners, Ocotillo and Palo Verde, and those assets were ready when
we needed them. Our fossil fleet's equivalent availability factor, which is the percentage of time that a
fossil generation unit is available and ready to perform when called upon, was 95.3% from June through
September. And Palo Verde generating stations capacity factor for the same time frame was 100.2%.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Not only were our generation plants there when we needed them, our customers were as well. Out of
an abundance of caution and to better prepare for potential unforeseen events, on August 18 and 19,
we asked our customers to voluntarily conserve energy during peak hours. It came as no surprise to
me that our customers were an amazing partner. Their response reduced peak demand on August 18 by
approximately 240 megawatts, creating a meaningful reduction on a day when the entire Western grid was
challenged.

In addition to successfully navigating the capacity shortfalls that were created by the heat, we also
used our careful planning and close coordination with the forest service and first responders to mitigate
the potential impact from wildfires this season. To reduce fire risk, our teams performed vegetation
management activities, we held wildfire prevention training and we continued to expand our clearance
around poles program. And it was an incredibly active wildfire season with over 900,000 acres burned to
date compared to an average over the last 5 years of 250,000 acres. Despite the above-average wildfire
activity, we actually experienced minimal impact to our assets, and I think that was due in part to our
effective planning and risk management program.

Despite a worldwide pandemic, a record hot summer, regional capacity shortage and wildfires, our team
continues to focus on how to make lasting impacts that benefit our customers, our shareholders and the
company. Palo Verde consistently provides examples of this type of continuous improvement and forward
thinking.

As a recent example, [ Tee Lee ], who is a Palo Verde procurement engineer, challenged our traditional
procurement process and conducted a cost analysis and engineering evaluation for a microswitch
replacement. The technical evaluation allowed Palo Verde to purchase commercial-grade switches at
approximately 7x lower than the alternative. Over the next 3 years alone, this change is expected to save
the company $2.5 million. His leadership and innovation earned him a nomination for an EPRI Technology
Transfer Award. And I can't emphasize enough that it's our team who drives the success of this company,
and I'm proud to recognize [ Tee ] for his innovation.

Shifting gears to regulatory. Staff and intervenors filed testimony in our current rate case on October
2. Staff's initial testimony recommended a 9.4% return on equity, and that compares to our current
authorized 10% return on equity. Staff also recommended approval of our actual capital structure at the
end of the test year. That's consistent with our request, and that would result in a 54.7% equity layer. The
total revenue increase recommended by staff is $89.7 million compared to our request for a $184 million
increase. We'll file our rebuttal testimony on November 6, and staff and interveners will file surrebuttal
testimony on November 20. The hearing is scheduled begin on December 14, and I expect it to continue
into 2021. While testimony is certainly an important part of the process and it does provide visibility
into each party's priorities, we're still very early in the case, and we expect that many of the issues will
certainly be discussed further as the case progresses.

I do want to note that yesterday, the commission voted on several amendments to a proposed energy
rules package. The amendments include new carbon reduction standard of 100% by 2050, with interim
targets of 50% by 2032 and 75% by 2040. The reductions are based off of the 2016 to 2018 carbon
emissions level benchmark. The amendments also require electric utilities to install energy storage
systems with a capacity equal to 5% of each utility's 2020 peak demand by 2035, and 40% of the
required energy storage must be customer-owned or customer-leased distributed storage. Another
approved amendment modifies the resource planning process, including requirements for the ACC to
approve a utility's load forecast and resource plan and for a utility to perform an all-source request for
information to guide its resource planning.

Earlier this month, the commission also voted on another amendment to establish a new energy efficiency
standard. The standard requires electric utilities to implement demand-side management resources
equivalent to 35% of their 2020 peak load by 2030. Eligible demand-side management resources include
energy efficiency, demand response and load shifting. And just importantly, the commission must vote,
and I expect they will vote soon, to approve a final energy rules package before any of these amendments
can take effect.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

As we look to wrap up 2020, we'll continue to work with the commission on implementing a clean energy
transition for the benefit of their constituents and for our customers. Recall that we've set an aspirational
goal of 100% carbon-free by 2050 and 65% clean by 2030. To do so will require a strong regulatory
partnership, support for an organized transition away from coal and fossil fuels and regulatory and
financial support for the expansion of renewables, batteries and energy efficiency within our portfolio.

I think yesterday was a strong indication of alignment with both the commission and other stakeholders to
achieve a cleaner energy vision and energy future for Arizona. Near term, our focus and priorities remain
on improving our customer communications, rebuilding our regulatory relationships by reestablishing
trust, moving towards a reasonable resolution of our rate case and continuing to engage with stakeholders
to build alignment on priorities that support our goal of providing clean, reliable and affordable service to
our customers.

So again, thank you all for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to Ted.

Theodore N. Geisler
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Jeff. And thanks, again, to everyone for joining us today. As Jeff mentioned, I will cover our
third quarter results and the impact from weather. I'll also provide additional details around our customer
and sales growth, economic development and financing activities. Lastly, I'll cover our expectations for the
remainder of 2020.

While we typically provide earnings guidance for the upcoming year on the third quarter call, we
historically have not provided forward-looking guidance during a pending rate case. Consistent with
that approach, we will hold off on providing 2021 earnings guidance until after the pending rate case
concludes.

Turning now to the third quarter. The significant tailwind from hotter-than-normal weather supported
earnings of $3.07 per share compared to $2.77 per share in the third quarter of '19. July set a new record
for the hottest month recorded in Phoenix, until August. August then surpassed July, setting another new
record for the hottest month. The above-average temperatures this quarter added $0.26 to earnings
year-over-year. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2020, weather added $91 million of pretax gross
margin or $0.61 per share year-over-year.

We also experienced 2.3% customer growth and 1.3% weather-normalized sales growth in the third
quarter 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. From May 13, when businesses started reopening
after the COVID closure period, through September 30, weather-normalized sales increased 1% compared
to the same period last year. We continue to see a reduction in weather-normalized commercial and
industrial sales of 5%, offset by an increase in weather-normalized residential sales of 6% during this
period.

The strength and speed of our return for positive growth numbers reflects the continued expansion of our
local economy following the full COVID closure period earlier this year. Further evidence of our recovery
can be seen in the increased number of single-family building permits and commercial construction
activity. In 2020, we expect a total of 32,000 housing permits, an increase of about 1,200 compared to
last year and the highest number since 2006.

The labor market in Arizona has also started to gradually recover from the pandemic impacts as well.
For 2020, through the end of August, employment in Metro Phoenix decreased 1.7% compared to
5.6% across the entire U.S. And while manufacturing employment in Metro Phoenix decreased 1.2%,
construction employment increased by 0.9%. The ongoing growth of new businesses and residential
properties and the 18 construction cranes that are currently visible here in Downtown Phoenix are
evidence of our continued growth.

To serve our growing customer base and support investments in clean energy, in September, we issued
$400 million of 30-year 2.65% green bonds at APS. The 2.65% coupon represents the lowest 30-year rate
in the APS bond portfolio.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Turning to our full year 2020 guidance. As a result of the above-average weather, we are increasing
our 2020 consolidated earnings range from $4.75 to $4.95 per share to $4.95 to $5.15 per share. The
weather benefit has more than offset the additional cost and reduction in sales due to COVID-19. We are
also increasing our 2020 weather-normalized year-over-year sales growth expectations to be between 0%
and 1%.

In light of the weather benefit, we have accelerated the timing of near-term O&M initiatives. For example,
we're pulling forward some spend in 2020 that was previously anticipated for future years, particularly
around project work and customer experience initiatives as well as onetime opportunities like our $10
million contribution to the APS foundation, which supports our community nonprofits. Our revised 2020
O&M guidance range of $870 million to $890 million reflects these items. While we believe this increase in
O&M demonstrates prudent planning and flexibility through this challenging year, we do remain focused
on our lean initiatives and continue to see our core O&M trend down. We are executing our plan to
reduce 2020 O&M expense by $20 million, including $10 million through improved procurement and
contract management activities and another $10 million in several small operating efficiencies across the
enterprise.

We also continue to partner with Arizona State University to train our workforce on lean skills and are
excited about the long-term potential in continuing to streamline our business. While we don't enter a year
counting on weather to be a driver, we do enter the year prepared to take advantage of above-normal
weather when it makes sense to do so. This can help us mitigate the impacts of mild weather in future
years, while also enabling our investment in certain key initiatives that improve customer experience, a
focus area for our company.

Our resource planning and capital expenditure forecasts have also been revised. The delay in our clean
energy procurement impacted by the McMicken investigation slightly reduced our 2020 capital expenditure
forecast by $68 million. However, we do remain committed to our clean energy commitments and have
made progress with our resource-acquisition activities.

In September, we executed a 200-megawatt wind PPA with a 20-year term. This is a repower of an
existing wind facility and is expected to be fully upgraded with additional capacity in 2021. We also plan to
issue 2 new RFPs, 1 all-source RFP and an additional utility-owned energy storage RFP at our existing solar
facilities.

While it was an exceptionally hot summer, we are grateful the weather tailwind allowed us to further
increase financial assistance to customers struggling to pay their bills as a result of COVID-19 and to
accelerate investments that will enhance the quality of our service and maintain our record for providing
top-tier reliability.

As Jeff mentioned, we will continue to focus on our regulatory outcomes in the near term, while executing
our long-term plan to deliver value for our customers, shareholders and community stakeholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

On the amendments to the proposed energy rules package. Can you give us a sense of how those
amendments and how the energy rule package in general would affect the 6% to 7% rate base growth
profile that you currently are predicting? And at what point do we get an update on all of this when you --
in order to incorporate all of that into it?

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And let me start, Michael, on just the rulemaking, then either Ted or Barbara may want to weigh in.
So one thing I think is the alignment that we see from the energy rules package is really important, and
there is fairly nice alignment with our efforts to decarbonize by 2050. And I think the interim targets,
while the dates are a little bit different, they're not. The alignment is still there. And so I think it's
consistent with what we were seeing as our plan. It's still got to go through the rulemaking process. So
this just starts the rulemaking. It's a formal rulemaking, and that will likely happen next year.

Theodore N. Geisler
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Michael, this is Ted. I'll just say that given that the amendments and the plan where it looks like
it's headed is largely consistent with our clean energy commitment. Our rate base growth that we have
outlined was already contemplating carbon-free and energy -- clean energy goals consistent with these
energy rules. So that's how I think about it.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. Great. And also on the rate case. As we're going forward, with the staff recommendation out
now, I just want to confirm, there's no -- what would you consider the odds of a settlement process at this
point, I mean, maybe after the election is over? Is it even possible at this point to get it done? Or is it just
not enough time?

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Michael, we're still -- this is right now, proceeding down a litigated path, and so that's the process that
we're following right now. As we said before, we'd always be open for those conversations, and it could be
a narrower one with some of the individual participants find alignment, take some issues off the table. So
we'd continue to be open to it, but we're focused on the litigated path right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So perhaps if I can just pick it up where your prepared remarks kind of left off. Can you talk a little bit
more about the procurements that you just alluded to, for instance, the storage effort here, the -- and
specifically utility-owned efforts and how that lines up against the cadence of the CapEx that you all have

8

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

delineated? So when should we see the specific projects to line up against the coming years here, if that
makes sense?

Theodore N. Geisler
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Julien, this is Ted. Appreciate the question, and it does make sense. Given the McMicken investigation
has now concluded, we have resumed procurement activity for investing in those APS-owned battery
storage with the intent that it's in service in 2022. We've also got ongoing procurement activity for
additional utility-owned renewable resources from a prior RFP. So look results of that soon, too. And then
additionally, we plan on issuing new RFPs for clean energy resources to be in service in future years. And
that will result, as we said before, in a blend of PPA and ownership projects. We estimate those through
our CapEx guidance now, but we continue to refine as we get nearer to each procurement outcome and
we have specific projects that result from those RFPs.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Excellent. All right. If I can pivot here to the 2021 outlook. And I know it's difficult to talk about
without more specifics from you all. But obviously, there seems to be something of a shift at O&M, but I
don't want to put words too much in your mouth on this one. How are you thinking about the prospects for
earning your ROE and/or perhaps describing it as a tailwind in terms of accelerating costs from '21 into '20
at this point? I know that guidance is difficult, but I'm curious if you can help to start to quantify some of
that benefit.

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it's difficult to quantify without guidance, Julien, but what I would say is that we continue to be
aggressive about our lean initiatives and cost management. And the acceleration of O&M opportunities this
year as a result of hot weather really focused largely in the customer space, community space and was a
pull forward from future years. It will help us manage opportunities to the extent there's mild weather. But
we remain focused despite the unique opportunity this year on cost management and keeping O&M flat
with kilowatt-hour sales.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to step back and talk about your generation plans here. It's great to see a pretty aggressive
move towards renewable energy. And I was just curious, if we did see pretty aggressive federal legislation,
so including things like tax credits for solar and storage and maybe EV infrastructure and just other
elements of things? How much that might change your longer-term planning or sort of maybe near to
midterm as well? But just if there were fairly generous federal incentives, how that might shift your
thinking?

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Fair question. I think at this point, without knowing details of what those incentives look like, I
would say that it would likely just simply make the assets that we already intend on procuring in order
to meet our clean energy commitment and potentially the commission's energy rules more affordable
for customers. But we'll just have to see what the details look like in any potential legislation and then
evaluate from there.

9

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Yes. Fair point. And then thinking about the just grid impacts of more renewables, there's always been this
hope that perhaps the Western states could coordinate more closely in terms of grid operations. I know
there's been an initiative underway for many years. Do you see any particular changes there that might
lead to better grid coordination among the Western states?

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Go ahead, Daniel.

Daniel T. Froetscher
President & COO

Stephen, this is Daniel. When you look at August and the capacity shortfalls and the corresponding
emergencies that were declared in a number of states, I think it exacerbates the need for the utilities in
the states in the Western interconnect to continue their work as it relates to better coordination, better
facilitation of interdependencies with the intended results of ensuring that we have reliability and that
generation assets are fully leveraged and utilized across multiple jurisdictions. There's a number, as you
mentioned, of working groups in play assessing those issues. And I think over the next 6 months to a
year, you'll see some recommendations that will come forth out of some of those working group activities.

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

And Stephen, we see that -- we're in the energy imbalance market. And so there is some coordination,
and that effort continues to develop.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. Maybe just last question for me is just thinking through fire risk. I think your prepared
remarks touched on a lot of important points. Bigger picture, as you think about just the impacts of
climate change and the risk of -- from climate change, how might that continue to kind of factor into your
thinking on both CapEx? And also how do we think about just the sort of performance standards that
you're required to meet? I know your state is very, very different from California in this regard. I just
want to make sure we kind of highlight some of those differences. So for example, in California, we think
about certain vegetation management standards, the sort of standard for liability is not great from a utility
perspective. Just curious if you wouldn't mind just adding a little more as you think about climate change
risk.

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So a lot of it is really focused around resilience and making sure that we, for example, protect
transmission lines that are bringing remote generation into the valley. And you heard in my direct
comments, a lot of that we do with vegetation management, working at defensible space around poles.
And so we've got targeted programs out there. We continue to evaluate that. We look closely at what
other utilities in the West are doing to make sure that we are adapting any of the best practices that we
can. But when you look really broadly around climate impacts, the importance is around resilience. So
whether it's looking at like microgrids, which we've got at Yuma for Marine Corps Air Station, focusing on
those kind of investments. We'll see how that ultimately translates as you look longer term. But that's
been our focus is making sure we've got a good resilient redundant system so that if we have a line go out
because of a wildfire that we've got alternative paths or alternative ways to serve the load.

Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

My first question is on just the renewable investments that you have lined up for 2021, 2022. Given this
current rate case will likely complete sometime in 2021, and unless -- the absence -- in the absence of a
rider mechanism or certain type of tracking mechanisms for those type of investments, one, what is the
general sense of timing for having to file the next rate case to get recovery of those?

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Insoo, thanks for the question. That will largely depend on the outcome of this current case. So
difficult to predict at this time. But to your point, we have been clear all along that we would intend on
being able to seek concurrent recovery for clean energy investments. We think that's the best outcome for
customers and our ability to be able to procure at the rate and volume needed to meet our clean energy
goals.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then in terms of the O&M, I think before the pull forward that you did this quarter, there was
some level of O&M that you're expecting after COVID happened. So is that incremental amount that
seems like a pull forward more largely items that you were going to spend in 2021 that now because
you're doing it in 2020, it just gives you that flexibility to manage the 2021 year?

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think the way to think about this is these are initiatives that we've had in the pipe as discretionary
items that we would like to be able to execute on in future years that hot weather gave us the opportunity
to do now. And that gives us then further headroom in future years, to the extent we have mild weather,
then we can manage that accordingly.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So my first question has got to do with the -- there are a variety of proceedings and questions and what
have you associated with like rate design and the tool comparison stuff. When do you think those might be
resolved? Will they be maybe resolved in the context of the rate case or before or after? Or do you have
any sense as to how those things might be eventually resolved?

Barbara D. Lockwood
Senior Vice President of Public Policy

Paul, this is Barbara Lockwood. Certainly, there are some items in play in the current rate case that we
do expect to be resolved, some moderate changes potentially to rate design and some conversations
that we've been having around customer education as well as potentially things like what the rates
are named. So that is in process, and that will happen through that process. Outside of that, we have
made a commitment that we're going to be continuously communicating with the commission and our
stakeholders as all of these issues continue to evolve. So we'll be talking to the commission on a very
regular basis, be an open meeting or individual updates with our stakeholders. And that will continue as
we seek to make progress on all of these issues with all of our stakeholders, including the commission.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. So I guess it's sort of stay tuned and we'll see how it progresses. I'm just wondering whether or not
there might be -- we might get some closure, I guess, with respect to this, if there's any sort of timing on
that. Or is it just sort of a stay tuned kind of thing?

So certainly, we think we've worked through the majority of the issues that have been in play with respect
to the rate comparison tools. And while there may be some additional discussion, from our perspective,
we've taken all the steps that we've needed to take to resolve that issue. And anything remaining will just
be updates in that respect. So we can't guarantee where things may evolve from there, but we do believe
that we've taken every action that we needed to take to resolve that issue. And we've had numerous
discussions about it, and it should be nearing the end of that conversation.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. Awesome. They have been numerous. So good. It's good to hear. So -- and then just on -- could
you give us an update on -- with this weather and everything else or where things stand in terms of
arrearage customers, COVID and everything, what -- how they're managing in terms of paying their bills?

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Paul, I appreciate the question. At this point, we monitor that closely, but still expect that the
allowance we set forth for $20 million to $30 million is consistent with where we think things are coming
in, but we'll continue to monitor closely, obviously, as things evolve. We did feel it was appropriate to
extend the disconnect moratorium through the end of the year. We think that's the right thing to do
for our customers. But even given that extension, we believe that the allowance we have identified is
appropriate.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then with respect to the storage investigation and just in general, I mean, I know you guys
were looking into this. This is obviously sort of something that you guys have been focusing on stuff. Any
takeaways or any thoughts sort of about how you approach storage? I mean, is this sort of just a one-
off thing and it doesn't really mean much? Or is it maybe a selection of vendors? Or I don't know, do you
have any sense or any takeaways that we might think about with storage? And just going forward, any
thoughts or insights that you've gained from this process?

Daniel T. Froetscher
President & COO

Yes. Paul, it's Daniel. And there is no doubt that off of our McMicken experience, we've learned a number
of things, quite a few things that we will put into play on a going-forward basis. Energy storage in order
for us to meet our clean energy commitments, and frankly, as it relates to the energy rules that were
discussed and tentatively agreed to yesterday at the commission, battery storage, energy storage is a
critical component of our ability to meet those obligations. We've expanded our internal knowledge off
the McMicken event incredibly as it relates to design, engineering, safety protocols and mitigation steps;
have in our employ a number of consultants who we're using on a going-forward basis to help us assess
vendor and product design, technologies and again, underlying systems, both mitigation and preventative.
And I have a high level of confidence that we are much better positioned today than we've ever been as
it relates to understanding the technology, its associated risks and are in a much better place as it relates
to design, engineering and safety protocols. We've learned quite a bit, and I think we're in a pretty good
place.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. I'm -- just was wondering if there's any sort of easy takeaway for us analysts who aren't doing
anywhere near the kind of work you guys are in terms of any sort of general sort of technological thing

that you came up with. Or maybe not, maybe it's just too detailed. But I'm just wondering if there's
something that you could share with us or…

Daniel T. Froetscher
President & COO

Yes. A couple of general themes, Paul. As we move forward, we will consider containerized but not
occupiable as a design alternative as compared to the occupiable containerized system that McMicken
was. I believe there'll be changes, I trust there'll be changes in both fire suppression and the arresting, if
you will, of what's called thermal runaway when battery cells fail. And we are moving forward under the
absolute belief that cells will fail in the future and that we've got to design, engineer and establish safety
protocols to deal with that. You may very well see some wet or dry standpipe installations as it relates to
a water cooling mechanism as mitigation infrastructure to deal with a thermal runaway. Those are some of
the things that we've extracted from the McMicken experience.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay, great. And then finally, I was wondering if you wanted to opine on what the election might bring
us. And I, of course, understand if you -- but are there any polling trends or anything that you think we
should be looking out for there? Or should we just wait a few days…

Daniel T. Froetscher
President & COO

I'd just wait, Paul. I don't think you can see a lot right now.

Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I was just wondering about the rate case and as you kind of prepare your rebuttal. What are some of
the key items that you identified where you disagree with the staff or where you think there's room for
something more towards the middle ground versus their recommendation?

Jeffrey B. Guldner
Chairman, President & CEO

Sophie, so we're in the middle of working on a rebuttal testimony right now. So probably not able to really
go into a significant amount of detail about that. But obviously, what we do is we look pretty carefully at
the testimony that comes in. We see if there are issues, and there inevitably are. There are some issues
where we're like, "You know what, that's a good point, and let's make an adjustment to that." And then
there are some issues where we're going to try to clarify or explain what we meant in the initial filing.
And so we're not too far away from getting that rebuttal testimony filed. I think you'll be able to see the
highlights of where that is on November 6 when we make that. So sorry I can't be a lot more helpful right
now on it, but it's not too far down the road.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes. I was kind of hoping to get some -- a sneak peek of that. But -- also I wanted to just make sure I
understand the stance on the O&M, right? So clearly, you guys had a very good quarter with the weather
help and you pulled forward some of the O&M. So what is the reason that you didn't pull forward more?
Is that strictly driven by kind of the customer rate consideration and trying to balance the O&M for the
megawatt hour? Or was there just not enough projects in the pipeline that were easily pullable forward, if
you will?

Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Sophie, appreciate the question. I think there's many factors that go into that evaluation, but we
want to make sure that we balance projects that immediately add value that we can execute and that are
prioritized amongst a myriad of criteria as we rank and order every project that we plan for and decide to
fund. So it really just went through our normal prioritization and ranking exercise. And we pulled forward
initiatives that we felt were prudent and could have an immediate impact, particularly in the customer
experience and customer-focused space.

Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on the battery storage, make sure I'm up-to-date on this. That facility that had
the incident has still not been energized. Am I correct about that? I mean you've never completed all the
repair and felt that it was in a condition you could start using it again, correct?

Daniel T. Froetscher
President & COO

Charles, this is Daniel. That is correct. It has not been recommissioned, and it will not be recommissioned.
We're working with the vendor on make-whole remedies as it relates to our contractual arrangements.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then specific to -- again, following up on battery storage. I would think, or tell me if my
assumption is correct or not, that the extremely hot weather creates some challenges for APS with respect
to battery storage that maybe a typical utility doesn't face. Is that true?

Daniel T. Froetscher
President & COO

Again, Charles, this is Daniel. No, that's not quite true. The containerized systems are air conditioned
and cooled at certain optimal operating temperatures. And so Arizona's high summertime heat does not
introduce any additional risk as it relates to the underlying technology.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. So it sounds like you're going to have battery storage. It's just a question of some maybe different
technology and some advancements that occur, correct?

Daniel T. Froetscher
President & COO

Yes. We'll employ the learnings off of McMicken, other learnings from the general industry and technology
development that have occurred since McMicken and be prepared to move forward with what we believe to
be a superior engineering design and set of safety systems to ensure battery success moving forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.

James Kennedy
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

It's actually James for Shar. Just one quick question about the energy rules, if I could just follow on the
earlier ones. There was some discussion from one commissioner, I think, about including a spending cap.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

I am just wondering if you could give us a little bit of background on that. And then do you see something
like that actually getting into the final package at this point?

Barbara D. Lockwood
Senior Vice President of Public Policy

James, this is Barbara Lockwood. Yes, that was Commissioner Olson, and Commissioner Olson is a -- not
a supporter of any sort of clean energy requirement. And so he was attempting to insert a requirement
that -- consistent with his philosophy that it should only be low-cost resource. That's the only guiding
force for energy resource investment across the board. So it was not supported. It was supported by one
other commissioner, and it was not approved on a 3 to 2 vote. So I would be very surprised if there is
any support on a going-forward basis for that sort of cap. Having said that, we do have an election next
week. And depending on the outcome of that, there could be a different perspective. But as it sits today,
we believe there's broad support for these clean energy rules, and that sort of requirement is not going to
be successfully passed or incorporated into these rules.

James Kennedy
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just the schedule for finalization of the package, I guess, have they set a date yet?

Barbara D. Lockwood
Senior Vice President of Public Policy

Yes. So James, good question. They have not set a date yet. If you were listening yesterday, they voted
on all of the amendments that were there. They actually moved the amended item, but then they recessed
before they voted the final package, and that was because they needed to put together the final package
and all the conforming changes to make sure it was exactly what they wanted to vote on at the end of
the day. And the chairman indicated when they had that package, they would reconvene and then take
the final vote. So we don't have any indication as to when that's going to be, but we do think it will be
relatively soon that they would like to get this done. Now having said that, keep in mind, this is a vote to
go to the formal rulemaking process. So there will be another vote before these rules become final and
effective, and that will happen likely next year.

Operator

We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for
closing comments.

Stefanie A. Layton
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call.
