CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to the CVS Health Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the call over to Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS
Health. Please go ahead.

Valerie C. Haertel
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020
Earnings Call. I'm Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I am joined
this morning by Karen Lynch, President and CEO; and Eva Boratto, Executive Vice President and CFO.
Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include Jon Roberts,
Chief Operating Officer; and Alan Lotvin, President of Caremark.

Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our annual report on
Form 10-K that we filed with the SEC this morning.

During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements reflecting our current views related to
our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions as well as the expected
consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections. Our forward-looking
statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from what may be indicated in them. We strongly encourage you to review the information
in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are
described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and Risk Factors section in
this morning's earnings press release and included in our Form 10-K.

During this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance
and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a reconciliation of these non-
GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release and the
reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website.

Today's call is being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for 1 year.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Karen.

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Valerie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we
begin, I'd like to acknowledge Larry Merlo's leadership. He set a bold path for CVS Health to change the
health care industry in this country. Larry did an incredible job bringing together our unique assets and
establishing the foundation for our future.

Our transformation over the last decade has enabled us to become the nation's leading diversified health
services company. As one of the most trusted brands in America, our presence in communities across the
country allows us to meet consumers where they are and become a bigger part of their everyday health.
Our unparalleled capabilities, reach and relationship with over 100 million people uniquely positions us to
support them for every meaningful moment of health throughout their lifetime.

These are unprecedented times, and our purpose to help people on their path to better health has never
been more important. CVS colleagues are on the front lines every day helping millions of Americans with
COVID testing and vaccines, in-home and virtual care services and face-to-face care in our CVS locations.
We understand our responsibility to support our customers, members and communities during these

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

difficult times, and we are delivering. I am proud of the nearly 300,000 colleagues on the CVS Health
team and all that we've achieved in this past year.

Turning to performance. Our strong results in 2020 show that both our strategy and business model
are working. We exceeded our earnings commitments while delivering 6% year-over-year adjusted
EPS growth. We grew revenue growth 4.5% to achieve adjusted revenues of $268 billion. We delivered
continued strong growth in our PBM and Government Services business, once again achieving solid
results in Medicare Advantage. We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $16 billion as
we continue to delever while investing in our business for future growth. We served a prominent role in
supporting our customers, providers and communities during one of the biggest public health crisis in our
nation's history. We continue to progress against our strategic road map, and we set 2021 adjusted EPS
guidance of $7.39 to $7.55, with mid-single-digit growth from our baseline. Eva will go into much more
detail about our performance and our outlook.

Turning to our 3 business segments. We delivered strong results in 2020 in the Health Care Benefits
segment. We grew total revenue by 8% for the year with increases in our Government businesses,
partially offset by declines in our commercial business. In the fourth quarter, we saw utilization of total
health care services in the aggregate return to more near-normal seasonal levels as higher COVID-related
costs were partially offset by somewhat lower levels of traditional services. Adjusted operating income
was in line with expectations. As we head into 2021, we demonstrated growth within each of our Medicare
product lines in January. Overall, we are on track for another very strong year of Medicare growth.

For years, we've used our voice to advocate for policies, programs and regulations at the local, state and
national levels that support access to affordable care for all Americans. After careful consideration, we
have decided to reenter the individual public exchange market as of January 1, 2022. As the ACA has
evolved, there is evidence of market stabilization and remedies to earlier issues. It is now time for us to
participate in these markets. We will show that we can bring great value to those who seek coverage. You
can expect to hear more about our exchange reentry plans in future updates.

Turning to our PBM. Our Pharmacy Services segment has been resilient through the pandemic. We
demonstrated the value we bring to our customers and our members. We achieved strong retention rates
and positive momentum in winning new business in 2021.

And finally, in our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we continue to advance our clinical programs which
improved medication adherence and health outcomes. We increased the level of engagement with our
loyalty and subscription customers, and we also achieved high customer satisfaction results.

During the last year, we delivered new market solutions, and we strengthened our role as a personal and
trusted health care partner in response to COVID 19. We pivoted and rapidly innovated to meet customer
needs for COVID testing in the community. We also advanced our digital capabilities to create a seamless
experience across CVS Health touch points. Today, we remain the largest community testing organization
in the U.S. We've administered approximately 15 million tests at our more than 4,800 testing locations
nationwide. Over 50% of these tests have been administered in communities with significant need for
support according to the CDC Social Vulnerability Index.

Additionally, we launched our Return Ready solution to help employers and universities as they execute
their return to work and school strategies. To date, 100 clients have enrolled, representing over 1.5 million
individuals with interest continuing to grow. Such leadership enabled us to establish new relationships with
approximately 8 million consumers through our COVID testing efforts. These are people who are new to
CVS Health.

Turning to vaccines. We've been working with the federal government on vaccine distribution readiness
for several months. We were selected as 1 of the partners for vaccine administration and long-term care
facilities. We've administered more than 3 million vaccine doses to the patients and staff in over 40,000
long-term care facilities across the country. We completed the first doses of vaccine administration in all
skilled nursing facilities and we'll complete the second doses by the end of the month as planned. We are
on track to complete both doses of vaccine administration for assisted living facilities by mid-March. This
will fulfill our commitment to administer vaccines in long-term care facilities.

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

We've also been selected as one of the national partners for the federal Pharmacy Partnership program.
This is the linchpin of the Biden administration's plan to vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of
the summer. As part of this program, we are administering approximately 250,000 COVID immunizations
across 11 states and in over 350 CVS locations each week. Early feedback from customers has been very
positive on their overall experience across both our in-person and digital channels. We will continue to add
stores as the vaccine supply increases. With the commitment and hard work of our employees, we have
the capacity to administer 20 million to 25 million doses per month depending on supply availability.

Millions of new customers will engage with CVS Health for the first time through testing and vaccine
administration services. We will use this opportunity to shape a health experience that demonstrates the
value we bring. It will create the opportunity to expand our customer base while deepening relationships
with current customers.

We have made measurable and important progress with our strategy as a health services company that
utilizes all our assets, that integrates them for a superior consumer experience and firmly addresses the
total cost of care. For example, we are creating health platforms that combine local points of care, remote
biometric monitoring and access to health care professionals, all within a personalized consumer-centric
model.

Our new diabetes program is an example of this. We have approximately 1.4 million members in this
new program, with about 50% representing integrated Caremark-Aetna plan members. We've had strong
reception to our fully integrated plan, the Aetna Connected Plan, and expect to add 15 markets in 2021.
Key features include $0 co-pays at MinuteClinic locations, standard formulary and use of our Coram
infusion services.

We deepened our pharmacy penetration in the Health Care Benefits segment through increased cross-sell
of medical and pharmacy plans. This is expected to result in approximately $350 million in incremental
revenue in 2021.

We are bringing dialysis services into the home to better manage chronic kidney disease. This program
offers a simpler, more patient-centered approach. It delays the onset of end-stage renal disease, reduces
hospital admissions and supports people with treatment options. Our kidney program will engage a
targeted cohort across businesses currently available to over 7.5 million eligible members.

And finally, our oncology program helps patients start on the best treatment and matches eligible patients
to clinical trials. Our goal is to improve patient outcomes and lower overall costs at every point of the
cancer care journey. Our program has expanded to more than 125 provider systems across 28 states,
covering over 30% of Aetna's insured oncology population.

As we engage consumers in addressing their most prevalent, costly and complex health conditions
impacting their lives, we are also concentrating on expanding access to affordable, quality care. We
launched new medical benefit plans designed with low co-pay or no co-pay at MinuteClinics to offer
broader access to care. We have approximately 6 million commercial and Medicare members enrolled
to date. In our small group product, which was the first to adopt, we achieved 25% greater use of
MinuteClinics, and CVS Pharmacy retail scripts increased from 30% to 65%. This continues to strongly
demonstrate the value of bringing CVS assets together to support across their health care needs.

We continue to expand access through our integrated care delivery approach. We ended 2020 with just
over 650 HealthHUBs nationwide, including locations in underserved communities. HealthHUBs are one of
many channels we have to engage with consumers for their health, that also complement the traditional
health care system.

We continue to expand our virtual care capabilities. We launched our e-clinic service in our MinuteClinic
across 33 states and in the district of Columbia. Consumers are now able to interact with nurse
practitioners for comprehensive virtual care in a convenient way. Through this offering, we can help
customers with both episodic care and provide a longitudinal integrated care experience.

We launched our virtual-first primary care program. Members engage with providers virtually. They are
then directed to lower-cost, high-quality sites of care, such as MinuteClinic, or other face-to-face in-

network provider care settings as needed. We are delivering value by creating a superior system that is
centered around the consumer, where they want and need health care.

In closing, we are starting 2021 with strong momentum. We are accelerating our pace of progress to drive
our consumer-centric strategy, a strategy built upon the fundamental belief that solving consumer health
needs will create value for all: Our customers, our communities, our people and our shareholders.

We will further develop and refine our strategy to leverage the rapid shift in health care underway in the
U.S., trends that we are not only on top of, but in many places, driving. As we move forward with this
work, the touchstones of our strategy will remain focused in the following areas. We will demonstrate the
integrated value of CVS Health's unique portfolio of products and assets. We will enhance the consumer
experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that seamlessly connect to in-person
channels. We will expand our portfolio with new, innovative consumer-oriented solutions that improve
health, lower medical costs while creating better health outcomes. We will continue to build a high-
performing organization that is passionate about our purpose that reflects the diverse populations we
serve and is empowered to do the right thing the right way for consumers' health and well-being.

I am confident in our future and our ability to help people on their path to better help. CVS Health will
lower costs, improve customer experience, enhance access and be their trusted health care partner.

Now I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Eva Boratto.

Eva C. Boratto
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As Karen stated, our strong performance across the
enterprise continued in the fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy during this challenging time.
For the full year, we delivered $7.50 adjusted earnings per share, and importantly, achieved over $900
million of integration synergies, above the high end of our expectations. We've hit the 2021 run rate and
the synergies are fully embedded in the business.

During the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion of cash from operations, bringing our full year to $15.9
billion, which is above the high end of our expectations. And we paid down $2.5 billion of net debt in the
quarter, exiting the year at a low 4x leverage ratio. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have
paid down more than $12.2 billion in net debt and remain on track with our low 3x leverage ratio goal in
2022. We maintained our dividend while we also invested in our enterprise to support our colleagues and
customers during the pandemic and to accelerate future growth.

Looking at our fourth quarter results by segment. Our Health Care Benefits segment's total adjusted
revenues increased 9.6% year-over-year driven by membership growth in our government products and
the reinstatement of the HIF. Adjusted revenues exclude the ACA risk corridor payment received during
the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $153 million, in line with our expectations, largely
reflecting the planned COVID-19-related investments benefiting customers, testing and treatment costs
and the divestitures of the Aetna PDP and our Workers Comp business.

Total membership increased about 140,000 sequentially, with Medicaid membership of about 90,000
as states continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending eligibility redeterminations.
Additionally, our Medicare portfolio continues to show growth with strong Medicare Advantage and MedSup
membership growth increasing sequentially about 90,000, up over 2%. These increases were partially
offset by a modest sequential decrease in commercial membership of about 35,000 members driven by
additional membership attrition due to COVID-19.

Our adjusted MBR for the quarter, excluding the ACA payment, was 88.3% and in line with our
expectations, representing an increase of 260 basis points compared to the prior year. The higher MBR
was driven by COVID-19-related investments, testing and treatment costs, the divestiture of the PDP
business, partially offset by the reinstatement of the HIF. Overall, fourth quarter utilization was generally
in line with our baseline, including higher COVID-19-related costs. Days claims payable were 48 days
for Q4 2020, consistent with our Q4 '19 and a day lower than Q3 2020, largely driven by pharmacy
payments. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Moving to Pharmacy Services. Total revenues declined approximately 2% versus last year primarily driven
by the previously disclosed client losses and continued price compression. The decline in revenue was
partially offset by growth in specialty pharmacy of approximately 4% and brand drug price inflation. Total
pharmacy claims grew 0.7% in Q4 compared to last year driven by net new business.

Momentum in Pharmacy Services continues, with adjusted operating income increasing 7.9% compared to
the fourth quarter last year. Improvements in purchasing economics and the ongoing benefit to our clients
and CVS Health from several generic launches and our continued success with customers in managing
specialty pharmacy continues to fuel the growth. The quarter also reflected higher investments to support
our successful 2021 welcome season.

And finally, Retail/Long-Term Care total revenues grew 6.6% year-over-year driven by a 2% increase in
prescription volume, including strong flu immunizations as well as benefits from our diagnostic testing
and brand inflation, partially offset by a 1.6% decline in front store sales. Our COVID-19 diagnostic
testing program contributed nearly $400 million in the quarter. Prescription growth was driven in part by
continued adoption of our patient care programs. Offsetting the growth was lower incidence of flu and flu-
like illness, which reduced flu-related scripts nearly 40% and affected cough and cold sales in the front
store by approximately 30%. Gross margins for the segment declined 140 basis points versus 2019 driven
by continued reimbursement pressure and mix, partially offset by testing. Adjusted operating income
declined 12.6% year-over-year, reflecting the items I have discussed as well as costs related to COVID-19.

Moving to other items on the income statement. We incurred lower interest expense as a result of our
continued debt paydown. And the adjusted tax rate was higher in Q4 compared to Q4 '19 primarily due to
the return of the HIF.

Transitioning to 2021 guidance. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.39 to $7.55,
an increase of approximately 4% to 6% from our 2020 baseline of about $7.11 and in line with our mid-
single-digit growth expectation. Consistent with our practice, net realized capital gains or losses and prior
year's development are excluded from our outlook.

We expect to generate between $12 billion and $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations in 2021.
This includes the impact of timing of certain payables and receivables that contributed to our 2020
outperformance. Our gross capital expenditure expectations of $2.7 billion to $3 billion is above historical
levels as we expand our investments in technology and digital, enhancing our app and systems workflow,
and we continue to invest in our HealthHUBs.

As noted over the course of 2020, there were positive and negative impacts from COVID-19, many that
offset across our segments, stemming from changes in consumer behavior. We are pleased with our ability
to pivot, to deliver the products and services in demand to drive continued growth at our enterprise as we
create a better way to deliver health care. In 2021, COVID-19 is expected to have an immaterial impact
on our adjusted earnings per share. As we have highlighted in our slides, COVID-19 is expected to have
a benefit to the Retail/Long-Term Care segment and have an unfavorable temporal impact to the Health
Care Benefits segment.

Importantly, we will continue to drive our enterprise cost savings initiatives, which we expect to deliver
between $900 million and $1.1 billion and will ramp as we move throughout the year. Key drivers of
savings include: Ongoing digitization of our businesses along with system technology improvements in
our operations, such as our call centers; real estate changes, including our decision to reduce office space
by about 30% resulting from COVID-19 and workforce management changes in how we are working; as
well as productivity and operational efficiency initiatives within each segment. We expect consolidated
full year adjusted operating income to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion with consolidated
total revenues in the range of $276.1 billion to $280.6 billion, up 3% to 4.5%. We are maintaining our
shareholder dividend of $2 per share.

Moving on to our segments. As a result of continued strength in Medicare products, we expect HCB
total revenues to be in the range of $79.4 billion to $80.7 billion. Medical membership is expected to be
between 23.2 million and 23.6 million medical members at the end of 2021, fueled by growth in each
of our Medicare lines of business. Partially offsetting the growth in Medicare is the transition of 2 large

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Medicaid contracts. Our guidance includes an expectation that state redeterminations do not return in
2021. We believe the strength of our unmatched benefit plan designs that utilize our enterprise assets
positions us well for 2021 and beyond.

Within Health Care Benefits, we expect adjusted operating income in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.2
billion. Our outlook reflects the negative impact of COVID-19 of approximately $450 million to $550
million, largely attributable to the Medicare risk adjuster impacts and the recent regulatory changes
from the Consolidated Appropriations Act; the removal of the HIF insurance fee, which we expect to
decrease 2021 adjusted operating income by approximately $175 million; and strong growth in Medicare
membership. Our full year MBR is expected to be approximately 84.7%, plus or minus 60 basis points,
which reflects the return to more normal levels of utilization, the removal of the HIF, lower risk-adjusted
revenue and mix shifts in our business.

In Pharmacy Services, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $144.5 billion to $147 billion driven
by strong net new business of $3.3 billion, continued growth in specialty pharmacy and brand drug
inflation in the mid single-digit range. The 2021 selling season is largely complete and we maintained a
strong 98% retention rate with gross wins of $4.9 billion. Adjusted operating income is expected to be
within the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion, driven by continued growth in specialty and our ability to
drive further improvements to purchasing economics, partially offset by industry-wide price compression.

Turning to Retail/Long-term Care. We expect revenue of $93.8 billion to $95.1 billion. We expect strong
adjusted script growth in the range of 7.25% to 9.25% driven by the continued successful execution
of our patient care programs, expected return of provider visits and COVID-19 vaccinations. We expect
front store traffic will increase as we move throughout the year. We expect adjusted operating income
to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, benefiting from continued pharmacy volume growth
and approximately $400 million to $500 million from COVID-19. The benefit from COVID-19 reflects
the positive impact of vaccines and testing-related revenues, net cost associated with these programs,
partially offset by the adverse impacts of front store and pharmacy, and our continued investments in
COVID-19-related protocols. Operating income growth also continues to be unfavorably affected by
reimbursement pressure.

Moving to other income statement items. We expect interest expense of about $2.6 billion, benefiting from
the paydown of our debt and our liability management actions. And our effective tax rate is expected to be
approximately 25%, reflecting the repeal of the HIF.

Finally, we expect quarterly earnings cadence to be fluid over the course of the year, but let me share
some perspectives on Q1. Q1 is expected to be the lowest earnings quarter for the year. In Retail/Long-
term Care, lower traffic in the front store and lower script volume has persisted into January in part due
to the weaker flu season. Q1 is also impacted by investments to advance our vaccine program. Health
Care Benefits is expected to have higher earnings in the first half of the year and the lowest in the fourth
quarter. Cost savings initiatives across our segments are expected to ramp over the course of the year.

In summary, we continue to deliver on our financial expectations and are confident in our ability to achieve
the 2021 guidance we outlined today. We are making progress toward driving sustainable long-term
growth. As Karen mentioned, we are accelerating aspects of our consumer-focused strategy to meet the
consumers' health needs of the future.

Before opening it up for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank Valerie for her work here in
Investor Relations. I'm disappointed to see Valerie leave over the next month, but I'm grateful for the
advancements that Valerie made during the time she was with CVS Health. I wish Valerie the best of luck
in her next venture.
Now let's open it up to questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.

Lisa Christine Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Karen, I just wanted to go back to the comments that you made around virtual-first primary care. So can
you maybe just help me to understand a little bit better, one, just the number of people that you have
enrolled in that program today? And then secondly, when you think about that virtual-first primary care, is
it virtual, then they come into the MinuteClinic? How is the physician network set up there? I just want to
better understand how that program is working and how many people you were able to enroll for 2021.

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Lisa. On the virtual care, this is a program that we started with one of our large national accounts.
Essentially, what we're doing is they select a virtual primary care physician, they interact first with that
virtual primary care doctor. And then if that person needs to be seen, what they do is they send them first,
our hope, is to the MinuteClinic. And that's kind of the way we've contracted. And then if there needs to be
other in-network providers, then they would refer them there. But there -- but their first interaction would
be with this virtual primary care. It is in pilot. And so with our large national customer -- one customer.
And our expectation is that we'll continue to roll it out as we go forward.

Lisa Christine Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Can you give us any idea of like what the cost savings is to that commercial client versus kind of a
traditional program as we think about potential interest around these kinds of things?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

It's a little too early to tell, but we are expecting lower cost savings, and that's when we're pitching it to
the national account customers. We've seen lower cost with primary care physicians being virtual. So --
but little early to tell at this point.

Lisa Christine Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up would be for Eva around what you have in the guidance for
vaccines. I heard the comments around 250,000 per week at this point, but the capacity for 20 million to
25 million per month. What do you actually have in the guidance that you gave us today?

Eva C. Boratto
Executive VP & CFO

Lisa, thanks for the question. I'll start with -- as you look at the Retail/Long-term Care segment guidance
and the prescription growth of 7.25% to 9.25%, I would think about the vaccines contributing about 2 to
3 percentage points of that growth. Obviously, it's fluidly, so it will depend on supply availability and the
selection of CVS Health. But as Karen said, we're ready to do 20 million to 25 million per month.

As you think about the profitability of the vaccine, Lisa, I would say, for the vaccinations that we'll
administer in our stores, the EBIT contribution's similar to a flu vaccination. And as we work through long-
term care, the profit contribution from that program is pretty de minimis as it was a complex process
requiring multiple visits to the site and with lower individuals there to vaccinate. Overall, the costs were
higher. So I would think about that as de minimis.

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Operator

We will take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman.

Robert Patrick Jones
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe just a follow-up on the $400 million to $500 million benefit. Just 1 point of clarification. Is that off
of the ex-COVID baseline? So we expect the $400 million to $500 million in the Retail/Long-Term Care
facility to be on top of the $7.11 at the enterprise level?

And then I guess, just more importantly, as we think about the year 2021, ex this COVID-related benefit,
could you maybe just share a little bit about how you're thinking about the other underlying assumptions,
returning back to normal or closer to normal as we get through the year?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me start with some of the assumptions, and I'll kick it over to Eva for some of the metrics. On
the assumptions, we assume that the public health emergency would stay in place all year. Obviously, that
impacts the Medicaid business. Relative to utilization, we have modest assumptions for deferred utilization
in the first quarter or so. And then we're assuming that we head back to a normal baseline.

As we ended the year of 2020, we had near-normal baseline levels of utilization. Obviously, COVID had
an impact on that. So as you think about the year, think about some very modest deferred utilization, but
returning to normal levels on the utilization front.

Eva?

Eva C. Boratto
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Bob. And your question on the retail side of the business. The $400 million to $500 million COVID-
related benefit, I would think about that across a couple of categories. One is the continuation of testing
while cases remain elevated to the benefits from our vaccination program. Offset by, obviously, the
incremental costs that we will incur. At the enterprise level, as I said, COVID is de minimis as you look at
the impacts on the HCB side, as Karen just outlined, and the impacts on the Retail/Long-term Care side.

Robert Patrick Jones
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then I guess just a quick follow-up. Karen, interesting decision to reenter the individual
markets for '22. Maybe if you could just share a little bit more about the decision process there. And then
as you think about year 1, how many geographies and markets might you be targeting?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So we've been studying the individual market for a while. What we decided, it's obviously stabilized
over time. Some of the remedies have been put in place. Clearly, there's a big market, 10 million to 15
million people that we aren't participating in today. We view that, the combination of the insurance and the
CVS Health assets gives us a unique opportunity to put a competitive product into the market. It will be
our first branded CVS Health-Aetna product that we put into the market.

And relative to the number of markets, we're still -- we still haven't finalized, though. So more to come
when we talk in the second quarter.

Operator

And we will move next with Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So Karen, you talked about, in the third quarter, and to dig in about the Aetna members that have 0 co-
pay access to the HealthHUBs. Can you just maybe give us an update of what percent of members have
that? And any early -- I know it's been kind of 6 weeks, but any early indication as how these members
are using that benefit?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Ricky. So we now have 6 million Aetna members that have the 0 co-pay, no-cost co-pay, benefit. We
put it into the Medicare business this year as well. So that -- we went from 4 million to 6 million as we
turned the corner on 2021. We have seen, where this -- our small group business had adopted this co-pay
early on, we've seen an increase in MinuteClinic visits of about 25% from that cohort of individuals. So it
is an indication that people are using MinuteClinic, are interested in using it with that co-pay design. So
that's the number -- so that's -- the 6 million is where we are, and we'll be able to watch that throughout
the year.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And as a follow-up, just on the PBM business. If you can just give a little bit more color on just kind of like
the selling season.

And you talked in the prepared remarks about a change in the business mix in 2020 -- into 2021. So how
should we think about business mix, up for renewal, and opportunities in the marketplace for 2022?

And what are the key new products that you are selling this year and you think will continue to -- into next
year?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Ricky, first, let me just comment on PBM. We're very pleased with our integrated approach with the PBM
and the health care side. And as I mentioned in our opening remarks, we have $350 million of incremental
revenue. That has been a focus for us to drive integration. The PBM business had, as Eva said, 98%
retention and about $4.9 billion of new sales. So we're quite pleased with the performance of the PBM
business.

And let me turn it over to Alan, who can give you more details around the products and the services that
we're selling.

Alan M. Lotvin
Executive VP & President of CVS Caremark

Ricky, thank you for the question. So just on -- with respect to us resonating in the market, I think there's
a couple of key points. So 1 is the most important thing to our customers right now is the management
of specialty. And we've continued to advance in that area and separate ourselves from the pack and
differentiate with a series of products, whether it's things that connect us digitally to our customers,
whether it's things that connect us digitally to our provider groups, and also as was mentioned earlier,
better management of oncology. That's really what's driven that.

With respect to -- when we look at the 2022 in terms of what's up for renewal, it's a year that's smaller
exposure of our own customers up for renewal than we've seen for the past 2 years. About $32 billion
compared to sort of in the $50 billion range the prior 2 years.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.

Charles Rhyee

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

12

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

First question, Karen, I think you talked about in the diabetes management program, you have about 1.4
million members. And you said about 50% of them was sort of representing Caremark-Aetna integrated
members here. Can you talk a little bit more about -- I guess, first. Is the 50% represents Aetna's fully
insured members and the others are ASO clients that are participating in this? And what kind of data have
you seen in terms of maybe cost savings by going through this approach?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So Charles, let me just comment on the diabetes program. First is it's focused on a data-driven
identification and targeting of member-specific gaps in 5 areas. We're focused on medication optimization,
medication adherence, screenings, lifestyle and nutrition and blood glucose monitoring. It's -- basically, it's
a multichannel approach.

We do -- as you mentioned, we have 1.4 million members. That 50% represents kind of all of our
members. It's -- I can't -- I don't know the split. We can certainly get you that split at some point. So
we've launched it.

We do have a large group Medicare account on it as well. But preliminary results are showing that our
engagement rate is improving. We're closing diabetes gaps for about 50% of those engaged members. So
far, what we've seen is we're pleased with the preliminary results. But obviously, it's relatively new to the
market, so we need to see sort of that longitudinal study. But it is resonating with our customers.

Charles Rhyee
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And is that being delivered through the HealthHUBs themselves? Or is it more broadly through the
MinuteClinic channel?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

It is being delivered through the HealthHUBs itself, and being sold through both the Aetna and Caremark
teams. And we're really looking at it from an integrated perspective.

Charles Rhyee
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. And I got one more follow-up. You also talked about the efforts in the digital channel. Obviously, a
lot of members coming through to CVS for the first time. Are they coming through CVS through the CVS
app, for example? Or are they coming first through the store because they're looking to maybe book a
COVID appointment? How are they first reaching out to you? Like what percent of that is digital? And then
can you maybe talk a little bit about that strategy, retaining them digitally post -- once they leave?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Charles, I assume you're talking about the interactions with our testing and vaccines. All of our customers
are coming in digitally. They're required to make an appointment for -- and it is all a digital experience.
We are receiving quite positive response from those customers relative to their digital experience. Clearly,
we also have phone capability for people when they don't have those digital experiences, but most of
our customers are coming in digitally. I'm very pleased with the level of results we're getting from our
digital team and the experience that our customers are having. We've received such positive response in
comparison to others as they've been trying to get appointments elsewhere, and our systems have been
incredibly stable.

Operator

We will move next with Matt Borsch with BMO.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just a question on your outlook for utilization this year. I gather you're expecting some deferral early in
the year and then really normal utilization after that. Are you projecting that we'll see much sort of pent-
up demand or catch up? And if not, what are some of the factors that influence your view there?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Matt, so let me just comment on pent-up demand and acuity. We are not projecting high levels of pent-
up demand. We think that system capacity will constrain that -- the use in the health care system. I would
also tell you that we have spent a lot of time this year reaching out to our members to close gaps in care.
So we have been very specifically targeting individuals that have diabetes, pregnant moms. So that we are
reaching out to them so that we were connecting them virtually, that we were connecting them to services
so that we could not sort of have that acuity occur over the long periods of time. Obviously, we probably
didn't catch everyone. But if there's a huge pent-up demand, that could have an impact. But I think the
system will constrain it, obviously.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

That makes sense. And if I could, as a follow-up, how did things go with commercial enrollment with the
large accounts coming into the new year?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

I'm sorry, Matt, I didn't hear you.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I'm sorry. I was just asking a follow-up about the large account retention and enrollment coming in -- on
the health HCB side coming into January 1.

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Relative to commercial membership for 1/1/'21. Essentially, the pipeline was not as strong as we had
anticipated. We did have solid retention. What I would tell you, it would -- assume it was flat for national
account membership.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.

Michael Aaron Cherny
BofA Securities, Research Division

Want to dive in a little bit further and maybe on a more overarching basis on some of the digital
investments that you're making. Karen, either you've sprinkled some of the thought process that you
have with regards to the primary care first, with regards to some of the other components. As you think
about, especially the step-up that you have in digital spend and some of the strategic investments you're
making, what type of time line are you giving yourself to measure the success of those? And how are you
thinking about the hurdle rate in terms of the conversion factors that you need in order to judge them to
be successful or not?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

14

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

Yes. Thanks for the question. As you would imagine, we are investing more in our digital capabilities,
clearly, to demonstrate that seamless experience for in-person connections connected to our digital
capabilities. We'll be -- as we look at the return on investment, give us some time to do that. Clearly,
to stay competitive, to be in the market, we really do need to enhance those digital capabilities, either
through our virtual-first primary care or our digital capabilities for our retail locations, our testing and
vaccines.

We are trying to make the seamless connection across the consumer experience. Today, our consumers
interact with us through the Health Care segment, through the Pharmacy segment, through the Retail
segment. And we really want to make sure those connections are seamless across all our segments so the
consumer can engage with CVS Health once and feel that experience as a CVS Health.

Let me turn it to Eva. She can talk about our returns.

Eva C. Boratto
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. I think just to give you some examples and add on to what Karen said.
We did a thorough kind of review of our technology and decided to accelerate in a few areas. And it is all
about improving the customer experience while reducing costs. So I'll highlight a couple of examples for
you.

First, we're deploying Intelligent Agents across our call centers. And we utilize technology at the outset for
our COVID vaccine scheduling. And what we've been able to see is the deployment of this technology took
70% to 80% of the calls out of our stores and the call center. So real meaningful impact in a very short
period of time.

Another area that we're really focused on is how we utilize machine learning for greater personalization
across all aspects of our business to increase the returns there.

So we'll continue to evaluate and look at the returns and invest and learn here to drive the business
forward.

Michael Aaron Cherny
BofA Securities, Research Division

And if I could just ask one more quick one on the vaccine side. I appreciate all the color you've given
around your current [ testing ]. As you think about that rough contribution on the script side relative
to the vaccines, how much of that is dependent on some of the new molecules coming to market? Is
that dependent on having J&J and having some of the other ones? Or is that built in on what the current
dynamic is in terms of what's available and what you're able to dispense?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

What -- our current allocations are based on what the government has currently. As we think about
ramping up for the rest of the year, it is dependent upon the vaccines, the J&J getting approved. We
anticipate that will get approved. Obviously, the country needs to have J&J get approved to get to the
numbers that the Biden administration has put out there.

Jonathan C. Roberts
Executive VP & COO

And this is Jon. I would just add that in our conversations with the pharmaceutical manufacturers, we're
estimating about 500 million doses of vaccine between now and the end of June. So we think there's going
to be good supply, and it should begin to open up in April.

Operator

And we will move next with George Hill with Deutsche Bank.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Eva, you had mentioned the 2022 leverage ratio and a couple of the other 2022 KPIs. I hate to look
forward that far, but I guess what I would ask is, do the other long-term earnings targets hold provided in
the 2019 Analyst Day? Or is there any reason that we should think the double-digit earnings growth target
or any of the other targets get reset because of COVID?

Eva C. Boratto
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question. George, what I'll say, we remain very focused on our long-term growth
targets that we outlined, right? As you think about 2022, it's a very fluid environment right now. So it's
difficult to comment explicitly on that, but we're focused on driving the organization forward over the
longer term to deliver on our targets.

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe my brief follow-up would be is it looks like the COVID, I'll call it, the tailwind
represents all the growth to the Retail/LTC segment in '21. I guess, is that the right way to think about
that? And I don't know if there's any other big moving pieces that you could talk about, particularly
reimbursement.

Eva C. Boratto
Executive VP & CFO

George, I'll take that one, right? As you look at the retail algorithm in 2021, our high single-digit growth
rate is attributable to strong prescription growth, right, 7.25% to 9.25%, which includes our patient
care programs as well as the COVID-19 vaccination. We expect diagnostic testing will continue. As you
think about it, as vaccines ramp up, the testing will ramp down. And normal returns in the front store as
we move toward the second half of the year. Reimbursement pressure is an offset to that. It continued
at consistent levels, as we've seen in the past as well as our cost-reduction initiatives. Overall, I think
about gross margins as flattish, given the mix change in the business, particularly as you think about the
COVID-19 vaccination and the revenues not reflecting the product cost, only the administrative fee.

Operator

We will move next with Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Could you just talk a little bit about your comment on an increase in the pace of targeted investments?
And was interested to just understand, in which areas? And will those be both organic or also through
acquisitions?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Lance, relative to our investments, there are organic investments really focused on technology, our digital
assets. And also, we have some investments for reentry into the ACA marketplace. So those are primarily
some of the incremental.

And let me turn it to Eva to add some more comments there.

Eva C. Boratto
Executive VP & CFO

I think -- Karen, I think you got it all.

Karen Sue Lynch

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Oh, okay. Well...

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Great. And then just -- could you just comment related to that, on -- you've obviously added a bunch of
talent already. Can you talk a little bit about your talent additions? And then if there are any implications
for org structure, new roles, et cetera, as you're thinking about that?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

So Lance, we've brought in 3 new individuals on to the team.

Neela Montgomery, who is leading our retail organization. She brings some significant consumer and
digital experience.

We've also brought in Michelle Peluso, who brings great, again, digital experience, customer experience,
marketing experience.

And we've also brought in a new leader of -- our new Chief People Officer, Laurie Havanec, who brings
cultural change, diversity and inclusion, and really help -- can help drive the workforce of the future.

I'm quite pleased with the talent that we have on the team across the board. So very pleased with the
complement of talent to drive the business forward.

Operator, we have time for one more question.

Operator

And we will take our last question from A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just maybe ask about the Medicare Advantage outlook. I know CMS is out this morning with the February
numbers, it looks like year-to-date, you're up 6%. Could you give us maybe a little flavor for where you
think that will land over the course of the year?

And I know in your 10-K filed this morning, you're talking about increasing cost of medical care and CMS,
local and national coverage decisions. Sort of begs the question of, where do you think MA margins are
going to go this year?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

A.J., let me just take a step back. So I think it's important to look at our Medicare business as a portfolio
of products. And we have grown in January in each of the products in our Medicare portfolio.

So if I start with Medicare Advantage, as you mentioned, the new files are out. We're pleased with the
year-over-year growth, of the double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis. We have made progress
in our group Medicare Advantage business as well. We're growing in January. We've also, as part of our
strategy. Saw a large commercial to group MA conversion. You would have saw that in the file this morning
as well.

We've had very strong performance in our duals business. We grew 100% in our duals business. And as
you might recall, that was a deliberate strategy of ours. And then our Medicare supplement business grew
impressively in 2020. We expect it to continue to grow in 2021.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

CVS HEALTH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 16, 2021

And finally, A.J., our PDP grew in January, outperformed the industry there as well. It was a very targeted
and disciplined approach to growing PDP. As you know, our strategy is to see if we can drive PDP
performance, PDP conversions to MA. We've had good success there, and we expect to continue to do so.

We are targeting our business at our targeted margins, A.J., so we expect that's where the performance
will be.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And if I could just follow-up, being the last question. I got 2 little cleanups here. When you get back
into the public exchange, do you have a view of what the target margins for those public exchange lives
should be? And then on the vaccine, you didn't say anything about front-end add-on. Should we think of
the vaccine for COVID like the vaccine for flu, where there is some added benefit in the front end of the
store?

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So for the IVL, more to come. We're still evaluating our pricing, our market. So more to come on that.

And then relative to vaccines and front store, let me ask Jon to answer that question for you.

Jonathan C. Roberts
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So we do see an opportunity with the vaccines and building relationships with new customers to
convert them to long-term CVS Health customers. So let me just give you an example.

Our customers, after they get the vaccine, have to wait 15 minutes as we observe them to make sure they
don't have an adverse reaction. So we're going to give them a series of value-adds to encourage them to
engage further. So from shopping passes in the store to MinuteClinic education and ultimately CarePass
onboarding.

And then remember, as we said earlier, every one of these customers is coming through our digital front
end. So we have their email, we have their text message, and we have the ability to communicate with
them regularly. So I would think of it beyond just the add-on front store. I would think about it as adding
new customers to the CVS channel and getting their pharmacy business plus their front store business.

Karen Sue Lynch
President, CEO & Director

That's all we have for today, so I'd like to thank everyone for our call this morning.

As you can see, we've made measurable and important progress on our strategy as a health services
company. We're starting 2021 with strong momentum, and we are accelerating our pace of progress to
drive our consumer-centric approach. And I do, again, want to thank all of our employees for their strong
performance.

With that, I'll say thank you for joining us today.

Eva C. Boratto
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, everyone.
