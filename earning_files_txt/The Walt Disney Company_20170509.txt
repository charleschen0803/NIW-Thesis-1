Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone
Earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.50 which represents an increase of 10% compared to Q2 last year after adjusting for certain items affecting comparability
Parks and Resorts delivered another strong quarter with operating income growth of 20%, driven by increases at Shanghai Disney Resort and our domestic parks and resorts
As I discussed during last quarter's earnings call, second quarter results benefited from one week of the winter holiday shifting into the quarter
However, this benefit was more than offset by the timing of the Easter holiday, which fell entirely in Q3 this year compared to Q2 last year
We estimate these two items had an adverse impact on the year-over-year growth in operating income of eight percentage points, or about $45 million
We are very pleased with the continued progress we're seeing at Shanghai Disney Resort
The resort was modestly profitable during the second quarter, and while we expect an operating loss for the third quarter due to seasonality, we still expect the resort to breakeven for the fiscal year
At our domestic parks, growth in operating income was largely due to higher attendance, partially offset by higher costs
I will note that our domestic operations delivered Q2 records for revenue and operating income
Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% in the quarter despite a net adverse impact of about two percentage points due to the timing of the winter and Easter holidays
Per capita spending in the parks was comparable to last year
Since Easter shifted out of Q2 this year and the 60th anniversary celebration at Disneyland Resort was behind us, we offered seasonal promotions during the quarter to drive attendance growth
Admission spending was in line with prior year with the impact of these promotions offsetting pricing increases
At our domestic hotels, per room spending was up 1% and occupancy levels of 88% were comparable to last year
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 4%, primarily reflecting the timing of promotions and reduced room inventory due to rehabs and conversions at a couple of our hotels, while booked rates are up 11%
Overall, we feel great about the performance of our parks business
Segment operating margin was 17.4% for the second quarter, up 150 basis points over Q2 last year despite an estimated net adverse impact of about 90 basis points due to the shift in the winter and Easter holidays
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was up 21% due to increases in television distribution and home entertainment, partially offset by lower film share revenue as sales of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise were higher in the prior year
TV distribution results were primarily due to international growth and higher domestic rates, partially offset by the timing of domestic title availabilities
Growth in our home entertainment business was driven by a greater sales mix of new release and Blu-ray titles and reflects the performance of key titles such as Moana and Doctor Strange during the second quarter this year compared to The Good Dinosaur, Inside Out and Ant-Man in Q2 last year
On the Theatrical side, we are extremely pleased with the performance of Beauty and the Beast in the quarter and the carryover performance of Rogue One and Moana
However, operating income was comparable to prior year, given the strong performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Zootopia during Q2 last year
At Media Networks, operating income was down 3% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by lower equity income from Hulu and A&E and a decline at Cable
Cable results reflect a decline at ESPN partially offset by growth at Disney Channels and Freeform
At ESPN, higher programming and production expenses were partially offset by higher affiliate and advertising revenue
As I've previously mentioned, we expected ESPN's programming costs to be up meaningfully in the second quarter due to the impact of the first year of our new NBA rights deal and the shift of three College Football Playoff games into Q2 compared to last year
I'll remind you that this year, ESPN aired three of the New Year's Six bowl games during the second quarter, whereas it aired all six games during the first quarter last year
Ad revenue at ESPN was up 5% in the second quarter as higher rates were partially offset by a decrease in impressions
We estimate Q2 ad revenue was down 1% excluding the impact of the three additional bowl games
Turning to Broadcasting, growth in operating income was due to an increase in program sales and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs and lower ad revenue
Higher operating income from program sales resulted from the sale of Iron Fist and higher sales of How to Get Away with Murder during the second quarter compared to the sale of Daredevil last year
Higher programming costs were due to a greater mix of third-party programs and contractual rate increases for acquired programming
Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down about 2% in the second quarter as higher pricing was more than offset by a decrease in impressions
Quarter to date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 23% above upfront levels
Total Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting
The increase in affiliate revenue was the result of seven points of growth due to higher rates partially offset by a three point decline due to a decrease in subscribers
This quarter, we experienced a slight change in the rate of sub losses
I'll note that the magnitude of the change was less than half a point compared to what we experienced during the first quarter
At Consumer Products and Interactive Media, operating income was up 3% in the second quarter as higher operating income from our games business was partially offset by a decline in merchandise licensing
Games results benefited from the discontinuation of our vertical console games businesses in the second quarter last year
Merchandise licensing results were lower in the quarter, reflecting strong sales of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in Q2 last year
As we look to the third quarter, there are a couple of comparability items I want to highlight
As I've noted in the past, we expect fiscal 2017 cable programming costs to be up 8% versus fiscal 2016 driven primarily by $600 million in incremental expense associated with the first year of our new NBA contract
We expect $400 million of that increase in the third quarter, which will be the biggest driver of a 16% increase in total cable expenses
At Parks and Resorts, we anticipate Q3 costs will increase meaningfully versus prior year largely to support underlying volume growth and a variety of growth initiatives
These include the openings of Pandora – The World of Avatar at Animal Kingdom, Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! at Disney California Adventure and Explorers Lodge Hotel at Hong Kong Disneyland
Higher costs also include a full quarter of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and will reflect an 18-day dry-dock of the Disney Fantasy
I also want to update our CapEx forecast for the year
Given changes in timing of a number of projects under development, we now expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be $200 million lower than prior year
During the second quarter, we repurchased about 18.6 million shares for about $2 billion
Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 41.5 million shares for approximately $4.4 billion
As you know, we've always taken a disciplined and balanced approach to allocating capital and in how we manage our balance sheet, which has served our shareholders well
Given the lower than expected CapEx and improved operating cash flow, coupled with our continued confidence in our business, we are increasing our share repurchase target by $2 billion to $9 billion to $10 billion for the year
Overall, we feel good about the financial results we delivered this quarter and for the first half of the year, and we are still on track to deliver modest growth in earnings per share for fiscal 2017. I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions
So, Doug, it's Christine
Your qualification of the affiliate renewals coming up over the next five years through 2022, that timeframe is about right
Omar, I'll touch on the Q3 ad sales pacing
So in my comments, I did mention that ad sales are pacing down and this is for ESPN, I think, that you're referring to and that's reflecting the softness that we're seeing in the overall advertising marketplace
We are, however, very pleased with what we're seeing with the NBA
There's strong demand for the NBA inventory, and the rating strength to date is encouraging
The teams that are remaining in the playoffs suggest that the performance in the Conference Finals should be strong
We're also encouraged by live sports
There's a couple of sporting events that did quite well recently
Total audience growth was strong in the recent NFL Draft, and we've also seen some very strong Major League Baseball games and also the Women's NCAA Championship Game that was just recently played
I'd also like to touch on more broadly just what we're seeing in the ad market
We are optimistic as we head into the upfront
And over the past year, we've successfully sold impressions across the ESPN platform, and we're confident that this strategy is going to continue to serve us well, particularly now that Nielsen is measuring all those live impressions as one number
Bob talked in his comments about the reach and growth of our platform, and that's everything from linear, out-of-home, over-the-top, WatchESPN, mobile, digital and we're quite uniquely positioned with this platform to deliver expansive reach to our very desirable audience
So this unique positioning provides us with optimism that we'll have a very successful upfront

Okay
Anthony, turning to Consumer Products, I think you remember that I previously said that full fiscal year 2017 would be driven by our second-half performance in the segment
We still expect strong growth in the second half and it will be driven by two very important IP franchises: Cars and Spider-Man
Both the Cars 3 movie, which releases on June 17, and Spider-Man, which releases on July 7, we're looking very much forward to those releases and we are very optimistic that the two franchises and the merchandise licensing from that will drive a very strong second half performance and our business overall
So on parks, in my comments, I mentioned that in the third quarter, parks expenses actually would be up in the third quarter year-over-year
And we anticipate those costs being up because of underlying growth, as well as the launching of some major new initiatives which are coming online
You've heard them a few times here, Avatar, Guardians of the Galaxy at Disneyland as well as a new hotel in Hong Kong
We also have that first full quarter of Shanghai operations in the third quarter, so that'll also impact our expense growth
And we also – it's worthy of mention that we have an 18-day dry-dock of one of our four cruise ships, the Disney Fantasy
So for the quarter, the expenses will be up for the parks segment
And, Steve, I know you had a question on the buyback, but could you repeat the question?
Well – no, I think the best way to think about that is we would carefully consider it
It would be a great problem to have to consider, tax reform, so it's just one of many things that we would consider
But we have been consistent with our buyback year after year, and I would just leave it at that
