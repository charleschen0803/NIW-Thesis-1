DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Craig A. Streem
Vice President of Investor Relations

Sure. Thanks a lot, Maria. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our call.

We'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find as always in the financial section
of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion this morning contains
certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual
results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in
today's earnings press release and presentation.

Our call this morning will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and from John Greene, our
Chief Financial Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time, as Maria said, for
a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, we appreciate it if you limit yourself initially to
one question. If you have a follow-up, maybe queue back in, so we can be sure to accommodate as many
participants as possible.

And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I hope all of you and your families
are staying healthy and safe during these very challenging times. I'd also like to take a moment to
acknowledge and thank the health care workers, first responders, grocery store workers and many others
who've been working so hard and often great personal sacrifice for the benefit of our communities and
country.

The structure of this call will be a bit different than our traditional earnings calls. After my opening
remarks, John will discuss our first quarter results with a particular focus on the reserve build. I'll then
come back and provide additional information as to what we have been seeing since the end of the first
quarter.

Here at Discover, our top priority has been the health and safety of our employees. Our headquarters
functions moved to work-from-home on March 16 with minimal disruption. And our technology team and
field leadership did an incredible job getting nearly all of our 8,000 Discover Call Center team members
working from the safety of their homes within 2 weeks.

Our robust business continuity plans, digital business model and a 100% U.S.-based customer service
helped ensure our representatives were ready even as we faced an unprecedented increase in call volumes
from concerned customers impacted by the coronavirus. Early on in the crisis, we answered 95% of calls
in less than 5 minutes. And for April, as our team got more comfortable working from home, average
hold times have been under 1 minute. We are providing significant support to our customers across every
product to help them through this crisis. We've expanded payment plans across our credit card, student
and personal loan and home equity products and waived fees on CD early withdrawals for customers who
need emergency access to their funds.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Our strong capital position and balanced funding model are also a source of strength. John will provide
additional detail, but I'm especially pleased with the strong demand we are seeing for our deposit
products.

Some of the early impacts of the pandemic can be seen in our first quarter results, specifically in sales
volume and card loan growth. For the company overall, we generated a net loss of $61 million or $0.25
per share as the benefits of solid growth in average loans were more than offset by higher provision
expenses. As we adopted the CECL reserve methodology on January 1, the reserve build this quarter
reflected the life-of-loan view as well as an outlook for a weaker economy and higher unemployment.

Actions we have taken since the crisis began includes significant tightening of underwriting for new card
and personal loan accounts with additional employment verification. And we've pulled back on balance
transfer offers and line increases. As I've mentioned on prior calls, for the last 18 months, we have been
tightening credit at the margin as we have felt for some time that we are in late credit cycle. But given the
present environment, we are adopting a significantly more cautious view.

To give you a sense for how our card portfolio compares today with how it looked at the end of 2007, our
contingent liability, meaning the total open-to-buy for our card products has been reduced from roughly
5.7x loans to around 2.7x, and the percentage of the portfolio below a FICO score of 660 has gone from
26% at that time down to 19% at the end of 2019. So while we are not immune from the impacts of
deterioration in the economy, our portfolio is significantly better positioned than it was ahead of the last
financial crisis.

In addition to our credit actions, we are taking a hard look at operating expenses to ensure investments
align with the economic environment. We are implementing approximately $400 million of cost reductions
over the remaining 3 quarters of 2020, and we'll continue to review expense levels as the economic
environment evolves.

I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail, then I'll come back to
discuss the current environment.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to echo Roger's thanks to all the
people working on the frontlines of the pandemic. I also want to thank all of our Discover associates.
They have pivoted to a work-from-home environment while maintaining their high service levels and
professionalism throughout.

Today, I will summarize the results for the quarter, then provide details on our credit performance and loan
provisions. I'll conclude with an update on capital and funding trends before turning the call back over to
Roger to summarize our COVID-19 response actions.

In light of the uncertainty in the economy, we are withdrawing our previously provided guidance. But
as Roger mentioned, we are targeting $400 million of cost reductions through the balance of the year
with the majority in the second half. Our expense actions include: reducing account acquisition expense,
cutting spending on brand awareness and consideration activities and reducing vendor and technology
spend. We will continue to review all discretionary spending as the payback on incremental spend has
changed.

In the interest of focusing our comments this morning on the impacts of the pandemic and our responses,
we are not going to review our customary slides on loan growth, payment volumes and revenue. So you
can find additional disclosures on Slide 11 to 16 in the appendix to this presentation. And as always, we
are happy to take questions on these or any other aspects of the quarterly results.

On Slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement. Revenue net of interest expense increased
5% this quarter, driven primarily by a 6% increase in average loans and a $35 million net gain in our
Payment Services segment, principally from the sale of a portion of an equity investment.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Net interest margin was 10.21% for the first quarter. This was down 25 basis points year-over-year, due
largely to lower loan yields as the prime rate came down in response to Fed rate cuts in September and
October of last year. This was partially offset by lower funding costs. The additional Fed rate cuts in March
of this year will impact net interest margin beginning in the second quarter.

Provision for credit losses include a net charge-off of $769 million, up 8% from last year, and an increase
in reserves of approximately $1 billion, reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook. I'll have some
additional comments on credit in a moment. But before we turn to the next slide, I want to discuss our
operating expenses. They were up 13% from the prior year first quarter. The increase was principally due
to higher compensation expense, increased marketing costs and investments in technology.

Turning now to Slide 5, showing our key credit metrics. Credit performance remained stable in the first
quarter. We did not see any discernible impacts from the national COVID-19 containment activities or
from our own credit mitigation actions in response. Card charge-offs increased 15 basis points from last
year's quarter, due principally to seasoning of loan growth. The credit card 30-plus delinquency rate was
up 17 basis points from last year, but flat versus the prior quarter, with both metrics reflecting consistent
performance in typical seasonal patterns.

Our private student loan and personal loan portfolios also had stable credit performance in the quarter
with both showing slight improvements in charge-offs and delinquency rates.

On Slide 6, you'll see our allowance for credit losses. We added $2.5 billion to the allowance for credit
losses in January of this year as we transitioned to a life-of-loan CECL basis. At the end of the quarter, we
added approximately $1 billion to the allowance, largely due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast.
The reserve build assumes unemployment rising to more than 9%, recovering through 2022, and a decline
in GDP of nearly 18%. We also included our best estimate of the reserve implications of the government
stimulus programs.

As the economic outlook evolves and the impacts of the various government relief programs become more
clear, we will adjust our allowance accordingly.

Turning to Slide 7. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 10 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a
decrease in loan balances, partially offset by capital returns. For purpose of calculating regulatory capital,
we have elected to defer recognition of the CECL day 1 adjustment for 2 years. So we will begin to phase
in our day 1 CECL impacts in 2022, with 100% phased in by 2025. The federal banking regulators have
also provided a phase-in for their day 2 impacts of CECL, with 25% of the quarterly reserve build also
being deferred until 2022, and then treated the same as the day 1 deferral.

Our payout ratio, which includes buybacks, was 99% over the last 12 months. As Roger noted, we have
suspended our share buyback program, but we will continue to fund our regular quarterly dividend.

Our liquidity position remains very strong. As of the end of the quarter, we had $19 billion in liquid assets,
$6 billion in committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations and $35
billion in borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of April 20, our liquid assets have
grown to more than $23 billion.

In addition to those forms of actual and committed liquidity, we have access to funding through our direct-
to-consumer deposit channel, with average deposits increasing 20% year-over-year and now making up
over 55% of total funding. Based on the strength of consumer demand, yesterday, we reduced rates on
our savings account by 10 basis points, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to do so.

In summary, good progress on the expense front, liquidity is robust, capital remains strong, and we
continue to monitor and manage our credit exposure.

And now I'll turn the call back over to Roger.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Thanks, John. While we will not be providing new guidance given the uncertain economic outlook, I do
want to provide you with an update on 2 key areas where the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our
business in a way that was not captured in the Q1 results.

On Slide 8, we're giving you a detailed look at the sales volume trends to illustrate how COVID-19 has
affected cardholders spending in April as compared to the much smaller impact we saw on the first quarter
sales.

The first column shows the composition of sales by category for the full year 2019. So you can see where
our cardholders spend is normally distributed by industry. We then give you the year-over-year growth
percentages for the first quarter of 2020 and month-to-date April. On a day-adjusted basis, everyday
sales, which includes gas, groceries and wholesale clubs and makes up about 22% of total sales, saw a
growth of 10% during the quarter. So far in April, however, everyday sales are down 14% year-over-year
as increased spending on groceries is more than offset by a 60% reduction in spend in Petroleum.

Discretionary spend is down 33%, driven by the travel category, which, although only 8% of cardholder
spending is down 99% and by retail, which is down 11%. As long as stay-at-home orders remain in place
and many businesses remain closed, we expect the weak sales volume trend to continue, and future
trends will depend upon the pace of the recovery.

Turning to Slide 9. I want to take you through the Skip-a-Payment programs we have implemented to help
our customers during this period of economic difficulty.

We recognize that COVID-19 has placed financial stress on the Discover customers, who may be out
of work or suffered reduced wages. One of the key differences in this downturn compared to the Great
Recession of 2008, 2010, has been the staggering pace of job loss, but also the amount of government
stimulus and the potential for many of those jobs to be restored after a hopefully brief period of
unemployment. Therefore, we are offering support to those impacted by COVID-19 with Skip-a-Payment
programs available across all of our products, many modeled on the relief we traditionally provide for a
natural disaster.

Through the first half of April, we have enrolled over 450,000 customers and roughly $3.8 billion in
receivables in Skip-a-Payment programs to provide financial relief to our customers across our lending
products. The receivables enrolled now represent 4% of total loans, but we are encouraged that the
number of daily enrollments has been declining since the level peaked in late March. We will continue to
work with these customers closely and potentially extend programs when required to meet the customers'
needs.

Let me close by summarizing some of the actions we have taken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We have shifted virtually all of our employees to work-from-home in a sustainable model that still
continues to provide an industry-leading customer experience across all of our products. We have taken
swift and meaningful action to adjust our credit policies to reflect the new environment, continuing to lend,
but with tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts.

We are implementing expense reduction initiatives while preserving key investments that will allow us
to grow our business over the long term, and we are prepared for additional actions as the environment
evolves. While our capital position is strong, we have suspended our share repurchase program in order to
enhance our capital base.

Clearly, we will have some challenging quarters ahead, but I'm confident that we have taken the correct
actions. None of us can foresee when the pandemic impacts will subside and allow the U.S. economy to
begin to recover. But Discover is well positioned for the recovery that we know will eventually come. We
have a loyal customer base, committed employees and a strong financial foundation to build from as we
look to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. So I will turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the line for
Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Bob Napoli of William Blair.

Robert Paul Napoli
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I hope everybody's well. A question on the -- your outlook for unemployment and GDP since you're
reserving for the life of the loans. And I know you gave some numbers, but is -- are you -- can you just go
over those numbers for 2020, 2021? And what you're expecting as far as recovery? And what effect is --
will that have on loan growth?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Thanks, Bob. This is John. I'll take a shot at that. So there is a wide degree of economic forecast
that we took a look at while we're building our models, and ultimately, our allowances. So what we built in
was unemployment peaking at 9% and staying relatively high through the balance of this year. So about
7% through the end of the year. And then it recovers slowly through 2022, so not expecting a real quick
recovery and rather slow, and our allowances has reflected that dynamic as we modeled it out.

So loan -- and your second part of your question on loan growth. So loan growth will be dependent on
how we see the economy and the recovery proceeding. As Roger mentioned in his comments, we have
been cautious coming into this cycle. And when the pandemic hit, we pulled back further. So loan growth
will be subject to essentially the recovery of the economy.

Robert Paul Napoli
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

But we would expect to see loans declining, I guess, from here, at least, for the next quarter or 2? I
mean, is that fair?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Bob, there are a lot of factors that will go into where loans go. Certainly, the retail spend numbers that
I gave you will have a significant impact on that. The credit action and expense actions we've taken
will have an impact on loan growth as well. But to John's point, there's a lot of uncertainty that will be
determined by the pace of the recovery.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.

Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I hope you guys are doing well as well. I guess it's been pretty well documented that since the end of
March, some of the economic forecasts have actually been revised worse. So could you just talk about
how that might be contemplated in the future? Or whether or not you guys think it should be? And then
also how you guys are incorporating some of these Skip-a-Payment to cure rates and such inside your loss
assumptions?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Thank you. So there's -- as I said in my response to the last question, there's a wide degree of
variation on the estimate. So when we put this together, we were looking at what a likely scenario was.

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Now the economic backdrop continues to evolve. So we certainly did consider that. There are some
overlays related to how we think about recoveries. And certainly, we did put a mild overlay in -- for the
government stimulus programs. But it is uncertain. And if the economy deteriorates further and we don't
see a recovery, that will have reserve implications. If it runs out as we've modeled, that will also play
through into the balance sheet and the P&L. So I know I'm not being real specific on your answer, but at
this point, given the uncertainty, this was our best estimate.

In terms of your second part of your question on Skip-a-Pay. So that -- though the nature of that program
is -- for card is that an inbound call will happen. The customer, if they're impacted by COVID, they'll get
an automatic basically payment deferral. They won't have to make the payment. If they call back a second
time, they can get a second deferral on the payment. And after that, they would either pay and go current
or continue to kind of roll into delinquency buckets, and ultimately, charge-offs. So as we provisioned, we
thought about life-of-loan provisions and feel like we did a reasonably good job of capturing the dynamics
on the portfolio.

The one impact on Skip-a-Pay is that, if a customer is in trouble and is unable to pay, it will result in up to
a 2-month deferral in the charge-off just by the nature of how things roll. But I do want to point out that,
just over 80% of those customers who entered into the Skip-a-Pay program were current at that time.

Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And just to clarify, I guess, the same forecasts you used for your assumptions in the first quarter,
have those actually been revised for the worse in -- early into the second quarter? And if everything
remained the same, would that mean that there would have to be an additional provision? Or are you
saying that it's really subjective based on sort of how you're seeing things unfold based on your own
forecasts?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So there's a number of factors. And I'm not trying to be elusive here, Sanjay, but unemployment and
GDP contraction are obviously key inputs. The duration of the slowdown will also be important. Geographic
input impacts are important. Job classes are important. So ultimately, it will be a matter of the pace of the
recovery. But just to go back and clarify my remarks, so we assumed just over 9% unemployment levels
at a peak, and then a very, very slow recovery in 2020 and then coming in through 2022.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

And Sanjay, just to build on that, the reserve is calculated a point in time. And so we'll go through
a similar process next quarter. My guess is there will be a lot of ups and downs in economic forecast
between now and then. And I would contrast that with in terms of how we make our credit decisions, that
is done on a near continuous basis and at a much more granular level. And so we're looking by industry
sector. We're looking by geographic area. We're making decisions on who we book, line assignment, how
much employment verification we do. So I contrast the reserve calculation with how we're managing
credit, which is near continuous.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.

Mark C. DeVries
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

The -- it sounds like your macro assumptions were not too dissimilar from the last recession as far as
kind of where unemployment peaks and the pace of the recovery, yet the card reserve reflects cumulative
losses that are probably less than half of what you've experienced in '08, '09 time frame. Could you just
talk about how the portfolio has changed in a manner that it makes you comfortable that losses won't
approach what we saw in the last recession?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

There's a couple of important pieces related to the portfolio that changed. So Roger mentioned this in his
comments in terms of the open-to-buy. So the open-to-buy has reduced by about $54 billion from the
last recession to this recession. Average FICO scores in the portfolio have increased between 500 and 600
basis points, which is a material change. Our underwriting, frankly, is far more sophisticated than it was
10 years ago. And frankly, the actions that this business undertook when the pandemic started to actually
drive some real difficult employment numbers was drastic and very, very quick.

So I don't know if it's -- if there is a perfect corollary between the last recession and this recession, time
will tell. But certainly, I feel like the business is well positioned and took decisive action. And again, if the
economic outlook changes, we'll adjust the reserves and the allowance accordingly.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.

Donald James Fandetti
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes. John, I'll try to sort of tie you to a specific number on the stimulus. Is it realistic that you could have,
as you've looked at your scenarios, maybe 1 point or 2 lower net charge-offs from stimulus?

And then secondarily, most financial institutions have said there'd probably be another reserve build, a
sizable reserve build in Q2. Just wanted to -- I know you've talked a lot about it, but is that the case as
you sit here today in April?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

So real difficult to answer at this point. So we're going to monitor the economy and our portfolio and
actually how our customers are performing and make appropriate calls on reserve builds in subsequent
quarters.

In terms of the government stimulus programs, the impact that we modeled was relatively modest. So I
don't know if I would go to a full percentage point on charge-offs, but there was a mild impact. And as we
see that unfold, it will become more clear.

The key thing on the stimulus programs, at least, initially was with the unemployment checks going out in
the $600, I'll say, benefit, that's a front-loaded impact, and we'll have to see how things develop on the
back half of the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.

Bill Carcache
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

Roger and John, I was hoping to follow up on your thoughts about the potential benefit from government
relief programs, specifically on the Paycheck Protection Program. Can you comment on the idea that
unemployed consumers who are receiving payments under PPP, and therefore, are not receiving
unemployment insurance, maybe understating the true level of the initial claims, which you guys have
always cited as an important leading indicator of credit performance?

And then if we extend that line of thinking, how much of a concern is there that like those receiving
unemployment insurance, employees participating in PPP faced uncertainty about their employment
outlook and still have to make decisions about which bills to pay first, what that means for the unsecured
credit card. But just, I guess, the overall consensus view seems to be that PPP is a positive in the near
term, but it's not a longer-term fix. And I was just hoping to -- that you could maybe speak a little bit

10

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

more to, I guess, the broad potential that the PPP program will benefit your loss experience and your
confidence level on that?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean, I think all of the government stimulus provides a benefit but given the depths of the decrease
in economic activity, what we all really need is for the economy to start back up again, and that will
depend on the pace of reopenings in different states, and it is impossible for us to forecast as we sit here.

Some of the traditional relationships may break down a bit. A lot of the initial unemployment claims have
been driven by, I would say, entry-level employees in retail, restaurant and other industries, that may
have less of a correlation with what we see in our prime card base. So there isn't necessarily even the
same one-to-one interaction that we would have seen in previous downturns where the job mix was
different. And that job mix may change over time during this recession as well. So I would summarize with
the government programs are helpful, but what we really need is the economy to get going again and so a
lot will depend on the pace of the recovery.

Bill Carcache
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

That's helpful. I guess maybe if I could just follow up with a conceptual question on CECL. I guess, a
different way of asking what's come up on the idea that if macro conditions were to continue to deteriorate
relative to your expectations at the end of Q1 at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that we will see
additional reserve building? And then therefore, when conditions stop deteriorating, we'll stop seeing
additional reserve building? And maybe kind of another way to ask that is, if you can envision a scenario
where you would need to continue to build more reserves even after economic conditions start to improve?
Just trying to again and get -- just get the big picture idea of how CECL is going to work.

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So big picture, if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate, there will be 2 dynamics that are
likely to happen. One would be the CECL life-of-loan provisions would increase. So the allowance would
increase. We would also take appropriate actions to ensure that our portfolio is stable and that the lending
activity we were doing made sense. So you could expect that the portfolio, frankly, might not increase
and would actually decrease. And if that were the case, you would see some level of offset as a result of
reserve releases tied to the portfolio size or the overall loan size. So there's multiple dynamics there that
come into play. But I hope that's exceptionally helpful.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.

Mihir Bhatia
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I wanted to ask a little bit more about just the forbearance programs? Sorry, firstly, this is Mihir on for
Jason. I wanted to ask about the forbearance programs and the Skip-a-Pay. Are you also continuing some
of your typical modification programs here? And can you just help us a little bit with the mechanics in
terms of just how you deal with the fact with whether you know the credit limits available to borrow, et
cetera, for those who seek either of these programs? And just how you expect that to lead to -- like with
the Skip-a-Pay, whether you -- will people be transitioning from that if they continue to grow through the
delinquency buckets to your other modification programs? Or is it that once you do the Skip-a-Pay now,
you don't -- you aren't eligible for some of those other programs? Just want to understand a little bit more
on how you're dealing with some of the delinquencies?

Yes. It's Roger. Let me try at a high level. As John described, for card, it's a 2-month program up to 2
months per Skip-a-Pay, but they do 1 month. Less than 5% have renewed for the second month. So we'll
see how that plays out over time. We do still have our program for customers that need a longer period
of assistance. Regulators have been encouraging us and others to maximize the support we provide for
customers. But again, I think, it really does depend on the pace of recovery. As John pointed out, over
80% of those taking advantage of Skip-a-Pay are current. And so our hope would be -- and again, that's
why we've modeled it after some of the disaster relief programs we traditionally had that they will require
a shorter bridge, and then we'll be able to get back to paying their bills. If not, we have longer-term
programs to assist them.

Mihir Bhatia
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And just -- sorry, just to clarify on that one. Do you do anything with the longer -- with the Skip-a-Pay,
there's no change to their credit limits available to borrowers, et cetera, correct?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

No. For those who have signed up for Skip-a-Pay, it does not impact their credit limits.

Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan.

Richard Barry Shane
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Thank you for all the information on the Skip-a-Pay. I'm curious what you're seeing in terms of payment
behaviors for consumers who aren't on Skip-a-Pay programs. Are you seeing an increase in consumers
who are making minimum payments on a monthly basis?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

So we're still

[Audio Gap]

pattern to emerge and part of it is driven by the drastic reduction in sales volume that you've seen.
But I would say that reduction in sales is relatively equal across transactors and revolvers. And so it's
balanced in that way. But what happens with payment rate, I think, will be determined on how quickly
those sales ramp up, some people making larger payments. And you can see from the inflow into our
deposit products, there are a lot of households who are still okay, but are looking to fortify their positions.
So I think it's too early to really pick out a pattern in terms of the impact of all these changes on payment
rate.

Richard Barry Shane
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And we share your view in looking at this in the context of a natural disaster in terms of
how the challenges emerge. But one thing that historically has been subsequent to a natural disaster are
significant insurance payments into those regions, which create things like huge cash inflows. We've seen
deposit spikes associated with that. I don't necessarily think that we're going to see that this time. Is it
your view that, that will actually change the post-event payment behavior and credit characteristics?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

There's a lot of speculation out there. In some ways, this is like a natural disaster. In other ways, there's
a big debate in terms of the resurgence of economic activity that you get from rebuilding after a disaster,

you won't quite have that here. And so is the economic -- people aren't going to go to twice as many
restaurants. And so is that economic activity just lost? I would say probably, while you don't have the
degree of insurance payments, you do have an unprecedented amount of governmental assistance. And
my guess is you'll continue to see additional programs. So that is probably a bit of an offset compared to
what you would have seen coming out of insurance.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler.

Kevin James Barker
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just in regards to the liability side of the balance sheet, I mean, are you seeing changes in behavior on
your deposit side? And what are your expectations going into the second and third quarter on just overall
deposit growth? Given the different -- the stimulus checks combined with stress across unemployment, I
know it's difficult to really pinpoint it, but it seems like there could be a lot of overlays where you might
actually see a little bit of pickup in deposits and then maybe a decline. Could you just give us a little idea
on your expectations there?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I think supply and demand are starting to come into balance, but it's going to take another quarter
or so. The appetite for our deposit products has actually been very, very good. We've traditionally been
second or third on the bank rate table. We have been -- recently been a little bit more aggressive on
the downward side based on the overall demand of our -- for our products. So I think certain people are
coming out of equities and looking for a safe place to put their cash. I think other folks have looked at our
offerings and our service levels and decided that we're a good spot, and they've chosen us.

So as we look forward in future, I'll say, future quarters, it will be subject to a couple of things. So
the supply and the demand factors, what our competitors are doing and then, obviously, our own
performance. But we look to kind of move on the deposit pricing to actually pull back some of the NIM that
was impacted by the Fed actions.

Kevin James Barker
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then in regards to some of the programs that you laid out with the $400 million expense
savings, should we assume that, that's off of what your previous guidance was? Or is that -- or are these
separate from what you plan to...

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you. Yes, that was off the previous guidance. And as we said, when we issued that, it was -- it'd
be based on a strict payback analysis. So are we going to get long-term returns for the incremental
investment? With the economic backdrop changing, we, of course, made the appropriate decisions.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

The first question is, where are we on utilization rates and average balances? And how do that compare to
maybe a period like entering the last recession?

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

I'm sorry, can you repeat the first part of that question?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Utilization.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Utilization rates. So as you look at overall utilization rates for the portfolio, I think, we showed that the
amount of contingent liability, i.e., the ratio of -- which is kind of the opposite of utilization is significantly
down from prior years. So -- one, as part of the credit tightening that we've done over the last several
years, a key component has been tightening contingent liability and tightening that exposure.

John Hecht
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I'm trying to quantify the effects of the rate changes in March. How much of the impact
to benchmark rates did you see in the quarter? I know it was later in the quarter. And what do we think
about NIM trends over the next quarter or 2?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So we didn't see any impact in the quarter from the Fed reductions at the end of March. So there
was about 150 basis points of reduction. So we've -- we're not giving guidance, but I'm going to give you
a couple of points in terms of how to think about it. So the 150 basis points hit, so there is an impact
for 3 quarters of the year on that. Our deposit betas have traditionally been about 50%. We took some
proactive steps early in the year, reducing overall deposit rates by 20 to 50 basis points depending on the
product. And then we're pulling back on the promo mix, which should also help rates. So you put those
factors together, and I think, it draws a picture of how NIM could look for the year.

Now the quarterly trends are going to be a little bit different based on what's happening in a particular
quarter on revolver and transactor mix.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Crédit Suisse.

Moshe Ari Orenbuch
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Roger, maybe as you kind of sit and think, and obviously, you're going to be doing less marketing, but
you're going to be doing it kind of in a different mix of products. And as you think about Discover's
product set and service niche, kind of how do you think about what you are going to be doing and where
there are opportunities to capitalize? And maybe if you could also just throw in thoughts on rewards
competition in this environment as well?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Moshe, for the question. One of the things we're trying to do is keep an eye on the
opportunity in this environment. And so even as we've made cuts, we continue to make investments as
well that will strengthen Discover, build the brand and make sure we're in great shape for the future. So
we're excited about the partnership with Quibi that just launched. Products such as our Miles card, where
you have the ability to redeem at Amazon and PayPal. That's a lot more useful than programs that were
structured just around travel.

Our third quarter promotion is for restaurants for the 5% program. We think that will resonate very,
very well. And our rewards rate and product is really structured well for a wide variety of scenarios. So

for example, issuers that have big sign-up bonuses, they're having to extend the period to earn those
because of the reduced level of retail sales and complaints from their customers, where -- or is it just a
flat match for the first year of spending. So we're very excited about where our products are positioned.
We talked a lot about the traction we're getting in deposits. I also think a lot of our messages really will
resonate in this environment. Who wants to waste money on a credit card with an annual fee? And we're
the only one with only no annual fee products. So we're really excited about some of the opportunities
we're seeing in this environment.

Moshe Ari Orenbuch
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. I would assume that you would expect better, whether it's a response rate or conversion rates and
things like that in this -- while marketing is lower, you might have some of that.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We're seeing as some of it plays out in the personal loan space, for example, some of the traditional
competitors in the FinTechs who do not have robust funding models are cutting very, very aggressively. So
even with reduced marketing, we're still hoping to generate good results.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

A couple of questions. Just one earlier, I think, you mentioned something about how this recession is
going to be very different from previous ones in part because of the quick job losses and then expected
recoveries. Do you know the job types by customer that you have?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

We get it at the time of underwriting. So some of it can drift over time. It varies a bit by product. We have
much better information for the personal loan customers, as an example. We don't have for our student
loan customers given they haven't been employed. So it does vary. But I would say we have very strong
personal loans and a good amount on the card portfolio.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then separately, on the reserving, as you know, folks like us were looking at the reserve levels
relative to the 2018 bank run stress test, just to get a sense as to how you're comping this upcoming
recession versus that stress loss scenario that you ran a couple of years ago. And when we look at that,
the credit card reserve that you've taken is running, if my math is right, around 45-ish percent of that
stress loss period, but the other consumer is running much higher. And on other consumer products, I
think, it averages around high 80s, low 90s. So I was just wondering, is there a reason why you feel this
tough kind of recession is going to be tougher on that other consumer? And does it have to do with your
answer you just gave? Or is there anything else there?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

I would probably say it really has to do with more technical differences between the nature of those 2
different stresses. A lot of it has to do with when a recovery comes in. So just comparing scenarios based
on peak loss can give you different numbers. So I wouldn't say it's anything different we're seeing by
asset class. It's more technical based on those scenarios.

DISCOVER FINANCIAL SERVICES FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 23, 2020

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just 2 other quick ones. When people sign up for Skip-a-Pay, and let's say, they go for the
1-month. Is it automatic that they can go for the 2-month? Or they have to call in every time or check it
on an e-mail?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Betsy, they have to call-in on the card side.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. All right. And I guess with the call times being extremely low, that's not going to be a challenge
for them. And then lastly, on the forbearance side or the call-ins that you've been receiving, from the
slide deck, obviously, it showed that the beginning of April was the peak. And I got a few questions on
overnight. Why do you think that's the case that the requests for Skip-a-Pay have already started to
decelerate at a time when unemployment claims are still rising here?

John Thomas Greene
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, that's a good question. Some of it could be related to the government stimulus programs. And then
it could be just the cycle. We do expect the trend to decline, and then a modest pickup as they approach
into the second month for certain customers, but we'll have to see.

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean, I guess, I would probably point to, a, people may have a better feel of what stress is coming
their way, even before they're actually unemployed. And so they may have called us knowing that their
boss said, "Hey, we've got 1 week left, and then we're closing down." So there isn't necessarily that line of
sight.

The second thing, my personal view is unemployment claims have actually been gated by capacity to
process as opposed to each week 6 million people are losing their jobs. And so that's why we would have
seen the bubble earlier because we didn't have that same capacity constraint that I believe you've seen
around unemployment claims.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That would be great to update that as you get in front of people too over the quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank.

Mengxian Jiao
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

One quick question, I guess, on the Skip-a-Payment. Do you guys give further demographics, I guess, on
what you're seeing in these customers? I mean, is it safe to assume that the lower FICO score customers
are the ones currently enrolling in these Skip-a-Pay payments? Or is that too much of a generalization?

Roger Crosby Hochschild
CEO, President & Director

I would say, we talked about over -- per card, at least over 80% are current. They are relatively highly
utilized in terms of the amount of balance, but there's actually a mix of some that are transactors as well
historically in that. So that's probably the information we're willing to provide at this time.
