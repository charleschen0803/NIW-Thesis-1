Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the National Oilwell Varco Third Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Blake McCarthy, Vice President of
Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.

Blake McCarthy
Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations

Welcome, everyone, to National Oilwell Varco's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With me
today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President
and CFO.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. They involve risks and uncertainties, and
actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain
valid later in the quarter or later in the year. For a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors
affecting our business, please refer to the latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP
measures are in our earnings release available on our website. On a U.S. GAAP basis, for the third quarter
of 2020, NOV reported revenues of $1.38 billion and a net loss of $55 million. Our use of the term EBITDA
throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our earnings
release.

Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

Now let me turn the call over to Clay.

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Blake. U.S. drilling activity during the third quarter of 2020 was the lowest measured since
records were started in the early 1940s, making this the worst quarter in the past 300 or so.

The COVID-19 pandemic response kept a lid on air travel and business activity, which depressed global
oil demand, and in turn, diminished demand for NOV's products and services. NOV's consolidated revenue
declined 7% sequentially, and EBITDA fell to $71 million or 5.1% of sales during the quarter ended
September 30, 2020. Although a vaccine and normalizing oil demand seem more likely than not in 2021,
our customers, like us, are cutting costs and exercising extreme austerity in the near term, which led to
modest orders during the third quarter. The company realized only 38% book-to-bill on a consolidated
basis. Fortunately, though, we are seeing rising inquiries in our Completion & Production Solutions
segment that we expect to lead to increased orders. And the Rig Technology segment already surpassed
its total Q3 orders level during the first few weeks of October. New products are helping drive demand for
both segments.

For the past few quarters, we sought to be clear and transparent in our communications with you on what
we are doing to navigate this historic downturn, namely: one, aggressively and proactively downsizing
and reducing costs; two, reducing working capital and CapEx to maximize cash flows; three, maximizing
liquidity; and four, continuing to invest in research and development and new products to position the
company for the inevitable upturn.

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

I'm pleased to report that we continue to exceed our targets on cost reductions. We have reduced our
global facility footprint, workforce and support services, making our operations leaner and more efficient.
We also continue to prune businesses that are not yielding adequate returns. We've shared a lot of data
around these costs and cash flow efforts with you on past calls. On the other hand, we've talked far
less about our new product investments, which we've been careful to sustain because they will form the
foundation of NOV's growth going forward.

At our core, what NOV does is build franchises that possess sustainable competitive advantage. Market
leadership frequently lends scale advantages, a status NOV enjoys. However, market leadership also
carries the responsibility of technical leadership. Our customers expect us to push the envelope on
technical innovation to improve efficiencies and cash flows for their operations. Knowing this, we have
sustained our investment in new technology through the downturn. And I'd like to tell you about a few
new technologies we are bringing to market.

Hydraulic fracture stimulation is a critical part of unconventional shale production. The shale revolution
is built on fracking. The industry has been experimenting with the use of lease gas to power fleets with
electricity to reduce gas flaring, carbon emissions, fleet maintenance costs and diesel expense, which can
run well over $1 million per month.

Generating power on-site to run electric motors that, in turn, drive pumps instead of conventional direct
drive diesel engines and transmissions can reduce mechanical complexity and maintenance costs. We've
already seen this work in the drilling space, driving the evolution of drilling rigs towards AC electrification
between 2005 and 2015. Throughout that period, the largest best capitalized drilling contractors at the
behest of their customers, the E&P companies, embraced this AC electrification improvement and invested
in new rigs. Then something really interesting happened. They looked around when it was done and from
their space reasonably well consolidated. That's because only a handful of smart drillers could afford the
price of admission to this new AC rig world, but those that made the leap clearly benefited.

If you don't believe me, take a close look at Tier 1 land rig day rates between 2015 and 2019. Despite the
downturn, day rates remained very healthy, strong evidence of an improved industry structure.

I cite this example because much has been said of the need to roll up the pressure pumping sector
across North America shale through aggressive M&A to drive consolidation. In my view, there is another
capital-efficient way to drive consolidation, and that is through technology disruption. We hear from
E&Ps that they are increasingly -- that they increasingly prefer electric frac to conventional fracturing for
environmental, safety and cost reasons. Few years ago, our Completion & Production Solutions segment
began work on our ideal e-frac suite to capitalize on this market opportunity, and we brought it to market
a few weeks ago. It offers reduced emissions and fuel costs for the operator and lowers total cost of
ownership relative to conventional fleets by up to 40% for the pressure pumper. It does this through 2
means. First, it is designed to have a few electrical connections in the industry, a feature that significantly
reduces the need for highly skilled electrical labor at the well site, reduces overall wellsite congestion and
safety risk and reduces cable expenditures. Second, the ideal system is designed with significantly higher
power density than its market competition. It is the only offering today with a 5,000 horsepower pump
designed to fit hand in glove with the best-in-class turbine offerings, resulting in a smaller footprint and
lower engine and transmission expenditures.

Additionally, this transported in 40% fewer truckloads and rigs up faster, particularly with our FracMaxx,
big bore QuickLatch system and FlexConnect frac hose. It requires a smaller footprint and fewer people on
site to operate. Engineered for 13.8 kV, it can accept turbine or gas genset power, both utilizing lease gas
and minimizing flaring or work off-line power. It's truly power agnostic.

Most important, though, is the reduction in total cost of ownership by up to 40% with further
improvements expected from its integrated, condition-based monitoring, which will work with the
predictive analytics we are actively developing. We know pressure pumpers have limited access to capital,
but we also know shale producers are anxious to become more ESG friendly. A shale producer willing
to sign a term contract with a pressure pumper, perhaps as short as only 2 years, could drive our first
purchase order for a fleet. In the meantime, we've executed an agreement with a major U.S. pressure
pumping service provider to test one of our new ideal e-frac pumpers in the field, and we expect to be

testing our blender and support equipment soon as well. Additionally, we are hearing of some clever
entrepreneurs exploring opportunities in the power generation side of the emerging e-frac opportunity.
Stay tuned.

Within our Rig Technology segment, we've discussed our growing installed base of NOVOS operating
systems across both land and offshore rigs, with 72 rigs running at this morning. Operators love it for the
drilling optimization algorithms it provides, but we believe they will love it even more soon. That's because
we expect to commercially introduce a new robotic pipe handling system for land rigs in 2021, one that
operates seamlessly within the NOVOS digital environment. We believe the growing NOVOS installed base
is the digital foundation for the industry's leap forward to automate drilling.

In North America, it used to be that Tier 1 rigs require greater setback, higher top drives, high-pressure
mud systems and walking capability. Now the new definition of Tier 1 rigs also includes digital rig
enhancements like NOVOS, SoftSpeed and KAIZEN, which are driving further efficiency and safety
improvements through artificial intelligence and machine learning. Fully automated slips to slips drilling
has been a vision shared by many for decades. The possibility of removing humans from the well center
greatly reduces safety risk and freeze up rig crews to focus on higher value-added activities. Drilling
automation can raise the performance standards of experienced drilling crews by permitting them to focus
on the big picture rather than on repetitive manual tasks.

But here's the kicker. Our new robotic pipe handling system is very affordable. It's easily retrofittable into
existing land rigs. We understand that capital is limited for drilling contractors these days, but we also
know that E&P operators would strongly prefer a rig that can push-button trip, enabling the retrofit of the
contractors' existing fleet at a very affordable price is a fantastic opportunity that we think will attract a lot
of attention among oil companies.

Rig Technologies is also seeing growing interest in its new PowerBlade power management system, which
cuts diesel consumption and CO2 emissions on offshore floaters. Even though we've just introduced this
new technology, our first customer in the North Sea is already looking at upgrading additional rigs to
improve their competitiveness on ESG metrics in a crowded marketplace.

Let me turn now to our Wellbore Technologies segment and speak to some real-world challenges our
customers face as we all hurdle toward a digital utopia you've all been hearing so much about. Wells
are drilled and completed and sometimes recompleted and then recompleted again, producing data for
decades from many vendors and many sources. The data they generate is subject to limited or no data
quality checks, is produced in multiple protocols with no standards around format. Consequently, oil
and gas producers spend a significant amount of time and money cleaning, aggregating, formatting,
translating and contextualizing data before any actual analysis happens. Furthermore, solutions reliant on
cloud connections introduce lag problems and issues arise when remote communications are broken. And
guess what, the oilfield operates in the remotest of locations, they often lack basic connectivity. Needless
to say, these real-world complexities get in the way of easy real-time decision making. Individual E&P
operators who roll up their sleeves and try to develop their own solutions to these problems frequently
lack sufficient expertise and scale because deployment is limited to their own operations and the cost
of maintenance and upkeep is hard to justify for all but the largest operators. Plus you have this whole
technological obsolescence thing.

Enter Wellbore's new max suite of edge and cloud technology, which we've been quietly developing for
the past 3 years. We are going to the field next month for testing and expect to be commercial in 2021.
Our value proposition is simple, enable our customers to use their own data and run their own businesses
with a uniform version of the truth, both in office and in the field. NOV Max, NOV's new digital ecosystem,
enables them to capture, aggregate, visualize and analyze their data in real-time at high speed on the
edge in their cloud or in our cloud, in their office and at the well site, one version of the truth, both at the
office and the well site in real time.

Like a Bloomberg screen, our vision is to collect disparate data streams and then put them on a single
screen, synced up and formatted and contextualized for easy use by the owner of the data. We are taking
Max to market through Wellbore Technologies 80-year old MD Totco division, the leading provider of rig
instrumentation services with global 24/7 support and boots on the ground throughout the oilfield. MD

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Totco makes sensors, both surface and downhole, which helps avoid garbage in, garbage out problems
and data generation. NOV Max gathers and translates that data and can run customer-owned NOV or
third-party analytics or applications at the well site or remotely while others require middleman, NOV
provides all services and solutions sensor to screen, meaning we don't just connect to the data, we
build the equipment that provides the data With the largest installed base of equipment in the industry,
NOV products were most likely already at the well site and in place to gather data As the market leader
in control systems, we speak machine language and can affect automation at the well site, a primary
means by which customers can drive economic benefit from their data. Max is built on new technology
stack that lives at the edge, out in the field where work is done. This edge technology has to be robust,
secure, connected and manageable at incredible scale. Available technologies just didn't fit the bill. So we
developed Max edge to include military-grade encryption and TLS secure communication, keeping data
and analytics safe. The solution handles 31 inbound industrial calls, including support for 12 kilohertz
waveform vibration data on critical channels and 15 industry standard outbound protocols, including AWS
IoT, Azure IoT hub and Google IoT core.

I'm proud of the NOV engineers, programmers and scientists who are introducing new, better, safer and
more efficient ways of developing and producing oil and gas during the worst quarter in the industry for
more than 75 years. I'm also proud that NOV continues to pursue opportunities in renewable energy,
building our strong position in the offshore wind and geothermal energy space. I said many times before
that we view the transition to a carbon-free future as one of the greatest economic opportunities in human
history. And I think capitalism will produce the solutions required.

However, I want to stress 2 important points that guide our decisions with respect to resource allocation.
The first is that we will remain true to our oil and gas customers. We will continue to bring them new and
better technologies and support their operations despite the popular narrative that the world will soon
abandon oil. We respectfully disagree and recognize that oil continues to lift people out of poverty and
improve all our lives. There are currently more than 1 billion motor vehicles, 39,000 aircraft and billions
of dollars of construction, mining and agricultural equipment around the world, representing tens of
trillions in capital investment. It all becomes worthless overnight without hydrocarbons. While renewable
sources of energy will certainly grow in the mix of the energy pie at the end of the day, oil and natural gas
continues to be the fuels that power the world.

The second point I want to make is that all of our investments in new products and technologies, both
traditional oil and gas as well as renewables, are constrained by responsibility to be good capital stewards.
We only aim at markets where we believe we can carve out a clear, sustainable competitive advantage. In
the long run, fundamentals always prevail.

When this crazy year passes and the economic shutdown fades, the world is going to need a lot more oil
and gas and the world that will need this industry to get back to work. NOV is going to be there, leaner
and meaner than we've ever been to make sure it has what it needs to do so efficiently and safely. The
dedicated creative service-minded NOV employees, for whom we are so very grateful, will prove once
again why they are the best in the world.

With that, let me turn it over to Jose.

Jose A. Bayardo
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Clay. NOV's consolidated revenue decreased $112 million or 7% sequentially to $1.38 billion as
our businesses felt the full effect of the sharp reductions in North American drilling activity that occurred
during Q2 and the continued activity declines in most international markets. EBITDA decreased only $13
million as our relentless focus on reducing structural costs and improving operational efficiencies across
the organization limited decremental margins to only 12%.

During the quarter, we exceeded our $700 million annualized cost savings target. While we've surpassed
our goal, we have a number of cost reduction initiatives that will carry into the next few quarters, and
we will continue to work to identify additional ways in which we can improve profitability and return on
capital for NOV. Our efforts to improve our working capital efficiencies, well we're making great strides in a

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

difficult environment, are part of our ongoing efforts to improve return on capital. Our success in reducing
working capital, along with our capital-light business model, is allowing us to deliver best-in-class cash
flow generation. During the quarter, we delivered another $323 million in cash flow from operations and
$274 million in free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date cash flow from operations and free cash flow
totals to $740 million and $567 million, respectively.

We expect to generate an additional $100 million to $200 million in free cash flow during the fourth
quarter. Our resilient cash flows have enabled us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet while making
meaningful investments in new product development and growth initiatives that will drive future growth
for NOV, including the offerings that Clay just described.

During the third quarter, we successfully completed a tender for $217 million of our senior notes due
December 2022, leaving us with only $183 million remaining outstanding on these notes, which we
expect to pay off with our cash on hand prior to the maturity date. Our next maturity does not occur until
December of 2029.

At September 30, our net debt totaled $339 million, with $1.485 billion in cash and $1.824 billion in debt.

Moving to results from operations and outlook. Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $361 million
of revenue during the third quarter, a decrease of $81 million or 18% sequentially. The decline in revenue
was in line with the sequential decrease in global drilling activity and reflected a full quarter impact of the
sharp reductions in North American drilling activity and continued declines in international markets.

Revenue declined 28% in North America and 12% in international markets, both in line with drilling
activity levels.

Continued progress on cost savings initiatives partially offset the impact of lower volumes and pricing
pressures, limiting decremental margins to 26%. Our ReedHycalog drill business realized a 10% sequential
decrease in revenue but achieved a modest improvement in EBITDA due to cost savings and improved
product mix. U.S. revenues declined 26%, meaningfully outperforming the sequential decline in U.S.
drilling activity levels, a result of industry-leading technology that is allowing the business to capture
market share and help customers set drilling records.

COVID-19 disruptions continued to hamper activity and caused project delays in international markets,
particularly in Middle East and Africa. More recently, we're seeing countries in Latin America and Africa
emerge from lockdowns, activity levels in the Middle East stabilize and North American rig counts increase
off the trough established during Q2, giving us some optimism that we will realize modestly improved
results for the business in the fourth quarter.

Revenues in our downhole business unit fell sharply during Q3 as customers halted orders for drilling
tools while they worked down existing inventories to levels better aligned with projected drilling activity.
As activity begins to stabilize in international markets and improve in North America, we expect the
destocking of these consumable products will be completed in relatively short order, resulting in a
stabilization of this business unit's results in the fourth quarter.

Our Grant Prideco drill pipe business also experienced a sharp decrease in revenues, a result of 2 straight
quarters of limited order intake. A higher mix of larger diameter pipe deliveries and cost savings initiatives
helped to limit decremental EBITDA margins. It will take time to alleviate the overhang of drill pipe from
recently stacked rigs around the globe. However, we believe the tightening supply of drill pipe that we
saw as recently as January of this year will shorten the time frame typically required to reestablish market
equilibrium.

While we are likely still a few quarters away from a strong inflection in demand, we are beginning to see
pandemic-delayed international projects resume, additional opportunities for drill pipe risers emerge
and drill pipe brokers and rental companies in the U.S. reengage, resulting in orders booked so far in Q4
already equaling half our Q3 total.

Our Tuboscope business experienced a revenue decline of approximately 20%. The unit's U.S. and Eastern
Hemisphere operations experienced particularly sharp declines in revenue as the falloff in oilfield activity

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

and COVID-19-related shutdowns resulted in customers having more than ample quantities of finished
tubulars in their possession to carry them through the quarter. With slowly improving activity levels in
North America and fewer pandemic-related restrictions, we expect our Tuboscope operations will realize
slight improvement in the fourth quarter.

Our MD Totco business unit saw a 14% sequential decrease in revenue due to the continued activity
declines in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere, which were only partially offset by improvements
in Latin America.

Our KAIZEN intelligent drilling optimizer, which employs artificial intelligence to help mitigate drilling
dysfunction and improve performance, continues to be adopted by key customers in the North American
market and now has 2 technical trials with large NOCs scheduled for this quarter.

As Clay mentioned, MD Totco's technology portfolio is rapidly evolving, and we expect to see significant
market penetration by several of these products in the near future.

Our WellSite Services business unit experienced a high single-digit sequential revenue decline in the third
quarter. Increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and the North Sea, along with increased screen
sales in the Middle East, partially offset sharp declines in Africa and the North American land market.
More recently, business unit has nabbed some sizable wins in international markets including an order
for 60 Brandt shakers to upgrade 15 jackup rigs in Asia and a contract for our proprietary hot oil thermal
desorption equipment to treat drilling waste in Guyana.

These awards, along with improving activity levels in North America, should result in improved results
during the fourth quarter.

As we've said many times in the past, our Wellbore Technologies segment is the most sensitive to real-
time changes in global drilling activity and also carries the highest operating leverage of our 3 segments.
Its leadership team has moved swiftly to rightsize the organization and stabilized results in unprecedented
market conditions. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues for our Wellbore Technologies segment to
improve 1% to 3% sequentially, with incremental margins in the 30% range.

Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $601 million of revenue in the third quarter,
a decrease of $10 million or 2% sequentially. Strong execution on international and offshore project
backlogs mostly offset limited demand for our shorter-cycle products and aftermarket parts and services.
EBITDA declined $5 million to $63 million or 10.5% of sales. Orders for the segment fell 14% to $169
million as the lockdowns and ongoing uncertainty associated with a pandemic caused customers to defer
decisions on new projects. Encouragingly, we have seen a sharp increase in activity around pre-FEED
studies and general tendering activity in the last few weeks. We are cautiously optimistic that order intake
bottomed in Q3 and believe the actions we are seeing bode well for more meaningful improvements in
2021.

Our Fiber Glass Systems business unit achieved a small sequential increase in revenue. Sizable deliveries
of large diameter, high-pressure pipe in the Middle East and continued solid performance from our fuel
handling business more than offset lower revenue from our marine customers who are postponing
deliveries of scrubber systems. The global pandemic has caused an unexpected glut of middle distillates,
usually processed into jet fuel to be used in the production of inexpensive, very low-sulfur fuel oil,
making marine scrubbing systems and uneconomic investment for our customers until the historical price
spread between very low sulfur and high-sulfur fuel oil returns. New orders from our Fiber Glass Systems
business have not been sufficient to offset large recent shipments, leading us to expect a sequential falloff
in Q4 revenues.

Our Process and Flow Technologies business unit posted a 10% sequential increase in revenue due to
strong project execution on offshore production-related backlog and due to the easing of COVID-19-
related lockdowns, which allowed our production and midstream operations to deliver delayed shipments
of reciprocating pumps and chokes into Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. While orders for our
Process and Flow Technologies business remained soft in Q3, a still solid backlog in the unit's APL turret
mooring and Wellstream Processing operations should allow for additional growth in Q4. More importantly,

9

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

pre-FEED studies and tendering activity have picked up, particularly for our APL operation. We believe our
customers are preparing to get back to work on large projects in 2021 and expect orders to start to pick
up modestly to support their plans.

Our Subsea flexible pipe and XL Systems businesses each experienced sequential revenue declines
as 3 straight quarters of customers pushing orders to the right began to affect operating results. We
expect both businesses to see additional revenue declines in the fourth quarter, but tendering activity has
improved modestly, giving us some optimism that bookings could improve in Q4.

Our Intervention & Stimulation Equipment business saw a 9% sequential decline in revenue. Despite the
uptick in North American and completion-related activity, the market remains sufficiently oversupplied,
which has resulted in limited demand for new equipment and customers deferring the purchase of new
spare parts by cannibalizing idle assets. As expected, sales of most consumables took another step down
in Q3. However, we continue to realize increasing market adoption of our FlexConnect frac hose and
demand from new coiled tubing strings improved more than 50% from the record low we experienced in
Q2. More recently, we've seen a pickup in demand for coiled tubing equipment aftermarket service and
repair work. And we continue to engage in a growing number of discussions with international customers
regarding pressure pumping, coiled tubing and wireline equipment, driven by increasing demand from
multistage fracture stimulation services in markets outside North America.

For the fourth quarter of 2020, we anticipate revenue from our Completion & Production Solutions
segment will decline 6% to 8%, with EBITDA margins decreasing between 200 and 400 basis points as a
result of less favorable revenue mix and increasing pricing pressures.

Our Rig Technologies segment generated revenues of $449 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $27
million or 6% sequentially. Third quarter revenues reflect a mid-single-digit sequential decrease in revenue
from capital equipment and a 3% sequential decline in the segment's aftermarket sales. The slowing rate
of revenue declines provided better visibility into the impact of the segment's efforts to reduce costs and
improve operational efficiencies we're having on results, with EBITDA improving $14 million to $28 million,
or 6.2% of sales.

Pandemic-related logistical challenges remain as the virus continues to pop up in clusters around the globe
and governments react with shutdowns and travel restrictions, but we are learning to mitigate the extra
cost and disruptions to our operations and are doing everything we can to support our customers where
they need us.

The impact of the economic turmoil caused by COVID-19 is perhaps most apparent in the segment's Q3
bookings, already burdened by stretched balance sheets, several of our larger offshore customers made
the difficult decision to enter the restructuring process during the quarter, which put a stop to new orders.
Drilling contractors in general are doing all they can to preserve cash in this difficult market and have
reduced spending accordingly. Segment realized a 23% sequential decline in capital equipment bookings,
resulting in $57 million of orders and a book-to-bill of only 29%.

Despite the tremendous stress our customers are under and the amount of idle drilling equipment that
exists around the world today, we continue to believe that our industry-leading franchise is attractively
positioned for the future as operators continue to demand use of better technologies to drive efficiencies
in their drilling operations. Even as we sit here today in an environment with record low drilling activity
levels and only 6 months removed from negative oil prices, we're having dialogue with multiple customers
around the world who still want to upgrade the capabilities of their drilling equipment. We still see demand
for new high-spec land drilling rigs in the Middle East and in Latin America. We've had steady demand
from new top drives in multiple markets in Asia, and we've recently booked orders from a U.S. drilling
contractor to upgrade several of its stand transfer vehicles, iron roughnecks and top drives.

This need to continuously upgrade capabilities also exist in offshore markets. Operators are demanding the
latest technologies as they look to reduce their environmental footprint, think our PowerBlade Systems.
And as they seek bigger prizes found in more challenging environments, think NOV's, 20,000 psi BOP
stack, which recently won the World Oils award for best drilling technology.

Even with the unprecedented market challenges on our offshore -- our offshore customers are facing,
they're still talking to us about major upgrades for rigs that will be reactivated in the not-too-distant
future. Additionally, the segment's renewable business is beginning to see more wind turbine installation
vessel projects come to fruition. As a reminder, we expect approximately a dozen of these vessels will be
ordered over the next couple of years, and we remain confident in our ability to win our fair share of the
project awards.

While a firm recovery in the market for our traditional capital equipment business remains ways off, we
believe Q3 marked the bottom for orders. And based on discussions with customers, we currently expect
to achieve a book-to-bill of around 100% for the segment during the fourth quarter. We also expect Rig
Technologies financial results to improve slightly compared to Q3, with revenue increasing between 1% to
3% and incremental margins in the mid-20% range.
With that, we'll now open the call up to questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons.

William Andrew Herbert
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Jose, so just in the category of dreaming here a little bit and contemplating life kind of returning to a
semblance of normalcy. So OPEC spare capacity normalizes back to kind of the historic range, our lives
normalize, demand is much closer on a global basis to pre-pandemic levels and this converging with the
austerity narrative of E&P leads to a reinvestment cycle and your clients taking more steps forwards and
backwards. Let's just call this for grants at 2022 outcome. And I'm just curious, given how much inventory
you've drawn down over the past few quarters, what would be your working capital intensity responding to
that kind of recovery narrative?

And the reason I ask the question is because, at least on my numbers, your free cash flow yields, call it,
on a semblance of mid-cycle are just huge, assuming that working capital is reasonably contained. So I
think kind of understanding the working capital intensity from this point forward is key.

Jose A. Bayardo
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. That's a really good and observant question, Bill. And yes. As you know, the organization has been
just relentlessly focused in terms of improving the capital efficiency overall with a big part of that focus
being on reducing our working capital intensity, again, across the board. And so we've made really good
headway over the last year or so in terms of bringing down that working capital intensity. But we still have
quite a ways to go on that front, right?

So you look at this last quarter, roughly somewhere between 36% and 38% working capital as a
percentage of the revenue run rate. We've been significantly lower than that in the past and certainly
expect to get significantly lower than that level. Obviously, we've had a lot of headwinds in terms of
bringing that level lower with its -- with as Clay described, the worst quarter from a top line perspective,
really the oilfield has seen in really maybe ever.

But the other part of what's occurring is big transition in terms of our revenue streams, big shift occurring
from revenue coming from North America to now becoming much more predominantly weighted on the
international markets. This last quarter, only 26% of our revenue came from North America. And as you
know, if you look at what we do in international markets, much longer cycle times in terms of the time
period in which inventory resides in our locations and also the average collection time period takes a little
bit longer. But we're getting better at all facets of managing inventory and expect all of our metrics to
continue moving in the proper direction over the course of the next year or 2. So long way of saying that
even though with the recovery, intuitively, you have a bigger build in working capital to take care of that
business. I don't think it would -- it's not just a matter of keeping the metrics flat and taking that forward.
The metrics will improve, mitigating the amount of working capital that we need to build in the future.

William Andrew Herbert
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

So it's not just kind of better management of working capital, but it's also the revenue mix shift to
international, where the inventory is stickier and thus the headroom for growth that you have with regard
to your international ops is much more generous? Is that fair?

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

I guess what I'd say is that just we will get better than we have been. Historically, international has been
more challenging from a working capital management standpoint. And there's more opportunity for us to
improve those working capital metrics.

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

I think more around the payment terms that we typically get internationally. Impacting that. But going
back on this question, Bill, and it is a great question. What I would really underscore is that this is -- our
folks have just gotten a lot better at it. And it's the muscle memory, I think, that they've learned around
working capital management through this downturn. And you've seen the results, we just get better and
better. And that's the key thing. This is -- it's partly math, but it's -- a lot of it is culture, too.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc.

Thomas Allen Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I wanted to start on the cost out initiatives. It sounds like you've now exceeded the $700 million run
rate target in advance of year-end, but that there could also be some additional opportunities next year.
Understanding that you still need to go through the full planning process, I would ask, nonetheless, can
you give us any insight on what buckets of cost you may be able to attack going forward? And is there any
way to frame up the magnitude of that opportunity?

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Fair question, Tommy. And so yes, as you pointed out and we touched on in the prepared comments,
we're really pleased, not only with improvement in working capital management, but kind of goes hand
in glove with the efforts that we're undertaking across the organization just to get leaner, meaner, more
efficient and just much better in terms of how we manage the business. And that's how we think about the
cost savings initiatives, which, as you know, were all structural cost savings that we're pushing through
the organization.

Since we started this process really in Q1 of 2019, we've continued to find more opportunities and reach
our targets more quickly than we generally anticipate, and that also took place this quarter really going
well beyond our expectations and hitting the full year-end target.

So as we sit here today, there are still more of those initiatives that are flowing through the system that
will flow in, in Q4 and also through the first few quarters of 2021. And as you've astutely observed, this is
a time period in which we go into our annual planning process, and that process is pretty intensive. And
we tend to poke and prod a lot of different areas within the organization. And we inevitably expect to find
additional opportunities to continue to refine and get more efficient as an organization.

So we're not prepared at this time to put new numbers out there, but we're optimistic that there is
more to get. And we will continue to do our part to get the operation properly sized with the market
environment that we see over the coming quarters and years.

Thomas Allen Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Fair enough. Will stay tuned. Shifting to capital allocation and portfolio. Maybe a question for Clay. We've
started to see some M&A now that the energy markets have stabilized, albeit at low levels. And a lot of
folks participating today as well as yourselves, have no doubt, noted some peers who had divested some
noncore low-margin platforms. So any update on likelihood of whether we might see something similar
from you guys? And then maybe as a nonmutually exclusive alternative, what's the level of appetite as a
potential buyer of assets in this environment?

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, as we mentioned, we continue to prune our own portfolio, and we've made a number of adjustments
to that around businesses that weren't earning adequate returns and didn't and maybe perhaps lack the
path to that we could see clearly to get to adequate returns. And so like others, we're doing that on the
one hand.

On the other hand, we've got a long and rich history of being an acquirer in this space. We've continued
to look at opportunities sort of influencing our view of those, though, is, number one, we clearly need
to be a better owner. We clearly need to see a way in which we can carve out competitive advantage in
those opportunities. Number two, we recognize that the cost of capital in traditional oil and gas business
has been rising and asset value should be falling concurrent with that. And so we've been very disciplined
on kind of our approach to valuations. And -- but what our emphasis has been over the last couple of
years as we sort of move through this more challenging period has been probably a little more around
organic technology development. So the products that I talked about earlier, several of the things that
are underway. What we find is that that's in a lot of ways, is the most capital-efficient way to carve out
competitive advantages to build on our franchises, build on our channels to market, our global presence,
bring better technology to both our traditional oil and gas customers as well as the renewable space.

And so I think that's sort of -- if you look back, that's been our track record in recent quarters.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Clay, I wanted to maybe follow-up a little bit more in the context of your commentary around developing
some of the new e-frac technology. And you've made a great analogy about how the U.S. land rig market
transition from mechanical rigs to AC rigs, took like a 10-year process for that to really gain full traction.
As you kind of look forward from where we are now in the difficult market environment that a lot of these
companies that participate in frac face, challenging cap structures and challenge to generate free cash
flow. What's your thought process on how long this transition from traditional frac to e-frac may take?

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, a lot of it depends on the appetite by the E&P customers of the frac companies. I think given the
more challenging economic environment that we are in now versus kind of where we were in 2005, 2006
means that there's going to have to be more pull by the oil companies on this technology. And that's going
to be sort of the catalyst, I think, that makes it happen.

I think if the E&P companies continue to move up the curve on being more demanding around reducing
their ESG impact to their frac operations that can accelerate the adoption of the technology. The pressure
pumpers will figure out a way to find the capital and if those purchase orders are backed by some sort of
term structure where the pressure pumpers can see their way clear to pay back, I think the investments
can be made. And so that's probably what's required. The second sort of wildcard in all of this, so is how
the power provision ecosystem sorts itself out. There's options now in terms of how to power these frac
jobs using turbines on location or using gas-powered gensets on location or using line power. And so
one of the cornerstones of our development, and I think I mentioned this earlier, is that it's really power
agnostic, at 13.8 kV, it accepts all of the above. And so we've tried to design as much flexibility as we can
with respect to the power question.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's great. And Clay, you kind of teased that a little bit earlier about the prospect of maybe a 2-year
contract. So I assume when you talk about things on a call like this, you have some additional insights

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

from conversations with varying parties. So do you think that's something that could potentially come
out here before year-end? Is it more likely sometime in 2021 before you can see a frac company get a
contract for any fleet?

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

Look, there's a lot of interest in this technology. We've talked to a number of customers about it. We're
excited about it on the one hand. On the other hand, things are pretty tough out there, Kurt, and very
fluid. And so time will tell. But what I'm most pleased about is the fact that we've come to market with
a really tightly integrated, thoughtful system that's a big leap forward on reducing the ESG impact of
fracking operations for shale operators, which is really something the market wants. And so I think in the
long run, this is going to be a very important development for the E&P companies. Can't tell you sort of
precisely which quarter that starts to really roll out in a big way. But again, I want to stress a high level of
interest from pressure pumpers in this.

Operator

Our next question comes from George O'Leary with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.

George Michael O'Leary
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

The global technology side, just given that can be the fastest cycle portion of your business, it's a business
where you've taken a lot of costs out of the equation of late, and you can see that bearing fruit in the
margins and the incremental, decremental margin performance on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

Can you just remind us -- I know you said 26% overall revenue came from North America? Remind us
kind of the mix of that business, in particular, the revenue mix in North America versus international?
And then any green shoots you guys are seeing by product line? And whether that is more just the North
America situation at this point? Or if there are any green shoots on the international front as well?

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

No, the mix is -- in the third quarter, was 38% North America, 62% international for Wellbore
Technologies. So in keeping with NOV overall, it's a greater share of the mix is international.

With respect to green shoots, yes, we -- we're 40, 45 rigs off of bottom in North America from August.
And so that's helpful. We're hearing stories of operators that are getting real granular on putting rigs
back to work to get up to a maintenance level in North America. So that's going the right way. But the
green shoots aren't limited to North America. As we mentioned a couple of times earlier, we think the
international markets are stabilizing. And after some pretty good-sized falls in Q3 and then we're hearing
about green shoots there as well.

So for instance, a major operator in the Vaca Muerta in Argentina is picking up rigs going back to work.
Greater activity outlook in Colombia. In the Middle East coming off bottom. There's a couple of programs
that we expect to get kicked off on the land side.

Offshore, I know of 3 IOCs that plan to get a little bit busier in West Africa, Brazil, Guyana. We're hearing
about more drilling activity that's likely coming up there. And then in the North Sea as well, a lot -- a
little greater level of activity perhaps helped by the temporary tax relief that the Norwegian government
put in place. And so there are green shoots out there. I don't want to overstate them. They're still a
very challenging market. You've got oil prices kind of range bound at the $40 range. An uncertain sort of
trajectory from here around continued pandemic lockdown, demand for oil still remains a big wild card.
And so a lot of uncertainty out there. But nevertheless, what investors may not fully grasp is that even in
a declining production environment, there's still some level of work that needs to happen in the oil field,
drilling, completion, recompletion, to maintain these assets and to be good stewards of the resource.
And so I think the industry -- the whole industry felt like it went into a defensive bunker in Q3, and it's

15

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

emerging out of that and working its way back towards a little higher level of sort of just good stewardship
of their resources, which requires a little more activity.

And keeping with prior downturns, North America is usually the first to go down and the first to start to
bounce back. And then international markets, which have longer-term projects, that are a little more
dominated by NOCs, are a little bit slower. And so we we're hopeful that international has stabilized, and
now we'll start to see it turn the corner, but look, time will tell.

George Michael O'Leary
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's very helpful. And then wind is something we're getting incremental questions about with respect
to a number of services companies, but you all, in particular, pop up as we chat with clients. And just
wondering if there's any way to frame the kind of market potential there over some medium-term time
rise in the next 12 to 24 months and the potential size of kit that NOV could win per vessel? Just any way
to think about that market, size of that market would be incredibly helpful.

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. George, I think you asked about wind. I think I heard you say about offshore wind.

George Michael O'Leary
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes, yes, on the marine investment side. Yes.

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Sure. Sure. So yes, we're very excited about this. And I think we said a quarter or 2 ago, I think a
dozen new installation vessels for the offshore is a reasonable outlook for the next few years. We can
win up to $70 million worth of kit on the larger vessels. And the vessels are getting larger. Just by way
of background, what's going on in that space is that taller towers are more capital efficient. They access
higher elevations, the wind blows steadier and harder at higher elevations. And so as the towers get taller,
the owners of these projects get better returns. And so in recognition of that, GE, which is a major turbine
provider, is coming out with a new 12-megawatt tower, I think, in 2022 and then Siemens Gamesa is
coming out with a 14-megawatt tower in 2024. And these things are enormous. There are 500 feet at the
hub, which is the size of a 50-story building and 700 tons. And you can imagine the kind of equipment
that's required to put a 50-story building out in the middle of the ocean. It's pretty massive. And the world
just doesn't have a fleet to do that. And so we're very pleased with the position that we are in as a leading
provider of offshore wind turbine installation equipment and look forward to continuing to participate in
that market going forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.

Sean Christopher Meakim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Clay, you all have been really focused on digital initiatives. You're enabling your hardware to work
smarter, work better. One of the silver linings of the pandemic is this acceleration of customer focus
and adoption of digital practices, both E&Ps and services. Could you talk a little bit about your strategy
regarding value capture versus transfer? So in other words, how you expect to capture more of the value
versus how much needs to be shared with customers to drive more volumes and share?

I imagine this could vary quite a bit across product lines, but trying to get a sense of how you think about
that key piece of creating value for NOV?

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

It's a great question. Look, nobody buys anything unless it's a win-win solution, right? And so our
customers have to see value in whatever we're providing at the price that we're charging. That's very clear
to us. And so we work very closely with our customers to understand that, but to make sure that we really
are adding value to what they're doing. And so that was a big part of our NOVOS development as part of
the reason we've had such great acceptance of the NOVOS operating system across the rig fleet globally.
We'll hear more recently with the shutdown and all the travel restrictions, we're seeing a lot of demand
for our tracker vision system, which uses augmented reality to -- and real-time communications with our
subject matter experts around the world to enable our customers to do installation of equipment, repair of
equipment, a commissioning of equipment.

And so the COVID-pandemic shutdown has really accelerated demand for that technology on the Max
suite of digital projects -- products that I described earlier. Likewise, that really started with some heart-
to-heart conversations with oil and gas companies around what -- where NOV could help them. But with
respect to pricing, we -- as we always do, need this to be a win-win. NOV shareholders need to benefit
from the investments that we're making and the really, really creative ideas that our employees come up
within these areas and as well, the customers who use these products to prove their own operations. And
so we always look for a fair split of that economic rent.

Sean Christopher Meakim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I appreciate that. And I appreciate the feedback on offshore wind, too. I thought that was helpful. There
are also other areas that have gotten a lot of attention outside of oil and gas or, particularly after the EUs
transition announcement this summer, hydrogen, in particular, has gotten a lot of attention. You guys
are always in the market looking for M&A opportunities. Are you able to maybe just give us a little more
view into how you see these other alternative energy channels beyond offshore wind? And where you see
pathways that could make sense for NOV versus those that are more difficult to bridge from your current
portfolio to these new opportunities?

Clay C. Williams
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, great question, Sean. I'll start with cost of capital. Earlier, I mentioned cost of capital appears to be
rising for oil and gas companies. In contrast, on the renewable side, cost of capital is plummeting. And
there's a lot of capital chasing opportunities in that space. We've looked at M&A. We've done some small
investments here and there. More sort of rifle shot things. We're continuing to look for opportunities there.
But it's a little more crowded landscape.

So in view of that, our approach, and this kind of fits with what I was saying earlier, our approach has
been more around home growing organic development and building on the strengths that our organization
have in the renewable space. And so -- which are considerable. I mean, I don't know another company on
the planet with smarter, more creative, more talented engineers and scientists, and we try to just get out
of their way and let them think through ideas and opportunities. And the ones that carry a view towards
competitive advantage, those are the things that we're funding. And so yes, we're looking in all areas.

With respect to hydrogen, we're looking at a couple of things. But other areas in the renewable frontier
at the moment, probably had a little better fit to our skill set. And I think have a clearer path for the
creation of competitive advantage. But I'll repeat what I said in the -- at the beginning in my prepared
remarks is that we've got to be good capital stewards through all of this. The funding, the execution of
these business plans need to earn a financial return. And that really only remains for the long haul when
you have competitive advantage. And so that constrains all that we do.

Operator

And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to the
speakers for any closing remarks.
