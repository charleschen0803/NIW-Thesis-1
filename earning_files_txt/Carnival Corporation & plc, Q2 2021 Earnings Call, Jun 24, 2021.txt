CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

Presentation

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our business update conference call. I am Arnold Donald,
President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Today, I'm joined telephonically by our Chairman, Micky
Arison; as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President,
Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us this morning.

Now before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I
must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.

Excitedly, we are on a path to return the full fleet operations, and we are very happy to continue to
welcome our loyal guests back on board as well as to welcome new guests. And we're working diligently
to have offerings that serve all of our guests in a way that is compliant in the home ports and destinations
we touch while serving the best interest of public health.

So far, we've announced the resumption of operations for 42 ships across 8 of our 9 brands by fiscal year-
end, and that represents over half of our fleet capacity returning to guest cruise operations. And this
includes what we expect to be a very successful relaunching of cruising in the U.K. later this week with
P&O Cruises Britannia; and sailing, once again, from the United States on Carnival Horizon over the fourth
of July. In fact, Carnival Horizon will be joined by 9 other ships restarting in the United States by the end
of August.

We're evaluating additional deployment options throughout the fall and winter period with a focus on
maximizing future cash flow while delivering a great guest experience in a way that, of course, serves
the best interest of public health. Again, our highest responsibility and therefore, our top priority is
always compliance, environmental protection and the health, safety and well-being of our guests, of the
people and the communities we touch and serve and, of course, our Carnival family, our team members
shipboard and shoreside.

We continue to work toward resuming operations also in Australia and Asia. And while we can't predict
the pace of the ramp-up to full fleet operations, we continue to expect full operations well before our
important summer season next year.

In the near term, we will be impacted by physical distancing requirements on a portion of our cruises,
which limits our historically high occupancy levels. And also near term, we'll be impacted by restricted
deployment options as not all of the 700 ports we visit are receiving guests just yet. As more people
receive vaccine treatment, continue to advance and as mitigation of the spread of the virus continues,
current restrictions, of course, will also evolve, and we're confident we will eventually be able to sail
without these restrictions.

Throughout this call, we have been proactively managing to resume operations as an even stronger
operating company. Our strategic decision to accelerate the exit of 19 ships has lowered our capacity
growth to roughly 2.5% compounded annually from 2019 through 2025. That's down from 4.5% pre-
COVID. Moreover, we have opportunistically rebalanced our portfolio through the ship access as well as
the ship transfer any modifications to our new build schedule. The combination of which will transfer 8,000
berths from our Continental European brands to America's favorite cruise line, Carnival Cruise Line, to
optimize the current environment, maximize cash generation and improve our return on invested capital.

While overall fleet capacity growth is constrained, we will benefit from an exciting roster of new ships
spread across our brands to capitalize on the pent-up demand and drive even more enthusiasm,
excitement and demand around our restart plans. Nearly every brand will still have a new ship welcoming
guests for the first time, beginning with our namesake brand, Carnival, introducing the new Mardi Gras.
Now it's no small task to successfully address the challenge of honoring the original Mardi Gras. The ship

that began the advent of our corporation and has been said, the advent of the a modern-day cruising, but
the new Mardi Gras does just that.

Recently, featured on Good Morning America, Mardi Gras has many features, including the first ever
rollercoaster at sea, BOLT. And trust me, I know from personal experience, it is indeed a thrill to ride.

Premium brands, Holland America. We introduced the new Rotterdam, sister ship to the very successful
Koningsdam and Nieuw Statendam. Princess will welcome guests aboard another new MedallionClass ship,
Enchanted Princess. And ultra luxury brand Seabourn will welcome Seabourn Venture with its world-class
expedition team and spectacular 360-degree view submarine.

For the U.K., we enjoyed a phenomenal virtual naming ceremony for Iona. Iona's inaugural sailing will be
August 7. For Germany, we will introduce LNG-powered AIDAcosma, sister to the also highly successful
AIDAnova. And for Southern Europe, Costa Firenze, and LNG-powered Costa Toscana will replace the exit
of several less efficient ships.

We enjoy our structural benefit to revenue from these exciting new shifts due to the richer mix of
premium-priced balcony cabins, which will increase 6 percentage points to 55% of our fleet in 2023.
And we will achieve a further structural benefit to unit costs as we introduce these new larger, more
efficient ships, coupled with the 19 ships leaving the fleet, which were among our lease position. Again,
the combination of which will generate a 4% reduction in ship level unit costs and a 3% reduction in unit
fuel consumption going forward, enabling us to deliver more revenue to the bottom line.

Moreover, we've continued to find efficiencies across our existing fleet to reduce our costs further as
well as planning for streamlined shoreside operations as we ramp back up to full fleet operations. Our
advertising efforts continue to evolve with heavy utilization of direct mail and other lower-cost channels
such as digital and public relations-driven earned media as compared to higher cost traditional channels.
In fact, we have outstanding public relations opportunities coming up such as the 50-year anniversary for
both our namesake brand, Carnival Cruise Line and the origin of our corporation.

Also, we celebrated the 25th anniversary for our AIDA brand. AIDA initiated an exclusive cooperation
with Germany's #1 newspaper in conjunction with the jubilee and their return to service. The [ 3 states ]
went viral creating continuous moves and onboard content that captured front page news, both print and
online. Of course, we always leveraged the excitement of our new builds to draw media attention. So
just a couple of weeks ago, the arrival of Mardi Gras into the U.S. and Port Canaveral attracted extensive
media attention. And just last month, our virtual naming ceremony that I mentioned earlier with P&O U.K.
at Iona captured record-breaking media, receiving billions of media pressures, far exceeding the reach of
any prior U.K. naming event.

Meanwhile, despite our minimal advertising spend, we continue to experience an acceleration in booking
trends globally, including capturing significant latent demand for our new sailings opening this summer.
The strong initial demand has affirmed confidence in our future and indicates a potential for pricing
strength over time. Also, we see the potential for improved EBITDA in 2023 compared to 2019, driven
primarily by the revenue growth from the introduction of new ships, along with the potential for a higher
revenue yield given pent-up demand and the benefit of a richer mix of premium cabins, coupled with
structurally lower costs from the replacement of smaller, less efficient vessels with larger, more efficient
vessels.

And at the same time, we are working aggressively to lower interest costs. I want to acknowledge here
David Bernstein and our entire finance team for their very successful efforts in helping us to manage the
balance sheet. As we said in our press release this morning, the company successfully refinanced a $2.8
billion term loan and an annual future interest savings of over $120 million. And this is the first of many
opportunistically finances that we expect to undertake.

Also importantly, we've continued to make advancements in our sustainability efforts. In fact, earlier
this week, we published our 2030 sustainability goals and our 2050 sustainability aspirations, which
you can find in the press release issued earlier this week and online at our sustainability website,
www.carnivalsustainability.com. A key focus of those sustainability efforts is our continued emphasis on

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

the important issue of carbon emission reduction. And as we previously shared, our absolute level of
carbon emissions peaked in 2011. That's despite over 20% capacity growth since that time. And it will
remain below those levels as we capitalize on our industry-leading efforts to develop and roll out new
technologies.

This includes examples such as shore power. Over 40% of our fleet is capable of plugging in while in
port, and liquefied natural gas. We have 11 LNG ships either currently in the fleet or under construction,
which will power nearly 20% of our total fleet capacity by 2025. In addition, 77 of our ships are fitted
with advanced air quality systems, which benefit our overall emissions profile, and we will continue to
aggressively explore new technologies as we work towards net zero emissions over time.

During this [ cause ], we have made continuous improvements in other environmental, social and
governance areas. We consider food waste another important place to focus our efforts. Food production,
much of which is wasted, is among the largest contributors to global warming. Now we've taken measures
to dramatically reduce our per person food waste and have made good progress toward our initial goal of
reducing our food waste by 30% by 2022. Among many efforts to honor our commitment to reduce our
impact on the environment, we are installing food waste digesters onboard our fleet where needed, and
these units will help to mitigate the risk of any nonfood waste discharge.

And we are honoring our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Now we already have a diverse workforce
with our crew hailing from nearly 150 countries. In addition, half of our operating companies are led by
women executives. And we've been recognized by Forbes as America's Best Large Employers as well as
America's Best Employers for Diversity and America's Best Employers for Women. We were named the
Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award winner in 2021, recognizing the company as one of the best places to
work, but we are still striving for diversity at all levels and in all areas of our greater enterprise.

Therefore, we are working proactively to engineer diversity through our recruiting and development
efforts, and we're also striving for greater inclusion, where every employee feels they have the opportunity
to make the contribution they want to, to be recognized or rewarded for those contributions and to realize
their individual career aspirations.

Agility has been a key strength over the last 15 months. We expect the environment to remain dynamic
as we roll out our fleet while continuing to adapt to an ever-changing situation. So we're working
aggressively to return our fleet again to operations as quickly as practical while still serving the best
interest of public health. With the aggressive actions we've already taken, optimizing our portfolio and
reducing capacity, we are well positioned to capitalize on pent-up demand and to emerge a leaner, more
efficient company, reinforcing our global industry-leading position. We have secured sufficient liquidity to
see us move to full operations. And once we return to full operations, our cash flow will be the primary
driver to return to investment-grade credit over time, creating greater shareholder value.

Throughout these challenging times, we have received overwhelming support. So once again, thank
you to our valued guests. Thank you to our travel agent partners. Thank you to the port communities
who are continuing to work with us to prepare for a successful restart around the world. Thank you to
the governments and health agencies in numerous countries and states who have partnered with us
to vaccinate so many of our thousands and thousands of crew members. Thank you to our other many
stakeholders for their ongoing support. Thank you to the dedicated members of our Carnival family,
shipboard and shoreside, who have worked tirelessly to get us to this turning point in our global restart
plan. And of course, thank you to our lenders and investors for their continued confidence in us and in our
future. We can't wait to welcome everyone back on board.

With that, I will turn the call over to David.

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you, Arnold. I'll start today with an update on booking trends. Then I'll provide our monthly average
cash burn rate along with a summary of our second quarter cash flows and then finish up with some
insights into our financial position.

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

Turning to booking trends. Our booking volumes have been very strong given the circumstances and
are clearly improving. Volumes for all future cruises during the second quarter 2021 were 45% ahead of
booking volumes during the first quarter. The increase was driven by both close-in bookings associated
with the recent restart announcement as well as strong booking volumes for 2022. This is a clear
demonstration of the pent-up demand for cruises as well as the long-term potential for the market. Just
as positive, our cumulative advanced book position for the full year 2022 is ahead of a very strong 2019,
which was at the high end of the historical range.

I would like to point out that our booking volumes and booked positions are very encouraging, given
that they were achieved with minimal advertising and promotional activity. Pricing on our full year 2022
book position is higher than pricing on bookings at the same time for 2019 sailings driven in part by the
bundled pricing strategy for a number of our brands, but excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise
credits, or more commonly known as FCCs. This is a great achievement given pricing on bookings for 2019
sailings is a tough comparison as it was a high watermark for historical yield.

Over the past year or so, we have offered and our guests have chosen more and more bundled package
options. In the end, we will see the benefit of these bundled packages in onboard and other revenue. I
just want to remind everyone that due to the pause in guest cruise operations, the company's current
booking trends are being compared to booking trends for 2019 sailings and not the prior year.

Now let's look at our monthly average cash burn rate. For the first half of 2021, our cash burn rate was
$500 million per month, which was better than the previous forecast of $550 million. The improvement
was mainly due to the timing of cash received from ship sales just before the end of the second quarter
and some other small working capital changes.

During the third quarter, we are forecasting positive cash flow from the 27 ships that will have guest cruise
operations during the quarter. However, keep in mind that many of those ships do not begin operations
until late in the quarter. As a result, the available lower berth days, or ALBDs as they are more commonly
called for the third quarter, will only be $3.8 million. However, as we have previously discussed, not all
these ALBDs will be sold for our third quarter cruises. Despite the forecasted positive cash flow from guest
cruise operations, we are anticipating an increase in the third quarter monthly cash burn rate versus the
first half of 2021 because of several good news positive factors.

First, restart expenses are accelerating as we have announced 42 ships will be in guest cruise operations
by November 30, our fiscal year-end. Second, capital expenditures will be higher driven by the restart.
And third, we have a number of progress payments on future new builds, which are timed to be paid
during the third quarter. All of these expenditures have been anticipated, and given the announced
restarts, many of them are now occurring in the third quarter.

Because of the difficulty in projecting the timing between the quarters of all the restart expenses and
capital expenditures as well as the exact amount of revenue associated with third quarter guest cruise
operations as a result of the atypical short booking window, given that these cruises were announced so
close to departure, we will not be providing a forecast of the third quarter monthly average cash burn rate.

For those of you who are trying to model our future results, don't forget that margins on the third quarter
cruises will be less than our normal margin given the lower level of occupancy that is anticipated during
the third quarter. However, with $9.3 billion of cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet, we
believe we have enough liquidity to get us back to full guest cruise operations in the spring of 2022.

Next, I'll provide a summary of our second quarter cash flows. During the second quarter, our total cash
burn was $1.5 billion, simply a monthly average cash burn rate of $500 million per month times 3. And we
used an additional $1 billion of cash primarily for debt principal payments. This was somewhat offset by a
$300 million increase in customer deposits. During the second quarter, customer deposits on new bookings
exceeded the impact of refunds driven partially by the receipt of payments from guests for cruises failing
in the current quarter. This is a welcome milestone and truly a sign that we are now solidly on the road to
full resumption of guest cruise operations.

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

Finally, I will finish up with some insights into our financial position. As I said before, we believe we have
sufficient liquidity to get us back to full guest cruise operations. Therefore, we are focused on pursuing
refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and reduce interest expense.

During the second quarter, 3 European export credit agencies, SACE, Hermes and Finnvera, provided
approval in principle to Debt Holiday [ 2 ] for the deferral of approximately $1 billion of principal payments
that would otherwise have been due over a 1-year period. These transactions should be completed during
the third quarter. The deferred principal payments were instead made over the 5-year period following
the completion of the transaction, extending the maturity profile of these loans. I want to thank everyone
involved in these transactions for the support that they have demonstrated towards the company.

In addition, last month, we repriced our $2.8 billion term loan base. It was an incredibly successful
transaction. It was well oversubscribed, which is unusual in the term loan B market. The U.S. dollar
portion of the term loan B facility now has an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 3%, which is 4.5
percentage points less than the LIBOR margin was before repricing. The euro portion of the term loan
facility now has an interest rate of Euribor plus a margin of 3.75%, which is 3.75 percentage points less
than the Euribor margin was before repricing. This was the largest repricing change of a term loan ever
achieved by any company in the term loan B market and will reduce our future annual interest expense by
over $120 million per year.

Clearly, this transaction is an affirmation from investors on our bright future, and they're confidence in
our management team. As we look forward, given how supportive the debt capital market investors and
commercial banks have been, we will be pursuing additional refinancing opportunities to meaningfully
reduce our interest expense and extend our maturities over time.

And now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director
Thank you, David. Operator, please open the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wanted to ask about your comment on pricing for 2022 cruises being ahead, excluding future cruise
credits. It seems like if future cruise credits are about 15% of bookings and maybe only a 20% discount
on average, that it would basically be kind of a low single-digit impact to your pricing. So I guess my
question is, is pricing -- the checks that we do is showing very strong pricing for '22 and a lot of that's
probably the bundling impacting that.

But if you included that sort of 3% impact or so from future cruise credits, would pricing not be up versus
'19 levels for 2022? And then sort of part B of that question is just given that you expect ships to be in
service, all ships by the spring maybe potentially not all at 100% occupancy yet at that point. Does that
give you the ability to have a little more price if the sort of lowest 10% of cabins on the ship don't get
filled?

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thank you, Robin. I'll let David add some detail. But generally, the pricing environment, as you point
out, is strong. In terms of the fleet returning, yes, we're planning to have the fleet sailing before next
summer, the full fleet. Of course, we have to see what evolves around the world. There are still pockets of
-- large pockets of still serious challenges with COVID-19. So we'll have to see how all that unfolds, but we
expect to have the fleet sailing in full prior to next summer. And the pricing environment is strong. David?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. So Robin, the -- when you think about 2022, as Arnold said, the environment is strong. But
remember, we only have a portion of 2022 on the book. So the FCC rebookings represent a meaningful
part of the overall bookings for 2022. And as a result of that, you're seeing that in the short term --
you mentioned 3%. The number is actually larger than that impact at the moment given the number of
bookings we have.

The other thing to keep in mind is that there were a lot of rebookings into 2022 from 2021 as people --
as we did pause and cancel some cruises, we rebooked people at the same price in 2022. So the impact
is for the FCC is a bit larger than what you had indicated. However, I will say, as we continue to book the
remaining portion of 2022, those FCC rebookings will become a smaller and smaller portion of the total.
And I do expect that when all is said and done, the FCC impact will just be a few percentage points on the
ultimate final yield for 2022.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

No, that's very helpful. And so when -- understanding the timing of that, right, that the FCC portion
will kind of move down as new -- more new bookings are taken. Is it reasonable to think that your
pricing went -- because right now, what you have on the books you mentioned is the rebooked -- a lot
of rebooked and a lot of FCC. As those portions move down as a percent of total, is it reasonable based
on the strength that you're seeing in new bookings coming in that, that price will be ahead of 2019 levels
next year?

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

So we're not really -- it's early days, and we're not in a position to give guidance. But as Arnold said, the
pricing environment is very strong. Our brands have done a lot to raise price over time. There's a lot of
pent-up demand out there, and we feel very good about our overall position. Booking volumes, as we said,
have been increasing. And so all these signs point in the right direction. But I do think it's premature for
me to give guidance at this point.

Operator

And up next, we have a question from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So first question would actually be a clarification. And I guess I think I -- well, I feel like I'm hearing you
guys a little bit in 2 different ways. And what I mean by that is when you guys talk about getting your
full fleet back in operation by the spring of '22, does that mean the actual number of ships in operation?
Or does that mean all of your ships are going to be operating at normal capacity levels? That's -- I think
there's some confusion out there with a lot of investors that we are talking to.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Steve, thanks for the question. First of all, definitely, we hope to have all of our ships and are planning
for that. But we also are optimistic that we can be at capacity at that point in time. But we've got many
months to go here to see. But we're hopeful that we'll be sailing at capacity over the full fleet.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Got you. Second question...

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Steve, if I could add one thing. I will point out the fact that we have a number of voyages, different
cruises out there. And keep in mind that the voyages that we have that are for vaccinated guests, there
are no social distancing requirements or capacity requirements on those voyages. So just keep that in
mind as you kind of round out and project the future.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Got you. And then second question, I guess, just maybe if you can give us an update on where you
guys are with the State of Florida and the governor at this point. Obviously, there's -- I think there's a
little bit of confusion out there as well in terms of the way he wants kind of the state to work versus you
guys wanting most of your passengers and crew to be vaccinated. Can you just kind of give us an update
in terms of where you guys are at this point?

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Sure. First of all, we're really looking forward to welcoming our guests on board. We, as you know, have
had a few sailings over in Europe during this pandemic, but it's really exciting for us and our people to
be looking across, not only here in Florida, but we have the Vista, starting on July 3; and Galveston, the
Breeze on July 15 in Galveston, Carnival Miracle, and July 27 in Seattle. Mardi Gras will start sailing along
with Horizon, Horizon starting on the 4th, Mardi Gras on July 31 in Florida and then all of our other brands
around the world. So it's just a really busy time and an intense time and exciting time. And of course,
there's a lot of noise. There's lots of different jurisdictions, different perspectives on how things should go.

So where we are is that we're looking to forward to welcome our guests on board. We're continuing to be
in dialogue with the governor's office. We continue to be in dialogue with the CDC. As you know, there's

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

the court ruling that affected the conditional sail order and that's through -- still in place, the conditional
sail order from CDC through July 18. And at this point, we were prepared to sail under that order, with
primarily vaccinated cruises. There will be unvaccinated -- people on those cruises not 100% vaccinated.
And so we're optimistic and working very hard to ensure that we can try to make everyone happy, but we
are welcoming our guests on board Horizon, July 4 in Florida.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Got you. David, can I ask you one quick housekeeping question? I guess you talked about -- I
think you said you're expecting 3.8 million ALBDs in the third quarter. And based on what you guys have
announced today, I'm not sure you're going to answer this. But is there any way to help us think about
maybe what the fourth quarter would look like as well?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, I don't have that calculation handy with me, Steve. But if you call Beth, I'm sure she can provide it to
you.

Operator

And up next, we have a question from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.

James Lloyd Hardiman
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

So David, you sort of open the door on this idea that, obviously, the voyages that have 95%-plus
vaccinated, you don't have the social distancing requirement or the capacity requirements. But if you don't
have that, you do. Can you maybe walk us through, at least based of what you currently know, obviously,
in a fluid situation, what you expect your mix of both of those categories to be. And how we should think
about the occupancy ramp within ships that do not meet that vaccination hurdle?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

So it's very difficult to give you an exact mix of what we expect going forward because this gets into the
evolution of COVID and the mitigation. We're very clear and we're out there with all the cruises we've
recently announced, what each ship will be and how it will work. But as we go along, we do expect things
to continue to evolve and change. And everything has been evolving in a very positive way, and we're
hopeful that, that continues. And so that should put us in a better situation in the days and weeks and
months ahead.

So -- because it is difficult to project, it's very hard for me to answer that question with great detail. But
my expectation is that we will be able to have higher and higher occupancy levels over time. And there are
a lot of projections out there that talk about potentially 70% of the globe getting vaccinated by some point
in early 2022. If that's the case, then a lot of these protocols are -- potentially can start to be removed.
And we'll just have to see how things progress over time. As Arnold mentioned in his prepared remarks,
agility has been one of the greatest things that have gotten us to this point, and we are going to have to
remain agile to try to react to the circumstances moving forward.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

I think -- I just want to add -- I just would like to reinforce what David is saying is that things are moving
in a positive direction. It will be -- it's probably going to be a little choppy around the world. And we're a
global business, and it's probably going to be a little choppy. So we've said for quite some time, the rest of
'21, early '22 will be a transition period.

But we're on a path to getting to a great place the world is with the vaccines, the various vaccines, the
advancements and treatments, et cetera. But it could be choppy. But by '22 and beyond, hopefully, with
the advancements in science, we'll be in a position to be able to sail, as one of the people asked, for full
occupancy and full fleet. Do you have a second question for me?

James Lloyd Hardiman
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

That's really helpful. And then another -- I did. So -- and it's similarly difficult to quantify with any
specificity. But if I think about spring of 2022 being some return to normality, I think one of the most
difficult thing -- one of the most difficult issues in terms of valuing your company and other cruise
companies is just sort of figuring out what the balance sheet looks like at that point.

So I guess, are we any closer to figuring out when we'll get back to maybe a cash flow breakeven
number? I get that there's going to be some incremental restart costs here in the near term. But is there
any color you can give us any way to think about, cash flow breakeven or sort of an interest expense
number once we're on the other side of this?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. So the difficult part, remember, so many variables that we just talked about. But if we do get back
in the spring of 2022, we have the full fleet back in operation, we're able to get to more normal type
occupancy levels, then we should be -- have significant positive EBITDA, particularly in the summer
months of 2022, and we'll move forward from there.

So I feel like we're in -- it's very hard to project from where we are today with 5 ships in operation to
95 ships in operation next spring. We have 90 ships in our fleet today, but remember, we have 5 more
new builds coming that will be back in service. So we'll have 95 ships in operation next spring. And we do
expect at some point during that process to get into a positive EBITDA. But with the seasonality of our
business and a lot of the other restart expenses that we mentioned, it's difficult to project the exact month
where EBITDA goes positive or cash flow goes positive.

But we're very hopeful. This spring isn't very far away, and we're looking forward to that. And keep in
mind that if you look at our historical results, everybody has always seen that the third quarter is our
strongest quarter. If you actually add in the month of May, the 4 months, May through August represent
just 1/3 of the calendar year, but it represents 2/3 of our EBITDA so -- or our operating profit. So it's -- we
are focused on getting the full fleet back in service by next spring in order to capture a great summer of
2022.

James Lloyd Hardiman
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. I think that makes sense. And just to clarify, we should not be then, based on everything you just
said, assuming that you get to that breakeven level significantly before that spring of next year. It's tough
to say at this point.

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Well, I wouldn't say -- I'm not giving guidance. It's tough to say because of so many other factors with
restart expenses and everything else involved. It is tough to say.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Up next, we have a question from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.

Jaime M. Katz

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

12

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

I actually wanted to [indiscernible] from version of James' question that we have some visibility into what
capital markets look right now -- look like right now and you have been able to refinance some of this
debt. And so as we think about the full year, is there a way that we should think about debt service costs if
you are able to make the changes that you would like to make?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

So I do apologize, but you broke up for me about halfway through the question. So I do apologize if you
could repeat it. I'm not sure why.

Jaime M. Katz
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay, sure. No problem. I said since we know what debt capital markets look like right now and the ability
to refinance has been fairly easy, I guess, is there a way that we should be thinking about debt service
costs for the current year given that you probably have some intended plans for refinancing over the last 6
months of 2021?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

So if you're talking about interest expense, the interest expense -- our current forecast is $1.6 billion
for 2021. Last quarter, I think I had said $1.7 billion. So we do expect a decrease as a result of our
refinancing efforts. And I think if you look at the principal repayments in the business update, we did give
the principal repayments. But keep in mind that those principal repayments were prior to what we expect
to close in the third quarter, which is the $1 billion debt deferral with the Debt Holiday [ 2 ]. So those
numbers will come down as well.

Jaime M. Katz
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Right. And then I know the U.S. is really leading the way out of the COVID period. But if you have any
color on European or Asia Pacific demand, I would love to hear that at this time.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So just in general, in terms of the environment, obviously, the U.S. is ahead of many places, although
there are pockets in Europe that have done well as well with vaccines. And again, we encourage everyone
to get a vaccination is the best way to keep yourself safe and your loved ones safe.

And so in that regard, there is more movement here in the U.S. from an environment standpoint,
collectively, although there are good pockets in Europe and elsewhere. I'll talk about Asia and Australia,
and then I'll let David comment on the general booking situation abroad. But Asia and Australia, in
particular, China and Australia are still pretty much on lockdown when it comes to travel. And so we
continue to be in constant dialogue with appropriate players there. And eventually, it will open up, and
we'll be ready to go when it does.

Dave, you want to give some comments on the booking environment?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. So I guess the best way to phrase it, we said that the 2022 book position was ahead of a very strong
2019. And that's actually the case both for our NAA brands as well as our EA brands. So we are -- as
Arnold indicated, we are seeing good, strong bookings on both sides of the pond as things continue to
rebound.

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

Up next, we have a question from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist.

Charles Patrick Scholes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

For the sailings in 3Q and 4Q, can you give us an update on limitations on occupancy and/or what
occupancy you are targeting for those ships?

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Sure. So broadly, right now, as David mentioned earlier, for those sailings that are under one part of
the conditional sail order for primarily vaccinated people, the way things are today, there aren't any
restrictions. There's no physical distancing, et cetera. And so we are slowly ramping up our occupancy
of sailings of that type to, first of all, give our crew a chance to get oriented because we are still having
enhanced protocols on board from a crew management standpoint and other things.

And so those proves us at that point in time can get pretty close to full occupancy by that point in time.
To the extent we have cruises, and we do have some outside the U.S. and other places that are under a
separate set of protocols because they have a lot of unvaccinated people on board, then there, some of
the occupancies are going to be limited by the physical distancing requirements as long as they persist.
And again, that can all change and evolve as community spread lessens and herd immunity increases. And
so there's a hodgepodge.

And at this point, as David already kind of referenced, it's hard to predict exactly where we're going to
be on those because we have to look at the specific itineraries, the destination requirements, the whole
port requirements and what the environment is at the time. Now we're all pretty optimistic right now, and
hopefully, that trend will continue. So directionally, we think we'll be moving more to higher and higher
occupancy and therefore, occupancy. But we're not forecasting at this point. David?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I think that was well said, Arnold.

Charles Patrick Scholes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Just I guess, to think of a starting point for the limited capacity that did go out last quarter, what
was the occupancy on that?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

So it was very limited. There were like 440,000 ALBDs. There was 1 ship that started in March, and then
there were 4 other ships that started in May. The occupancy started -- did -- they improved as the quarter
went on, and we were seeing ships that were at 50% or above by the end of the quarter. But you do have
to understand the background because -- I'll give you a great example.

One of the ships for AIDA was sailing in the Canary Islands. And so the Germans that went on the ship
because of the restricted travel requirements in Germany, the people had to quarantine when they came
home. But then once the quarantine and the travel restrictions started to reduce, you started to see better
and better occupancies and better and better cash flows on the ships. So while we did invest early on,
we did see positive cash flows on the ships later in the quarter. So we were very pleased with the overall
experience.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And we proactively manage that on the occupancies early on because, again, we had -- at that case,
we had extensive protocols: universal testing, enhanced medical screening, physical distancing, mask-

wearing, enhanced sanitation, enhanced air handling. So there's a whole lot of different protocols. And so
initially on those, we really were pretty stringent and really tapped down the occupancy in our sails.

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

We're expecting to see better occupancies as time goes on for all the reasons that we talked about.

Charles Patrick Scholes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Sure, that makes sense. And certainly, good luck for sort of in Florida coming up.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Thank you.

Operator

And up next, we have a question from the line of James Ainley with Citi.

James Robert Garforth Ainley
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I'm interested in just digging into your ESG commitments a bit more at the kind of 40% reduction in
carbon emissions by 2030. Can you just flush out a bit more about the tools and mechanisms you need
to get there? And can you help us with what the potential cost implications might be? I'm thinking maybe
you might need to buy [ several ] credits and things like that. So any color on that would be very helpful.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Sure. We've been on a concerted march on reduction of carbon emissions for some time. And we've
already effected a 30% reduction since our baseline of 2006, and we achieved that in a number of
different ways from more basic things like just really being rigorous and tuning our engines and carefully
planning itineraries and so on to much more investment required, oriented ways of new lighting schemes
and technologies and handling waste and density on the ships.

And then, of course, we made a hard commitment early before there was even infrastructure in place on
liquefied natural gas. So we were the first, with an LNG ship, with our AIDA brand. We did that -- frankly,
we made the commitment to do that. We weren't even sure how we're going to fuel the ship. But we
had time during the construction phase and whatnot to work out a deal with Shell, and now we've got
infrastructure in place. And as I said, we have 11 ships in total now, either sailing or under construction.

As you know, LNG is the cleanest burning fossil fuel. It also gives us a 20% smaller footprint from a
carbon emission standpoint. And so those are the ways we have gotten there and plan to get there. But
ultimately, our goal is a net zero emission platform over time. And to do that, we're going to have to
have science and technology work with us in the form of better and combinations of lithium-ion battery
technology, fuel cell technology, biofuels, et cetera. But we are on a hard margin and we have a line of
sight for the 40% reduction. We're going to need some technology advancements to get to the net zero. I
hope I answered your question.

James Robert Garforth Ainley
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. So the LNG ships on their own, how much of that 40% reduction will come from them on their own?

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

Well, as I said, we're already at 30%. So as we move forward, we'll continue with -- new ships inherently
are more efficient because everything is engineered from day 1 to be that way. But the LNG ship will
represent, once we get to the 11th one, about 20% of our fleet. So it will be a significant contributor to us
being able to achieve and hopefully beat the 40% target.

Operator

And we now have a question from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Wolfe Research.

Frederick Charles Wightman
Wolfe Research, LLC

It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. As we think about the possibility that the full fleet is back in the
water next summer, David touched on some of the seasonality considerations just looking at the third
quarter specifically. Should we expect some yield headwinds just from reduced access to international
travel? Or do you think that we could be in a more normalized sourcing and deployment mix by then?

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Again, we're not trying to give any guidance or anything at this point. But what I would say is that we've
exited 19 ships or will. And so as I said in the remarks earlier, that's a significant reduction in capacity.
Now we are adding new ships, which we're very excited about. And therefore, we'll get to capacity
comparable to what we had in 2019 eventually. But the reality is that we're at a much lower growth rate
as an industry and as a company than we were before with a lot of pent-up demand.

Keep in mind, by next spring, a lot of repeat cruisers still may not have the opportunity to cruise again.
And we have a huge base of repeat cruisers across our various brands. And so there will still be a
considerable pent-up demand that has been largely unsatisfied at that point in time. And that's the
environment that we're anticipating we'll be operating in. But we aren't going so far to try to predict
beyond. David, I don't know if you want to add any color.

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. No, the only other thing that I'll add is on travel restrictions. Travel restrictions are being reduced and
changed every day. So the summer of 2022, I mean we're talking 11 months away -- 11, 12 months away.
So there's a lot of opportunity as things continue to evolve and improve to see many, if not most or all
of those restrictions disappear before the summer of 2022. I know -- I booked my cruise in December of
2022. I expect to go to Turkey, Greece and Italy, and I'm really looking forward to it and looking forward
to reduce travel restrictions.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

And David definitely gets the friends and family premium when he...

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Exactly, exactly.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

There's no big price [ hike ], right, for David, yes.

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

HSBC, Research Division

Just wanted to ask, in terms of your views on leverage longer term, would you look to deploy equity to
maybe increase the pace to get to investment grade?

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Real quickly. Look, we have good liquidity in place now, we feel, to get us back to full sailing of the fleet.
Cash generation is the way and cash maximization is the way we're going to accelerate repayment of debt.
We're going to do some refinancings to lower the interest burden along the way. But basically, that's the
path we're on right now.

Ali Hamza Naqvi
HSBC, Research Division

Understood. And do you have a view as to what happens to pricing when the sort of pent-up demand for
cruising normalizes? Does that happen in 2023 or beyond that?

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

I think for our plans, as I said on the call, we were on a growth trend of 4.5% pre-COVID through '25 with
the moves we've taken and the new builds we already have coming in, will be at a growth rate annualized
of 2.5%. So that's a much lower growth rate. And I think that, again, continued pent-up demand, people
have spent a lot of time in isolation and like now, people really want to experience things. I think that's
going to last a while. And so we're -- obviously, it's hard to predict the future, but we're logically optimistic
that there will be a good environment for some years coming here.

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

So operator, given the time, we'll take one more question.

Operator

And the final question, therefore, comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I'm convinced you guys go in alphabetical order. So next time we could reverse and do the Zs first. But I
guess I just wanted to clarify something, David. The CapEx for the year, are you raising the expectation?
Or is it just weighted to the second half of the year in timing?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

It's weighted to the second half of the year timing. We have -- because as part of -- during the pause, we
delayed a lot of dry docks, we have quite a few ships going into dry dock in the second half of 2021. And
so you will see capital associated with those ships. And so the timing is weighted towards the second half.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Perfect. And then one other question, this may be hard to ascertain just given the bundling aspect
of what's being offered. But what is the appetite? Or what are you seeing in pre-booking for onboard
spending?

David Bernstein
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

CARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 24, 2021

So the trends, when you try to dissect them, we're seeing similar trends to what we have seen historically
on the onboard spend side. But it is -- as you say, it's very, very difficult because -- and I'm talking about
people who are not booking the bundled packages. When you talk to the various brands around the globe,
they are still pushing as they always have, onboard -- other onboard packages and things associated with
the cruise and no significant changes in that front.

Arnold W. Donald
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Thank you, everyone. Really appreciate your time. It's a great feeling to have an expanded
opportunity to welcome guests on board here in the coming months, and we're very excited about it. But
thank you very much. Thank you, operator.
