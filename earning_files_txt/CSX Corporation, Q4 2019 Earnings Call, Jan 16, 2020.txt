CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Call. As
a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor
Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. You may begin.

Bill Slater
Head of Investor Relation

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief
Executive Officer; Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Kevin Boone, Chief
Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations.

On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.

With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon. I want to begin by thanking all of our CSX employees for another
great job this quarter. They continue to show that they are the best operators in the industry. For both the
fourth quarter and full year, they once again broke their own records and set new all-time low operating
ratios.

Our service is the best it has ever been and getting better. The key here is reliability. Operating a simpler,
more efficient network, we are able to offer rail users a service that is truck-like in consistency but with
lower cost and more environmentally responsible. More shippers are selecting us for their shipping needs,
and we have tremendous opportunity for growth.

Let's now turn to Slide 5 of the presentation. Our financial results are straightforward with only a few
unique items, which Kevin will point out in a few minutes. Fourth quarter EPS declined 2% to $0.99. The
operating ratio improved by 30 basis points to a new record of 60 as continued operating momentum
offset top line headwinds. For the full year, EPS increased 9% to $4.17, and the operating ratio improved
by 190 basis points to 58.4%. These are truly great results considering the industrial economy's second
half performance.

Turning to Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue declined 8% year-over-year due to the continued impact of
the softer industrial economy, intermodal lane rationalizations and coal headwinds. Merchandise revenue
and volume declined 3% as growth in ag and food and minerals markets was more than offset by declines
in chemicals, auto and other markets. The Philadelphia refinery explosion and GM strike accounted for
more than 2/3 of the volume declines in the quarter. Intermodal revenue declined 9% on 9 -- on 7%
lower volume, primarily due to the impact of lane rationalizations implemented around the 2018 peak
season. We have now lapped the impact of these changes. Coal revenue decreased 22% on 17% lower
volumes, with declines in both export and domestic markets due to the impact of lower export demand
and benchmark prices as well as low natural gas prices. Lastly, other revenue declines resulted from lower
storage revenue at intermodal facilities and lower demurrage charges.

Moving to Slide 7. Let's review our safety performance. The full year personal injury rate declined 15%,
and we reduced the full year train accident rate by 41%, including setting another company record in the
fourth quarter for the lowest accident rate. This progress is a result of concerted daily effort on the part of
the employees performing the work. At the same time, we still see areas where additional improvement
is needed. In 2020, we will maintain a rigorous safety program focused on continuing education of our
workforce, further strengthening rules compliance and empowering employees to have the courage to act

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

if they see something unsafe. As I have said before, we will never be satisfied with our performance if just
one of our employees gets injured while at work.

Moving to Slide 8. Let's review our operating performance for the quarter. CSX set new all-time company
records for both velocity and dwell, achieving significant year-over-year improvements as well as strong
sequential momentum. The combination of these improved metrics helped significantly increase car miles
per day as we continue to translate incremental operating efficiencies into higher asset utilization across
the network. We also continue to set fuel efficiency records operating below 1 gallon of fuel per 1,000 GTM
despite typical seasonal headwinds in this quarter. CSX is the only U.S. Class I railroad to have crossed
this threshold. Fuel efficiency remains a key focus for the team, given the combination of financial as
well as significant environmental benefits from reducing fuel consumption, and we believe opportunities
remain to get even better going forward. Reducing emissions is important to us, our customers and the
communities we serve, and we are proud to have been recognized by various institutions as leaders in
sustainability for the transportation space.

On Slide 9, most importantly, we are translating these operational improvements into more reliable service
for our customers. Trip plan performance set new records again this quarter, with 83% of our merchandise
cars and 95% of intermodal containers hitting their hourly trip plan targets. Additionally, we successfully
completed the rollout of individualized trip plan performance data to our merchandise and intermodal
customers. Feedback on the tool has been very positive, and we believe providing this unique level of
transparency to our customers will continue to differentiate CSX' best-in-class service.

I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will review the financial results.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 11. I'll walk you through the highlights of
the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was down 8% in the fourth quarter as
the impact of lower intermodal and coal volume as well as reduced fuel recovery, lower other revenue and
unfavorable mix more than offset the benefit of pricing gains in merchandise and intermodal.

Moving to expenses. Total operating expenses were 9% lower in the fourth quarter, a significant
achievement that reflects CSX' ability to react to changing markets while delivering record service levels.
Overall, these results reflect the company's sustained operating improvements and significant gains in
labor and asset efficiency.

Labor and fringe expense was 3% lower, with average head count down 7% or nearly 1,600. Efficiency
gains were strong in the quarter, partially offset by inflation, other costs and incentive compensation,
including accelerations of stock compensation related to certain retirement-eligible employees.

Our ongoing refinement of the operating plan continues to drive savings from fewer crew starts,
enabling a 9% year-over-year reduction in the active train and engine employee base and driving a 7%
improvement in crew utilization as measured by gross ton-miles per active train and engine employee.

With workforce efficiency and management execution, we reduced overtime across the operating
department by nearly 15% sequentially or approximately 30% versus the fourth quarter in 2018.
Additionally, the average active locomotive count was down 10% year-over-year in the quarter. The
smaller fleet, combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies, that will drive a 9%
reduction in the mechanical workforce while also reducing mechanical overtime expense by over 40%.
Finally, we cycled a unique benefit in the prior year related to the railroad retirement tax refund.

MS&O expense improved 20% versus the prior year. Continued improvements to the train plan, combined
with increased network fluidity, have enabled an 8% reduction in crew travel and repositioning expenses.
On the mechanical side, the lower locomotive counts also drove savings in MS&O, including a 26%
reduction in locomotive materials and contracted service expense versus the fourth quarter of 2018.

Real estate and line sales were $10 million lower in the quarter. We continue to see a pipeline of real
estate opportunities. And for planning purposes, we currently expect gains in 2020 to be approximately

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

$60 million, while the impact of these transactions will remain uneven from quarter-to-quarter. As you
remember, in March of 2018, at our investor conference, we guided for $300 million in real estate sale
proceeds over 3 years. We will significantly exceed this guidance with our expected 2020 results.

Fuel expense was $37 million favorable or 15% year-over-year in the quarter. These savings were driven
by a 7% decrease in the per gallon price but were further aided by lower volume and significant efficiency
improvements. Our enhanced focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software,
combined with train handling rules compliance, drove a fourth quarter record fuel efficiency. Full year 2019
fuel efficiency was also an all-time best for CSX.

Looking at the other expense items. Depreciation was relatively flat year-over-year. While we did
recognize $10 million in additional expense this quarter due to a 2019 depreciation study, this was more
than offset by other items, none of which were individually significant. We expect depreciation expense to
increase approximately $50 million to $60 million in 2020, reflecting the continued impact of the recent
study as well as a higher net asset base. Equipment rents expense increased 9% as the impact of inflation
and other items more than offset the benefit of lower volume-related costs and efficiency gains. Equity
earnings increased $7 million in the quarter due to higher net earnings at our affiliates.

Looking below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances, partially offset
by a lower all-in coupon. Other income decreased $4 million as the company recognized a $10 million
make-whole premium on the early redemption of $500 million of long-term notes in October. This was
partially offset by increased income from higher investment balances.

Income tax expense decreased $45 million due to lower pretax earnings and further aided by certain big
tax matters and federal legislative benefits. Absent unique items, we would expect an effective tax rate of
approximately 24.5% for future quarters.

Closing out the P&L. As Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX operating income declined 8%
year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reflecting the challenging volume environment. Despite the tough
backdrop, the company delivered another record operating ratio of 60%, a 30 basis point improvement
over the fourth quarter 2018.

Finally, turning to Slide 12. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 12. In 2019, capital
investment declined $88 million or 5% year-over-year. While overall capital investment declined,
investments in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure saw an increase of 13% as we continue
to prioritize investments that provide safe and reliable train operations. Overall, our reduced asset
intensity, especially in rolling stock, has enabled us to sustain lower levels of capital investment without
compromising safety or reliability. The level of PTC spending has also come down significantly in the last 2
years.

Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team. Generating operating productivity while
driving improved capital efficiency has produced differentiated free cash flow conversion. Growth in CSX'
core operating cash flow generation, including improvements in working capital, drove a 9% increase in
adjusted free cash flow to $3.5 billion in 2019.

We returned over $4.1 billion to shareholders in 2019, including nearly $3.4 billion in buybacks and over
$750 million in dividends. Additionally, we are exiting 2019 with nearly $2 billion of cash and short-
term investments, which, combined with another year of substantial free cash flow generation, provide
significant opportunities to reinvest in the business and continue to return cash to shareholders.

With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Kevin. Let's turn to Slide 14 and our outlook for 2020. We expect underlying economic
demand to remain relatively consistent with current levels. It took industrial activity a while to cool off,
and it will take a while to heat back up. Based on this, we expect full year revenue to be flat to down 2%

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

versus 2019. This forecast includes more than $300 million of top line headwinds from the coal business,
driven primarily by lower export coal volumes and pricing.

For the first half of the year, the merchandise business will continue to lap the higher economic level -- the
higher level of economic activity from the first half of 2019, but we expect merchandise volume growth to
turn positive in the second half of the year. We expect intermodal volumes to increase in 2020 as we have
now fully lapped the lane rationalization impact and look to grow the reengineered network.

As to the operating ratio, our goal is to operate as efficiently as possible while ensuring we maintain our
reliable service product. Our focus is on growing the business, and in that context, we are targeting cost
efficiencies that will not inhibit service. There are additional cost levers out there for us to pull, but we
must make sure we are well positioned to capture new business and respond to demand when industrial
production moves up.

Looking at the 2019 operating ratio results, we again outperformed our real estate target of approximately
$100 million a year. Adjusting for this outperformance implies a baseline operating ratio of 59%. Despite
roughly $300 million of operating income headwinds in 2020 related to export coal and noncore items such
as lower real estate gains, higher depreciation and lower other revenue, we still expect to realize enough
incremental savings across the business to maintain or hopefully even improve our margins.

For capital allocation, our first call on cash is maintaining the integrity and reliability of our railroad. As
Kevin noted, in 2019, we again significantly increased investments in rail infrastructure, spending more on
rail, ties, ballast and signals, and we expect to maintain this level of investment going forward. In total,
we project capital expenditures for the year of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, in line with our 2019 targets.

In the absence of any high-return growth projects, we expect the next principal use of cash flow will be
the continued return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and additional share buybacks.
Importantly, we are committing to doing so in a way that maintains our strong investment-grade credit
rating.

Over the last 2 years, we have accomplished many exciting things at CSX and fundamentally transformed
the way the company does business. However, none of us are resting on that success. In fact, we have
only scratched the surface of this company's potential. I believe the best is yet to come for CSX as we
continue our journey to becoming the best run railroad in North America.

Bill?

Bill Slater
Head of Investor Relation

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays Capital.

Brandon Robert Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Congrats on a pretty good year relative to pretty difficult conditions. Jim, or I don't know if Mark Wallace is
on the line, but do you guys mind digging a little bit deeper into your macro assumptions behind the flat to
down 2% revenue assumption? And I think you did call out some headwinds in coal as well. Do you mind
just repeating that again?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. Sure, Brandon. It's Mark. So going into 2020, we expect a continuation of the current macroeconomic
trends to continue. As we know, the consumer economy remains strong, but PMI and IDP and other macro
indicators suggest that we're not going to see a near-term increase in industrial activity. IDP is projected
to be relatively flat for the year. And the PMI read in December was 47.2%, which was the second worst
since '09 and the fifth consecutive month signaling contraction. So given this, we're not forecasting a
hockey stick recovery, but any improvement in the macro environment would be upside for us.

Despite these challenges, we're going to continue to get better on what we can control, providing high-
quality service to our customers and executing. We have not changed our outlook for long-term revenue
growth. Intermodal, as we've said many times, we -- I think -- we think we can grow 2-ish x GDP and
merchandise GDP plus. So we're going to stay close to our customers, watch things and see if sentiment
improves throughout the year. But clearly, as I said, we're not forecasting any type of big recovery in the
year.

Brandon Robert Oglenski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And I guess it's a related follow-up, Mark. Can you just tell us how the marketing strategy and sales
strategy has changed at CSX, especially related to intermodal and merchandise?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes, sure. I mean we -- in 2019, we spent a lot of time revamping the entire sales and marketing
organization. We've changed a lot of people, brought in some great talent. We have actually developed
a strong marketing team, no longer a pricing team, as we've discussed in the past. The marketing team
is doing a fantastic job, working hard doing actual marketing activities and looking for opportunities to
gain share from truck and going after them -- and providing the sales team with the leads and those
opportunities to grow our share as we are leveraging this fantastic service product that Jamie and his
operating colleagues have provided the sales team just to sell.

On the intermodal side, again, as Jim has alluded to, we're through our lane rationalizations that began in
late of 2017. We have a great intermodal network that we're leveraging, and we're excited to sell our -- as
Jim said, our 95%-plus trip plan compliance -- or trip plan performance numbers and even higher in some
other -- in some lanes. It's exciting, and customers are taking note, and we're executing and doing really
well with our intermodal customers there.

Next, we have Tom Wadewitz from UBS.

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Wanted to see -- I appreciate the detail on coal, the perspective. I think that $300 million's a revenue
number. Any thoughts on how we might think of that in terms of an EBIT number? Is that presumably a
fairly high incremental margin? Is that a 50% incremental margin? Or how would you think about the EBIT
headwind related to the coal revenue comment that you provided?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Tom, it's Kevin. We've really never broken down the profitability between our different segments, but
we've always said that the coal business is obviously a very attractive business for us, and we're going
to continue to move as much coal as we can. But that's probably as far as we want to go there on the
profitability side.

Thomas Richard Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. What about, I guess, thought in terms of the pricing assumption you have for seaborne? I mean it
seems like you see Queensland benchmark look like -- I think it went down to -- or the market went down
to the $130 area. You've kind of, I think, come back to $150. Is there any sense within that coal headwind
kind of what you're assuming broad-brush for the seaborne prices for met?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. Tom, it's Mark again. The met benchmarks -- and again, the met is about 65% of our export coal. The
benchmark prices have continued to decline as the global production has weakened. And currently, they're
about $150. As a reminder, our contracts reprice quarterly. So you should expect to see a bit of a drag
on the RPU into Q1. But that's kind of where it is, and we'll see what happens throughout the year. As a
reminder, this time last year, the met prices were -- coming into the first quarter of the year, were about
$220.

Thomas Richard Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So you just assume they kind of stay where they are today. Is that the right way to think about it?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Correct. Yes. So we'll see the -- overall, for coal, we're going to see a step-down in the first quarter, but
sequentially throughout the rest of the year, we don't think it's going to get any worse on the RPU.

Operator

Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And just maybe, Jim, looking at the expense side, you've kind of accelerated cost here. But if volumes are
going to be down, maybe you can talk about, if most of the PSR gains are over, how do you think about
moving along with reducing expenses in light of these reduced volumes in contrast to your statement
about being cautious about not going too far to be prepared for the rebound and specifically like any
employees?

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes, I'll ask Jamie to give a little color on it here. But there are significant amount of cost reduction
embedded in that guidance that we provided just to offset the inflation and other cost increases that we

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

set out in terms of the increases in depreciation, et cetera. So -- but this game is not over, and we're
going to do the first and more -- foremost thing is to make sure that we're well positioned to provide a
really good quality product to our customers in the future. And again, I'll let Jamie offer a little more color
on the specific initiatives.

Jamie J. Boychuk
Executive Vice President of Operations

Absolutely. Look, Ken, we're continuing to look for good improvements this year on fuel, definitely towards
our car hire end of things. We're finding, as we become more fluid out there and the railroad moves better,
our bigger yards are able to do more for us. So we're looking at getting rid of more out of route miles. Our
locomotive fleet continues to go in a great direction as we utilize and get more miles out of our engines,
which, again, turns into fewer asset costs with respect to repairs and parts. And really, it just keeps on
chipping away each and every day we're getting involved and getting into what's going on out in the
ballast line.

And that's probably the most important piece that the team is doing is, as we're getting on the ballast line
and we're walking out there and looking at each industry, looking at how we switch them, how can we
do things better, and by getting out of headquarters and making sure that all of the right team, including
myself, is out there each and every week, taking a look at what we can do different and better, not only
does it give us that opportunity to continue to reduce costs but continue to improve the product that we're
able to supply Mark and his team to get out there and gain some more business as we keep on moving
along.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

But I guess, maybe I was trying to be more specific on the employee side, right? So employees were down
over 1,500 year-on-year. Is that something you would see accelerating at this point given the volume
declines? Or is that holding? I just want to understand, given Jim's commentary over not taking out too
much to be prepared for the rebound.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Well, as we've said before, our focus is on labor cost, not just head count reduction. We made a significant
reduction in the labor cost and not just targeting heads. So we'll continue to look for ways to reduce our
labor cost. And as we did in this quarter and as we'll do in every quarter that we have to manage the
company, we'll do what's necessary around here based upon what we see in terms of business activities.
Right now, we've kind of given you guidance that we think, especially on the merchandise side of the
business, there's going to be some reasonable stability sequentially in terms of where the volume line
should be and that -- and an increase on the intermodal side, and we'll manage the head count according
to that. If it goes sideways or downward, you guys get the numbers every week. And if you miss a week
or something, we'll point it out to you at which direction the numbers are going in.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And just a quick follow-up, Jim. The arrivals really jumped, or maybe, Jamie, from 53% on time 2
quarters ago to 85% now. Is there something beyond just execution that you're kind of -- that you want
to highlight, I guess, on the positive side, something really strong performance there?

Jamie J. Boychuk
Executive Vice President of Operations

So I mean, look, the team is executing. The guys are out on the ground taking a look at everything we
can. We'll probably -- I can tell you right now, we're going to crank the times a little bit. We're going to
pull some times out of our trains. We're going to get things moving faster on the network with respect
to cutting out some hours on how long it takes to get across the network. And that number might bump

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

down a little bit into the next quarter because we tightened things up. So that's a gauge for us to make
sure that our assets and people get to the other end, so we can turn them back. But at the same time,
when I see that number start to go up, it tells myself and the team that, on the service design side, we
can take a look at removing some hours and times from our trains getting across the network.

Operator

Allison Landry from Crédit Suisse.

Allison M. Landry
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So obviously, this year, you have a number of headwinds that you outlined, and that was really helpful.
But I just want to understand -- and also, you've talked about more to do on the cost side. But just
broadly speaking, do you need a more normal volume environment in order to really leverage those costs
and get the OR even lower, somewhere in the mid to high 50s? How should we think about that in terms of
the different revenue environments?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Allison, it's Kevin. Clearly, we've outlined more cost savings that we think, and there's runway to
continue to do that. The model we're setting up here is we're positioning ourselves for growth and really to
leverage that when the growth comes. And so I think we're very excited about the model we've created.
There's a lot of leverage in this model to really drop the revenue at a high incremental margin. That's what
we're looking forward as Mark and the team are diligently pursuing growth opportunities for us.

So -- but as Jim just explained, too, if the volume environment gets worse than what we expect, we all
know we have to react. We did it last year. We came into 2019 thinking revenue was going to be $500
million higher. We had to react after in the second quarter. And Jamie and the team pulled together. We
came up with a new plan based on the volume that we saw from that point on and we adjusted. I think we
did a great job. So we'll do it again if we have to.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

And the math will just work out in terms of what the margins are, should the business levels come
back. We're building a tremendous company here with great operating leverage to take advantage of
incremental volumes when they come back.

Allison M. Landry
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. That's definitely helpful. And maybe just on that point but specifically to your expectations for
intermodal volume growth this year. If truck rates remain weak for some period of time through 2020, is
there a point at which you might be willing to give a little bit on price to maybe drive some of that traffic
into the network? Or will you just wait for capacity to shore up and then wait for the volume?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

No, listen, Allison, we're not going to be cutting prices to grow the business. I think the team here is --
CSX has worked way too hard to do everything we've done to provide our customers with exceptional
service out there. A large portion -- the vast majority of our intermodal network on the domestic side is
under long-term contracts anyway. We're not looking to grow by just going out and slashing rates. That's
not our game plan. That's not our -- that's not what we're going to do. But the truck environment is still
pretty loose. It's about -- as we saw it last quarter, we don't think there's going to be any meaningful
snapback or tightening there. But clearly, if that happens, it will be a demand-driven environment event,
and that would be good for intermodal if that happened.

Operator

Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Kevin, just want to quickly confirm the $300 million for coal, that was a revenue number, right?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Absolutely, yes, that was a revenue number.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Yes, that makes sense. And it obviously implied 15% decline. Any help on how we can -- maybe
you can provide some color on what the split between the volume and revenue per yield on that, what's
the makeup of that. And then I thought you had said last quarter that D&A expenses were going to tick
up sequentially by about $50 million. We obviously didn't see that. Just wondering what -- if there's any
impact to the first quarter. And what should we think about from a sequential -- from a D&A perspective?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I'll handle the D&A question. I might pass off the coal question to Mark.

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Do you want to D&A first?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. On the depreciation, we did expect from the life study to have a little bit of uptick here in the fourth
quarter, which was offset by some smaller items. So we basically netted out to 0. I did guide for 2020 in
the $50 million to $60 million range incremental depreciation year-over-year. So we'll see some bump-up
from the life study and some incremental capital spend next year. That's my expectation. So no change to
the 2020 expectation there.

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Amit, on the coal side, let me really run through the coal environment, and hopefully, we can get to the
-- your answer without me answering it just specifically. But starting with export, as we've talked about
before, it's been a tale of 2 cities between met and thermal. As we guided through the year up to 2019,
our expectation for export coal was -- it was around 40 million tons. We slightly missed that number
coming in around 38 million. I tried to round it up to 39 million, but Kevin won't allow me to. So it would
have to be 38 million. But we now expect this year to deliver low 30s for 2020. As I said, we expect the
declines both for met and thermal but probably larger for thermal than on the met side.

On the thermal side, again, it's 1/3 of our export shipments, where we've seen large volume declines,
given low natural gas prices and mild winters in Europe. Obviously, in fact, in the coal demand there and
the API2 benchmark, as we talked about a little bit earlier, it's $55 per ton, so really low. On the met side,
again, mostly a price story, not a volume story, but a price story. Then back to my comment earlier, the
prices have continued to slide down to about $150 per ton today. So that's kind of what we see on the
export coal front.

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Okay. That's very helpful. And then just 1 follow-up for me. Kevin, we saw, I guess, a pretty sizable uptick
in the labor and fringe per employee. I know there was -- you called out some acceleration incentives
stock comp. So I'm just wondering what's the right way to think about that line item in 2020 because you
have regular inflation, but you guys have also been kind of focusing on managing overtime. And with the
volume environment being what it is, there could be some cross currents there. So if you could just talk
about that. And if I missed it, just help us think about how head count will be at the end of 2020 as well.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, you talked about the incentive comp has a little bit of headwind to that number when you calculate
it. The other thing that you have to remember in the fourth quarter is we have a lot of our capital teams
particularly on the engineering side that go over into vacation. And once -- a lot of their labor through the
year is going towards capital, but once they go on vacation, it starts to hit our OE expense. So there is a
bit of seasonality to our per employee cost. And so that's what you saw there in the fourth quarter.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

But it was a year-over-year number. It was up over 4% year-over-year, right?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think some of that impact as well. And then obviously, the inflation that hits that within that number,
there's a little bit of mix as well. But going into next year, I wouldn't see any significant rise in our per
employee cost. What was the other part of the question?

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just the year-end head count in 2020.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think look, we have a lot of momentum, obviously, that we've carried through the 2019 that will go
into 2020. We'll continue to focus on managing attrition. There's a process here where we look at every
job that comes available and ask ourselves, given the new model, whether that job is necessary. So we'll
continue to evaluate those. With a lower volume, there's opportunities on the operating side that we'll
find. So we'll continue to manage the labor side. It's not all about head count. It's also about overtime,
which we saw some great success in fourth quarter. We have big targets next year to continue to drive the
overtime down as well. So it's across the board on the labor savings.

Operator

Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan.

Brian Patrick Ossenbeck
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Mark, I wanted to ask you about the pricing environment, especially given the softness here to start
the year in rail volumes and the industrial economies you mentioned. Last quarter, you gave some
indication of same-store sales and how they were trending. So just given the backdrop and what we're
seeing on the rail indices from a pricing perspective, I wanted to see what you thought was kind of the
current market temperature when it came to price, realizing you just commented on not gaining volume
for price. So just what you see in the market will be helpful.

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Yes. No, I was going to repeat that, but we're not. So -- but within merchandise and intermodal, our
same-store sales pricing in Q4 was about in line with what we saw in Q3, which, again, was the strongest,
I think -- I said back then was the strongest we had seen in the past 3 years. And our contract renewals
-- the pricing on our contract renewals that came up in the quarter exceeded our same-store sales
pricing. So clearly, the team is doing a great job to value the product for the service that we're offering to
customers. And we're pleased, and I am pleased with the great work the team is doing on the pricing side.

Brian Patrick Ossenbeck
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And in terms of the inflation indices, do you have a lot of exposure in the contracts that are just going to
naturally reset lower in this coming year? Or is that not...

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

No. I mean the -- on the thermal side, those are annual contracts. So they will reset sort of now on the
met. As I talked about earlier, they reprice every quarter, but clearly so, the met benchmarks being 140-
ish or 150-ish, $150 a ton in Q4, we'll sort of reset those contracts in Q1. So yes.

Operator

Scott Group, Wolfe Research.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So I think you talked earlier about $300 million of operating profit headwinds. So I presume that's coal
plus any of the discrete cost stuff. I just want to review that discrete cost thing. So I got real estate and
depreciation. But maybe, Kevin, can you just walk us through any of the other discrete costs, headwinds
that you see in 2020?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think we -- obviously, we called out the real estate sales this year. In 2019, we realized roughly
$160 million. The guidance for that is $60 million which I talked about in my opening comments. The
depreciation step-up of $50 million to $60 million versus what we saw in 2019 are the items outside of
coal that we really kind of called out.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Anything on the other railway revenue or the other income that you want us to be thinking about?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think where we're run rating today is probably a consistent -- a good way to think about it going
into next year. So there will be a little bit of headwind on the other revenue side as our customers --
demurrage costs have lowered, gone down over the year. So we'll have a little bit higher other revenue in
the first half of the year and kind of normalized to where we are right now.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then just lastly, when we get back to revenue growth, what are the right incremental margins?
It sounds like you're positioning yourself, you said, for incremental margins. Is that 50%, 60%, 40%? How
should we think about incremental margins when we get back to revenue growth?

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Probably the best incremental margins that other businesses would be envious of.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

At some level, it doesn't matter where the business comes but we have a lot of trains that have capacity.
So obviously, in those situations on the merchandise manifest business, when we're adding a car to the
back of the train, existing train, there's not a lot of cost you add to it. A little bit of car hire, a little bit of
fuel. But I think the incremental margins will be quite attractive.

Operator

Chris Wetherbee from Citi Research.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the revenue line. So if you take out the $300 million from coal of that headwind, it
sure seems like you're guiding revenues kind of up a little bit to maybe up 2.5% or so. We know we have
some headwinds from other revenue with some of the ancillary stuff from earlier in the year last year.
How should we be thinking about maybe that cadence? Is it merchandise volume that improves as we go
through the year in addition to intermodal volume? Maybe if you could help sort of bridge some of that
gap because I would have thought mix might have been a bit negative, too. So that -- any color would be
helpful there.

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. Sure, Chris. So we talked about coal being a significant headwind, down sort of mid-double digits,
as Jim alluded to. In intermodal revenue, we expect, in 2020, we're going to return to a GDP-plus
environment as we lap our lane rationalizations. And as I said many times, our service product is strong
with a 95%-plus trip plan compliance. So I think very good momentum there. On merchandise, we exited
2019 really well positioned to grow with a strong service product. And I think even despite the tough
environment and the tough comps year-over-year, we can see a slight improvement to revenue growth in
the first half and with a stronger second half.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. So maybe inherently, ex coal volume up for the full year, does that sound right?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

I would say that, yes, absolutely.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

If it hadn't -- again, in the merchandise business segment, if it hadn't been for the 2 specific items
which I pointed out, the refinery explosion and the GM strike, we would have been close to flat this
year in terms of volumes in merchandise, which is significantly different than the rest of the industry.
And so we're reasonably positive. As the business environment begins to, at what point in time, I don't
know when that's going to happen. This is not the new norm. This is kind of a natural evolution, things
go down and then they go back up. When these things start to go back up, we would expect to see
merchandise volumes begin to increase. And intermodal, we have always said we believe we have a
fantastic intermodal franchise. We have fantastic intermodal service. And we had to bite the bullet over a
2-year period to reengineer the franchise to make it as better as we go into 2020. We knew that's what we
were doing. And now we're going to see, as Mark said, hopefully growth, 2x GDP. So put those together, I

mean, 60 -- 80% of our business should be doing extremely well. Unfortunately, all 4 discrete segments of
the coal business are getting hit simultaneously, which is difficult for us to overcome.

Operator

Next, Bascome Majors from Susquehanna International.

Bascome Majors
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

I wanted to go back to the service levels. You improved your trip plan performance in the carload business
by 7 full points in this quarter. It has been pretty steady in the mid-70s before this gap higher. Can you
dig a little more into how you're able to drive such a big improvement in 4Q, if there's any -- if that's
sustainable or something lumpy there. And as you look forward, is the conversation with your customers
changing? Is -- are you feeling that this yields excess carload business growth over some period of time?
Can you just tell us how that's going on the ground?

Jamie J. Boychuk
Executive Vice President of Operations

I'll start off with the product that we were able to create here, and then let Mark touch on some of the
feedback he's getting from the customers. But look at it, it -- we've got a fantastic team of railroaders
out there with CSX. And we've gone through this transition over the past 2.5 years, almost 3 years. And
trip plans was a difficult piece for us to work on as a group. We tackled the first piece of intermodal,
which Mark had just mentioned, the team has been knocking it out of the park, over 95%. We still haven't
achieved internally what we want to achieve for a trip plan on the merchandise side. But it is day in and
day out, grinding discussions, talking with the field, working inside and out with each and every one of our
operators, in order to move up each percentage point. So we have, I'd like to say, the most stringent trip
plan with respect to a 2-hour buffer, and that's it. We measure empties, which I don't believe any other
railroad does. And we work really hard, hand-in-hand, 7 days a week, driving that product. So I would
say that we're going to continue to see that percentage improve as we continue to prepare and get Mark's
team ready to jump out there and make those sales.

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

At intermodal, we measure to the minute.

Jamie J. Boychuk
Executive Vice President of Operations

Yes, intermodals are absolutely...

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

It's to the minute, not within 2 hours. So if we miss by a minute, it's a trip plan failure. October 1, we
rolled out trip plans, as Jim said in his opening remarks, to our customers. On ShipCSX, in December,
early December, I think on the second. We rolled the trip plan performance out to all our merchandise
customers. So they have total unprecedented visibility to every car, whether it's a load, whether it's an
empty on the CSX network. They have unprecedented visibility to their trip plans to what we're doing, how
we're doing in every lane, every car. And customers love the tool, something they've never -- no railroad
has ever type -- provided this type of visibility. Listen, it's been having an impact. I think going back to
Jim's comments a few minutes ago, if you look at our carload performance in Q4, we were down 3%. And
the industry was down 5%. If you take out the PES, the impact of the PES refinery and the GM strike, we
were flat in merchandise. Rest of the industry, down 5%. Clearly, customers are responding to that type of
level of performance and rewarding us with their -- more of their business. And we're winning share every
day from trucks, and we're going to continue to push. And as these -- as this performance, listen, 83%
for the quarter was great. We're hitting high 80s today and low 90s with some customers, and we're going
to continue to -- I know Jamie's not satisfied, and the team's not satisfied with that. So as we get better,

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

continue to push and become more truck-like and provide great service, then we're going to be rewarded
with more business.

Jamie J. Boychuk
Executive Vice President of Operations

The one piece to remember on trip plans for us, what Mark has and his team has taken beyond what I
think anyone ever thought trip plans were going to be, trip plans are more of an internal metric. So we
could see how we were doing and look at costs as well as getting hour by hour across the network. By
putting this out to the customers, it put the pressure definitely on the operating team. But guess what,
we're hitting it. And look, we've got a little bit more work to go. But we've taken this beyond what I think
anyone ever thought trip plans could be.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

And going from whatever the number was over the last couple of quarters, say 75% to 85% in terms
of the carload trip plan compliance, 2 years ago, that number was 35%. The reason we have to give
our visibility in tracking mechanisms to our customers is so that they will trust us to try our new service
product that proves to them that it is as reliable today as a truck. When a couple of years ago, your trip
plan compliance was 35%, and you were trying to get a customer to switch from moving his freight in
a truck to rail, he didn't have a lot of confidence that the -- his freight was going to get to his customer
on time when your on-time performance was 35%. So that's why it's so important that we focus on this
metric and that we're so confident that this number be reliable and consistent. But even more importantly,
that the customer believes that, that product is reliable and consistent so he's willing to shift. He's always
been willing to pay the 15% premium to buy the reliability in a truck. We need to show him through this
transparent tool that he can trust us to get his product there when we said we were going to get it there.

Operator

Justin Long from Stephens.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color around what the guidance assumes for the
quarterly cadence of consolidated volumes. Is it the right way to think about it that we should see
something like a low- to mid-single-digit decline in the first half and then something like a low single-digit
growth number in the back half as the comp fees?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. Clearly, we're lapping some -- we're going up against some tough comps here in the first quarter as
I -- in the second quarter of the first half, as I said, we had a pretty good environment in the first half of
2019. But we've got a great service product, and we're going to do as much as we can. As I said, I think
we're going to be able to do well in intermodal in the first half and in merchandise, hopefully eke out some
positive volume growth in merchandise. But we will, as we sort of get into the back half of the year, we
think that it will be a little bit stronger than the first half, for sure.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think Justin, you'll see throughout the year, going -- first quarter will mark the low point from a
growth perspective, that's probably across all of the -- not only revenue but operating income, EPS across
the board. And then from there -- and this is a lot of -- just based on the comps as we get in the back half
of the year, lapping some of the coal and some of the other headwinds that we saw in 2019 that growth
should improve.

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. But when you put together all the pieces, do you think in the second half of this year, volumes can
be up on a year-over-year basis? Is that the assumption?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. Yes.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then secondly, on free cash flow. Obviously, that's a highlight of the business right now.
So I wanted to ask, in 2020 and beyond, what's the right framework, in your mind, to be thinking about
for the free cash flow conversion percentage? And then also on buybacks, Kevin, maybe you could provide
a little color on the magnitude you're expecting in 2020 relative to what we saw last year.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Free cash flow conversion, our goal is to remain -- keep that high. We have some headwinds in terms
of cash tax rate that will -- over time, that's going to trend higher. We're going to do everything we can
on -- to offset that with working capital initiatives and really taking a look at our capital program and how
efficient we can be on that side to save dollars there. So a lot of opportunities. I don't think we have any
plans to go back to the old ways of very low free cash flow conversion that we saw historically, from not
only CSX but the industry. So we -- that's something we pride ourselves in where we continue to strive to
maintain and have every plan to.

On the buyback, we are taking in $2 billion of cash, as I mentioned, end of the year. It gives us a
tremendous amount of flexibility. There's no reason for us to retain $2 billion of cash on our balance
sheet. So that allows us some flexibility going next year to be opportunistic when the markets present
opportunities and we'll do that. We'll also look at the dividend as well. So we have a history of returning
cash to shareholders, and we'll continue to do that.

Operator

David Vernon from Sanford Bernstein.

David Scott Vernon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Mark, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the expectation that intermodal's going to get better. It
sounds like you were thinking that in the front half we might start to see a return to growth. How are
your intermodal partners kind of talking to you about the outlook for the business in terms of their ability
to actually attract share? We're coming off a year where domestic intermodal is down, call it, whatever,
5%, 6%. What's going to flip that switch that's going to get that volume to start coming back on to the
network?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. Let me split it up a little bit and talk both intermodal on the international side and the domestic side.
But the international business was down less than domestic. We're still continuing to see -- and going
into the early part of 2020, and hopefully, for the rest of the year, we're continuing to see good growth
there on the international side with [ our land port ] strategy and some new service offerings with our
customers. But the overall market remains soft. But we are doing well with picking up some business
there. I think our -- listen, again, customers are -- don't -- responding to our repositioned network, it's
moving faster and more reliably and more efficiently. And they like the service, and we're doing well to
grow the intermodal franchise, and we're lapping those lane rationalizations. We're -- those are all behind

us now, and we're growing from that. So again, we're -- we think given the environment and given the
service product that we've got and we can grow this thing.

David Scott Vernon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about the improved service, obviously, some businesses that
are contract. Is that going to give you a better leverage to kind of get some even better than sort of run
rate pricing going forward? Or should we be thinking about that as being kind of the standard and you're
going to be using service more to drive growth than to really try to extract more value from the existing
book?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Well, we attack it from all fronts, right? We're going to -- we've got long-term contracts with our
customers. And there's great escalators in there, and we're going to -- but we're going to continue to grow
with them and bring on more business and get price where we can get price. And again, we're not giving
away our service. And so we're going to attack it from all fronts.

Operator

Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities.

Cherilyn Radbourne
TD Securities Equity Research

Just wanted to ask a question in terms of performance evaluation and how you differentiate between
performance improvements that may be associated with lower traffic volumes on the network versus
improvements that would be associated with sustainable process optimization that would remain, once
volume growth returns.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think when we look at productivity, the way we measure it here internally, it is a lot easier to drive
productivity in a growing volume environment. Because, first, you got to -- in a declining market, you got
to offset the decline in revenue before you even generate any productivity. So the fact that we're able to
offset the headwinds that we have talked about a lot on this call, implies a lot of productivity this year.
And it's a lot of smaller things that are adding up to big numbers across the board. When I look at the
overtime percentages and I look at a lot of different things, those aren't being driven by lower volumes.
So that's a lot of blocking and tackling. Even at the D&A side, we're getting a lot more productivity out of
our employees than we ever have. So we measure productivity internally. It's certainly hard to -- it would
-- if I -- I can tell you right now, we would have realized a lot more productivity this year in an increasing
volume market, if that was the outlook for us.

Jamie J. Boychuk
Executive Vice President of Operations

We can -- I mean I look -- we can look at the metrics, and to Kevin's point, give me a growing
environment, and it's easier to run the railroad right now. We're in tough conditions to put up the numbers
that we're putting. And ultimately, if you take a look at the metrics and where the metrics are sitting, how
do you know that things are -- that we're improving even in the environment we're in, the cash is falling
out? If we were hitting metrics and the cash wasn't falling out, then there would be a point made, "Hey,
it's easier, and it's all because of volume based." But I think we've proven that along with our metrics
going in the right direction, the cash is falling out in the savings.

And many of these changes are transformational in nature. And therefore, sustainable. We are not just
kicking the can down the road. We are fundamentally, in every respect, changing the way we run this
company. And these changes that are resulting in these efficiency gains are, to a large degree, going to
stay with us as we go forward.

Cherilyn Radbourne
TD Securities Equity Research

Okay. All of that makes sense. Maybe just by way of a quick follow-up. As operating ratios across the
industry start to converge and maybe it's in the high 50s, what metrics do you think that investors should
pivot to start focusing on to differentiate between the various franchises, whether it's ROIC, free cash flow
conversion or some other metric?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Cash flow, we talk about it a lot around here. I think we're pretty proud of our cash flow conversion. It's
not easy to both improve OR and generate a lot of cash flow. And I think we've proven that. So that's
really the differentiator that we see out there. And as we shift longer term, we -- we're here to drive
operating income growth as well. So those are the 2 things that I think we'll be focused on.

Just a quick question. We talked a lot on the coal side about the export front. Can you touch base a little
bit on the domestic side? And how much of that $300 million top line headwind might be tied to that? Or is
it really all on the export side?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. No -- sure. On the domestic side, there's some impact. I don't think it's going to be as much of
a negative impact in 2020 as we've seen going forward. Net gas prices, unfortunately, have remained
stubbornly low, dropping to about $2 recently. But -- and we did not see the surge in prices that we saw
in the fourth quarter of 2018 when they hit like $4 for a couple of weeks. But for coal -- for utility coal
to be competitive, prices would have to increase from the current levels and the total electric demand
would need to increase. As we all know, in many locations, coal is used for peaking generation. And so
our upside is always seen or many cases seen when we have these extreme weather conditions and
cold. Unfortunately -- or fortunately for the people on the call in the northern half of the country, you're
not seeing much cold weather, but that's bad for utility coal. And so the natural gas capacity has not
been stretched so far this year. But for 2020, we do see and we do expect that our utility tonnage will be
relatively flat as we have had some wins offsetting some market declines.

Jordan Robert Alliger
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And just a quick follow-up on the coal pricing. Does domestic coal revenue per carload, I mean does that
stay positive? Or is it positive? I shouldn't say stay, I'm not sure. That's the question.

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

There's going to be -- they're -- on the domestic utility?

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Yes.

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Well, again, it will be down just given where things are. Those contracts are multiyear contracts with our
customers but there are price adjustments. But we have minimums in the contracts with LDs tied to them,
but we do expect a little bit of pressure on coal, on utility RPU.

Operator

Ben Hartford from Baird.

Benjamin John Hartford
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Kevin, just kind of perspective as we move beyond 2020, and the model evolves, one -- toward one of a
growth focus. As this operating plan takes hold, this 59% OR target here for the full year for 2020, and as
Mark had said, we're near trough level -- cycle trough levels for PMI ratings and industrial-related activity,
to what extent do you view 59% or thereabout, as a representative trough or a floor for this model's OR
as we look ahead to the next decade or so? What -- why would not that be the case?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Why wouldn't 59% be the floor?

Benjamin John Hartford
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Why couldn't 59% be the cycle floor for dealing with trough levels of PMI ratings and we're looking out
toward growth? Why shouldn't this 59% OR or thereabout be viewed as a representative trough for a floor
for this model's OR going forward?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

You say floor and you're meaning that it -- why wouldn't it get better from here?

Benjamin John Hartford
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Correct, yes. Yes. Can we treat this as a cycle trough, this 59%, the low point?

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think as we look longer term, and maybe Jim has some comments on this as well. We're really
going to focus on growing operating income and generating EPS growth in the most effective way. We
talked about the leverage we have, we've built in this model. So we think, given everything that Jamie and
his team have done, that we can drop through revenue at a very high incremental margin. So that implies
a pretty good outcome on the margin side. But we'll have to think about what's the most effective way
is to grow operating income in -- at a very high return. And so those are the things that, I think, as we
get further out, we'll have to contemplate. But it's -- we have a better service, so clearly, getting price for
service is what we'll go after. And -- but it's really operating income and cash flow that we -- that we'll be
striving for in the next few years beyond 2020.

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Right, at [ 42 ] or so margins. And as Kevin said, easier for that number as our -- for our margins to
improve or our operating ratio to go down with increasing volumes. Our long-term strategy is to continue

to leverage our service, regain business that has been lost from the industry and while maintaining what I
consider to be extremely good margins and grow our operating income, cash flow and earnings per share
of the company.

Operator

Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just a quick one, again on coal. You said that you probably hit the worst of it in 1Q and then things kind of
normalize from there, if the benchmark stays where it is. Given your -- the kind of take-or-pays you have
on the volume side and kind of the way the contracts reset, if the benchmark stays where it is for, let's
say, the next 3 to 5 years, like forever, is all of the coal impact going to be isolated in 2020? Or is there
like another leg to come in 2021?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Oh, my gosh, Ravi. Coal benchmark stay here. It's not -- that's -- you're not going to be happy.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Sorry. I'm making you do math at the end of the call.

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. Listen, I'm not -- I'm in no position to speculate what's going to happen to coal internationally,
whether it's thermal, met. I mean again, thermal's going to be driven internationally by the demand for
coal -- utility coal in India and other places, Turkey, Pakistan, it's going down. It's -- in the next 10 years,
it's probably not going to be -- we're not going to be shipping any more to Europe. And on the met side,
again, it's industrial production worldwide, it's cyclical. These things...

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Right, right. I get that. I mean I get that. We don't really have any visibility on where coal is going to go.
But my point was if it didn't change starting tomorrow, if it just stayed where it was, are your contracts all
going to just lap and kind of completely reset in 2020? Or is there more to come in 2021?

Mark K. Wallace
Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing

Yes. No, no. They would -- it would keep going. They will lap.

Kevin S. Boone
Executive VP & CFO

There's not a contract that's going to expire in 2020 that -- where there's another shoe to drop, so to
speak, on it if the commodity -- underlying commodity prices just stay the same. I think what the volumes
today represent is what the underlying commodity prices are at. So all else equal, there's no long-term
contracts within our export coal business that are set to expire after 2020.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's what I was getting at. Maybe just one more. Kind of, you guys implied that you're going to
see significant incremental margins when the volumes come back. That kind of implies that you haven't
necessarily downsized your operations completely for the cyclical volume environment you're seeing right

now, maybe some of the other rails have. If volumes don't come back until the back half of next year, at
what point do you guys say that, "Hey, maybe we can cut some more on the cost side here?"

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

We watch this. We watch this daily. It was kind of like -- let's just kind of transition back 6 months ago,
when everybody was saying, "Man, the second half of 2019 is just going to be gangbusters." And we were
saying, "I don't see it." And we were responding accordingly and making the appropriate steps on the cost
side to make sure that we delivered almost double-digit earnings growth this year in an extremely difficult
environment. And we'll do the same this year as we go each and every month and assess where we are.
And are the volumes better than or worse than what we expect them to be right now, and we'll respond
accordingly.

Operator

Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets.

Walter Noel Spracklin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I want to go back, Jim, you were talking a lot about the improvement in operating metrics that you had
and how that's improving service and Mark's certainly echoing that. You mentioned about how you're
using that to convince the truck customer to switch over. What evidence are you seeing that they are
capitulating here and moving over? Are they waiting for some other factor to consider? Is it -- or are you
going to -- do you look at 2020 and see an opportunity for a notable share gain against truck coming up
into 2020? Any thoughts on share gain opportunity against truck?

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Oh, yes. Well, let me -- real briefly. It took us decades. It took the railroad industry decades of poor
service to drive the business off the railroads onto the trucks. We are not going to get [ the railroad ]
business off the highway back onto the railroad in 2 weeks. So we're going to have to earn it, that's what
we were talking about earlier. We're going to have to not only put up good metrics, but prove to the
customers that these metrics are as equal to a truck and that this business model is sustainable. In the
past, I'm sure they've had a lot of railroad guys that have walked in and said, "Hey, trust me, take your
business off the truck, put it on the railroad. I'll get it there on time."

And the next thing you know, 6 months later, it wasn't performing as well. And that customer lost business
as a result of his conversion from truck to rail. He is skeptical and rightly so. We need to prove to that
customer that this is a long-term, as I said, structural, fundamental change in the way we do business.
And when we do that, we'll continue to see where we grow our merchandise and intermodal volumes at
a rate that is faster than the industry. Is that going to be 1% greater than the industry? Is that going to
be 1.5% greater than the industry? It isn't going to be 12% greater than the industry. It's going to be
incremental, quarter after quarter after quarter, year after year after year, where we have outsized growth
relative to the industry, that's going to prove this business model.

Walter Noel Spracklin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Let me turn around and ask that same question now against your rail competitor. We've talked to a
number of your customers, they've confirmed the service metric improvement. Jim, you've had experience
of running, working with a company that has had a significantly better operating ratio than its competitor.
Is that an opportunity for share gain against rail if your operating metrics, as they've shown here,
continue to improve? And certainly, relative to the competitor, are we -- could we see a more notable
upward shift in your share gain opportunity against your rail competitor?

CSX CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 16, 2020

Well, I think it's different than the -- our business environment here in the eastern half of the United
States, as I would say, is significantly different than the business environment in Canada. We have billions
of dollars of opportunity available to us from truck. Customers today that are shipping products with
us in a boxcar that are also shipping 50% to 60% of their product in a truck because the truck is more
reliable. I want that opportunity, which is billions. It is crazy for me to go over there and price my service
as a commodity to try and pick up a couple of million dollars off the other railroad. That's the business
model that has run the railroad industry down for decades, and that is not the business model that we are
pursuing.

Operator

Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo.

Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just want to talk you. You made a lot of progress on the operations over the past few years. And you
talked about the levers that you can pull in 2020. If you -- as you look at those, which ones do you feel
could be the most challenging, particularly in this environment, if there is anything?

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Well, the levers are always challenging. As we said, if we wanted to just take -- and I've been saying
this for the last 6 to 8 -- we have been saying this for the last 6, 8, 10 months or more. If the business
had dropped off 10%, 12% in a couple of weeks in a traditional kind of recession scenario, it would have
been easier for us to go in there and find the equivalent amount of cost and taken it out of the company.
When it was a slow drip, week after week, month after month, 1% here, 1.5% here and it continued
down, down, down, it was more difficult for us to respond to that because we were fearful that we would
-- and as we expressed again here today, we would cut service in areas where we were -- in an attempt
to reduce cost. And we would perpetuate the downward trend by driving more business off the railroad
and onto the highway. So that is the challenge. Where can we cut and where can we -- and maintain our
levels of service? If the volumes continue to decline, it creates opportunities for us. And at some point in
time, you just get a little more aggressive. We have not done that. And -- but we have the ability, if it was
necessary.

Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just trying to be optimistic, if we do get maybe a more significant inflection in the back
half, does any of those levers sort of get moderated or pulled in a little bit?

James M. Foote
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're really -- we are optimistic. We like to think we're realistic. We are optimistic. We expect
80% of our business -- our merchandise business and our intermodal business to do quite well this
year. Especially, in -- as we said, in the second half of the year, if for no other reason that we just get
easier comps. And yes, if the business comes back, which clearly, we hope it does -- well, it's going to.
Not a question -- as I said, this is not the new norm. Business is going to come back. It is -- all of our
businesses are cyclical. It's just a question of when does it come back. We're -- all we're saying is, as of
right now, we're being a little more pessimistic about -- I don't expect all of a sudden, volumes would
jump up 5% in the -- on May 12. We're going to wait and see. We're going to be cautious. We're going to
be vigilant in making -- and we have to do that in order to manage the company. And if things come back,
we'll be in a position to handle the volume and grow the business.

Look, as Jim said, this isn't a slash and burn exercise that we've been going through, it's controlling the
costs. And on the operating side, we work very, very close with Mark and his team. As the business starts
to come back, we're going to be prepared for it. We're going to be ready for it. We've got the assets. We
make sure we have the people, and we don't leave a load behind. So this has purely been a controlling --
and look at -- we need to continue to control the cost because the business isn't coming back as quick as
we may have thought it does, then we'll do that. But we will be prepared to grab every carload that starts
to come towards us.
