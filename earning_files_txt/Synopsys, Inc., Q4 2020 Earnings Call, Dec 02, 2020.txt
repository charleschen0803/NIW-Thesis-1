Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys earnings conference call
for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020. [Operator Instructions]

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa
Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Lisa L. Ewbank
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Rich. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-
CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will
discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial
results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance
as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight
during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC
reports and today's earnings press release.

In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their
most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in
the earnings press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items,
plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the
prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.

Finally, we are all again participating from different locations today, so please forgive any delays or
technology glitches or awkward handoffs in the Q&A session that occur as a result.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Aart de Geus.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report another outstanding year for Synopsys. Despite unprecedented
macro challenges, we built considerable financial, technology and customer momentum. We substantially
exceeded our original plan with business strengthening through the year.

We grew revenue nearly 10% to $3.685 billion, led by EDA software and IP, expanded non-GAAP operating
margin by 3 percentage points, delivered more than 20% non-GAAP earnings growth and record cash
flow of $991 million. Contributing to these very positive results were the new EDA and IP products
we've introduced over the past few years. We expect to further build on this momentum with several
groundbreaking technologies that we launched this year. In addition, our reenergized Software Integrity
business is on its way to scaling to the next level and reaccelerating growth.

About 2 years ago, we communicated a 3-year financial plan to drive double-digit non-GAAP earnings
growth through a combination of top line growth and operating margin expansion to the high 20s by 2021.
We achieved our initial ops margin target a year early and have consistently delivered high single-digit
revenue growth. As we enter 2021, we expect to surpass $4 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP operating
margins of 29% to 30%, low to mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth and more than $1 billion in operating
cash flow. Beyond 2021, we will raise our ambition to a Rule of 45 as we drive revenue growth and further
operating margin expansion. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 02, 2020

Meanwhile, design activity remains strong across the board. Opportunities in key end markets such as
AI and machine learning, high-performance computing and cloud, 5G and automotive are massive as all
drive increasing adoption of our advanced solutions at a time that Synopsys enjoys particularly strong
differentiation. This includes ambitious companies such as AI start-ups and cloud hyperscalers as they
position themselves to leverage big data generated by the billions of cloud-connected IoT devices. They
need a trusted partner who not only has the most advanced high-impact products today but complete
solutions capable of scaling well beyond the traditional demands of Moore's Law into the powerful
intersection of hardware and software.

Let me provide some highlights. In EDA, our unrelenting innovation push in digital design has
strengthened our long-standing market leadership. More than 95% of advanced designs today rely on
our Fusion Design Platform and over the past year, revenue growth has accelerated. In particular, we
continue to see strong adoption momentum for our Fusion Compiler product, the industry's premier digital
design solution. Fusion Compiler significantly exceeded its orders target, increasing 140% in 2020. The
progression from technical benchmarks to competitive wins to growing orders and production proliferation
is trending even better than we anticipated. We've seen widespread adoptions from customers ranging
from the largest global communications, processor and graphics firms; to high-impact cloud hyperscalers;
to influential system houses and AI start-ups.

For our customers, production deployment yielded excellent results as evidenced by 5x the number of
tape-outs in FY '20 compared to last year, and for us, a rapidly growing pipeline across many market
segments. The Fusion Technology foundation also dovetails exceptionally well with the challenges inherent
in the next wave of chip and system design. Specifically, Synopsys is addressing new TAM opportunities in
AI-driven design flows, in 3D multichip design and in the new area of silicon life cycle management.

Let me start with our DSO.ai product, where DSO stands for design space optimization. Our combination
of Fusion and AI learns and automatically adjusts and optimizes design exploration for both better results
and faster time to market. With it, design teams can also tackle larger blocks and more projects, thus
focusing on more value-added tasks. Even in this early stage, the power and potential of DSO.ai is being
widely recognized as it received a 2020 World Electronics Achievement award for Innovative Product of the
Year.

Next is our extremely timely 3DIC Compiler solution with disruptive technology that enables the
design and analysis of multiple die together on a chip. At the very moment, that system architects are
augmenting traditional chip complexity by connecting multiple chips very tightly together, our 3DIC
product provides far better performance and capacity than conventional disaggregated chip-in-package
approaches.

Finally, we launched the industry's first silicon life cycle management platform just last month. On-chip
sensors and monitors feed into data analytics engines integrated with leading test and yield management.
This provides visibility into critical performance, reliability and security issues for the entirety of a chip's
lifespan from design to in-field operation. Early customer interest in all of these new solutions is very high.

Turning to custom design. Momentum for our Custom Compiler product accelerated with more than 30
new logos and 15-plus full-flow competitive displacements during the year. This resulted in over 50%
revenue growth. Having seen the power of our innovations targeting advanced [ system ] designs, a
number of the highest impact semiconductor and systems companies are putting their trust in us.

Let me now move to our Verification Continuing Platform, which combines market-leading anchor products
into a seamless, high-efficiency solution. With the complexity increase of intersecting chips, systems
and software, the need for Verification continues to rise. Our #1 market share position in both software
and hardware puts us at the center of this wave as we continue to innovate aggressively in state-of-the-
art native integration of the fastest engines. Contributing to our solid growth on the software side are
influential high-profile customers ranging from hyperscalers to AI to automotive and mobile.

Our hardware-based Verification products are totally focused on unmatched speed, highest capacity,
lowest cost of ownership and lowest power consumption for high complexity designs. Building on
our record year in 2019, in 2020 we again expanded our customer base, adding more than 50 new

customers and well over 100 repeat orders. This includes major expansions at some of the world's largest
semiconductor and systems companies.

Now to IP, where strong market demand for our rich portfolio drove another record year, growing
approximately 20% to more than $900 million in revenue. Our strength is broad-based across all
regions and key market segments, particularly high-performance compute, cloud and networking, AI
and automotive. In automotive, momentum continued in 2020 as we have achieved more than 400
wins on advanced processes across more than 30 major semiconductor companies. An area of particular
automotive strength is our ARC processor. This year, we extended our lead in automotive-qualified titles
by delivering the industry's first processor certified for full ISO 26262 Automotive Safety Integrity Level D
compliance. We also broadened our portfolio, introducing DSPs, higher-performance embedded vision and
a 64-bit processor family. As the undisputed leader in interface IP, we continue to see very strong adoption
of generation upon generation of important titles, including PCI Express, memory interfaces and MIPI,
which had an exceptional year.

In USB, we extended our leadership by introducing the industry's first USB4 IP. We also saw continued
traction in very high-speed SerDes with multiple 56- and 112-gig wins. Building on our lead in foundation
IP, we expanded our portfolio to include specialty memories used in AI and cloud compute and general
purpose IOs, which had an excellent year.

Finally, our track record of being first to market with IP and advanced process nodes continues and is
highly valued by our customers. We announced a full portfolio of 5-nanometer IP with multiple silicon
proof points, including our industry-leading PCIe 5.0 and USB4 solutions. With already more than 50 5-
nanometer design wins, we started development of next-generation 3-nanometer products, targeting
high-end mobile and high-performance compute.

Now to Software Integrity, testing software code for security vulnerabilities and quality issues. This
area contributed approximately 10% of our revenue. The market opportunity is vast with the need to
address critical security challenges steadily increasing in importance. As the industry leader with the
broadest portfolio of products and services available today, we're well positioned to serve this growing
space. Over the past several years, we have successfully expanded our customer base with enterprise
companies now representing about 75% of revenue. In 2020, we saw an increasing number of customers
adopting multiple products and services, leveraging our broad portfolio. An important example is a Fortune
100 technology, industrial and aerospace conglomerate. The depth and breadth of our products and
services allow them to consolidate from multiple vendors to Synopsys while significantly expanding their
investment and user base.

Having said that, Software Integrity is one area that saw an impact from COVID as well as some near-
term operational transitions. Our new General Manager hit the ground running a little over 3 months ago
and has already made significant enhancements in 3 areas. First, we evolved our go-to-market strategy
and customer success organization to better address and serve new and existing customers. This includes
timing our sales coverage and building an indirect sales channel. Second, we are bolstering our strategic
consulting capabilities. And third, we are evolving our product roadmap to capitalize on security trends in
DevOps and cloud adoption.

The recent moves are encouraging, and we expect to see continuous progress towards ending the year
with reaccelerated growth. We're very optimistic about the long-term opportunity as we work to scale past
the $0.5 billion mark next.

In summary, we're entering 2021 with significant momentum. Market demand is strong, fueled by
complex technologies and a multitude of high-profile verticals. Our innovation engine continues to
deliver advanced capabilities as our product offering is increasing in differentiation while seeing strong
adoption. Financially, we're executing very well and raising our long-term ambition. Thank you to our
dedicated employees who quickly and effectively adapted to unprecedented challenges this year and to
our customers and partners for their commitment and support.

With that, I'll turn it over to Trac.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 02, 2020

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was another excellent year. We reported record results
in all key metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow. We finished the year well
ahead of our initial expectations.

Our ongoing financial success reflects our dynamic end markets, our portfolio of best-in-class solutions,
our resilient business model with nearly 90% recurring revenue and our return -- our determined
execution. We're entering 2021 well positioned to exceed $4 billion in annual revenue and further expand
non-GAAP operating margin. As a result, we are on track to deliver strong double-digit non-GAAP earnings
growth and more than $1 billion in operating cash flow.

I'll now review our full year 2020 results. We generated total revenue of $3.685 billion, up nearly 10%
over the prior year with strength across all geographies. Backlog grew approximately $500 million during
the year to $4.9 billion. Total consolidated GAAP costs and expenses were $3.065 billion and total non-
GAAP costs and expenses were $2.654 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%. GAAP
earnings per share were $4.27, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $5.55, up nearly 22% over the
prior year.

Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $3.3 billion, with particular strength in EDA
software and IP. Adjusted operating margin was 30%. Software Integrity segment revenue was 385 --
$358 million with adjusted operating margin of 11%. While Software Integrity results were affected by
COVID and our near-term operational transition, we are enthusiastic about the dynamic market and our
leading industry position. Our long-term objective remains to grow Software Integrity in the 15% to 20%
range, exceeding market growth as we and the industry evolve. We believe operating margin can reach or
exceed our corporate average over time.

For 2021, as our operational adjustments take hold, we expect business levels to ramp throughout the
year and to achieve 15% to 20% orders growth for the full year. Revenue will feather in overtime due to
our time-based model. Our objective is to exit the year with double-digit growth in Q4 with a full year
in the high single-digit range, then accelerate in 2022. We'll increase the level of internal investments in
2021 as we implement our adjustments, and we intend to resume margin expansion in 2022.

Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the year was a record $991 million, reflecting our strong results
as well as robust collections. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1.2 billion with total debt of $128
million. During the year, we completed buybacks of $242 million. At this time, we expect to increase our
total buyback in 2021 versus 2020.

Now to guidance, which assumes there are no changes to the current Entity List restrictions. For fiscal
2021, revenue of $4.0 billion to $4.05 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.226 billion and
$3.271 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.825 billion and $2.855 billion; a non-GAAP
operating margin of 29% to 30%; other income and expenses between minus $11 million and minus
$7 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; GAAP earnings of $4.39 to $4.54 per share; non-
GAAP earnings of $6.23 to $6.30 per share; cash flow from operations of $1.2 to $1.3 billion; and capital
expenditures of approximately $100 million.

Now to the targets for the first quarter. Revenue between $935 million and $965 million, total GAAP
costs and expenses between $767 million and $785 million, total GAAP -- non-GAAP costs and expenses
between $674 million and $684 million. GAAP earnings of $1.05 to $1.16 per share and non-GAAP
earnings of $1.44 to $1.49 per share.

Longer term, we are raising our financial objectives. We intend to manage to a Rule of 45 over the next
several years through a combination of solid revenue growth and continued operating margin expansion
beyond 30%.

In conclusion, we enter 2021 with excellent momentum, reflecting the strong markets we serve, the
resiliency of our business model and the outstanding execution of our team.
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll start the Q&A with Rich Valera with Needham.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on delivering some really solid results in challenging conditions this year. And with that,
you finished off the year with another really strong quarter in Asia Pac, second quarter in a row, and
I'm guessing China was a factor in that. And one of the concerns that's raised is that maybe some of
that business is being pulled forward for various reasons. But just wanted to get your thoughts on the
strength out of Asia Pac, in particular, China. And if you guys have any concerns about maybe some of
that business having been pulled forward and what that implies for next year?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Thank you, Rich. It was indeed a very good year, and China definitely contributed substantially. In general,
Asia Pac overall was very, very strong. We have no indication of pull forward from China. Obviously, there's
always questions around that, but nothing really out of the ordinary, except the fact that we had very
strong business with also quite a number of additional new customers.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just a follow-up on the SI business. Are there any sort of green shoots you can point to at
this point? I know you've made a lot of nice sort of organizational and structural changes. Are you seeing
anything on kind of the bookings pipeline or funnel that might show some of those are actually starting to
have an impact?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

No, we cannot say that yet because Jason Schmitt, the new GM, has been there for just about 100 days.
He has made already a lot of very good changes, specifically on the whole go-to-market side, where we
have been able, I think, to optimize much better. So as indicated, our expectation is that through this year,
we'll gradually see the growth rate accelerate again because the business is fundamentally actually the
right thing at the right time. And so I think as our execution improves, we will see the results probably
fairly quickly.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

So, Aart, first question for you is, based on the news we got out of Intel this summer, a little hiccup in a
node transition. So just a bigger, broader question, what is the impact to you in the EDA industry when
a large customer stalls out a bit in node transition? I know that they'll redesign at the current node for a
while, but just in general, what -- how does that impact EDA?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, Tom, as you know, I never comment about individual customers. But one of the things that we
know well for many decades is if anybody at any point in time stumbles a bit or gets ahead, the race is on

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 02, 2020

among everybody. And at this point in time, I think all the companies that aspire to be at the leading end
in technology are investing and moving very fast to move the ball forward. Now this is not just because
they want to be first in line with their technology, it's that the demand of the market is very high. So
it's not only do you have the latest node, it's also can you deliver in volume with the right level of yield
because the production rates are pretty high. So to us, this is all good news. It is good news because we
see a strong wave of new designs. The new designs are very much aimed at the latest technology. So
people are taking advantage of that. And in parallel to this de facto continuation of, let me call it, Moore's
Law classic, we also see more and more customers now very actively looking at multichip -- or multi-
chiplets in a design. And so I think the hunger for more capability is insatiable.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

This is Trac. I just want to add that you're going to see this in the 10-K in a couple of weeks, but I'll
highlight that we continue to do very well at Intel, and our business there has grown in 2020.

So just to reiterate Aart's points.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. Makes sense. And then Trac, I guess, in the comments -- the transcript, you talked a bit about the
Software Integrity and putting in an indirect sales channel. Is that a different sales line -- a sales approach
than before? And is that going to have any impact on the margin of profitability?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

If I may chime in, I think I may have misspoken about the indirect sales channel. It's really a parallel
utilization of a channel that typically goes to large companies that actually help install things at our
customers. And so it's really sort of working more closely with the existing ecosystem and not really a
different sales channel.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarification.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Yes. Sorry, I got in the middle of almost cough and started to misspeak, my apologies.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to start with the cash flow outlook for next year. It's quite strong and a pretty nice step up. Can
you maybe provide a bit of a bridge other than just the improvement in net income and the reduction in
CapEx that factors into the improvement in cash conversion next year?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Joe, that's -- those 2 things that you highlight are really the biggest contributor. The fact that we are
growing op income and reducing our CapEx spend. The other thing I'll highlight is, over the last couple
of years, as I've mentioned, we've had some unusual onetime events that has hit us. And we've always
described that heading into 2021, things will start to normalize a bit with regards to onetime adjustments,
whether it's tax-related or legal settlement related or build-out of our facilities. But going back to the
Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 02, 2020

point, it's -- the biggest part of the fact that we are driving margin expansion up in '21 that's contributing
to the strong cash flows.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then it's a really strong improvement in backlog here at year-end, nice to see the
acceleration. I'm wondering if you could maybe help decompose some of the bigger contributors. I'm sure
there's quite a bit contributing. But if I kind of step back and think, it probably helps that the broader
environment seems to be improving now in terms of R&D activity accelerating into next year. So I'm sure
that helps across the portfolio. But in terms of any of the individual product contributors, is it really just
increased momentum behind, Aart, some of the things you called out in your prepared remarks, so things
like Fusion and Verification Continuum? Anything else you would maybe point to as being, I'll say, extra
good here at year-end?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Sure. Well, if I were to find a common denominator among all of those things, it is the adoption of
advanced technologies. And the reason for that is that the race is so much on in everything that has to do
with big data, be it from transport to storage, and of course, especially to computation, i.e., various forms
of machine learning, et cetera, that people want to adopt the most advanced technologies. In order to
do that, they really need to have the most advanced tools. And Fusion Compiler is really doing terrifically
well. We can see the benefits. Our customers see that, and it's in broad deployment. But the other thing is
the building blocks and the building blocks are IP blocks. And those IP blocks with the advanced nodes are
becoming more and more difficult to do for many of our customers or just economically not all that viable
if they do it themselves. And we are absolutely ready for the most advanced nodes as they come out. And
so those are the areas that stand out.

The last one I would just highlight is that with all these systems that use more and more and more
transistors, these transistors have one mission in life, which is have software run on it. And so the
intersection between hardware and software, which we often refer to as prototyping, overall, is also very
healthy.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Joe, I'd also add that it's great to have $4.9 billion of backlog and have that certainty and the visibility to
the future. And it does reflect the broad-based strength that Aart's described. More importantly, I think a
more critical measure for us is run rate, and that was up pretty substantially for the quarter and the year
as well, which is the one thing that we are more encouraged by when we look at the key metrics for our
business.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just wanted to double-click a little bit on the operating margin implied guidance here. When I look at the
EPS growth, it looks like you're implying somewhere around 12%, 12%, 13%. That would be kind of the
lowest you guys have put up over the last 4 years, 5 years or so, just looking over the past performance.
Just curious as to why the incremental margin driving for '21 would be lower relative to the last 3 years or
so?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 02, 2020

The margin story, I think, is very constructive. We're driving margins up between 1 or 2 points. And
remember, Mitch, this is coming off a what I consider a pretty extraordinary year, right, both in terms of
strong revenue growth and margin improvement. At this point, this is the best visibility that we have in
the business, and I think it's a pretty constructive outlook for growth profitability as well as cash flows. So
a pretty strong outlook for the year, and we feel pretty good about it at this point.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the Software Integrity business, is there any sort of update you guys
can give us for like the long-term trajectory there? I know you guys moved over a lot of the salespeople
and kind of the strategy there. So maybe you can put up a big picture as to what that should look like
over the next few years or so?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Sure. So aside of the go-to-market improvements and accelerations in some areas, there are 2 other
things that we look at. One is to increase our consulting capabilities because there's demand for that,
and they have a big impact on how well the rest of the business does. And secondly, on the product
side, sort of a double focus. A focus on one hand of making sure that each one of our individual products
increase more and more of their differentiation because they do battle with a lot of small companies. And
simultaneously that the overall platform really becomes more and more integrated because there's a lot of
demand from the larger companies to be able to look at their overall risk management picture as it applies
to software. And the more we can provide multiple tools that are integrated and that can jointly report on
the status, that is very helpful to the CSOs or heads of IT that are typically in charge of that.

We'll now go to the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just, Aart, on the growth in Fusion, I think you mentioned it was like 140% growth in orders. Is that order
count? And is that also -- I mean, are ASPs basically coming in line with what you had expected, so total
contract value is also exceeding your expectations with Fusion Compiler?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Yes. Fusion is doing very well in every dimension. And as you know, this was a long road to get -- it's not
only a product, but it's a whole platform to get it to really -- to the point that certainly is across the bridge
where it became markedly differentiated versus any competition. And we see that not only with Fusion
Compiler as -- is the core product, which, for those of you are not familiar, it does both synthesis and
place and route, but also has embedded in it, timing and power and test and a number of other things.
In other words, it's the intersection of many things that you look for on a design. It is also the linchpin
for brand-new products such as 3DIC and also connected very well to the Silicon Lifecycle Management
capabilities. And so in many ways, we feel that we have literally entered now the next decade of being
able to build on that backbone that we have invested in for quite a number of years. And so both the
technical stats, the booking stats and the revenue stats are all looking very encouraging.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then a financial follow-up. Time-based license was -- time-based licenses actually came
down sequentially. That's a pretty rare phenomenon. In fact, it doesn't -- it's not like it never happens, but
in a fourth quarter, I think it's even rarer than in another quarter. So anything that we should be aware of
just in the mix between time-based and services?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

No, Jackson, there's really nothing unusual there. Over time, the time-based is pretty steady. But from
quarter-to-quarter, you'll see it be a little bit more volatile given the timing of contracts and what gets
added or falls off. So it's really nothing unusual in the business.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital Markets.

Gal Munda
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

The first one for the team is just around China. If I did my calculation right based on your disclosure, it
grew about 30% this year, even more than that. I guess I'm trying to look a few years out, and it now
represents low teens in your revenue as a proportion of total revenue. So we've seen that it can reach
-- if it continues to grow that rate, it could be up to kind of high teens. Is that something that you would
expect to happen in the long term, especially considering your comments earlier that you have been really
seeing pull forward that this is a structural growth the way you're seeing it?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, as you know, the Chinese economy has rebounded post-COVID, but in general, is in a phase of
growth where technology is important to where that country is going. And we see many new companies
entering the fray for chip design and other areas that we can provide them with tools with. And of course,
we see many of the companies that have now a number of years under their belt designing much more
sophisticated chips. So I expect that to continue for a long, long, long time. And when you say a decade, it
doesn't phase me at all. On the contrary, I think that's absolutely what's going to happen. And so our job
will be to service that market as well as we can because it's a great opportunity. Now I would add to that,
that the countries around China are doing quite well also. And so the whole Asia environment is absolutely
moving forward on technology. And we have -- we're thankful that we have a very good connection in all
these countries, be it ranging from Korea, Taiwan, but also Japan that is rebounding somewhat with the
China phenomenon.

Gal Munda
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Got you. And then the second one, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the margin itself. If I look at
the incremental margins you guys have achieved this year, it has been quite remarkable, around 60%.
Your higher end of the guidance kind of implies 45% for next year. Is that really a reflection of the fact
that perhaps COVID situation made it a little bit of a more inexpensive year this year and some of the
investments might come back just generally in terms of the hiring and stuff? And is 45% something that
you feel comfortable kind of then achieving on an ongoing basis as we move past FY '21, incremental
margin.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So Gal, I would say that you're right with regards to COVID. We did get some benefit of COVID in
2020. So -- and that was for most of the year. And as we look at 2021, we do expect things to sort of stay
that way for the first half, but we do expect some resumption of normal activity. So that's a bit of a drag
on margins. But overall, as we said, we're expecting to drive margins up this year. With regards to the
question regarding incremental margins, we'll have more to say throughout the year because we're in the
process of further refining our next multiyear financial plan. But if you think about our -- the objective
of Rule of 45 and the idea of driving really strong growth while expanding margins towards a Rule of 45,
you're going to see pretty healthy incremental margin improvements year-over-year. So we'll have -- like I
said, we'll have more to -- more specific details to provide as we progress in the year.

We'll now go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.

Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

Aart, let me start with you on the Silicon Lifecycle Management strategy and platform. When we look at
the stack of that platform and as you depicted at your design symposium a couple of months ago, it looks
like there would seem to be some logical connections that you could make between that and core EDA
and/or perhaps even SIG. So perhaps talk about what your plans might be, what the road map might be
for connecting SLM to one or both of the remainder of the businesses?

And then for Trac, to clarify on your comment earlier about business with your largest customer, I assume
you meant in dollars, not necessarily as a percentage of revenue. But given the extent of the decline of
that business in 2019 versus 2018 in dollars, could you say whether you got back to the 2018 level or not
in 2020?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Okay. Jay, you opened a very big box with Silicon Lifecycle Management because there are multiple entry
points to that. One of the entry points that's sort of obvious and actually has been asked for many years
is for chips that are in the midst of a situation that could be life-threatening, i.e., in charge of a car or
the brake system of a car. So you really would like to know is the chips still working. And if the answer
is no, you really want to know what to do with that answer or how do you stop the car or whatever you
have to do. And so that is already a first example where, for a number of years, people have started to
put different mechanism inside of a chip via test connections to know is something broken, is the software
still running correctly or are there heat situations and so on. And so from there, to go to the notion of,
well, why don't we start to add some additional sensors? And by the way, sensors are very little things. So
you can easily find a corner somewhere to put them in. That brings very quickly the next question, well,
why don't we then take some data inside of the chip? And can we make the decision if the chip still works
inside of it? With other words, can you have some machine learning that gets interpreted inside of the
chip? In contrast to say, oh, we can now read out a lot of this data from the chip that comes from these
sensors and use external learning or external interpretation of the data so that we can make better chips
going forward.

And so I'm trying to just give you a little bit of a visceral sense that the minute you put observation points
in anything, but certainly, on the inside of a chip, and you have a way to either bring the data out or use it
on-site, so to speak, all kinds of new doors open up. And that is why this is exciting because on one hand,
you could say, well, nothing new here. On the other hand, you'd say, there's a lot new here and a lot new
opportunity in specifically the AI that can be applied with that. So hopefully, it gives you a little bit of a
sense that the opportunity space is very big. The good news is we are in a leading position with our test
capabilities. So we have good connectors there. We have very strong machine learning capabilities. We
can use that. And by the way, our own IP has already used a number of these type of mechanisms for a
number of years. So technically, we know what to do.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Jay, this is Trac. So on your question, you're right. Thanks for clarifying that. The dollar revenues at our
largest customer is up this year. I know that you like reading our K, so I don't want to give away too
much. That's going to come out in a couple of weeks, and you can see the details of that relative to the
prior years.

Okay. Okay. Just a quick follow-up, if I may. I don't think you used the word record to talk about either
hardware or IP revenues for the quarter. But certainly, for hardware, it looks like it had a record quarter
and possibly for IP as well. If you could clarify those.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We had a really good year, a good year for -- good quarter and good year for hardware, and it was
down slightly versus a record year in 2019. But nonetheless, a really strong revenue year for us. And
same with IP. IP, I want to say, actually, is a record year for us overall.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Jason Vincent Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

The first one, going into the introduction of the Rule of 45 a little bit, how much of achieving this goal is
based on the SIG business being higher margin than the corporate average?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

I think, for the most part, Jason -- and we'll provide more details throughout the year like I said because
we are in the midst of developing that multiyear view. But for us to continue to drive margins north of
30%, a lot of it is going to come from the rest of the business, the 90% of the business that is driving
the growth and profitability. Now longer term, there -- as we said pretty consistently, there's nothing
structural about Software Integrity that would prevent it from converging towards the corporate margins.
But that's a bit -- that's some time out. In the next few years, as we think about it, a lot of it's going to
come across -- some of it's going to be contributed, I'd say, but a large portion will continue to be driven
by the semi business.

Jason Vincent Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then...

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

And Jason, I would add that throughout the company, everybody understands presently our objective of
the Rule of 40. And so it really applies to all of the businesses to do their best to move in that direction.
But SIG is only about 10% of Synopsys. Now that's -- it's a high potential 10%. And so your conjecture
that it will need to both grow and improve its margin is absolutely true. But for the numbers that we -- or
the direction we're indicating to you, we think that we have a number of engines that are doing quite well.

Jason Vincent Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then one more quick one. The 20% growth in the IP business, I think that's what
you mentioned in the prepared remarks. But I widely understood the tailwinds, the design starts and
outsourcing, but what are you seeing on the competitive side? Any competitive changes on the IP side?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

No, not really. There are a number of other companies that provide either very specialized capabilities,
and I could mention ARM as a actually very good partner to Synopsys. And then we have some direct
competitors that compete on some of the blocks that we do. And in general, if a market is competitive,
that's actually a good sign that there is opportunity for growth and doing more. I think we will all be very

busy because I do think that there's a lot of market demand, and I think it will increase. I think Synopsys
is particularly well placed because increasingly, IP is very much a trust business. These things are very
complex. And somewhat tongue-in-cheek, I've often said that it's a little bit like organ transplants. You
want to make really sure that you're getting some very good quality solutions into your chip because
otherwise, it causes all kinds of other issues. And so it is very much a trust business, and I think Synopsys
is doing very well in that regard.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I think you have given us nice sales growth number for next year, about just over 9%. I was hoping if
you could give us some relative indication growth in the different segments? And I think, Aart, in your
prepared remarks, I thought you said growth acceleration from 2022, and I'm not sure whether you meant
just in the SIG business or whether you were talking about the overall company growth rate?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, let me start with that part. What I meant at that point in time, I was talking about SIG because
obviously, SIG is lower than our intent and our expectations. And so the changes that we've made, I
think, are all in the direction to vitalize specifically the go-to-market function and really align better at
the product, consulting and go to market, 3 steps for bigger business. So I was talking about that part of
Synopsys accelerating back to where it should be. For the rest of the company, I think we're doing very
well. I must say that it's very difficult to predict what 2021 will look like in general. There is high hope
that, as you heard in second half of the year, not only the Far East will do better from an economic point
of view, but also Europe and the U.S. with the coming about of vaccines. But it's not a simple situation.
Having said that, I think the semiconductor segment and the technologies around that are almost immune
to that part of the economy because the needs are so high. And many of the very things that got started
under COVID, such as the work from home, such as the massive communication, the massive amounts of
data being used, are just going to continue to be accelerated themselves.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And for my follow-up, we are starting to see ARM expand into new markets, Macs and other high-
performance markets in the data center, even supercomputing. Is that a net positive for you? Or does it
just cannibalize your presence in the x86 market?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

No, no -- well, we ourselves are not in the x86 market. We provide all the building blocks around these
key processes, right? And so if that part of the market wants to go accelerate themselves through a
massive food fight, by all means, go at it because acceleration, in general, tends to use more technology
and newer technologies. And so I don't want to handicap any of the players. These are all very, very, very
competent and great companies. But I think that the applicability of various forms of cloud computing is
broadening. And what we're going to see is that there will be more and more specialty areas, not only in
general processing, but various applications, of course, of graphics processors. But let's not forget, we are
serving 200-or-so companies all doing the best ever AI chip. And these are all specialized computation
machines that will -- many of those will be very valuable for certain specific applications. So there's no
slowdown by any means here.

Pradeep Ramani
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

First, I guess, for Trac, can you sort of help us shape the year in terms of how the revenues are going to
be weighted first half versus second half? And on the margin front, it almost feels, if my math is correct,
most of the upside in margins is going to come from your semiconductor SSD business, basically. Is that
correct? Or am I sort of missing something there?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

You're right, Pradeep. I'll start with the second part of it, the -- where the margin expansion is coming
from. For '21, specifically, given that we will make some additional investments in Software Integrity to
get it on a -- to reaccelerate growth, you'll see more of that margin improvement being driven by the semi
business. With regards to the quarterly profile, it's certainly going to be a better profile this year than
what we saw in 2020. Closer to fairly even, but still a strong second half.

Pradeep Ramani
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And for my follow-up, actually, when I look at ARM from a different angle, do you feel that
customers are sort of indicating greater interest in ARC simply because of the uncertainty around the
ARM's situation? And is that a positive for you guys? And maybe, does ARC actually grow -- is that -- is it
growing faster than your other IP business?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, I don't really want to comment too much about ARM as they are a strong partner. I would say that
there are many different applications for different types of processors. And we have never really competed
with ARM in its main area, which has been very much the strong processors for mobility that are driven at
a low power level in order to work well in a portable phone. And so we do an enormous number of what
we do. Our customers do an enormous number of the ARM cores with our tools, I should say, and we
drive them as hard as we possibly can. ARC has done particularly well in super low-power situations or in
a number of specialty areas where the processors just suited the build particularly well. And automotive
is one of those areas because there's all kinds of other requirements around automotive that have to
be followed very strictly. And as we put a major effort in quality overall and in quality, specifically for
automotive, we paid attention for that for ARC specifically, and that's why it's doing well.

Operator

Next, we'll go to the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I have 2 of them. One on -- I just wanted to -- first question on IP business. You kind of mentioned on
the IP side, like building IP blocks is getting more difficult with the advanced nodes for your customers.
Is there a way to quantify what the percentage of outsourced IP blocks to the EDA companies was like,
let's say, 28 or 20 nanometer? And what is it today at like 5 nanometer? Is there a way to quantify the
percentage? And then I have a follow-up.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, to be honest, there's probably a very good way to quantify it, but I cannot do that live for you
here because I don't have the credibility, I would have to talk to the people in the IP group. Generically,
though, I can absolutely say that 28 nanometer feels like a long, long, long, long time ago. And at that
point in time, we are probably in the 20% or 30% of outsourcing. Now we're much higher. But what has
really changed is that the complexity of the blocks since that time, there are certain blocks, especially

16

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 02, 2020

all these big controller and communication interfaces, they have become particularly tough to do. And
they are exactly the area where maybe some customers could do it themselves. And why would they?
Because there are often standards. And being better than a standard is the same as being worse than
the standard. You're not the standard. And so I think that has benefited our taking on more and more
of the area around chips. If you add to that, the fact that there's a large, large number of embedded
memory, that covers a large swath of a chip as well. So from that perspective, we keep moving up in the
percentage of what we do. But what we do itself is moving up in its complexity and in its transistor density
on an ongoing basis. And I think that's why this business is very healthy, is likely to continue to grow well.
And we will be very close to the differentiation side of our customers.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. It's a longer-term question. In the past, when
customer consolidation happened within your semiconductor customers, like Avago, Broadcom, et cetera,
there's a view that it's going to be negative for EDA companies, which did not happen. But also at the
same time, the EDA companies also consolidated. So therefore, your customers went with the biggest
supplier. Now when I look forward, like there's still a lot of semi M&A left to be done. With future customer
consolidation, there seems like there's [ not ] the tailwind of the supply consolidation. So do you feel like
that would make a difference in the future? Or do you think it doesn't make a difference, R&D is going to
be spent?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, it's a good question because many, many years ago, you recall it well every time that the word
M&A in your customer base came up, it felt like a 4-letter word. And actually, it wasn't because the one
thing that doesn't disappear are the very designers that are being M&A-ed around, so to speak. And so
from that perspective, it didn't harm EDA and IP businesses as much as initially expected. Secondly,
you're absolutely correct that we have done a certain amount of consolidation in our market. Largely to
actually stay at critical mass in order to be able to afford the amount of R&D needed for all of these new
capabilities. Now I think in our core technology, we are very well equipped to do these things ourselves
and invest in it. But on the -- sort of what's sitting at the boundary between existing SAM and new TAM,
there a lot of new opportunities that are opening up. And so if you take, for example, the Silicon Lifecycle
Management, we have acquired some capabilities. We are developing a lot of capabilities ourselves. But
it's a new territory. It's a new TAM. Maybe a little hard to describe how big it will be, but the promise is
extremely good. And so from that perspective, I think we will grow with our customer base in aggregate,
and I think that our customer base is doing well because they are at the center of what will drive the
technologies of the next decade. So we will race with them.

Operator

And with that, we've exhausted the Q&A queue. Please continue.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, with that, thank you so much for participating today. We hope, of course, that all of you have
stayed healthy within your family and yourself. It's not always been an easy time for everybody, but we
appreciate the very fact that many of you have stayed in contact with us through the entire year. We look

well-being. We look forward to talk to you soon again.
