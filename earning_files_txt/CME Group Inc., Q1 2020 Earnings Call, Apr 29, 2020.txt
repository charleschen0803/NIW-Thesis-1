Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the CME Group First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this
time, I would like to turn the conference over to our first presenter, Mr. John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to start with the safe harbor language.
Then I will turn it over to Terry, Derek and John for brief remarks followed by your questions.

Other members of our management team will also participate in the Q&A. Statements made on this
call and in other reference documents on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties
and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
from what is expressed or implied in any statements.

More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in our filings
with the SEC, which are on our website. Lastly, the final page of our earnings release, you will find a
reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We hope you and your families are healthy
and staying safe. Today, we have Julie Winkler joining us, along with Ken Vroman. And Julie heads up
our global sales and research areas, and she has taken over our data business. Ken is now running our
optimization area and our international business. Julie and Ken are taking on several of Bryan Durkin's
responsibilities as he transitions to his role as an advisor. Also, I'm going to have Derek Sammann make a
few comments regarding the energy market at the end of my remarks.

These are obviously extraordinarily difficult and challenging times for all of us. The COVID-19 pandemic
has taken a devastating toll on human life and created unprecedented uncertainty around the world. It
has also changed our daily lives in ways that seemed unimaginable only a few weeks ago. The heroes in
this crisis are clear. Our sincere thanks go out to the entire medical community fighting this disease on the
front lines and aggressively working towards a vaccine. We also want to thank the many first responders
who continue to risk their lives to keep us safe.

At CME Group, we remain focused on the health and safety of our entire community. We took early
action and were the first in the industry to close our trading floor to protect our employees and market
participants who access that facility on a daily basis.

We also implemented work-from-home mandates and travel restrictions to protect employees across our
global offices. We are proud of the resilience of our team and how they have risen to this new challenge.

Our employees continue to work incredibly hard to help our customers and partners navigate through
this challenge and its increased uncertainty and volatility. With that in mind, I'd like to highlight a number
of metrics that we think reflect our performance this quarter and are important to consider as we look
forward. Our systems and processes performed extremely well with peak order traffic during the quarter,
and we saw very consistent response times. Our highest volume day on record took place in the first
quarter when we traded 58 million contracts on February 28.

Aside from the peaks, Q1 volume set records across many different product areas as our global clients
managed risk. Average daily volume for the quarter was 27 million, up 45% from 2019. In addition, our

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

volume in the first quarter from clients outside the United States was particularly strong, averaging 7.3
million contracts per day or up 56%. As a result, clients continued to be able to manage their risk across
all products and all time zones. We also maintained our industry-leading clearing function to provide
safeguards for every trade. In response to increased volatility, we raised margins on many products across
most asset classes. These prudent risk management policies were reviewed with both our clearinghouse
risk committees and our regulators. We are in daily contract -- contact with our regulators to ensure the
health of our markets during these unprecedented peaks of volatility.

Let me turn to the trading floor for a moment. Our options volumes in key products, especially interest
rates and equities that have traditionally relied on the floor, have held up well since we closed it. We've
successfully assisted many clients who trade on the floor to the screen, leveraging our own front-end
platform in order to quickly register and onboard a significant number of new users over a short period.
And in the 5 weeks since then, interest rate options as a percentage of interest rate futures, have
remained at roughly the same levels. So far, these volumes are actually ahead of where they were in the
last few days that the pits were open.

As many of you know, we have made a significant effort to increase our global sales presence. We began
to make an investment several years ago and to deepen our client coverage around the globe, and that
has served us extremely well with our regionally-focused sales model.

Today, more than half our sales staff is based outside the United States. We have sales professionals
in 19 cities, located in 15 countries around the world. Our sales, product management, clearing and
operation teams have worked closely together to handle client engagement during this pandemic with
client interactions at record high. Client feedback consistently mentions that our proactive outreach stands
out compared to others in our industry. We believe these efforts will continue to pay off. We saw broad-
based strength across all customer groups including: asset managers, hedge funds, banks, prop trading
firms, commercials and retail.

Our retail business was up more than 70% growth with considerable strength in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

Last, but certainly not least, we made considerable progress during Q1 to integrate the NEX business. We
divested NEX Exchange, and we integrated our London offices where more than 600 of our employees
work. We completed over 290 cross-selling meetings to clients from both our traditional futures business
and those of the cash and optimization business we acquired. For reference, that compares with 400 of
these cross-selling meetings during the full year of 2019.

The largest percentage of these meetings continue to be focused on new clients in our interest rate and
FX and options businesses. And we also are seeing success with Optimization, EBS, BrokerTec and data
services.

To summarize the first quarter, the market environment was challenging for all of us on the professional
and personal level. I am proud of the dedication of our employee base as they stepped up to the
challenge. We also appreciate the trust that our market participants have in our ability to deliver results.
Looking ahead, we do not know yet what the long-term impact of COVID-19 will be, but we do know that
financial markets are an important part of maintaining our economy and, ultimately, recovering from this
tragedy.

As we move forward through 2020, our strategy remains the same: to build strong global benchmark
offerings with deep liquidity around the clock; to continue to -- our commitment to offer all of these asset
classes on common platforms; to deliver world-class risk management and capital efficiencies; to promote
broad participation, offer robust distribution and continue developing our strong channel partnerships.

We look forward to answering any questions you have. But before that, I'm going to turn the call over to
Derek Sammann. Derek?

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Thank you, Terry. As Terry mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused increased uncertainty and
elevated volatility across all of our asset class, excluding -- including our global crude oil market. I'd like to
take a moment to provide our perspective on what happened in the crude oil market last week to further
context [ to use ] most of these events.

Overall, the WTI futures market performed as they were designed in a challenging market environment.
And I'll share a few comments on what we saw in the market to illustrate that further. Continued
downward price pressure and a significantly steepening contango have created unique challenges for the
global oil market over the last few months. Along with a significant oversupply of oil, there has also been
a drastic reduction in global demand, with global daily oil consumption decreasing from 100 million barrels
a day to 70 million barrels a day. Heightened concerns about storage capacity in the U.S. and abroad have
intensified the downward pressure on oil prices as well.

In early April, anticipating that these market dynamics may create the potential for negative pricing, CME
Group proactively informed our regulator, our clearing firms and the marketplace that our trading and
risk management systems were capable of handling negative prices in the WTI contract should market
dynamics require it.

Prepared for such an eventuality, we saw WTI trade negative on April 20, driven by the same
fundamentals I mentioned a moment ago: oversupply, reduced demand and an increasingly full U.S.
storage. Our WTI contract reflected these challenging underlying dynamics on Monday as the cash and
futures markets were converging going into Tuesday's final settlement of our WTI physically-delivered
contracts.

I should also note that while negative prices are rare, they're not entirely new in energy and power
markets. We've seen multiple examples of negative price in energy and power in the U.S., Germany
and the UK. I'd also like to briefly comment on the strength of WTI as a global benchmark. Today, WTI
represents 56% of the global trade in crude oil futures, including more than 60% in April. WTI is the
market's choice for managing crude oil exposure, and we believe that is because optimal commodity
benchmarks are based on physically-delivered products. Physical delivery is the gold standard of these
contracts because it ensures convergence with the underlying cash market. Commercial and end-user
customers who participate in physical oil markets need the certainty that convergence provides so that
they can optimally manage their underlying risks.

WTI futures settle with actual transactions that result in physical delivery as opposed to other products,
which are disconnected from the physical and settled via assessments.

We're pleased that WTI markets continue to reflect broad participation from all client segments around the
world, and in every time zone. Year-to-date, our overall crude and refined products volume during Asian
trading hours is up 148% and Europe has increased by 48%. Importantly, we also continue to provide our
clients with the leading crude oil options tools, which have grown 49% in the first quarter of this year and
are particularly important to our clients in times of heightened volatility.

In summary, against this backdrop of extremely challenging market dynamics, our benchmark [ of ]
physically delivered WTI crude oil futures contract continues to perform to help our clients hedge and
transfer their risk in global oil markets.

With that, I'll turn the call over to John.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Terry -- thanks, Derek. As Terry mentioned, the investment in our technology and the dedication
of our employees served our clients well during this unprecedented time. During the first quarter, CME
generated more than $1.5 billion in revenue, up approximately 29% from last year. Expenses were very
carefully managed and on an adjusted basis, were $459 million for the quarter. And CME had an adjusted
effective tax rate of 23.6%, which resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.33.

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $38 million. During the quarter, CME paid out
$1.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of our annual variable dividend of $2.50 per share and our
regular dividend of $0.85 per share, which is up 13% from a year ago. CME's cash at the end of the
quarter was approximately $1 billion.

We continue to pay down our debt. We have approximately $100 million of outstanding commercial paper,
which we'll pay down by the end of the year. This quarter, we achieved our 1x debt-to-EBITDA target. We
continue to progress on the integration of our legacy BrokerTec and EBS trading systems. Our technology
and operations teams continue to work towards a migration of the BrokerTec platform to Globex in the
fourth quarter with EBS following in 2021. Our testing environment is up and BrokerTec clients are testing
the system. We will be working closely with our customers during the next several months while we
navigate the added complexity of remote working environments, but at this time, we continue to target
the fourth quarter. At this point, we continue to expect our operating expense for the year, excluding
license fees, to be in the $1.64 billion to $1.65 billion range. In addition, our tax and CapEx guidance
remains unchanged. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial
highlights and details.

In summary, we are very pleased with the performance of the company. Our employees adapted to
the challenges of this environment and worked relentlessly on behalf of market participants. Our global
employees, along with the investments we've made in our technology systems and processes ensured the
markets operated well and risk was effectively managed.
In closing, I hope you and your families are healthy and safe during this difficult time. We would like to
now open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] John Peschier and I will be available today
for any follow-ups you might have after the call. Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

First question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I guess, Derek, just to follow-up on your comments and WTI and the relevance of that. I guess, could
you talk about, obviously, the health of your customers and then really the utility of the product for both
commercial and noncommercial users as we think about what's happened here in the last couple of weeks
with regard to negative pricing?

I mean, obviously, the headlines haven't been good. You've seen ETFs change, kind of rolling forward
some of the contracts. I guess, just behaviorally, can you talk about how your customers are acting? And
ultimately, the utility of the product going forward, if you could kind of walk through that again as to why
you still view WTI as the most relevant benchmark within that asset class?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Dan, it's Terry Duffy. Before Derek goes into answering that question, I want to touch on one thing that
you referenced because I think it's a little bit incorrect. The headlines haven't been good as I think is
what you said. The headlines were not good on day 1. I think that was a lot because a lot of people didn't
understand exactly what happened. That narrative has changed dramatically. I'm sure you've seen.

So I think that the narrative and the headline associated with what went on in negative pricing is
completely different than it was a week ago, Monday. So I just want to make sure that we're clear on that.
Derek?

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Dan, it's Derek. Thanks for -- yes, thanks, Terry. Thanks for the question. It's certainly topical, Dan.
So let me start by talking about the utility of WTI. I mean, there's -- let's talk about what WTI is. We
firmly believe that the kind of the optimal benchmarks are based on physically-delivered contracts. As I
mentioned in my comments, physical delivery is the widely believed to be, and we firmly believe, the gold
standard for exchange commodity contracts as it ensures convergence with the cash market. So when you
think about WTI and what it represents, it actually represents expirations. So on April 21, the physically
settled WTI contracts settled at $10.01. That is the price at which over 2.4 million barrels were delivered
at that price. So when customers are looking for a product that represents the actual underlying physical
value of that asset, physically-delivered contracts that converged to cash is that standard.

So I think it's worth talking about what is the difference between WTI with physically settled product
that delivers you the actual price of the asset itself versus, say, Brent, for example. And it's worth noting
that the Financial Times just ran an article this morning, came out about an hour ago, that references
the disconnect that Brent futures are seeing right now from the underlying convergence with the futures
-- with the underlying futures that are traded or actually the underlying physical cargoes that are being
assessed in the North Sea right now.

So that difference between ICE Brent futures is a financially-settled contract, it does not settle the physical
delivery. What physical barrels are priced on is Dated Brent, which is trading between $5 and $7 below
ICE Brent right now. So when we focus on the utility of the contract, to come back to your question, Dan,
contracts that connect the underlying physical market and deliver that actual asset at that price is what
our physical end-user customers are looking to use our contracts for.

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

When you look at our business year-to-date, on the client side, our fastest-growing participants on
the revenue side are our corporates and our buy-side and bank participants. So you see broad-based
participation from end-user customers, whether it's the buy-and-hold guys or whether it's the commercial
customers, those have been our fastest-growing participants year-to-date in this contract.

And I would say that the last piece of your question relative to kind of what does this look like on a going-
forward basis? Listen, the market has seen some unprecedented impacts of the global oil market right
now.

This is not just a U.S. story. This is a global story. If you actually look at the floating storage that is being
utilized, it's estimated that about 10% of all freights in global right now is being used for floating storage
for oil coming out of the North Sea.

So the oversupply story is not just the U.S. story. The steepness of the curve in the front end of WTI is
simply reflective of the underlying fundamentals of supply-demand storage globally, not just in the U.S.
and that's what customers use our products for. They need to know that their underlying physical risk is
linked with the contract, and they can deliver at that price. So that's how we think about it. That's why
our customers are using our products. And that -- I just want to put some context relative to how WTI
represents the actual underlying physical barrel and how WTI -- the Brent contract, the Brent futures
contract doesn't converge to spot. That's actually priced at about a $6 or $7 premium, I believe, right
now, to Dated Brent, which is the physical cargoes.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi.

Benjamin Joseph Herbert
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Just want to -- hope you could give us some color on the APAC volume strength in the quarter, just the
progression, given some of the rolling economic shutdowns and then reopenings. And then also, any detail
you can provide somewhere on April to date?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

I'll ask Ken Vroman and Julie Winkler to make comments, so either Ken on Julie can go ahead and start.

Kendal Vroman
Senior Managing Director of International & Optimization Services

Sure. Thanks, Terry. Yes, to your point, we have seen very, very strong volumes in Asia through Q1. We
saw that up 73% year-over-year, which was really good. And as we noted, in China and other places, this
is despite economic shutdowns across various countries in Asia. We do see that they're probably leading
the world in terms of coming back now. So while we've been able to -- as they come back online, we think
that growth will continue. China is an example, we saw that up just 7% year-over-year. Last year was a
tough year given some of the trade wars that were going on that dampened volume. But we do see ADV
growth there for the first time since Q4 of 2018.

And when you take the China story in combination with Greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan,
it becomes an even stronger growth story. So we think temporarily, these dislocations based on the
pandemic, have been worked through. And we think that's a testament to the investments we've made in
terms of education in the area, marketing, technology and infrastructure. And importantly, our sales team
and the work they've done there and seamlessly transitioned into a more digital outreach.

And so we think while we've seen volumes, to answer the second part of your question, move back into a
more normal range or a more consistent range with the run rate of 2019 in April, we feel good about the
platform that, that positions us for growth.

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Was hoping to switch gears to interest rates for a second. Obviously, a lot of debate about a 0% interest
rate environment and what that means for you guys. So just curious if you could provide any color on
what you've been seeing from a client perspective already as a result of that.

And I guess the things I would highlight, obviously, volumes in April have been very soft. Open interest is
down, in particular, on Eurodollar futures. And I think the open -- the large open interest holders that you
often cite as a, I guess, indicator of growth, I think it's also down 13% from the peak.

So just any more in-depth color for things that we may not be seeing happening underneath the surface?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Great question, Alex, and I'm going to ask Sean to comment. But as you know, the volumes in April
have been down pretty much across the global marketplaces, including our interest rate complex with
Eurodollars. But there's a lot of things that we've been discussing and talking about and watching
fundamentally that I think Sean can give you a little bit of color on that we find very interesting. Sean?

Sean Tully, you there? Did we lose him, Sean?

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

His line, I think, has been muted.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Did Sean Tully drop off?

Operator

No, sir, his line is still connected.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

All right. So why don't we come back to that, Alex, your question in a second and go to the next one. I
don't know what -- why Sean can't get through. We'll be right back to you Alex, on that question. I have
it. And John Peschier and Pietrowicz, you heard Alex's question, correct?

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

Yes. We heard it. We'll -- Sean is working to get back on the line.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Okay. So I can give you -- I mean, John, if you want to -- we've all been discussing this. Sean, is that
you?

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

It is -- apparently, Sean, he's on the line, but we can't hear him. So I think, Alex, we can come back when
Sean gets on, and so we'll go to the next question, and then we'll circle back to this one once Sean is able
to speak.

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. But just on that point, Alex, we've been talking a little bit about what is going on with the issuance
of debt. Sean referenced on a call with us just the other day, we're looking at $3.7 trillion of additional
debt, of which we think we'll see a lot of coupon issuance associated with that against our treasury
complex, so we do believe that, that is very optimistic for that business. So even though we're in a 0%
rate environment, to your point, on the short term of Eurodollars, we are still seeing a lot of activity in the
back end of the Eurodollars, along with the options on Euros and across the treasury complex.

And again, the more debt we're assuming or issuing with coupons, we do feel that people will be needing
to manage that debt. So there's a lot of positives there. I'm not sure, if Sean is going to get back on, but
he'll give you -- elaborate more in a second. So why don't we go to the next question and we'll come back
to Alex.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Sean might actually be part of this question too, but it's okay to defer as well, and he can answer when
he gets back on. Or if you guys maybe want to take a shot at it. It's just really -- it's along the rates line,
but it's from a different perspective. It is -- the question is, to what extent has the user base changed
substantially in April versus March?

Obviously, a lot of participation by proprietary trading firms and hedge funds and risk parity strategies
with basis trades. And so the question is, that seems -- I would surmise that it's dropped off a lot in April.
So maybe if you can confirm that as part of the decline in April versus March in the rates franchise? And
what you think it will take for those firms to reengage and begin trading again?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Brian, I'm not sure if Sean joined back yet. So if he didn't, Sean, are you there?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes, Terry. I'm back in. Can you hear me this time?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Go ahead, Sean.

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

Yes, we can hear you, Sean.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Did you hear the question?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

I apologize. I don't know what happened there. No. Can you repeat the question? I apologize.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes, sure...

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

I'm sorry, go ahead, Brian.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes, sure. I'll go ahead. So yes -- no, it's -- so Sean, so it's about the user base and the interest rate
franchise in April versus March. Obviously, after we get through a volatility period, we typically do see a lot
of the proprietary trading firms and hedge funds pare down their risk books. Maybe if you can comment to
what extent that has been the major driver of the volume decline in March to April? And what do you think
it will take for those firms to reengage in those strategies? Again, how long do you think that might be?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Thank you for the question, and apologies that I was cut off somehow earlier. In terms of our volumes,
the short end of the yield curve, in particular, the very front contracts, let's say, the Fed funds contracts,
for example, do become less interesting during a time of 0% interest rate policy and when we do not
expect the Federal reserve to change rates at the upcoming meeting. However, our deferred Eurodollar
futures become extremely interesting relative to the shape of the curve and the timing of when the Fed
might begin to become active again. Most importantly, you would have seen at the end of last week,
the Congressional Budget Office did announce a -- their estimated $3.7 trillion deficit for the Federal
government this year. This is, obviously, completely unprecedented in terms of its size. And if you think
about $3.7 trillion deficit, that's $3.7 trillion worth of additional treasury bills, notes and bonds that will
need to be issued this year, that will need to be risk-managed.

If you look at 2019, for example, the net issuance was $984 billion, so this is obviously multiples of
that. So we do expect to see increased activity in hedging across the treasury curve. With respect to the
increased issuance, you also saw our business grow dramatically between 2012 and 2018. Much of that
time during 0% interest rate policy with the additional products that we added, that allow people to much
more accurately manage their risk across the entire curve.

We've also seen huge innovation. We've obviously invested in innovation. We've invested in electronic
markets. We've invested in client acquisition. Our SOFR future is doing 50,000 a day, our Ultra Bond is
futures doing 233,000 contracts a day, our Ultra 10 is doing 293,000 contracts a day. Invoice Spreads
doing 148,000 contracts a day.

So I do expect, as you go further out the curve, there will be increased uncertainty. I do expect with the
increased treasury issuance, that, that will also create a much greater demand for risk management. And
I think our innovative products serve our clients well in this environment.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And just on the user base, the mix change between March and -- and obviously, there's a lot of
proprietary strategies engaged in March. How are you seeing those players in April? It looks like they
probably dropped off to a substantial extent. Do you think those players come back soon? Or I guess, it's
confirmed that or if you can confirm that, is that the large part of the drop-off from March to April?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

There's no question that you tend to see some reduction by leverage funds in particular and CPAs, when
you have a very large increase in margin requirements. We have invested as well in addition to the things

I mentioned earlier, in great margin and capital efficiencies over the years that help clients out. The thing I
would mention is, in March, we reached a new [ all-time ] portfolio margining efficiency delivered to clients
when margins increased. So $7 billion in margin savings in the month of March with portfolio margin.

We do expect the customers to come back in and to have to manage the increasing issuance by the U.S.
Treasury as the year progresses. In May, as you know, the treasury will be issuing for the first time in
many years, a 20-year bond issue. We will be -- that will be traded on the BrokerTec platform, and it will
be deliverable into our bond futures. So we do expect to see the same activity we have always seen with
the increased treasury issuance.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Brian, let me just add, this is Terry Duffy, that I think we've heard for years now with the rates going down
to where they're at, where are the participants going to come from? We saw them all show back up in
March to your earlier point, and then they dissipate a little bit in April. We, like any other business, cannot
measure the full year by a couple of weeks of trading. So the good news is, everybody is actively watching
our markets. It doesn't mean they're going to actually participate every single day. But I would not get too
hung up on a few weeks of trading. I think we have to measure this over the longer period, just like we've
seen over the last several years, and then we saw the record business that we saw, that we pointed on the
first quarter.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Terry, to that point, I mean, I think when you take a look at the last 10 years, April tends to be in the
bottom couple of months in our -- in terms of monthly volume. In fact, when you look at last year, we
did about 15.7 million contracts a day with -- and rates accounted for more than 50% of that activity. In
April, rates are accounting for about 38% of the activity. So the fact that we've seen some decline is not
unusual. In April, there's no rule. Easter tends to be in the month of April, so there's Good Friday, Easter
Monday. And also, this tends to be a period of time when there's spring breaks and the likes. So a bit
different environment this year, but a slower April is not uncommon.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes, but -- again, I don't want to belabor this, Brian, but at the same time, and we're all not in the same
room, so I don't want to start counter defending everybody, and I won't. Because everything we said is
true, but we do have to measure this over the long period. And there is a different fundamentals in today's
market than there was a year ago, as we all know. There's different fundamentals in today's market than
it was 6 weeks ago.

And I think Sean clearly pointed out what is happening from a fundamental side and now we have to see
how that transitions into how people want to manage that risk. And the value of it needs to be managed,
and we've definitely saw that happen in March.

Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point.

Christopher John Allen
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to circle back on crude. I understand the differences between WTI and Brent, the physical
settlement dynamics. So maybe if you can give us some color on the WTI customer base, maybe roughly
size how it breakdown between commercial speculators, market makers. What I'm trying to think through
is, if we do hit full capacity for storage perspective, whilst taking it, starting to shut in, how does that
impact the commercial base moving forward? And how does that filter through down to the speculator
base as well? Any color there would be helpful.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thank you very much, Chris. And to what we can deliver, Derek, why don't you go ahead in respond
to Chris' question?

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes. So thanks, Chris. Good question.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Be mindful of not using any names?

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes. No, it's a good question. I think that, Chris, you've asked us before, kind of, what that spread of that
business. I can't give you a percent. I can't give you names. But what I can tell you is, when you look at
the growth in the participation of our energy market overall, and certainly, crude is a strong reflection of
that, it's a big part of our overall franchise. As I mentioned before, the fastest-growing participants in our
energy franchise this year is buy side, corporates and banks. Those are the 3 fastest-growing participants.
So if you ask about who's participating more broadly, who's extending the utilization, it's exactly those
customers that we focus on for that end-user connection to our core product. We haven't seen that change
in the last couple of weeks, and we don't anticipate that changing. As I mentioned, the reason and utility
of a WTI contract being physically delivered is that it converges directly to those underlying barrels.

I think the question that you're posing is, if this contango continues to stay steep the way it is, what's the
impact on the global oil market? Well, as I mentioned before, this is not an issue that's only impacting WTI
right now. You're seeing the Dated Brent trade at a significant discount to ICE Brent futures right now for
exactly the same reasons. So I think it's about $5 -- between a $5 and $7 disconnect right now.

So global oversupply and lack of demand and the storage issues globally is impacting the overall oil
market. So it's not a function of customers saying, "Hey, WTI is no longer my physical risk," because the
reason people use WTI is once the export ban was lifted in 2015, it became the underlying physical assets
they were exposed to, if they were in Europe and in Asia actually importing those products. The reason I
mentioned, at the top of the call, in my comments on the broadening and accelerated use of participation
in our markets in energy, crude and refined from Europe and Asia is explicitly because it's reflective of
the globalization that Terry alluded to, and Ken spoke to at the top of the call, and the significant growth
we've seen in end-user participants in our energy market. So triple-digit growth out of Asia; 50% -- 48%,
I think, percent growth in Europe is indicative of the way in which WTI has become a global benchmark
and that is the physical risk that people are facing.

To your point about storage, I can't control for that. The market can't control for that. Nobody loves the
fact that oil is priced as low as it is right now. Dated Brent is trading this morning and I think I said about
a $5 to $7 discount to ICE Brent, and it's reflecting exactly what our physical market is reflecting. So
Dated Brent and WTI reflective physical, ICE Brent futures don't have the physical component to it. So it's
actually pricing -- it doesn't reflect the underlying price of the barrel of oil in the North Sea right now. So
you want to be a little bit careful when you look at the ICE Brent rate right now because it does not reflect
where you can sell a barrel.

Just given the high level of volatility during the quarter in energy and elsewhere, how has the
clearinghouse operated? How have FCMs held up? And any significant changes made during the quarter,
given some of the big news that we've seen?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Mike, it's Terry Duffy. The clearinghouse has done as usual, an exceptional job managing this risk. I spend
most of my time, especially over the last 6 to 8 weeks, tethered to Sunil Cutinho, the President of our
clearinghouse and his team, as we continue to go through these unprecedented times. And it's not just
me, it's many members of our management team that are working with Sunil and others to make sure
that we're doing everything to be able to manage this risk. I think in my opening remarks, you heard me
reference about margins. This is a very big component of how we operate CME to make sure that we have
products margined properly. So we're not putting the system at risk. Today, we're holding record amounts
of margin on deposit because of the way we're concerned with the volatility and with the unprecedented
times that we live in.

So I have nothing but kudos for the entire clearinghouse staff. They've done a remarkable job. The
systems and the operations that my COO, Julie Holzrichter, put into place along with Sunil and Kevin
Kometer is second to none. So we're very proud of this. We're still working towards our SPAN 2 margin
methodology, which we're still excited about, which will be more advanced on margining going forward,
but we'll keep our original system as well. So all in all, I will tell you -- and I don't know if Sunil's on this
call or not, but the clearinghouse is operated at the highest level in the 40 years that I've been in the
business, in the 18.5 years that I've been CEO and now Chairman -- Chairman, and now CEO.

Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.

Richard Henry Repetto
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And first, I hope all the CME team and their families are all healthy and safe, and congrats on a
phenomenal quarter. I got to turn back to the WTI question and to Derek again. It sounds like you made
the case for physical delivery, so it sounds like there's no option to go -- an option to cash and physical
deliver to move the contract like that. So then it comes back to the storage issue. And I know you said the
spread was around $7 -- it's been $7 or $8. But if you look back over the last year, the spread has really
been around $5 to $6. And that day that it did price negatively, the spread was a negative $50 to $60. So
I guess the question is -- and if you talk to industry participants, they also are well aware of the storage
issues in Cushing. And it sounds -- you improved the storage in the past 5 years. But what can you do to
improve the storage going forward? Is there capacity to improve the storage, so this -- it doesn't get that
wide again.

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Rich, it's Derek. Yes, thanks...

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Go ahead, Derek.

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Okay. Look, it's a good question. There's 3 overall drivers that changed. I think you guys have written
about this. I think people understand this. We've got this massive oversupply with Saudi and Russia
piloting. We got this massive disruption on the demand side, and I referenced, 100 million barrels a day
consumption reduced down to 70. The stat that was on the news last night, widely reported. Air traffic

is down 95%. Miles driven in shapes -- in states that are shut in, either in Europe or U.S. is down 75%.
So there's just -- there's no demand, there's oversupply and then you got storage issues. So I want to
be careful how far I opine on this physical infrastructure on storage, but what I can tell you is this, that
there has been a significant expansion of use of floating storage, both in Europe and in U.S. and in Asia.
I think I mentioned earlier in our conversation that alternative forms of storage is floating storage, VLCCs
or ULCCs, which are the carriers that carry oil are being increasingly filled up and just serve this floating
storage and docked out in various places in Europe and U.S. right now.

The other piece that's going on right now is that as refiners have reduced their runs, the crude can't stop
as quickly as refiners can run their run. So we have been speaking to multiple folks in our world asking
us those questions, how can I get involved in the physical delivery process? And they're seeking to find
alternative forms of opportunity.

With the steepness of the curve right now, Rich, and I said this is true in Dated Brent as well as WTI, this
is a global phenomenon. So this isn't a function of switching from one product to another product. This is
underlying fundamental supply and demand overlaid with the storage issues.

So I think we're starting to see floating stores take up some of that excess. We are seeing folks
determining where and how they can convert some of those utilities to address the storage. But again,
that's not what we can control for. What we can control for is how effectively our products converge on the
day of exploration and how our markets reflect the underlying fundamentals, and the use of our markets
by those end-user customers who in our engagement, particularly, the commercial customers recognize
the contract did what it needed to do, which was converge on the day of exploration.

And as I said, a little over 2.4 million barrels of crude got delivered in on the basis of that delivery
settlement price on April 21 at $10.01.

And the last thing I'd say is with the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 across a range of physical
markets, we are seeing historically high levels of basis differential between cash and futures. We've seen
it in the gold market with EFP prices moving out as there are concerns about moving gold globally. We're
seeing it in some of the cattle market products about where and how delivery can get done and how
those markets are converging. I will tell you, every one of our physical-delivered products have converged
because they operate effectively to serve the end-user needs of those participants.

Richard Henry Repetto
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Do you expect Brent that seaborne delivered? Do you expect that to trade negatively as well?

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

I can't tell you as it depends on how steep that curve goes right now. As I said, there's an FT piece that
came out literally just before we all jumped on this call, explicitly calling out the very steepness of the
front end of the Dated Brent curve right now and that disconnect. I think it was as high as $8 last week.
So if we continue to see demand as low as it is, not return, but here's the beauty of the market, Rich, if
you look at the forward curve, and if you look at the forward curve right now and turn up the steepness of
the contango, the very front month contract is trading significantly below the second month. That's trading
a little bit below third month that -- the market is telling us with the pricing of the forward curve that by
the -- probably 6, 9 months out, that forward curve roughly flattens out. We're just seeing the steepness
in the front end.

So I think the FT has made some really good points this morning and points that we've been looking at,
where is the physical Brent. Where is Dated Brent? Not where ICE future is. You can't sell a molecule
based on the ICE futures price. The molecules get sold on Dated Brent. That's the physically-delivered
product. And that's what FT is pointing out is that is a growing disconnect and is following the same
fundamental drivers the WTI is right now. It's a storage issue, it's a stand issue and it's a demand issue,
and it's a supply issue.

So the good news is that there's lots of different opinions how quickly demand is going to return, and
that's where the volatility in our market. That's why we're still doing 3.5 million contracts even in April in
this environment to help customers manage their risk.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Derek. And just to reconfirm, Rich, we don't need the FT to validate the fundamentals that we've
been seeing in the marketplace for numerous years. And everything that Derek and his team are working
on a daily basis. So Derek, thank you for your answer. Rich, thanks for your question.

Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays.

Jeremy Edward Campbell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Thanks for all the great color on the market so far. Since some of that has been pretty well traveled, I
just wanted to ask a little bit about your cross-selling efforts that might help flush some of the natural
volume headwinds you might see in some products. I think you mentioned doing 290 cross-sell meetings
in the first quarter versus 400 for the full year last year. Can you just help us think about: one, what the
length of this cross-selling cycle might look like? And then two, what the client engagement and feedback
looks like either from optimization clients, maybe looking to use futures to lower capital charges or typical
futures cash, OTC traders looking to dip their toes in the waters of other product structures?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Jeremy. I'm going to turn to Julie Winkler and let her respond to that question. And if Ken wants
to add a little something on optimization, but I really think this is more towards Julie's area. Julie?

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Sure. Thank you for the question. So this has definitely been a challenging environment, but the client
engagement that we've been able to drive and the cross-sell statistics that you mentioned are definitely
accurate. So year-to-date, through the end of April, we've seen our sales activity up about 150%
versus the same period in 2019. So the outreach has continued, even though we've been in this virtual
environment, so contacting clients via calls, e-mails, video conferences, you would expect. And what we
saw with the 290 cross introductions, the biggest month we had was in February, where we had 135. More
specifically, that was driven by an uptick within the buy side in our commercial client segment in the U.S.
and this number compared to, in all of 2019, we did 400 cross introduction meetings.

The largest percentage, as we previously reported as well, of those cost introductions continue to be
focused on really new clients in our futures and options, both interest rate and FX franchises. But we are
seeing successes, as you mentioned, across new introductions into our optimization services. So if you can
think about the environment that we're in where clients do have increased need to manage their risk, they
are looking at new things like triResolve to manage their margin exposure to one another as well as data.
We haven't talked about data yet today. But in a period of unprecedented volatility, clients need data to be
able to put this data within their trading models to forecast that for future trading events.

And so those cross introductions, I would say, have upticked more within the last quarter than even what
we saw last year. But it's something that we're continuing to monitor and client engagement has been --
and feedback has been really strong. We invested a lot in our global sales team over the last few years.
And having those, that regionally based with sales leader and personnel on the ground, means that we
have that trust with our customers and the need for face-to-face meetings is less important when we built
those relationships. So that part has been great.

And we're also taking advantage of this work-from-home environment to continue to do a lot of education
with our sales team and make sure that they're really prepared for those cross introductions. So with that,
I will turn it over to Ken to add anything from an optimization perspective.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Ken, real brief on a little optimization.

Kendal Vroman
Senior Managing Director of International & Optimization Services

Yes. Very briefly, I think Julie's team's efforts are really kind of the lifeblood that's driving the optimization
business. The one observation I would say is that we learned a lot in the first quarter about the
importance of these businesses, and they performed well. Because CME was so quickly able to move to
a work-from-home environment, we were very well-prepared to help our customers during this time,
and our services performed very well. And having acquired NEX 18 months ago and working through the
integration, I think, we can sit here and say, coming out of the Q1 that these services are in high demand
from our customers, and they're even better positioned based on their performance during this difficult
time coming out of the first quarter.

Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I think Sean actually answered my original question. So I don't think there's much more to add. But
since I'm back here, just a quick follow-up on, I guess, Terry's comments -- on your comments on the
Eurodollar franchise on the -- or the floor trading, rather.

You made it almost seem like closing the floor hasn't had an impact because the percentage between
futures and options has remained stable. And I guess I would challenge it to some degree and say, well,
just because the percentage is unchanged, doesn't mean that pie hasn't shrunk, right? So maybe Sean
or somebody else can flush out a little bit what you've seen actually in terms of trading strategies, how
people have behaved, et cetera?

And then related to that, considering that the -- I think the trading on the floor is much lower economics
than trading electronically, wondering to what degree you're already exploring, like, hey, has this market
shifted enough where maybe we don't really need the floor as much anymore as we needed, and there
could be a substantial cost savings maybe in the future if we never reopen again. So maybe any sort of
color on the cost of the floor would be helpful as well.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Okay, so -- and I'm going to let Sean take the first part as it relates to potential different strategies
associated with floor versus screen, if there is any -- if there are any differences that he's seen. I gave you
percentages of raw apples-to-apples. Your point about the pie could be valid, I'm not saying it's not. And
then I will comment more about where we're at as far as our objectives as it relates to the trading floor.
So let me go first to Sean to talk about that.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Terry, thank you very much. Terry mentioned in his prepared remarks, if you look at -- and as Alex
you referred to, so thank you, Alex, for the question, our options as a percentage of our interest rate
futures, since the closure of the floor, are running at 39%. And if you look at 2019 as the base case,
our interest rate options traded an average daily volume of 36% of the relevant futures. So from that

perspective, it looks like it's been a very healthy transition to the floor. In addition to that, you'll know well
for many years now, we have made very significant investments in electronification of our markets. And in
particular, we have instruments called user-defined spreads. So there are many predefined spreads that
users can ask on a request for quote for prices for. Then in addition to that, there are almost an unlimited
number of user-defined spreads that users can request quotes on from our market makers up to 30 legs.

So we have seen very robust activity on the box since the closure of the floor. And the -- we've seen, I'd
say, all of the different types of strategies that we ever saw on the floor, continue to trade on the box.
We've seen, as I said, actually a growth in the percentage about options versus futures. I'd also mention
some of the innovations that we had launched, and we're continuing to work on have gotten greater
traction. I'll give you an example. We have a function called a Committed Cross where a broker is able
to put in both sides of the trade. And if they better the market, they get a portion of the trade guarantee
to them. Why is that important? We were trying to electronically replicate the experience on the floor for
both the end customers, the market makers as well as the brokers.

And I'm very pleased to say that while Committed Cross was trading just 10,000 or so a day in January,
we're trading 74,000 today since the closure of the floor. So our innovations are working, our investments
in electronic markets are working. Participants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior
to the closure of the floor. And in fact, our options volumes relative to futures have increased relative to
last year since the closure of the floor. I hope that helps.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

And let me just add a few things. Alex and Sean, thank you for that response. The trading floor, the costs
associated with it are roughly around $20 million annually, I believe, is what the number is. But John
Pietrowicz or John Peschier can correct me.

As it relates to the floor products. As you know, back in 2000, we had thresholds associated with them
about the viability of their existence. And you know the futures did not meet those thresholds, but
subsequently we closed them several years after they did not meet the thresholds. We didn't do it right
away. It was actually many years.

The options on futures, none of the products meet the threshold today, except for one, to my knowledge,
and that is Eurodollar options. So we are going to continue making sure we maintain our thresholds and
our guidelines that we have agreed to many, many years ago, but most importantly, Alex, as it relates
to the trading floor, we will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where the health
officials and government officials are going to come down as it relates to multiple people getting together
in a single location. As you know, trading floors or trading environments are very close environments and
a very difficult to -- with this virus to continue to keep everybody safe. I have 54 employees that have to
be down there to staff those. And then we have hundreds of traders and clerks that are down there and
we have an obligation to do the right thing and not overreact either way.

So we'll make those decisions with government officials and health officials as time goes on. But I just
want to point out that the cost is not extraordinary. And the threshold levels have not been met in futures,
subsequently closed. The threshold amount in futures has not been met, but still open, except for one
product, Eurodollars. Does that help you?

Maybe a follow-up for Sean. I am sorry if I already missed this, but why exactly do you think, Treasury
issuance will have any impact on volumes in a 0% rate QE world? I guess, Treasury debt tripled from 2007
to 2014, but CME volumes did not grow over that period. So curious what's different this time?

And then just a second part question -- part of the question. Just a second question, basically, maybe
for John, really more of a cleanup question. On the balance sheet, I see performance bonds tripled to
$100 billion. Just remind us the dynamics here on that line item, kind of what drove the spike? Is that
sustainable? And more importantly, how do we think about any P&L impacts?

So -- yes, Terry, do you want to...

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes, go ahead, Sean.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

So I'd say that our marketplace today is completely different than it was prior to 2010. As I said earlier,
we've spent an enormous amount of money, effort on product innovation that has, for example, made
our Treasury complex much more attractive. We added our Ultra Bond futures in 2010, that this year
have done 233,000 contracts a day. We added our Ultra 10 Year futures just a couple of years ago,
which are doing 293,000 contracts a day. These allow participants to much more accurately hedge their
cash treasuries with the underlying futures products. In addition to that, we also have made significant
adjustments to our products. So as you know, a little over a year ago, we adjusted our 2-year note
futures, minimum pricing increments, reducing them by half.

I'm very glad to say that we believe that around 200,000 contracts a day of our 2-year note futures today
that are attributable to the decline in the minimum price increment. When you reduce that minimum price
increment, you reduce the cost to trade by reducing the bid/offer spread.

In addition to significantly reducing the execution costs to trade by things like changing minimum price
increments, we've massively improved the capital margin and total cost efficiencies through things like
portfolio margining against interest rate swaps. Again, didn't exist during that time period that you were
talking about.

In terms of interest rate swaps, I mentioned earlier, actually, we had an all-time revenue record in Q1
in interest rate swaps. And in March, in particular, as I did mention earlier, we saw an all-time record
portfolio margining benefit to our customers of $7 billion. So we see very significant differences in terms
of our products, in terms of our offerings. In addition to that, we could talk for a long time about our
investment in sales force. So if you look -- going back to the period of time you're referring to, the bulk of
our sales force sat in the United States, and the bulk of that sales force set in Chicago.

Today, most of our sales force is outside of the United States and so we've much more deeply penetrated
the global market.

Last, if you go back to 2012, another key difference and something you've heard me talk about on
earnings calls before, is because of these efficiencies, because of our improvement in sales, because we
have invested so much in electronic markets, our penetration of the cash treasury bond market has grown
dramatically. So if you look back in 2012, our treasury futures traded 55% of the average daily volume of
the cash treasury bond market. Today, we are trading more than 121% of that underlying cash treasury

bond market -- the treasury futures. So I think for all of those reasons, we're in a completely different
place today than we were in that. I hope that helps.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Sean. In terms of -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Christian, go ahead.

Chinedu Bolu
Autonomous Research LLP

Yes, I was going to say, yes, John, please, on the balance sheet.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Christian. So in terms of the balance sheet, what you see in terms of the performance bonds,
that's the positions that the customers put up in support of their trading activity and we did see an
increase on our balance sheet in terms of performance bonds, which primarily represents cash, put
up at the clearinghouse, increase from about $37 billion in the fourth quarter of '19 to $100 billion in
the first quarter of this year. So a pretty marked increase. And that's really due to the activity at the
clearinghouse and the volatility. So higher the volatility, and more activity, you'll see an increase in the
amount of performance bonds put up. Now how that flows through the -- into the income statement is we
earn money on cash, put up at the clearinghouse by our customers. And generally speaking, we have a
spread between what the IOER is, the interest on excess reserves. And we share that with our customers.
Generally, it's about 80% gets rebated back to the customers; about 20% we keep in support of managing
the collateral. We also earn based upon the noncash collateral as well, and that flows through our revenue
line. But to give you an idea, in last quarter, average balances in terms of cash that we earn on increased
from about $28.1 billion to $40 billion, so a $12 billion increase in the average balance, and we earned 29
basis points in the fourth quarter and 19 basis points in the first quarter.

Now just to point out, the average cash balances through the month of April is about $89 billion in the
month of April, so about more than double what we had on average for the first quarter. Now the IOER
did come down to 10 basis points. And again, we keep a spread of approximately 80%-20%, 80% to our
customers, about 20% to us. And so the customers are earning 8 basis points, and we're earning 2 basis
points.

Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.

Kwun Sum Lau
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Continuing on the balance sheet and capital management, so you had $1 billion in cash, and you reached
your 1x leverage target at the end of the first quarter. But given the COVID uncertainty, would you raise
more debt in order to have more cash? Or you're confident about your cash position and can pay down
some debt? And I think more importantly, how should investors think about your variable dividend policy
this year?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Owen. John, you can go ahead and address that, and I might chime in as well.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. Thanks, Owen. In terms of our capital structure, we're very comfortable with our capital
structure. We -- like I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've achieved our 1x debt-to-EBITDA target.

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

We have about $100 million in commercial paper that we will be paying down in relatively short order. So
with that, that's the remaining amount of debt that's prepayable.

So we feel very comfortable with our capital structure. We had -- as you saw this quarter, we've got very
strong leverage in our business model, and we have a very high investment-grade rating, which we think
is important for the firm.

So very comfortable in terms of our capital structure. In terms of our ability to pay down debt, like I
mentioned, we got $100 million in prepayable debt, which we'll pay down in short order. And I think in
terms of our annual variable dividend, the dividend is obviously a function of our Board, and that's a Board
decision. We have been very focused on ensuring that we've got an appropriate capital return policy, and
we've been utilizing our annual variable dividend and our regular dividend as a means to return cash back
to our shareholders. Our regular dividend, we increased 13% to $0.85 a share. And we have a -- what we
think is a really good and prudent dividend policy.

The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

So another one for Derek around the energy market dynamics. And the question is really not so much
about the merits of physical delivery versus cash settlement or Brent versus WTI. I'm more curious about
the outlook of U.S. oil production, and given the fact that that's likely to decline over the coming year to
bring the markets back into balance. Obviously, as the demand side of the equation is kind of difficult to
predict right now, how do you see this decline in oil production impacting utilization of WTI?

And in terms of exposure, Derek, I think you talked about, in terms of growth by different customer
categories, but any way you can give us a sense of just kind of run rate exposures in terms of total
revenues or total volumes of WTI by kind of the buckets that you've described in one of the prior
questions.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Alex, thank you. And Derek, obviously, we can't predict future volumes, but Derek why don't you go ahead
and address Alex' question.

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes. So it's tough because the predicate is where the oil market is going to go. What I can do, Alex,
is point you as we all look at, as I mentioned earlier, look at the forward curve. And if you look at the
forward curve and look at where the market is expecting some amount of demand to return, I think, that
the real risk here, frankly, is -- and this is why the refiners have been quicker to reduce their runs and
take less crude into refined because they can respond more quickly to shifts in demand. The concern is it
takes longer to shut an oil well down. The concern now is not that there won't be terminal demand for the
next year.

The question now is as states are beginning to open and as you start to see air miles start to fly and miles
driven start to increase as they go back to work, the issue now is wells are reluctant to close because it
takes them a while to restart.

There is a very real chance that if -- and this is the math refiners are -- that producers are doing right
now, should we shut down? And how long does it take me out to reduce my excess stocks? And then by
the time you see demand starting to slowly ramp and then accelerate as markets open up again, and
demand returns, they don't want to be behind. There is a real risk right now that actually if too many
folks shut down their production, now you've got the uncertainty of, well, when demand returns am I
going to be behind the curve and are we going to see some rubber-banding back, the fact of oversupply

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

22

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

now, people are overly shut down, then demand returns, but then the producers can't return that quickly
enough. So the interesting dynamic is it's the -- people express different opinions as to how quickly
demand is going to return. I can't control for that. What we are watching is the forward curve, and we are
watching there's a reluctance for producers to shut down because it takes them off-line for too long. So if
you do see a rapid return of demand, they're going to be behind.

And so when you just look at the COVID uncertainty, on top of the election uncertainty, that's keeping
people in the market. We are not seeing people shutter positions, close down and sit and wait for demand
to return because everybody knows, by the time you see it, it's too late.

So I can't give you a precise answer, but look at the forward curve, look at the continued participation
in our market. Our WTI futures' open interest has been between 2.2 million and 2.4 million contracts for
the last 6 months. That has continued to be more or less in play. We have seen, as I mentioned before,
that outsized participation from the commercials. We're not seeing them step away, so I think everyone's
looking at the return of demand. I can't control for that, but the market is telling you it's probably 3
months out, 4 months out. And in the meantime, the storage issue is kind of red herring because I don't
want to leave people with the impression that the structural constraint is, there's only so much tank space
in Cushing and oil can't go anywhere. There's over 3 million barrels a day that transitions through Cushing
as a distribution hub. It goes on the railcars. It goes to the trucks and moves elsewhere.

So quite frankly, the contango in the market right now is an opportunity for folks. And we think that
market is going to be responding to that and finding smart ways to take that oil, transport it, and that's
one of the differences that you're seeing. It's not just physical storage at Cushing, it's a transit hub,
and so folks are figuring out where can I take that and move that and there's a cost to doing that to
alternative locations. So it's a healthy RPC business. We're still at about $1.12, $1.13 on or thereabout.
And we are continuing to see the commercials participate. We don't see them pulling back because of the
uncertainty of the near-term demand return.

Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.

Christopher Meo Harris
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

How should we be thinking about the potential risks to market data and connectivity revenues as a result
of the recession? It really doesn't seem like there's been any impact so far, but not sure how to be really
thinking about the outlook for the duration of 2020 and beyond.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

So I'm going to let Julie Winkler comment about the market data business a little bit. And John Pietrowicz,
if you want to comment on the revenue side as well. I will give you this observation from where I'm sitting
right now, everything you've heard and everything you've heard over the last 6 weeks from multiple
companies as we're in uncharted waters, difficult times, different times, no one's seen it before. And
I believe, and I think the team believes that the opportunity for market data is going to be critically
important in order for risk management, whether it's derived or historical. So we can't predict what it's
going to be, but I think more and more people after seeing what's going on here the last several weeks
are going to be looking for more and more data in order to help run their businesses. So if that gives you
any indication and what Julie Winkler and her team are doing right now is pretty exceptional. So Julie, I'll
let you comment. And then if anybody else wants to make a remark, John, go ahead. Julie?

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Sure. Thanks, Terry. Thanks for the question. Yes, the data business certainly performed well in Q1 with
our consolidated revenue of $132 million. So we were up slightly over the first quarter of 2019. We really
have not seen much decline in our professional subscriber display device count so far. So certainly from

23

CME GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

the impact of COVID-19 going forward, what the team has been doing is certainly close consultation with
our key data vendors and also our clients to gather input. I'd say many of our customers were very well
prepared for this work-from-home and DR scenario that we're in. They transitioned their traders and their
support teams with minimal disruption. And they wanted to recreate as much as possible, the experience
those people have in accessing our data in that work-from-home and DR environment.

So for some customers, the transition was more disruptive. The good news there, as Terry pointed
out earlier, there really -- there was no disruption, right, in terms of the market data technology or
distribution.

And so we've seen some of our vendors tell us there might be some decreased demand for data screens in
this going forward, while others are actually seeing an increased need from their customers for our data.

So we are going to definitely remain close to them. I think the 2 things that we're looking at, in particular,
are the historical data that I talked about earlier, where the last 2 months, we saw a 50% increase
in sales as customers are shopping for data, as Terry pointed out. The web traffic on those page is
up over 300%. Clients need to have access to the data to be able to continue to refine their trading
strategies and manage risk going forward. And additionally, on our non-display device business, customers
are increasingly seeking flexibility of how to use the CME data and algorithms and machine learning
capabilities and other automated solutions. So that's a trend seen across the industry that we think will
certainly continue through this.

And we're continuing to get as close to our customers as possible. And also, I believe, bringing that
team within our client development and research organization that we've talked about today is definitely
going to be more client-focused and continue to understand what their needs are, so we can deliver new
products, acquire new clients and continue to work very closely with our channel distribution partners. So
John, anything you want to add?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

No. I think you...

Terrence A. Duffy

John, on the revenue side of the data, do you want to add anything?

John William Pietrowicz

No. I mean I think we saw a solid first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and Julie hit all the
appropriate -- all the points.

Terrence A. Duffy

It looks like the line dropped. Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt.

Kenneth William Hill
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to ask on expenses. You had some nice control here in the first quarter. So I just wanted to
wonder how to think about that for 2Q, maybe any potential COVID-19 impacts that might flow through
into 2Q, whether that be kind of travel lockdowns or how you're thinking about the expense base here
over the near term and then as the year progresses, would be helpful.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Ken. I'll turn it over to John, and he can address that, John?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Terry. I think the entire organization really has done a fantastic job in terms of managing our
expenses in this really unprecedented time and unprecedented amount of activity at the exchange.

In terms of expense impacts to the -- related to the pandemic, certainly, we're seeing less employee
attrition and less hiring going on during this period of time. And when you look at the level of travel, it's
down substantially, as you would expect. In fact, in the first quarter, it was half of what we spent in the
fourth quarter of 2019. And I would imagine, in this quarter, it will be near 0.

Also, our marketing and advertising spend is pushed out into later on into the year. And also, we've really
moved to, as Julie had and Ken had pointed out previously, we've really moved to more video conferencing
and webinars versus events. So we have seen some impacts related to the crisis. I am very proud of the
entire organization and how they've been able to manage through it and also manage expenses.

In terms of our guidance, we certainly are very comfortable that we're not going to exceed our guidance
range. And it's a little too early, really to predict how we're going to come out, it really relates to a lot of
how the stay-at-home orders get taken away how businesses respond to. And as Terry has mentioned,
previously, this are really unprecedented times.

So we felt it's a little too early to make any adjustments to our guidance. But we are, as the entire
organization has over the last several years, really been managing our expenses well.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

And just to add to what John said, Ken, I think it's a pretty safe bet that we will be very conservative
with our people as they get back into their normal routines whenever that may or may not be to limit
that to some degree. I'm not just going to turn the valve and say everybody go back to what you were
doing before. Because as we clearly highlighted on this call and then have been over the last several
weeks, we've been able to function at a very high level. And I'm very proud of my team for doing this all
throughout the world from home. So we will be very cautious to continue on with business as usual from a
travel perspective and any other things that would incur cost.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

In terms of your response to Christian's question earlier on the record or near-record margin levels, where
are those levels now that we're sort of closing in on the end of April and volatility has diminished? And
given the decline in interest rates, what are the net yields that you're earning on the customer cash side
versus the yield you might have earned earlier in the year?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

I think John Pietrowicz answered your latter question a moment ago, but maybe I'm mistaken. But John,
I think you already answered that one, but you can say it again. As far as the amounts that we have on
deposit I'll yield to John Pietrowicz on that exact number, if he wants to give it or not. Because it does
fluctuate depending on what the margin models are calling for up or down. We -- as I said earlier, we
have raised margins across the board on most asset classes to be prudent on risk management. So that is
obviously a big part of it. And let me turn it to John for any other comment on that.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Thanks, Terry. As I mentioned previously, we are averaging in terms of cash that's put up at the
clearinghouse in terms of what's available for investments on behalf of our clients was $88.7 billion
through the month of April. In terms of noncash collateral on average, and this is the amount that's
subject to -- that we can -- that's managed on behalf -- noncash collateral that's managed on behalf of --
or that's put up at the clearinghouse is about $136 billion. Both are up substantially from the first quarter.
First quarter average cash was about $40 billion and about $114.5 billion that is related to -- that's put up
that we earn some collateral management fees for.

At the end of Q, at the end of March, our total collateral was $255.4 billion. We're seeing it being relatively
stable through the end of April in approximately $240 billion to $250 billion range. So both -- so they --
as Terry indicated, this is really related to prudent risk management. In terms -- I've already mentioned,
in terms of the amount of sharing that we do with our customers because we invest on their behalf, they
get about 80%. Our customers get about 80% of what we earn, and we keep about 20% of what we earn.
And right now, the IOER is at 10 basis points.

Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.

Kyle Kenneth Voigt
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I'm sorry about that. And I'm sorry if this has been asked in the last couple, but it was just on expenses. I
know there's -- I think there's a $1.54 billion annual expense run rate. If you just look at the first quarter
and kind of annualize that guidance at $1.64 billion to $1.65 billion. Just wondering, John, if you could
help us bridge the gap there in terms of what's going to drive the incremental spend for the remainder of
the year? And then, is there expense flex below that guidance range if the options floor doesn't open, and
your travel expenses and other expenses remain low due to COVID-19.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Kyle. John?

John William Pietrowicz

that has to be managed. And it's across the entire organization that's really stepped up to manage the
incredible amount of volume and the customer outreach has been really tremendous. It really, I think,
differentiates us from our peers in terms of our engagement with our customers. So a tremendous result
across the board from the employees. We've definitely been managing our expenses very carefully. We
intend to continue to manage our expenses very carefully. This is something that you've seen us do over
the last several years. We really -- every employee really looks at and make sure that we are spending
our money as efficiently as we can. Going forward, it's too early to tell in terms of how the crisis plays out.
And so we felt that it wasn't appropriate yet to change our guidance. We're very comfortable that we're
not going to be above our guidance. And in fact, I think there's opportunity based on different scenarios
for us to come in under our guidance, but it's a little too early to tell.

And in terms of the back half of the year, depending on how the crisis plays out, there could be some
timing related to some of our spending. And as you are aware, our fourth quarter tends to be heavier
spend for us in terms of seasonality in our expenses.
