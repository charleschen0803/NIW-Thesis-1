Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Edison International Third Quarter 2020 Financial Teleconference. My
name is Michelle, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj,
you may begin your conference.

Sam Ramraj
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive
Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also on the
call are other members of the management team. I would like to mention that we are doing this call with
our executives in different locations, but please bear with us if you experience any technical difficulties.

Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edison.investor.com. These include our Form 10-Q,
prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute
our regular business update presentation.

During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its
subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could
cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read this carefully. The presentation includes
certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.
[Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Pedro.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, Edison International reported core earnings
per share of $1.67 for the third quarter of 2020, that was up $0.17 compared to the same period last year.
This increase was primarily due to higher CPUC-related revenue from the 2018 GRC escalation mechanism
and lower expenses from regulatory deferrals related to wildfire mitigation activities, partially offset by
equity share dilution. Reflecting our strong year-to-date performance and our confidence in the outlook for
the year, we are narrowing our 2020 guidance range to $4.47 to $4.62 by raising the low end $0.10. Maria
will discuss our financial performance in detail in her report.

We continue to address the numerous impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, customers and
communities. At the same time, we recognize that climate change is driving unprecedented weather
conditions and catastrophic wildfires in California, and the state is in the midst of another active wildfire
season. Our thoughts are with the communities and families impacted, and we are thankful for the
first responders who have worked tirelessly to contain the fires and protect the lives and property
of Californians. At Edison, safety remains our first and highest priority. SCE continues implementing
measures to reduce wildfire risk, working closely with local first responders and emergency managers and
communicating regularly with customers to improve awareness and promote preparedness.

On the California legislative front, this year's session was shortened due to COVID-19. The legislature
prioritized the state's COVID-19 response and wildfire risk reduction. The governor signed several pieces
of legislation that build on the state's investments in firefighting personnel and technology and fuels
management projects.

I am also pleased that 2 issues advocated by SCE, clarifying the AB 1054 insurance policy year and
obtaining the opportunity to securitize revenue under collections and bad debt expense due to COVID-19
in 2020, were both addressed by the legislature through the unanimous passage of Assembly Bill 913.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

During this wildfire season, we have seen near-record deployments of firefighters to contain major
wildfires throughout the state with over 19,000 first responders at the peak, which was the highest since
2008. Firefighters from CAL FIRE, the U.S. Forest Service and numerous cities and counties have done a
tremendous job this year despite being stretched due to the significant lightning-driven wildfire complexes
and having to work with COVID precautions.

This reflects the work done over the past couple of years to significantly increase firefighting resources
and enhance the ability to model and forecast fire progression to better position ground and aerial assets.
SCE's wildfire mitigation efforts augment those of state and local agencies.

For example, SCE has improved its situational awareness and that of local fire authorities by installing 161
cameras. In late September, SCE contributed $2.2 million to the Orange County Fire Authority to secure
the largest heavy-lift helitanker in the world for this fire season, capable of nighttime flying and making
water drops at 3,000 gallons. This helicopter was working all through last night and today on the Silverado
Fire in Orange County. As of this morning, the Orange County Fire Authority reported that this fire has
burned over 11,000 acres and is 5% contained with no structural losses. Tragically, 2 firefighters have
been seriously injured battling the blaze.

SCE filed an electric safety incident report, or ESIR, yesterday on the Silverado Fire. As noted in the
ESIR, there was no activity on a nearby SCE power line nor evidence of any down power lines prior to
the reported start of the fire. While SCE's investigation is at an early stage, I would like to note that
preliminary investigation suggests that a lashing wire attached to a third-party owned telecommunication
line that sits beneath SCE's power line may have contacted SCE's power line above it, possibly igniting the
fire. However, it is early to draw any definitive conclusions at this point.

I've mentioned before that coverage conductor is the most effective and expeditious way for SCE to buy
down public safety risk by preventing admissions that can lead to catastrophic wildfires. SCE is on track to
meet or exceed the target of 700 miles of installed covered conductor set in the 2020 Wildfire Mitigation
Plan.

Our utility made substantial enhancements over the past year to its Public Safety Power Shutoff or PSPS
program. SCE has enhanced communication and coordination with government and communities and
improved its capabilities to sectionalize circuits to reduce the number of customers impacted when a
preventive de-energization is initiated.

In addition to our efforts to help reduce the risk of wildfires, the company continues to work to resolve
wildfire-related litigation. As we noted on September 23, SCE resolved all insurance obligation claims for
the Thomas and Koenigstein fires and Montecito mudslides. With this and other information in hand, we
were able to move our accounting reserves from the low end of the estimable range to a best estimate,
providing investors greater clarity on this and our related equity need.

Moving to regulatory actions at the CPUC. We are very pleased to see continued timely decisions and
progress on our key filings as originally scheduled. This is a significant improvement in action and progress
under the leadership of President Batjer. We commend the commission and its staff for their continuing
efforts in ensuring that proceedings are staying on schedule despite challenges from the new remote
working environment during the pandemic.

During this quarter, the CPUC issued decisions in several of SCE's key filings. These include the 2020
safety certification, the Charge Ready 2 program and the WEMA application, authorizing $505 million of
wildfire insurance cost recovery and supporting continued treatment of insurance as a reasonable cost of
service. We also received a proposed decision on our initial AB 1054 CapEx securitization application and
see timely progress on track 1 of the 2021 GRC proceeding. Furthermore, SCE has reached a settlement in
principle to resolve all issue spending in track 2 of the GRC.

SCE and numerous other parties filed their 2020 integrated resource plans. One of the principal objectives
of this IRP is to help California made its 2030 and 2045 GHG reduction targets. In SCE's plan, we urge
the commission to adopt a 38 million metric ton target for 2030 to put California on a viable trajectory
towards meeting its decarbonization goals. SCE also reiterated and highlighted a substantial CAISO

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

system capacity need of 5,400 megawatts in the 2024 through 2026 time frame due to planned power
plant retirements.

To address this, SCE has recommended that the commission updates its reliability planning methodology,
including increasing the planning reserve margin to better reflect the state's evolving electricity market
and ensure system reliability. These recommendations are consistent with the conclusions found by the
CAISO, the CPUC and the California Energy Commission in their recent preliminary root cause analysis of
the August rotating outages.

Last month, the governor issued an executive order that moves up the time frame to have all new vehicles
sold in California be emission-free to 2035. The order aligns with our Pathway 2045 work in which electric
vehicles are an important element to achieve carbon neutrality. I am really proud that Edison has been
recognized as a thought leader on this front.

I want to underscore the importance of making necessary investments today to ensure that we have a
strong, safe, reliable and resilient grid to accommodate the increasing electrification of the economy. This
drives substantial investment opportunities to meet increased electricity usage and increased system
complexity, including more distributed energy resources, higher levels of renewable resources and energy
storage. Importantly, our analysis shows that this transition will also be affordable since the greater
efficiency of the electric motors and appliances will reduce customers' total costs across all energy
commodities by 1/3 by 2045.

With that, I'll turn it over to Maria to provide her financial report.

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Pedro. Edison International reported core earnings of $1.67 per share for the third quarter
of 2020, an increase of $0.17 per share from the same period last year. This increase was primarily due
to higher CPUC-related revenue due to the 2018 GRC escalation mechanism and lower expenses from
regulatory deferrals related to wildfire mitigation activities. These were partially offset by equity share
dilution.

Reflecting our solid results for the first 9 months of the year, we are once again narrowing our guidance
range by raising the low end of our 2020 EPS estimate. I will discuss this in more detail later in my
remarks.

On Page 2, you can see SCE's key EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I would like to highlight 4 items that
accounted for much of the variance. First, EPS increased by $0.43 related to higher revenue. CPUC-related
revenue contributed $0.25 of this increase due to the escalation mechanism from the 2018 GRC decision.
FERC and other operating revenue had a negative variance of $0.05, largely because of the true-up for
the 2018 formula rate case we recorded last year. There was also a positive variance of $0.23, primarily
related to the balancing accounts for the GSRP settlement that was approved in April. However, there
were offsets in expenses related to this variance. Second, O&M had a positive variance of $0.08, primarily
due to recognizing lower wildfire mitigation expenses as a result of deferrals to regulatory assets. Third,
income taxes had a negative impact of $0.13, primarily reflecting lower tax benefits captured through our
tax balancing account. Lastly, SCE's EPS in the quarter was lower by $0.16 because of dilution from the
increase in shares outstanding.

On Page 3, you will see SCE's capital expenditure and rate base forecast. CapEx is consistent with last
quarter's forecast for 2021 through 2023, with a slight increase to 2020. Additionally, we updated the rate
base forecast, primarily for Charge Ready 2 and GRC rebuttal testimony. We continue to see significant
opportunities to grow rate base over time, driven by investments in electric infrastructure. And this is
reflected in our robust capital program of $20 billion to $21 billion over this period. This request level
represents a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% in rate base over to rate case periods. After applying a
10% reduction to the total capital forecast, to reflect our experience of previously authorized amounts and
other operational considerations, the low end of the range still reflects a strong rate base growth of 6.6%.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Please turn to Page 4. Track 1 of the 2021 GRC proceeding has been on schedule and during the quarter,
all related briefs were completed. We are now waiting for a decision and continue to expect that in first
quarter 2021. To emphasize our previous statements, SCE's core business will require minimal equity to
fund our ongoing capital expenditures program beyond 2020. We will be able to quantify these levels after
we receive the final approval of the GRC.

Page 5 summarizes our progress on SCE's cost recovery filings for incremental 2018 and 2019 wildfire
mitigation costs. In April, SCE received CPUC approval for the GSRP settlement, which authorized recovery
of $476 million of capital and $123 million of O&M. The decision approved a revenue requirement of $159
million, which went into rates on October 1. The balance of the capital costs that were approved will be
recovered as we securitize amounts related to wildfire mitigation as authorized in AB 1054. In September,
the WEMA application to recover $505 million of costs for wildfire insurance is approved. This is now
included in rates and will be recovered over the next 24 months.

Importantly, the CPUC noted in its decision that SCE had acted reasonably and prudently in its
procurement of insurance policies. The commission also recognize that wildfire liability insurance serve as
an important protection for customers against third-party legal claims invoking the inverse condemnation
doctrine and allegations of negligence. These decisions enable SCE to recover approximately $665 million
of cash over the next 2 years and further strengthen its balance sheet and credit metrics. In addition, the
CPUC recently issued a proposed decision on SCE's application to securitize the GSRP capital noted above.
When the financing is completed, it will add approximately $335 million to the cash position.

SCE and all interveners reached a confidential settlement in principle regarding all issues in track 2 of the
2021 GRC. Once a definitive settlement is executed, a motion will be filed with the CPUC seeking approval.
SCE expects a proposed decision on the track 2 settlement in Q1 2021. We will record the impact of the
settlement once the commission acts and do not expect a negative earnings impact.

I will highlight a number of other pending filings and future applications related to wildfire mitigation
costs. First, we are due to receive a decision on our CEMA filing for certain drought and restoration costs
in first quarter 2021. In the next few months, we also anticipate filing a WEMA application for excess
insurance premium costs for July through December 2020. Finally, we will make our GRC track 3 filing in
first quarter 2021, with the proposed decision expected a year later.

As for other regulatory actions during the quarter, the CPUC approved SCE's Charge Ready 2 program,
which supports approximately 38,000 light-duty EV charging ports. This is the largest light-duty EV
charging program by an investor-owned utility in the U.S. and will add approximately $400 million to
SCE's rate base by 2026.

Turning to guidance. Pages 6 and 7 show our updated 2020 guidance and the key assumptions for
modeling purposes. Let me highlight that we are once again narrowing our full year 2020 EPS guidance
range to $4.47 to $4.62 per share by raising the low end of the range. This also increases the midpoint of
the EPS range by $0.05 to $4.55.

While most of the earnings assumptions are essentially unchanged from last quarter, there are a couple of
factors driving the majority of this upload revision. First, we now expect SCE earnings to be $0.04 higher
than our previous assumption. This is driven by improvements of $0.01 in rate base earnings and $0.03
from SCE variances related to the timing of financing activities as well as operational items. Second, the
EIX Parent and Other forecast has improved by $0.01 versus our previous estimate. These factors and our
strong performance so far this year make us increasingly confident in our narrowed 2020 EPS guidance
range.

Last month, we issued a news release about the September 2020 subrogation settlement and noted
that we anticipate issuing approximately $1 billion of equity to invest in SCE, enabling the utility to debt
finance wildfire claims payments. Since then, many of you have asked questions about the timing of the
equity issuance. As we shared with you, we will provide an update on the fourth quarter 2020 earnings
call. The timing of the equity issuance will be dependent upon the timing of future claims resolutions and
payments that exceed insurance.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Could I just ask a question on the September announcement and the -- which obviously you just
mentioned now? And particularly, of the $6.2 billion that is now your accrual, can you give us any sense,
Pedro, of sort of how -- what proportion of that is effectively settled or agreed and how much is still
subject to estimate or extrapolation? Just sort of some directional sense of how you arrived at that being
the estimate as opposed to the low end these days?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. Maria can fill in the numbers here. But in terms of the categories, you've seen the
major announcements so far. The various settlements that we have announced on one last fall with the
public entities and now the subrogation parties in this latest settlement. In addition, there's been a -- I
think we shared that there's been settlements with a number of private parties, private plaintiffs but those
are small relative to the thousands of plaintiffs in the individual cases.

So that's -- based on that, and Maria can probably give you the precise number that we disclosed, that's
included in the settlements, but in the writing of the best estimate, what we did was have the benefit of
now having those major settlements under our wins, right, and behind us, And then in addition to that,
going through the discovery process on the rest of the claims. We're deeper into the discovery process.
We think have a better understanding of the facts at hand and what our arguments would be. We have an
understanding of some of the counterarguments that various classes of plaintiffs might have. And that just
gives us a better ability to now move from the low end to the best estimate. There's still assumptions in
there.

And we, I think, disclosed that the final result should be higher or lower, and we're not able to disclose an
uncertainty band around that, Jonathan. But our hope and expectation is that by now moving from the
low end to a best estimate that we're no longer talking about being on one end of the roadway. We're now
right down the middle of the roadway. And I know that investors will be probably making assumptions
or having their own expectations about what that uncertainty band might be, again, not in a place to be
able to communicate that. But what we've given you is our best estimate or best sense of what the final
outcome would look like on the benefit of not only things that we've locked down, but facts that we now
better understand through the litigation process.

Maria, I don't know if you want to give Jonathan -- if you have a handy kind of percentage.

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think just the only thing, Jonathan, maybe the last piece of your question is, you were, I think,
asking about which portion of that amount is the subject. I think the way I interpret is the subject of the
subrogation claims settlement that we reached, and that's about $1.2 billion.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I know that, Maria. I was looking for -- just overall, how much of it is known versus estimated.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Yes. And Maria, I guess the answer to Jonathan's question would be that you take the $6-plus billion gross
amount and then point them to the settlement that we just entered for $1.2 billion, the settlement that we
had last fall, which was on the order of $1 billion. The claims of $1 billion settlement was, call it, 1/3 or so
of that. So round numbers would be, Maria, probably have a more precise number, $1.5 billion or so, $1.6
billion.

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I guess I would probably just go back to what we have recorded on the books right now is the
total recorded liability, Jonathan. The portion of that, the $1.2 billion approximately is associated with
segregation claims payment. What I would say about your question, what's known and what's unknown,
we took all of that into consideration in order to reach the best estimate. I don't think Pedro's comments
earlier about kind of the practically went through, et cetera. We're not trying to break down between all of
the different types of claims payments at this point. You can understand why.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. Understood. And may I just sort of -- on a related topic for my follow-up, the equity that you say
you're going to talk to us on the fourth quarter. Any -- can you -- would you comment at all on your sort
of interest in using the current ATM that you have between now and then? And then sort of also why --
what's the thought process behind sort of waiting until you need to actually pay claims, why not just sort
of put this dilution behind you sort of better -- want of a better reason, '21 will be sort of a base that won't
be further diluted?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

So in regards to both of those questions, I think your first question about thoughts about what I'll say,
approaches or tactics or tools. I think we have a lot of flexibility around the tools and all options, I think,
are available to us running the gamut to ways we've done it before, ATM, et cetera. So I think we have
a lot of when it comes to the tools, and we'll work that out as we progress closer to the point in time at
which we will be issuing an equity.

And I think your second question around kind of why wait. I think we've described before that the way
these processes work, we have changed our best estimate, but that doesn't mean that cash is going out
the door right now. In fact, the subrogation settlement that we announced last month, really, most of that
was covered by insurance. So we're really going to follow that pattern of where -- when cash is actually
required, and that will play into our decision about the timing of the equity issuance.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Let me just -- let me put a fine point on it, Jonathan, because perhaps reading too much between the
lines of your question, there could be an implication there that perhaps events might be happening within
a certain time frame. And the reality is, we just don't know what the time frame will be for resolution of
the remaining claims. I think as we said all along, often these claims get resolved through settlement,
but they may not result for settlement. If it goes through settlement, some have happened more quickly,
like you saw the public entities settlement and the subrogation claims. But there's no guarantee that
remaining claims outstanding would be settled on a similar sort of time frame, and it could take much
longer for those to be resolved. And if we ultimately ended up going all the way through litigation, that we
would expect to be a multiyear process.

So I think I was hearing into your question, the idea, well, if you need it by x time, why don't I go ahead
and do it, and let -- issue the equity a little bit earlier, but we don't know whether that will be a little bit or
a lot earlier because we don't really know the time frame, Jonathan.

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So if I can pivot to the Silverado Fire, if you don't mind, I appreciate the remarks at the outset here.
But can you help frame, as best you understand the liability statutes pertaining to third parties, such as
those potentially involved with the telecom lines? In the case -- and also further, I appreciate all this is
preliminary, but how should one think about your direct exposure should the fact pattern that you guys
just alluded to about a third-party causing the fire be affirmed and most critically that inverse combination
would not apply to the utility, seeing that, at least as best I physically understand what you're describing,
that this wire basically flew up from below and actually touched your -- presumably sparked your own
wires? Sorry for a long-winded question, but I just want to be very clear to make sure we understand the
statute here.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Sure. And I'm going to give you a sadly unsatisfying answer because this fire is still raging. We know very
little at this point. And so even what -- I won't say statute, what legal treatment would apply, ultimately
is still unclear. I know we're probably focusing, for example, on putting inverse condemnation apply, for
example. And even with that, whether it applies to depend upon the facts of a particular case, ultimately
will be determined by a court. So we've been speculating if we will try to opine on whether something like
inverse would apply here.

Likewise in terms of liability, potentially by other parties, I think you're understanding the picture as well
as we do right now, right? We shared we're aware of this possibility of the lashing potentially having gone
up and flowing up into the power lines that were above it on that particular segment. And so that could
imply then some potential liability by the third-party telecommunications carrier. The utility could show
that there were clauses like that, then the utility be able to pursue a contribution from other responsible
parties. And so that certainly is a possibility here. But it's just way too early to draw any conclusions at all,
Julien. So I probably have to leave it at that.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

All right. Fair enough. I'll ask you a little bit of an easier one here, if you don't mind. Where do you stand
on the ability to procure insurance as you look forward here? And I'm asking us in light of continued
elevated wildfire activity in the state, even if it's admittedly not been directly tied to utility matters, but
rather broader environmental factors here.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start this and Maria will probably have even better detail. But I think it sort of by saying, you saw
that we procured ensuring successfully for this calendar year. It is a tighter market than it's been in the
past. The disclosures you're seeing are the premiums and amounts that we've saw the recovery of have
indicated that the pricing for that product is a lot higher than it was 3 or 4 years ago. I wouldn't want to
speculate on what the market will look like when we're back out in the market. I think we would expect
that there would be product available, but that's discovery you go through every time that you go to the
insurance cycle. Maria, what would you add there?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So Julien, I think it was a tough market. It's been a tough market for a couple of years. We have
had the ability to get the amount of capacity that we wanted, albeit at a higher and higher price. So that
is, of course, an issue for our customers. You may be aware that in our 2021 GRC, we've actually started
to try and explore other alternatives that would have helped to lower the cost, so funded self-insurance

and some things like that, balancing accounts. So that if the market changes to the good or the bad in
terms of pricing that we're not caught short nor would our customers bear an undue burden if it actually
turns out to be better than we were forecasting.

So I think it's just something that we continue to monitor and we continue to work hard to get it into our
program at the most affordable price for our customers.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Maybe one more thing I would add, Julien, that might be helpful is -- and again, this is a little bit of
speculation here, but at the same time, I think it's important to reflect on the fire season that we've seen
so far, which was been once again historic. We thought '17 and '18 were historic, but in terms of acreage
burn, we've seen over 4 million acres burned across the state with over half of that having been due to
lightning strikes. The point I'm making here is one that I think I made already in my prepared remarks,
the fire suppression effort has been really strong. And I'm going to speculate a little bit here, but it can't
prove the negative here.

But I would hazard a pretty good guess that if we have had this fire season 3 years ago, before this date
has significantly increased its firefighting resources and capabilities, we might be seeing a much different
level of damage across the state regardless of the cause of the fire. We might have seen much more
damage for the lighting-induced fires, and if there were utility-caused fires, we might see more damage
stemming from those as well.

So I would hope that as insurance carriers look at their risk profile for California, they, I'm sure, will be
taken into account some of the climate change-related weather conditions, the winds, et cetera, that have
contributed to the large fires this year. But I would also hope that they would be looking at the flip side,
the fire suppression effort that helps bring the risk envelope down for everyone. And at the same time,
I would hope they would be looking at the efforts of all the utilities, certainly our utility in executing the
Wildfire Mitigation Plan. The risk isn't 0, the risk will never be 0, but I think the risk is very different today
than it was 3 years ago. As we -- and we will continue to change as we continue to harden the system, as
we continue to use PSPS responsibly and the like.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I want to -- I have 2 things. One is just a payment-level question for the '17 and '18 wildfires. If I just
do back of the envelope, and I'm sure the queue has more, and I'll hop in off-line. But the $6.2 billion
accrual, you paid out about $1.6 billion. You have somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of
insurance left and you're getting around $225 million on FERC recovery. So that's -- it's kind of rough
year -- the cash out-of-pocket is somewhere in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range from the '17 and '18
wildfires. Am I kind of in the ballpark, Maria?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And that's for forward tax settlements?

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Yes, that's about right. And now I have to go to the math a little bit, went through it pretty quickly. But
we had about 6 and 2 and 4. It's probably like, I would say $2.5 billion is a little low to me if I go through
the numbers. If you're going all the way from the beginning, you're not -- if you take all of the charges,
including the ones that have already been paid for the evidence of the settlements back here.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I'm just trying to think about cash going out from today onwards. So the $6.2 billion, but you've already
paid $1.6 million, roughly $1.6 billion. And you have some insurance still to collect. So -- and I don't
remember what that number is. The max is $2 billion, but I think you've already collected some. And
you're going to still...

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

So if you're thinking about the go forward, that's probably about right, about $3 billion in the best
estimate -- embedded in the best estimate.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Understood. So I have a question just about the tone in California towards utilities, which is one of the
major publications in Northern California today put out what seemed -- or maybe it was last night put
out what seemed like a very harsh piece on one of your peers. And it seems to have been relatively quiet
coming out of Sacramento and other public officials about kind of the low utilities play in wildfires and
wildfire mitigation. And maybe that's because we're going through a harsh season.

But can you just talk about how the -- how you manage the court of public opinion from here and the
sentiment and how that impacts and kind of flows through policymakers and the coordination with
policymakers?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that's a good question, and I'll try not to take up the whole rest of the earnings call on because I
guess, we probably could spend a whole afternoon on it. By the way, in your prior question, I'm glad you
asked that. I think that your question was probably in the same zone as Jonathan's in looking for the
sizing of the numbers. So hopefully, that helped everybody.

I think in terms of tone, and look, I won't comment on the publication you just mentioned or other utilities
out there. But I think -- I'll make 2 comments. I'll make a general comment and then a more specific
comment about Edison. The general comment is that, particularly with the 2020 wildfire season so far,
the fact that over half of the acreage burn have stemmed from lightning-induced fires. The issues that
everybody in the population has seen around firefighting, and frankly, the great efforts by firefighters, et
cetera.

I think at some level, there's a deeper understanding that this is not just about the source of the fire, but
it's about this convergence of factors, including climate change, including weather conditions, including
fuel on the ground, including all of this, right, including where homes have built, that adds up to this risk
that the state bears and trying to do something about. So that, I think, brings in maybe a little different
tone overall.

I'll make the second comment about our utility. One of the things we've tried to do throughout all this
is -- name a few things we've done. We try to be really transparent, Michael. And so as we have seen
issues in the system, as we've gone through the 2017 and 2018 wildfire experience, you saw us be very
transparent. When we saw that there might have been issues related to our equipment that might have
contributed to fires because overall, I want to make sure that the public can have confidence and trust in
the Edison company being forthright.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

And not only working hard to improve things and reduce wildfire risk for our communities, but also in
being transparent about when things might happen. And the reality is, we operate under a prudency
standard, not a perfection standard because we operate a system with 1.5 million poles across 50,000
square miles with 27% of this 50,000 square miles being high fire risk territory.

And the other thing we've tried to do is make -- 2 more things to go. The second thing has been -- to
work really hard, really hard at continuing to learn, develop our Wildfire Mitigation Plans, improve on
them. Actually, even before there was the concept of the WMP, frankly, even before we've seen the
Thomas Fire in 2017, we started the work on the Grid Safety and Resiliency Program because we saw with
the combination of the one country fires in the fall of '17 and the instability have been in the regulatory
framework after the CPUC's San Diego Gas & Electric decision.

We saw that the risk profile was very different, both physically and in regulatory space, and that began
our first iteration of a radical rethinking of how we thought about wildfire risk on our system that led to
the GSRP filing, and we haven't stopped since then. And we try to communicate with the communities,
everything that we're doing around that.

The third and final thing I'll mention is, even as we focus most of our attention on this near-term issue and
these risks, we've also kept the eye on the long-term ball here. And that's why you've seen us continue
to think hard about things like Pathway 2045 and what California needs to do to address climate change.
Both because we're seeing the climate change impacts manifest themselves in wildfire. So it's important
to take care of the wildfire risk, but we also have to help the states take care of the true long-term risk,
which is doing something about climate change, but also because taking care of -- addressing greenhouse
gas reduction, it turns out that you really need a strong utility to be a major partner with the state to have
a strong grid to help access clean energy and electrify the economy.

And that I think that need for a strong utility for the long run to help the state achieve its climate goals
is part of the fabric here, all right? It's part of the reason to ensure that the utility can have a compact to
keep it healthy. It's part of the reason that you saw state government support AB 1054. And it's part of
the reason that you saw unanimous approval for AB 913 this year.

So -- sorry, a little long-winded here, but we really think a lot about this in terms of what do we do in the
near term, but how do we think about the long-term and how we help demonstrate to the state and to our
public that we want to be a partner, and we need to be a strong partner for the long haul here in order to
make California the great state that we all enjoy living in.

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Michael, just one thing because I was using my scratch pad while Pedro was going through it. I think...

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

I give Maria time to work with some numbers.

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think the number you're looking for is more like $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we can go over how
I did my math off-line, if you want.

And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

So just one technical question on the lashing wire and I guess the telecom wires and electric, are -- is the
telecom company responsible for managing and servicing their own wires near your poles? Or do you have
to do that at all?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

In general, they are responsible for managing their equipment. It gets even more complicated here
because you can have multiple telco companies using the assets under joint pole agreements. In some
cases, they might have a space on the pole designated for them, but they can then deem that or dedicate
it to other telco providers through transactions. So it really -- their responsibility -- it is a responsibility to
maintain their physical assets.

That said, when we go on and inspect our facilities, we look for any hazards that could interfere with the
electrical system. And so while we don't do detailed inspection of their telco assets, if we see something
and we certainly keep an eye out for any hazards that the telco assets might pose to the electric system
and report those to the telco companies.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then just one other question on the GRC, the -- how -- it sounds like you feel pretty good on
the timing of the track 1 by early next year. Do you think there's any chance of settling the GRC track 1
like you have track 2? Or should we assume that's going to go through the full litigated process?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We're pretty far along in the process now. I mean we -- all we have left is really the ALJ to issue
a proposed decision, and you could have oral arguments after that. So I won't say you can never do
something like that, but we are pretty far along in the process in terms of the track 1. Track 2, on the
other hand, obviously, we were much earlier in the process and having yet gone through a lot of the
different piece parts of the proceeding when we reach the settlement in principle.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

And you'll wait for that to give 2021 guidance, the outcome of the GRC, like you've done in the past?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, the track line? Yes, we will.

pretty far down the path. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

I think -- Jeremy, thanks for the question. I think the short answer I'll give you is that we have not filed an
ESIR for Blue Ridge. And at this point, we don't see any basis for needing to file an ESIR.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. When thinking about potential changes to California system planning, how
should we think about incremental capital opportunities for EIX over the next few years? Just kind of a
broader question there.

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, that's a great question. I'll try and keep it brief. When we think about that, I think certainly the
near-term pieces I talked about, right? So the procurement needs that we foresee across the state for
the 2024 to 2026 time frame. I would suspect that much of that will continue to be served by competitive
generators in the state. The state has generally had a preference for that. There's always an opportunity
for utility involvement. We have shared with investors before that we don't see SCE investing capital into
traditional generation. It's just not the core business at this point. We like the generation that we do have
in rate base, but we don't see dedicating new capital to new generation since we have a very vibrant third-
party market here, and we have plenty of opportunities to invest capital in the wire system.

A little different with storage. Because storage could well be part of that, not only at midterm
procurement, but we certainly see storage being a big part of the story in California as we go up to 2030
and 2045. And so just to remind you, our Pathway 2045 analysis suggests that California-wide, you'll
see a need for 80 gigawatts of new renewables and 30 gigawatts of new storage at the bulk power level,
statewide. And while I would expect that a lot of storage will also be done by third parties, we have seen
certainly an interest in statute in preserving the option for some utility on storage.

You've seen in our current rate case, we had filed in their provisions for not a large amount of capital, but
some capital to set aside Maria. I want to say it was around $60 million, if I remember correctly, but check
me on that. $60 million, right, for potential utility on storage. And when we see storage being a more
likely target for utility ownership would be where it can play a more integral role in grid operations. As an
example, the 20 megawatts of batteries that we deploy at our Mira Loma substation a few years ago.

I'd say bigger picture, though, as we think about those near and midterm needs and in the longer-term
energy transition, the big capital investment opportunity in need here is making sure we have a robust
grid to be able to interconnect clean energy resources with the increase in uses across the economy as the
economy electrifies. And as we see load, which has been generally stagnant for the last decade increased
by 60% by the time we get out to 2045. So we see a significant need for investment in the wire system.
And that, along with potential upside opportunities in areas like the Charge Ready 2 program, there might
be other opportunities like that as the environment evolves. So I hope that covers it, Jeremy.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Really appreciate that. And if I could slip one more in, just what's your current outlook for customer
rates over the planning period with kind of the incremental recoveries authorized as expected?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

So if you look at our current rate case, so the GRC, that's especially the track 1, if everything were
approved, which obviously, that never happens. But the average monthly residential bill would build about
$13 on average. Our care customers would go up to about -- I think it's about $8 a month.

And our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

In light of the blackouts in California over the last few months, can you comment around specifically
blackout-related potential investment opportunities in transmission and storage, that may address some of
the problems over the last few months and reduced risk for future seasons?

Pedro J. Pizarro
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian (sic) [ Ryan ]. And I think a lot of the answer and what strokes is
what I just shared with Jeremy. I don't think that we have a more precise beat right now on your specific
piece of equipment that might help with that. Remember that the rotating outages were not driven by
the transmission and distribution system per se. They were driven by insufficiency and supply. And so a
lot of the focus, therefore, is on the kind of near-term procurement that SCE advocated for and the CPUC
approved last year.

So recall that they approved something like 3,000 megawatts of procurement for the 2021 to 2023 time
frame. Of that, I think SCE has done that statewide number, and I think SCE has done something like
2,700 megawatts of procurement for that time frame, largely with keeping some existing generators going
for a few more years. That's been in tandem with the state water resources board, having extended the
time lines for retirements due to once the cooling restrictions. So I think that's a lot of the very near-term
action.

In the midterm, that's what I was talking about earlier, we see that statewide need for around 5,400
megawatts of resources beyond current contracts, statewide. And so some of that may be met by, once
again, existing plants, being able to extend their lifetime. Some of that may be driven by new resources.
Some of that could be combinations of addition -- storage additions that might provide greater effective
capacity. So that, I think, could be something that some portion of which might end up being done
for utility rate base. And I think certainly the large portion of that, that is done through competitive
processes.

On the transmission side, I don't know that I can point to any specific transmission deficiencies that would
have contributed to the rotating outages. But as we think about the system adding new resources, that, of
course, will then need to -- lead to needs for transmission interconnection if those resources are landing
in places that don't already have wire connections. And so again, I don't think I have anything specific to
share in terms of the near term.

I will tell you in terms of the longer-term view, heading out to 2045, in our Pathway 2045 white paper
when we tried to put a dollar figure around the resource needs, that 80 gigawatts of renewables and 30
gigawatts of storage, those new clean energy resources added up in our estimates, it's a rough estimate
to around $175 billion need for new investments statewide. Again, much of that may be done by third
parties. And the related transmission bulk power system investments through 2045 statewide will be
something like $70 billion. So there is significant investment need ahead, and I think some portion of that
will need to be served by utilities.

Operator

Paul Fremont from Mizuho.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I guess my first question is, can you tell us a little bit more about the Bobcat Fire? And I guess, there were
some news reports with respect to the Bobcat Fire that there may have been vegetation or tree branches
that came into contact with the transmission lines. Are you able to sort of give us any update there?

Pedro J. Pizarro

17

EDISON INTERNATIONAL FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Sure. And I don't think there are any major new updates beyond what we have reported already, but just
to recap that, we have reported that the fire started in September 6, the reported start time with the fire
was 12:21. We did have a relay on our system on a 12 kV circuit from 5 minutes before that at 12:16.
But one of the high-definition cameras that we have out there saw or capture the initial stages of the fire
and saw smoke as early as 12:10 p.m. So 6 minutes before we saw any sort of activity in our circuit and
what's that, 11 minutes before the reported start of the fire.

The U.S. Forest Service is doing investigation, and they removed the 23-foot section of overhead
conductor from the area of interest, and we understand that they also removed and retained some 3
branches. So they suggested they may be investigating if vegetation was involved in admission of the fire.
We don't know if the U.S. Forest Service is also looking at any other possible causes. So the -- for the fire
or this equipment is their sole focus.

SCE is doing its own review. It's still really early here. We will certainly be looking at any number of
potential costs as the bottom line, Paul, is. It's way too early, and we have reached no conclusions in
either direction in terms of causation at this point.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And then my other question is with respect to the track 2 settlement, you're making a statement that you
don't expect a negative earnings impact. Can you elaborate on that? Is that relative to what?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

So I guess I will caveat everything by saying that since the settlement into a lot of detail. I only meant
that didn't want people to think that there was anything in the settlement that would be untoward.
We don't see any impact on earnings or anything like that. We've deferred some of the costs as being
profitable of recovery. Just wanted to clarify that this is consistent with what we had previously thought.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Okay. So that's not in any way, any type of a signal on future EPS?

Maria C. Rigatti
Executive VP & CFO

No. It was more to clarify that -- well, I mean, I guess it is a signal since these things are not going to
have a negative impact on earnings, but it was more to point to the fact that we had previously talked
about and how we were deferring costs. And this settlement covers a number of those costs that we've
been deferring.
