FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

Presentation

Operator

My name is Angela, and I will be your conference facilitator this afternoon. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Fortive Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Griffin Whitney, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Griffin Whitney
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Angela. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are
Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer.

We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation
G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website,
www.fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information. We completed the divestiture of the
automation and specialty business on October 1, 2018, and accordingly, have included the results of the
A&S business as discontinued operations for current and historical periods. The results presented on this
call are based on continuing operations.

During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-
year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-
over-year on a continuing operations basis.

During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities
laws including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may
occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today.
Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-
looking statements is available in our SEC filings including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2018, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update
any forward-looking statements.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Our results for the fourth quarter provided a strong finish
to 2019 as we delivered a 13.1% adjusted earnings growth, with strong adjusted operating margin
performance and excellent free cash flow.

For the full year, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 on a continuing operations basis,
representing a 13.7% increase year-over-year, with 2% core revenue growth and 30 basis points of core
operating margin expansion. We delivered these results in the face of slow demand dynamics across our
short-cycle businesses throughout the second half of the year. At the same time, we achieved significant
progress with respect to the continued transformation of our portfolio, closing nearly $4 billion worth
of high-quality, strategic acquisitions that accelerate our strategy around software-enabled workflow
solutions.

As a key part of our portfolio transformation, we continue to make good progress with the integration of
Advanced Sterilization Products. We closed down China before the end of the fourth quarter, successfully
integrating the largest of the Day 2 countries and accomplishing a key milestone as we bring ASP's global
operations under our full control. We remain keenly focused on closing the remaining Day 2 countries

and ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is in place to enable us to exit the majority of the TSAs as
planned by the end of the second quarter.

At the same time, we are pleased with the significant progress that we've made toward the completion
of the separation of Vontier. In December, we announced key members of Vontier's senior management
team, including Mark Morelli as President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Naemura as Chief
Financial Officer, and we are continuing to work toward an IPO split to effect the separation. While we
have put ourselves in a position to be ready for the first step in the form of an IPO of up to 20% of Vontier
by the end of the first quarter, we will continue to assess market conditions and maintain a variety of
options for the eventual completion of the transaction, which is on track for the second half of this year, as
previously communicated.

Given that I've been challenged with a cold for the last week, Chuck will provide the details of the quarter.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q4, adjusted net earnings were $368 million, up 13%
over the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.03. Sales grew 13.9% to $2
billion based on strong contribution from recent acquisitions and a slight increase in core revenue, which
came in largely as expected. Core revenue growth was highlighted by mid-single-digit or better growth at
Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Gordian, Industrial Scientific and Matco, which was largely offset by declines across
the short-cycle businesses within Professional Instrumentation. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange
rates reduced growth by 110 basis points.

Geographically, core revenue in developed markets grew low single digits reflecting the continued soft
macro conditions in both North America and Western Europe. Core revenue growth in North America
was up low single digits, while Western Europe declined mid-single digits. High-growth markets core
revenue decreased mid-single digits due to slower performance at Fluke, Tektronix and GVR. China posted
a high single-digit decline as strong growth at Qualitrol and Sensing Technologies was more than offset
by the headwinds associated with the winding down of the double-wall tank upgrade cycle at GVR and the
Huawei-impacted Tektronix.

Adjusted profit margin was 23.3%, representing a year-over-year increase of 60 basis points. Core
operating margin increased 150 basis points, driven by solid execution and strong operating margin
expansion across the breadth of our portfolio. More than half of our operating companies each generated
greater than 100 basis points of operating margin expansion during the quarter.

During the fourth quarter, we generated $452 million of free cash flow representing an increase of 17%
year-over-year. This strong performance resulted in free cash flow conversion ratio of 123% of adjusted
net income for the quarter.

Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted sales growth of 23.1% despite a low single-
digit decrease in core revenue. The significant contribution of recent acquisitions continue to drive overall
growth within Professional Instrumentation. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth
by 50 basis points.

Segment-level adjusted operating margins were 25.1%, including a core operating margin increase of
130 basis points, which was offset by 190 basis points of dilutive operating margins associated with
acquisitions. Our core operating margin increase was driven by price, supply chain savings and business
model execution.

Field solutions core revenue increased slightly, including a low single-digit increase in developed markets
as growth at ISC, Gordian and Qualitrol was partially offset by a decline at Fluke in North America. High-
growth markets decreased slightly.

Fluke improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, but still declined low single-digit year-over-year
primarily as a result of continued softness at Fluke Industrial. In North America, Fluke declined low single
digits but saw some early signs of stabilization. In China, Fluke declined high single digits as we expected,

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

reflecting negative points-of-sale trends. Fluke Health Solutions grew mid-single digits, led by Landauer,
which saw strong orders from the U.S. Army for its RadWatch radiation monitoring device. Fluke Digital
Systems grew mid-teens led by eMaint, which posted another double-digit increase in net new customers
and greater than 20% increase in annual recurring revenue.

PRÜFTECHNIK continues to perform ahead of expectations and has greatly enhanced the broader Fluke
reliability offering. Fluke continues to see excellent momentum from its revolutionary II900 Sonic Imager
which generated $20 million worth of revenue in 2019 following its launch at the end of April that year.

ISC delivered high single-digit core growth, driven by strong growth across North America and Western
Europe. ISC's subscription-based iNet performed well, generating high single-digit growth and strong
new customer bookings. The momentum at iNet reflects the growing demand for ISC's expanding set of
real-time, WiFi-enabled connected worker solutions as more facilities adopt live-monitoring capabilities to
improve safety performance.

Intelex grew double digits in the fourth quarter as strong bookings and share gains helped deliver a record
year for customer wins with a 17% increase year-over-year in total new customers. The ISC and Intelex
teams also continue to make progress with the integration of the Intelex software offering with iNet in
order to unlock the opportunity for future cross-selling.

Qualitrol's core revenue grew mid-single digits, marking the first positive quarter for both core growth and
bookings since 2017. Qualitrol delivered strong growth in North America, China and Latin America, which
was partially offset by continued challenges in Western Europe and the Middle East.

Turning to our facilities and asset management businesses. Gordian performed very well in the quarter,
delivering greater than 20% core growth. This performance was driven by strong growth across our
procurement platform with increased construction volume from large enterprise customers, including
the United States Postal Service. Gordian also saw momentum across estimating and facilities planning,
reflecting the initial return on strategic investments that we made in its product offering and sales force.
With facilities planning's application of FBS sales and lead management tools, we helped Gordian end the
quarter with its largest backlog in its history.

Accruent saw a sequential growth in the fourth quarter but registered high single-digit decline on a
year-over-year basis driven by a tough comparison given the large amount of licensing deals that hit
in the fourth quarter of 2018. While the pace of SaaS bookings wasn't enough to offset the licensing
revenue decline in the quarter, Accruent continues to drive better sales execution and productivity
with a higher win rate for larger software deals and improved cross-selling. Accruent continues to
see strong performance across a number of its key product lines, including its EMS, 360 Facility and
connectivity offerings, all of which generated greater than 20% bookings growth in 2019 and carried
strong momentum into 2020.

Product realization core revenue decreased high single digits as PacSci EMC and Invetech was more than
offset by continued weakness at Tektronix. EMC generated low single-digit sales growth versus a tough
compare from the prior year led by defense electronics and commercial aerospace offerings as we saw
momentum with its commercial satellite customers as well. EMC continued to see broad-based bookings
momentum, allowing it to maintain strong backlog and excellent revenue visibility for the year ahead.

Tektronix registered double-digit -- a low double-digit decrease in core revenue. As expected in the
quarter, Tektronix saw continued pressure from many of the same headwinds that emerged earlier in
2019, including slowing at Keithley, weak demand in North America and Western Europe and the loss of
business from Huawei due to U.S. trade restrictions. Tektronix saw strong performance across its mid-
range oscilloscopes offering, which grew mid-single digits. The 3 and 4 Series scopes were successfully
introduced last June continued to perform particularly well, generating high-teens growth and significant
share gains in the quarter.

Core revenue for Sensing Technologies decreased low single digits as broad-based growth in China was
more than offset by continued weakness in Western Europe and flat performance in North America. Gems

benefited from improved conditions in the semiconductor end market, which returned to growth in the
fourth quarter, removing a key headwind that persisted through much of 2019.

ASP grew low single digits, led by growth in consumables as well as continued strong performance from
its service business. Geographically, ASP saw strong performance in China and Mexico. We continue
to be encouraged by ASP's performance in Japan, which saw high single-digit growth in the second
half of the year after an extended period of weaker performance prior to our ownership. At the end of
October, we closed China, and we now have approximately 80% of ASP's global revenue under our direct
control. The acquisition of Sensus, closed early in the fourth quarter, significantly enhanced our connected
workflow offerings for central sterilization departments. Sensus is off to a good start with 10% growth
in the quarter, and we're excited about the cross-selling opportunities with ASP as we provide more
comprehensive solutions to our health care facilities.

Moving to Industrial Technologies. Revenue grew 1.9%, including core revenue growth of 3.6%, which
was partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rate of 180 basis points. Segment-level adjusted
operating margins was 23.8%, including core operating margin increase of 230 basis points. The strong
OMX in Industrial Technologies was once again led by GVR, where applications of FBS drove strong margin
performance and significantly improved working capital turns as EMV ramped throughout the year.

For Transportation Technologies platform, core revenue grew mid-single digits led by low double-digit
growth in North America. GVR generated mid-single digit core growth, led by high single-digit increase in
developed markets. As expected, GVR delivered another quarter of strong performance in North America
tied to sustained momentum from EMV-related sales as the October liability shift deadline approaches.
GVR registered mid-single digit decline across high-growth markets as strong performance in Latin
America was more than offset by a slower quarter in China and India. GVR continues to see good early
momentum with its Insite360 remote Forecourt management solution, which enables customers to
monitor and update fuel dispensers remotely. They also recently released a new fuel procurement and
logistics solution on Insite360 called HALO, which will -- has been well received by the market.

GVR recently received a large order for Tritium EV chargers from a major European oil company, the
largest such order to date from a legacy GVR customer. This win, and the potential for a larger opportunity
to support a broader EV charging rollout across the customer's network, highlights the opportunity for
GVR to leverage the distribution and service capabilities across its existing customer base of Tritium's -- in
support of Tritium's continued growth.

TeletracNavman core revenue decreased mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations.
TeletracNavman saw strong continued growth in Asia Pacific, which was more than offset by declines
in North America and Western Europe. The TeletracNavman team continues to work to stabilize its
North America business with overhauled customer support processes, reducing the customer churn and
enhancing margin. While there is significant work ahead, the TeletracNavman team is making progress
with root causes of the higher churn, laying the groundwork for improved performance ahead.

Moving to franchise distribution. The platform's core revenue grew low single digit during the fourth
quarter, driven by the strength at Matco. Matco's performance was led by growth across its power tools,
tool storage and specialty tools category. Matco continues to benefit from strong product vitality and
the success of new product introductions. The power tool category, in particular, was supported by
the introduction of the Cordless Infinium high-performance impact wrench and high-speed ratchet kit.
Matco also introduced its maximum light diagnostic scan tool in December, bringing to market the latest
extension of Matco's growing diagnostics offering.

With that, I'll hand it back over to Jim.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Chuck. To wrap up, the fourth quarter represented a strong finish to 2019 with continued
momentum from Industrial Technologies and solid execution from Professional Instrumentation in a
challenging environment. Our performance in the quarter provided a clear demonstration of both the

power of the Fortive Business System and the increasing resilience of our portfolio, enabling us to deliver
150 basis points of core operating margin expansion in the face of slow short-cycle demand that persisted
throughout the quarter.

In 2019, we faced a number of challenges head on from tariff-related headwinds to short-cycle slowing
through the back half of the year. Despite these challenges, we delivered strong margin expansion and
free cash flow and saw approximately 7% revenue growth across the software businesses we have
acquired since spin. In addition, we have made significant progress toward the integration of ASP, while
also moving forward with the separation of Vontier to position Fortive for the future. Clearly, there are
signs out there of continued industrial slowness, and we're cautious about the macroeconomic outlook for
the coming quarters.

With respect to guidance, we are initiating our full year 2020 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance at $3.68
to $3.78, representing year-over-year growth of 6% to 9% on a continuing operations basis. The annual
guidance assumes low single-digit core revenue growth, 50 basis points of core OMX and an effective tax
rate of approximately 16%. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of
$0.70 to $0.74, representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 7%. This includes assumptions of low single-
digit core revenue decline and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. Our first quarter guidance also
anticipates a $0.02 headwind from the disruption we have seen so far associated with the coronavirus
outbreak in China. This is a very fluid situation, and we are monitoring it very closely. Obviously, first and
foremost, the safety of our employees throughout China is our top priority.

In closing, I want to take a minute to acknowledge the efforts of the broader Fortive team across
the globe. 2019 was a truly transformational year for our team. And while it was not a year without
challenges, I'm extremely proud of how our team performed and responded. It's the dedication of our
people and their relentless commitment to continuous improvement that drive the Fortive Business
System and enable us to deliver greater long-term value for all of our stakeholders. I look forward to the
next decade ahead with our outstanding team. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin.

Griffin Whitney
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Angela, we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just the first question around Slide 10, the 2020 EPS bridge. Looking at that piece on the left, the
$0.16 of core because I guess I'm trying to understand, because I think the restructuring savings from
last year gave you about $0.14. And then if you put in core growth, low single digits with that 50 bps
OMX, that gets you about $0.16. So I'm just trying to understand where does the restructuring savings --
or the core growth fit in that bridge.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Well, Julian, this is Chuck. I think that what -- you're doing that roughly correct. I think that it just really
depends on how much growth you're putting in there. And then maybe the one wildcard that we're -- we
probably got embedded in here a little bit is how long PI stays down. We've got a negative in Q1 here, but
probably flat in the first half and has that continue into Q3.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I see, that $0.16 incorporates both the organic growth and the restructuring savings?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

That's correct.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then my second question, just maybe help us understand the biggest moving pieces within the PI core
margin. It was down a bunch in Q3, up a lot in Q4, and then it looks like it's guided to drop again in Q1.
So maybe just help us understand what's swinging that around in the context of sort of steady-ish declines
in organic sales.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Julian, it's Jim.

First, you're right about Q4. If you sort of think about the second half and what we saw in PI in the second
half, we're probably down 20 or so bps for the second half. So a number -- what we saw in Q4 was some
really strong pricing. We saw -- we always get a bigger portion of our supply chain savings near the end
of the year, and we certainly saw that. So those 2 plus a little bit better mix was really what drove the
stronger margin expansion in the quarter. As we go into -- you certainly have some headwinds of things
like salaries and things like that, that come into the first quarter, that will be part of the offset. But I
think part of it is just -- we'll see the big businesses, Fluke and Tek, be about the same relative to their
contribution. But I think as you see the coronavirus hit here, and that's principally and that hit is going to
be more in PI probably than anywhere else.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Jim, I hope you're feeling better soon. So I'll just [ a bunch on ] cash. There's a couple of different
things here. So there's about $500 million and change of M&A spend during the quarter, was that all in
this acquisition, this Sensus acquisition? And then CapEx was a bit lower than we expected. Is that kind of
better job on CapEx? Or was that a push out relative to your original guidance for '19?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

I think I would take the second one first, the CapEx. I think that -- I don't think that's appreciably lower
or different than we normally see. So maybe I'd try to go back and figure out. If we gave you that
impression, we shouldn't have, because I think we're pretty stable on that piece. And on the first piece
you're talking about, how much of the -- are you talking about the deal cost?

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Is it -- is that all Sensus? Or was there 2 or 3 smaller deals in there as well? What I'm trying to figure
out is what -- how big is the Sensus acquisition? What should be -- we model for 2020?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

I understand. Yes. No, that's the Sensus acquisition.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Any details you can give us on revenue contribution for '20?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Relative to Sensus?

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

So yes, that business is, I think, roughly $50-ish million so figure double-digit kind of growth, you're
probably talking in the $10 million range for the year. That's -- it's mostly a SaaS business. So I think
some -- if we think about how that [ brand ] will continue to grow and we think we'll probably put some
additional investment in it in order to accelerate growth through the year as we work with the team there.

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the combination of Sensus, along with what we've got at
ASP, gives us a really strong offering in central sterilization department. So some of our effort here to
accelerate the growth is going to be some investment in go-to-market in order to make sure that we can
accelerate that growth through the year.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. I don't want to overstay my welcome here but what kind of margin profile does Sensus have?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

Pretty close, lower operating margins than what we would at the start -- but high gross margin. So you're
talking about gross margins in the 60s. They do have a service business. So the software, obviously, is in
the high 80s and 90s kind of range. But then there's a service and installation component to it that brings
the margins down. We think we can continue to grow that margin profile over time. And obviously, the
operating margins will start to come up. I think they're in the -- roughly the 20s now and they'll probably
be in that range this year.

Operator

And your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just on ASP, what are the organic revenue contributions from that business for 2020?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

I think the -- it's going to be low single digit, but that probably high -- it's moving up as things -- as we
get more of the revenue under our own shop. So I think that's going to be pushing [ 3 ] would be my
guess.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay, so that includes kind of that push forward of kind of the TSA impact. So we can think about the
revenue base and then just grow that by 3%? Or is that kind of the organic growth, excluding the impact
from whatever happened last year with the TSA?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

I think -- by the way, what I'm talking about is how the end customer growth is going to grow, think about
that at 3%.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. So but what is the actual organic revenue contribution to the [ comp ] to -- you can define it
anyway you want. So just as a percentage of Fortive total revenues, the amount you would include as
organic from that business specifically.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, it's probably going to be north of $25 million. On the organic -- just the organic growth. Now keep in
mind, we didn't have Q1 in there last year. So just make sure you don't...

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. So it's a 9 month. Yes, so it's a 9-month mix in is what you're saying.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

Okay. And then just on cash flow for the fourth quarter, some things moving around, there was a decent
bump from accruals and another kind of decent drag from I think, from prepaids or something like that. Is
that kind of the unwind of some of this TSA stuff that you talked about earlier in the year? Was that just
organic performance? Anything kind of going on there that was kind of a big swinger year-over-year in the
fourth quarter?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, I don't -- I think that there were some those things were probably related to how J&J got us the cash
that, that business created in the fourth quarter. But I don't think I would say that, that is what you should
expect us to be able to do in the fourth quarter. And that there wasn't an unusual bump there.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. So it's not like anything was kind of pulled out of 2020. That's kind of a clean base for 2020.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, it's normal seasonality for us to be really strong in the fourth quarter and lighter in Q1.

And your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So last quarter, you gave a view and that organic revenue declines will continue into first quarter and
probably second quarter. You sort of reiterated that, I think, today. Do you still see the likely return to
growth happening in third quarter? And more importantly, other than coronavirus, what are the 1, 2 items
that could swing that earlier or later?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think as we look at the guide, Andrew, we don't have any dramatic improvement that I would
say is counting on a big economic swing. Our comps get a little easier in the second half. So you have
a little bit of that. And we've got some product launches. So I would say if the upside -- if things were
to get better in Europe, I think that would be some upside to us. That would be 1 thing. I think we've
got North America, I think we've seen North America fairly stable. If we start to think about some of
the places where we see some point-of-sale, as an example, we've seen some growth lately in point-of-
sale. Admittedly, still kind of low single digit, but we're seeing growth. So I think the upside story would
be probably China accelerates -- forget just beyond corona, but it just accelerates to a little bit better.
And Western Europe comes back to growth maybe sooner. I think those are probably 2 of the embedded
things. You could go OpCo by Opco, but I think geography is probably the best way to think about it.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then just a follow-up question on price/cost. Could it be more favorable for you in 2020? I
imagine tariff impact is slowing, and you can still command decent pricing, and how does Phase 1 trade
deal sort of figure into your calculation of price cost into 2020? How does it impact you?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

So to take the second piece of that, the trade deal that they just signed wasn't going to impact us either
way. And so that's no impact for us. I think that in terms of some of our actions, I think you saw our

margin expand here at the end of the year, reflecting that maybe some of our price will carry into next
year. And I'd like to think that in the first half, we've got some good momentum there. I think from a cost
standpoint, we don't -- it does not feel like a severely inflationary environment for us. So I think that our
position's going to be pretty strong there.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I guess, just first question on the Vontier IPO. I guess, Jim, depending on which way I tilt my head
here, it seems like you might come out of this whole thing pretty close to net debt-free on the Fortive
piece. Is that a fair way to think about it and a fair way to think about kind of the acquisition firepower as
we get through the transaction?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well we'll certainly be in a good position, that's for sure. As we highlighted in the prepared remarks about
our plan here, still a lot of things to do. I'll let Chuck specifically comment about how we're thinking about
the debt structure here.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, I don't think -- I think we're going to be improved, but especially given if an IPO would net some
proceeds and accelerate where we get to. But we're -- both of these companies are going to have M&A
firepower here. And so I don't think we get to net debt 0 on Fortive. I think Vontier is going to -- will take
some of the debt, but not a disproportionate amount.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about this $0.16 of core improvement in 2020. I guess if
the demand environment were to firm up, especially in the back half, I guess, what's the bias to reinvest
some of the restructuring versus what will fall to the bottom line. I guess, maybe a different way of asking
is if growth is better, is it $0.16 plus whatever growth does? Or should we expect some leakage from
reinvestment that's currently being held back?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Well, I think we'd always look for opportunities to -- where we could accelerate growth. But I think the
reason we did the restructuring is so that we could deliver growth. And if we see the back half accelerate.
I think we see us deliver our normal VCM fall through of around 35%. And maybe a little bit more. But
we'll happily deal with that situation when we see it materializing.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Jim or Chuck, can you talk about how you're thinking about GVR in 2020. You obviously still have U.S.
EMV- related growth. But then you have China slowing and India, I think, it's been lumpy lately. I surmise
it's a contributor to 2020, but maybe orders are getting pushed a bit. So can you give us more color on
how to think about that business overall and what you're seeing.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure, Andy. Thanks. So I think the China thing is pretty predictable. We have a double-wall tank
upgrade. We've seen tremendous benefit last year from that. And we knew inevitably that, that was
going to sort of wane, and that came in fairly predictable. So I don't think China will be a big source of
growth for GVR necessarily in 2020. India will. We really have seen more -- we've actually been -- most
recently, we've seen some good news on some of our project rollouts. So the first quarter may be a little
hit and miss. But I think as we get into the second quarter and in the back half of the year, you're going
to see India be a contributor to growth for GVR as well as some of the other high-growth markets. So
as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, Latin America was a highlight for them as well in the quarter.
And then maybe the bigger story is now -- obviously, EMV is the big story. Came in really the way we
thought it should come in, in the quarter. That will continue to be helpful in 2020. And I think what we
saw, which is nice to see, was the comments we made around starting to see some of the benefits with
GVR customers in Europe with Tritium. So that's a starting point for growth as well. So a number of levers
that we think can get them -- will be additive to their growth rate. But EMV still will be the big number
there throughout this year.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then just asking about Accruent. It was starting to slow last quarter, you talked about the conversion
to SaaS. I think you mentioned high single-digit declines in Q4, given the tough comp. Do you guys think
this is more of a just traditional decline, as you called it last quarter? Or is it more cyclical? And what's
your outlook for Accruent here in 2020.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. If we looked over -- if we sort of get away from the quarters and just look at our ownership of --
we've seen mid single-digit growth at Accruent since our ownership. So I think what we've seen here
recently is, first of all, like we said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing good growth in some of the
SaaS offerings. We mentioned Connectiv, which is our health care offering, which did really well. As an
example, our EMS offering and our 360 Facility offering, which are really parts of our CMMS offering and
space management offering.

So we saw some good SaaS bookings growth in those businesses. We do have parts of the legacy business
that were down, as we mentioned last quarter, and were down more than we thought or thought they
were going to be. Some of that is larger licensing deals that we had in the fourth quarter of over a year
ago, which made for a tough comp. But I think as we sit here in 2020, we look forward with the team, we
certainly see our path back to that sort of mid-single-digit and better growth. With the SaaS business, it
takes a little while for that to kick in. But we're still very excited about the business. And then we think
more broadly about Gordian as well as what we've done with Fluke Digital and eMaint as that sort of
almost $0.5 billion of facilities and asset management businesses, those businesses growing exceptionally
good. So the market dynamics are good. Like we said, we've got a little bit of work to do at Accruent, we
talked about that. I think that's consistent with what we said before. But when we look in total, what we're
doing from an all Fortive perspective, I think we like where we're at, and we like the future opportunities
as well.

Operator

And your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Maybe just following up to some of those earlier questions around the balance sheet. Can you talk a little
bit about how the pipelines look like for each of the businesses as we go forward from a capital allocation
standpoint and the ability to do M&A?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, I think we certainly are -- we completed Sensus in the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, we
did Intelex as well in the second half. So a couple of very good deals in the second half. In the summer,
we had PRÜFTECHNIK. So we had good additions and the breadth was pretty good as well. Intelex really
being part of our ISC safety offering, Sensus being part of our health care offering, PRÜFTECHNIK really in
the core of Fluke business. So as we look across those funnels, John, across all of our businesses, I think
we're in a very good place with all of our funnels. We just reviewed our strategic plan for the next several
years with our Board and highlighted the opportunities for some of our key platforms. And we really see
across a number of platforms opportunities for capital deployment. Obviously, we're pretty busy right now
with some of the things we've got going and but we continue to be active, and we're hopeful that we'll get
some things done here in 2020 as well.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then as we think about Vontier, I don't think we've had a chance, since you've announced the
management team there, to kind of get your perspective. Just wanted to get your thoughts on both the
appointment of Mark and Dave there.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we're really excited. I think Mark is a bit -- is a very much a person with -- who's got a considerable
continuous improvement experience. He's been a student of DBS and FBS for a long time and has
applied it in his businesses. He certainly goes back to some United Technology days where they were
implementing a number of Lean principles. So I think he brings public company experience, he brings
business transformation experience, he's incredibly results oriented. So I think Mark is somebody who
we're really excited about.

And Dave Naemura is really coming back, right? Dave was the group CFO for us before he went to Gates.
And Dave's a great financial leader. He's worked with Chuck and I for decades. And I think it's -- we're
really excited. Dave knows these businesses. He's coming into the organization knowing these businesses,
having had some financial responsibility for these businesses before he left. So I think the combination
of both external experience, both having public company experience, but also their belief in continuous
improvement, I really think sets up already with a great leadership team that we already have in those
businesses. We think Vontier's future is very strong with the leaders that we now have in place.

And your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I really appreciate that you all were brave enough to take a stab at what the coronavirus impact would
be in the first quarter. We've seen really 1 other company to go through that math. [ Xylem ] did it today.
So I'd be interested in hearing a bit more with any precision if you can, what's the -- how do you get that
$0.02? Is it the plant shutdowns? Any assumption about the supply chain, maybe we can start there.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Deane. It's obviously, as we said, it's an evolving situation, and our first priority is the safety
and security of our people over there. And obviously, a very difficult situation for the country of China,
the health crisis that it is. So I think, first and foremost, we're focused on making sure that our teams
are fine. And we're doing what we can from a business perspective, to help in the situation. We have
some products, as an example at Fluke, that are helpful to diagnosing some things relative to some of our
temperature measurement products as an example. So that's first and foremost.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

How we got to the $0.02 is really, I think, pretty straightforward. It's really another week of being down.
So that's inactivity of not only the factories but also customers. And the fact that I think we ramped slower
than normal. I've been pretty -- we've talked about China and how you come out of the new year for a
number of times. I have a couple of decades of experience of leading our efforts over there. And usually,
you come up a little slower coming out of the new year as -- and we just think that's going to be a little
slower. So it's really the combination of the lost week and really not probably coming up as quickly as we
typically would out of the new year.

Now I'll tell you, Deane, as you know, it's an evolving situation relative to next week. February 10 is really
the starting point, which -- and we're really looking at 3 things: one is how are our customers going to
come back, how is commercial transactions going to start-up and occur; the second thing is our factories
and our Tier 1 and Tier 2 and even Tier 3 supply chain, and how quickly they come up, we're pretty
confident about our own factories, but seeing the supply chain come up; and then I think the third piece is
just the freight lanes, what's going to happen. We do ship, as an example, on some commercial flights, as
an example. So we'll just have to see how that happens. And really, all that's going to sort of evolve next
week and in the weeks to come as we start to see things. We're -- we've got countermeasures in place on
all 3 of those situations. But we have to get into it to see how things play out and how quickly. But we felt
obligated with what we've known pretty much over the last maybe 2 or 3 days, we've really felt obligated
to be very clear about what we think will happen thus far.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's great color. We're all hoping for the best there. And then on ASP and Sensus, interesting you were
citing the opportunities from sort of cross-selling, and that's kind of the whole strategy around bolt-ons.
Can you give any kind of examples of what cross-selling might be? And are the sales forces provided any
incentives along those lines?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. So first, well, Sensus is a great business, in and of itself. And so one is the team there is -- we're
going to accelerate some investments in commercial opportunities to really take their solution forward,
which we think is a really great solution for central sterilization departments. So that's first and foremost.

And then as we said, we've got, in some customer sets, we probably have a stronger position in some
places, like IDNs, as an example, they're very strong. So the opportunity for it to cross-sell within those
situations is certainly there, and we're certainly incentivizing the sales force. On a global basis, we
probably have more opportunity to take the ASP customer set and introduce Sensus to them because
obviously, ASP is such a global business. So really, both opportunities but -- to really cross-sell. But I do
want to make sure we emphasize it. We bought a good business to begin with. As I said, over 10% growth
in the fourth quarter. That's not in our core number yet. But we think very strongly that this is a great
combination for us to go forward with.

And your next question is from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Jim, could you touch a little bit -- circle around to Fluke Industrial? I think you kind of spoke to some
seasonal growth there in the fourth quarter relative to the third so that would seem encouraging. How
does the channel look to you at this point? And does that business start to cycle more favorably by
midyear? Or what's your general feeling on Fluke Industrial?

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

Yes. We saw a little bit better performance in the fourth than we did in the third, and a little bit better
performance than we originally thought. And I think that was principally in North America. If we think
about point-of-sale trends at Fluke in the fourth quarter, the U.S. grew a little bit; Western Europe and
China were still down; China, off a tough comp. So we really -- we've got to come out, as I mentioned
a few questions ago, corona probably [ hasn't impacted ] Fluke maybe more dramatically just given the
daily volume of business that goes on at Fluke. So we've got to watch that in China. We think the U.S.
continues to sort of stay on track. We don't really see big inventory issues. And in Western Europe, we still
think it's going to probably be flattish to down here, at least in the first half, start maybe to get a little bit
better based on comp.

The inventory positions within the channel are pretty good. So we don't expect any dramatic downturn in
the economy from here with these industrial customers. And so you would think that most of the inventory
corrections are behind us at this point.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then let me just, again, kind of stay on the short-term business here. But with Tek, I think
most of the T&M companies in the electronics side, have their toughest comps with Huawei in the first and
part of the second quarter. I mean, not only was business ramping, but we obviously saw the restrictions
go in place in May, I think, of last year. But is that the case with Tektronix on the lost business? Is their
functionality from a T&M standpoint the same? Did it ramp on that same time frame. So comps are very
tough, pretty much through the second quarter there at Tek?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, I mean, I think if the restriction certainly went in, we heard about them right at the end of May, so
there's still 5 months of tougher compares in the first half of this year. There's a little bit in a normal year,
a little bit more in the second half than the first half, but I don't think that's enough to worry about. But
it's in the first 5 months of this year and not beyond that.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

I think the more dramatic number at Tek though, really, Rick, is going to be just seeing that market come
back in North America and Europe. That's really that the Huawei thing is something and it's something for
Tek. But if we were to really think about what's really a larger piece that we usually see 3 or 4 quarters
are down -- 4 to 5 quarters of downturn when this sort of turns. And I think that's kind of our current
thought. Large -- as you know, while larger purchases get delayed for a little while but they can't be
delayed forever. And so we think we'll start to see things start to improve as we get further into the year.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then just the last question for me. The core growth for '20, the guide there, low single digits.
If I think about PI and IT, it seems to me that PI would start off fairly negatively because of these short-
term issues at Fluke Industrial and Tek. And then perhaps, from a core growth standpoint, strengthen in
the second half, whereas potentially IT starts off strong with some GVR backlog and maybe fades a little
bit in the fourth quarter -- by the fourth quarter. Is there much difference between PI and IT as they relate
to that low single-digit corporate core?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Rick, this is Chuck. I think you roughly have PI correctly being negative, especially in the first half running
into easier comps but still being low single digit. I don't quite sit the same way with IT as it goes through
the year. I think that they have a little bit of a tough compare here earlier in Q1 versus last year. But I'd
expect them in that low mid-single-digit growth in -- from -- or throughout the balance of the year, I don't

think, even though the liability shift is in October, I don't think that we'll see a slowdown in this business,
especially the -- I'm talking about the EMV wave, that will continue on beyond the end of 2020. So I don't
think it slows down the back half of the year on anything I can see.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

And a couple of things we said before, Rick, just put that in context, like we were talking about EMV, like
we just talked about. As I also mentioned, India improves through the second half. So you start to see --
I think electric vehicles, the EV charging business, probably ramps a little bit more. So you've got a few
things that are going to start to accelerate through the year that are non-EMV related as well.

Operator

And your next question is from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Just picking up on that IT discussion. So if IT is kind of low to mid-single digit this year, the margins are
-- in the first quarter, and I think for the year, are relatively flat. Yes, we've got some of these EMV, I'm
assuming those are pretty good profit contribution benefits throughout the year. Why is the OMX now a
little bit higher for IT based on your guide?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Well, one, I think IT is coming off of a pretty strong year. But I would think that IT would come through
with -- I mean if you're talking about our business, it's growing 3% or 4%. 50 basis points is what you
would expect to see. And I think that, that is -- that's what you're going to see with IT going through the
year.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. So I thought, Chuck, I thought IT was a little bit more flat in your guide in terms of the performance
in the first quarter and 2020. But you're saying it's actually going to be up about 50 basis points? Or
should be?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

I thought you were talking about operating margin expansion. I'm sorry, but the -- I think that IT will be
up in Q1, not taking into account that coronavirus would be about, I think it's 3% and then accelerate
slightly through the year.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Yes. No, I was talking about operating margin expansion. So we're talking about the same thing.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

They just had a quarter where they did 200. So I think that there's good momentum there, but then
they're lapping some really tough compares. They had great margin expansion all last year.

been an announcement yet. What's the timing on that?

Well, yes, we haven't commented on the Board. I mean, we've got a lot of degrees of freedom. We've
announced Karen as our Chair. And so we've got to a Chair, we're building a Board at the construct.
We never want to comment on who's going to join the Board or whatever, based on, as you know,
commitments and how many boards people are on. I would say that our Board recruiting has been
incredibly positive. We've had a number of folks that have been interested. And we're in the process
of interviewing those folks. We -- because of the structure we've talked about, we're in good shape for
what we need to do for the IPO, and I think we're in very good shape to -- as we move forward with the
separation, the full separation, if you will, later in the year.

And Jim, what are the next milestones, if anything, from a time line perspective?

Charles E. McLaughlin

of things going on, as we've noted even on this call. So we're going to assess what the best market timing
has gone -- is for us. But we'll be in position by that point. But we're really pleased with our progress. And
as you mentioned, the management team is in place. And we'll see what the market conditions look like.

James A. Lico
