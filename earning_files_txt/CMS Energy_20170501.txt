Thank you, Keith
Well, I'm sure many of you saw the news this morning
Tom Webb has announced his retirement after 15 years here at CMS Energy
Tom's shoes are awfully big to fill, so we were very discerning in our replacement
It is my privilege to introduce Rejji Hayes, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, joining us with a decade of experience in our industry at both Exelon and ITC, following his time at Lazard and Bank of America
Rejji is a great addition to the CMS Energy family
Now, you know we take succession planning very seriously here
This news is just another example of how we prepare for orderly transitions of our management team
In fact, at my very first board meeting as CEO, I discussed my own potential successors
We require that our senior executives retire at the age of 65, and Tom is nearing that time
We are right on plan
Tom has been named Vice Chairman and will work with Rejji and the rest of the management team for the next six months to assure a smooth transition
We still have lots of work for Tom to do, so don't be in too much of a hurry to say goodbye just yet
We have plenty of time for that between now and November
In fact, Tom, Rejji and I will see many of you next week during our road show
Both Tom and I have confidence, and you should, too, that the team, now including Rejji, will continue to deliver the consistent financial results that you have come to expect
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom
Thank you, Tom
I'll be covering our first quarter results
I'll talk about our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance, enabled by our Consumers Energy Way
Stand by because I will also share my story of the month, as always, and Tom will cover our results and outlook
We're off to a strong start for the year in spite of a mild winter and several storms
We're up $0.12 over 2016, and when we weather normalize, that's up over 20% or $0.14. We're reaffirming our full-year adjusted guidance for 2017 at 68% or $2.14 to $2.18. We can sustainably and consistently deliver this performance by remaining true to our stand for people, planet and profit, underpinned by world-class performance
When we say people, we mean our customers, our communities, our co-workers and other critical stakeholders
And our commitment to the planet is demonstrated by our track record of going above and beyond environmental regulation to leave the planet better than we found it
We do not compromise profitability in these pursuits because we believe in the end around here
Our triple bottom line is made possible because we are squarely focused on world-class performance, and it underpins everything we do
Given the passage of the energy law at the end of 2016 and its implementation in flight, it's very helpful that Governor Snyder reinforced the stability and strength of our Michigan Public Service Commission by extending Chairman Talberg's term to July 2021. This was enabled by swapping terms with Commissioner Saari
The Governor also reappointed Commissioner Eubanks to July of 2023. The new law serves our customers very well and strengthens our regulatory construct in Michigan
We're working with the Commission to implement several aspects such as the new energy efficiency and waste reduction standard, the 10-month filing calendar, the 15% renewable portfolio standard, and the new state reliability mechanism
In addition, we have active gas and electric rate cases, as well as our Palisades early termination securitization filing
We've asked a lot of our Commission and their staff
Their continuity and experience is a real advantage, and we're thankful to have such professionals in place
We gauge our effectiveness with our customers through their feedback to us
We're proud of the improvements for both our residential and our business customers
Our customers are noticing that we're continuously improving their experience
Despite our progress, however, we are still dissatisfied
Our customer feedback scores put us very close to the best in our industry, but are still over 200 points on a 1,000-point scale from perfect
We are in pursuit of world-class, and won't be satisfied until we demonstrate excellence in every interaction with our customers and when they believe that we are, in fact, the very best
One area where our customers and others are taking note is the transformation of our generation fleet
As you can see, we've made big progress in reducing our reliance on coal for both capacity and energy by retiring more coal plants than any other investor on utility, and investing in renewable, as well as fully utilizing our low-cost gas plants
We call this our Clean & Lean approach
It seems to make sense for people that when we say clean, it reflects our commitment to the planet by replacing our coal plants with investments in renewable assets and gas plants
People do still ask us, however, what we mean when we say lean
Lean, the heart of Consumers Energy Way, reflects the commitment to waste elimination and improving our performance at the same time, not just cost reduction for cost reduction's sake
For example, we could have built a brand-new oversized gas plant to replace our coal units, but instead, we purchased a low-cost under-utilized gas plant
We are fully utilizing it now and running it really well
This saved our customers over $0.5 billion, allowed us to deploy our capital to an area of greater value, and reduced our carbon footprint simultaneously
Like all things we tackle, we serve people, the planet, and profit
No trade-offs
Our MCV PPA expires in 2025, which may seem a ways off, but it's actually just around the corner from a generation and supply planning perspective
The replacement of that PPA will provide a great opportunity to deploy our Clean & Lean strategy, and transition from an expensive PPA, in this case, to a significant renewable capital investment in the $3 billion zone at a lower cost for customers and in a modular phase-in to match demand, a great example of Clean & Lean
On March 8, we experienced one of the worst wind events in Michigan's history
Approximately one in three people in Michigan were affected, and it's times like these when our team is at its best
In fact, we had several utility executives, as well as our Governor, reach out to congratulate us on our performance and asked us how we did it
We're very proud of our team for their extraordinary performance
Our customers don't hold us accountable for Mother Nature, but they do want to know what to expect during an outage
We are finding that they want to have frequent and accurate conversations with us during a major event
A shout-out to our customer service reps who handled over 116,000 calls during the storm, our IT team who supports our outage map, which took 355 hits per second on the first day of the storm, and our social media team who answered every single posting personally, 24 hours a day, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram
This is a new standard in capability for us
And that isn't even my story of the month
Smart meters during storms is my story for this month
Smart meters are part of the answer to how our performance continues to improve during major events
During a separate event in April, our traditional tools told us that our Nashville, Vermontville circuit showed a full circuit lockout, and 1,175 customers on that circuit were without power
Our ability to proactively ping those meters allowed for remote confirmation that only 178 of those customers were actually out of power
In the past, we would've run trucks for all those outages
Imagine the waste we eliminated by more surgically being able to determine the location of the interruptions
We would've wasted time and valuable resources needed in other areas of the restoration effort
We were able to accurately quantify that we reduced over 3,000 hours of customer interruption and over 50 truck rolls as a result of this one circuit and one storm, thanks to our smart meters
We don't even have our meters fully deployed yet
That's scheduled to occur by year-end
The value of our investment in the cellular technology is just beginning to materialize
It's our favorite kind of capital investment, one that improves the customer experience at a lower operating cost, and provides a real return to you, our investors
We have a proven track record to deliver for you in spite of the changes in the economy, storms, policymakers, and company leadership
This just confirms we, in fact, have a CMS Energy Way, continuously improving everything we do
Take it away, Tom
Good morning
Very nice
Lots of smiley faces
The big addition in that from our current plan to the future plan are those additional renewables that I talked about
It would be as a result of the MCV PPA replacement
So, that's a big opportunity for us to grow our plan
And so that would obviously be generation resources
We still have additional substantial gas infrastructure investments to make, however, as well
And so what we are always working to optimize is making sure that we pick our highest value CapEx and minimize rate impacts to customers
So, lower costs, really focused on affordability, and then picking our CapEx that does the balancing
Good morning, Ali
Ali, I would say it like this
First of all, as we look at what grows the plan from $18 billion to $25 billion, we see these PPAs coming off that enable the CapEx without putting pressure on the affordability
In fact, it saves customers money
So, for example, our PPA with Palisades, we're going to save customers about $45 million a year even after we replace that PPA with new generating assets
So, when we look at building out the plan, we see that as the headroom creation that's required to be able to bump up the CapEx
Well, one of the things that came out of the energy law, Ali, that passed at the end of 2016 is a study on the part of the Commission for a performance-based rate making and new rate designs, and when they – and a couple multiyear CapEx strategy reviews
So, for example, we're doing a five-year distribution modernization collaborative with the Commission
So, I would suggest that there's interest in looking at longer-term CapEx planning as it rewards customers
And so, I would think that as we work with the Commission further on having better visibility to multi-year plans, it makes it a lot easier for a Commission to agree to a multi-year investment recovery mechanism
We do have one in our gas structure today in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program
It's about $75 million annual program to replace mains and distributions, and that has a true-up annually, we've been achieving it
And so, we're getting a good track record
So, I would just suggest that, I think, there's going to be opportunities for us to work through the Commission and with the Commission to modernize our rate-making and give more visibility to the long-term investments that reward customers
Hey, Mike
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Hi
So, we think that working with the Commission and looking at the renewable portfolio standard, as well some renewable rate packages for industrial customers, we launched or we will be launching May 12, a proposal with the Commission for a renewable tariff for our large business customers
One of the interesting things with renewables right now that we're observing is that our large industrial customers, particularly those that are brand-facing, are very interested in us working with them to provide renewables
So, for example, General Motors, our Switch data centers, they've made public commitments to 100% renewables, and they want those renewables to be additive
So, our Cross Winds, the expansion that we're underway right now, is going to be fulfilling the needs of Switch for the data center that they built in Grand Rapids to provide the additive renewable generation to serve their load
And so, we do think that there will be ratemaking that goes into the formula as well
And so, it's an exciting time, and I do think our Clean & Lean strategy is well placed with the demands of customers, their desires, as well as the ability to replace our high-cost PPAs right now
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Great
And also, safe to say, with DIG contracting at about $4.25 a kilowatt a month, is that – is it fair to say that you're relatively unaffected by the recent low MISO capacity auction results?
Yeah
Here's what I would say about the MISO auction
I'm sure there's going to be – there are who have questions about the MISO auction
This is what we observed, that the low cost or the low price in that MISO auction tells us a couple of things
One, it says that MISO is predominantly regulated, and so there was definitely a low-price bidding strategy
However, I think it also is fair to say that a one-year forward auction is not a good telltale for generation-planning and resource adequacy
Last year's Zone 7, as you all know, was at $72 a megawatt day
And when we compare that, obviously, to this year's $150, we saw more energy efficiency and demand response
We'll be studying Zone 7 more in detail specifically
But what it tells us is that it's not a good planning tool
It can be a red flag, it can be a warning bell, but it's a warning bell that's too late
And so, we're very grateful that we passed the energy law at the end of 2016. We really thought the FERC was going to approve the MISO three-year auction
And when they didn't, it was great that the energy law had gone into place because it provides the three-year visibility, in fact, four years of visibility for both the utilities and the alternative energy suppliers for who's providing the load
And so, the transparency, the forward-looking nature of the process that's been put in place by the Commission is going to serve a much better forward-looking telltale than the MISO auction currently does
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC That's great
Thank you very much, and I look forward to working with you again, Rejji
Hey, Greg
Well, obviously, the results aren't complete yet
If someone were to build something, I would say they'd have to have proven transmission that they could import
And so, there are certainly limits to that currently and constraints on how much can be imported into Zone 7, which is the Michigan's Lower Peninsula
So, we'll – DIG is obviously a viable candidate
We'll see how it stacks up against the other offers
And like in the past, if there's a more economic solution for customers, we'll take it
We'll use the data to make a good decision
So, 2025 does feel like a long time away
That's when the contract expires
However, we have to plan for that
We're always doing forward-looking planning
And as we build out that generation strategy, and we're really trying to explore what are the limits to Clean & Lean, we see this as a key – it will be the big next step change for us in generation replacement
And so, as we looked at does Clean & Lean hold when you're looking at 1,200 megawatts of a gas PPA, and we can see there's real potential that it could, we're just trying to reinforce that we really are serious about this generation replacement strategy
We're obviously deploying it currently on the PPA from Palisades
If we have any other short-term plant closings of our own fleet, we would also deploy it there as well
And so, we're always looking, but we want to make clear that there are future opportunities that just continue to strengthen this business model for the next decade
I think a lot of people might struggle to have a 10-year CapEx plan
And so, we like to be sure that you all are clear that it's legit
We have a legitimate plan for the 10-year time horizon that we can see that meets both the CapEx demand and the affordability commitment that we have for customers
Good morning, Jonathan
Well, what will be interesting in 10 years is what's our load and what's our demand, and will it match up exactly where we are today, will it be more than where we are today, or will it be less as efficiency of motors and equipment and lighting? Does it change our mix
And so what – this whole lean idea that we would build to match more closely to demand, I think, is different
And so, I feel a need to continue to just kind of explain it and reinforce that the idea here, in the past, traditionally, utility model, you build a big generating plant and you grow into it
Your CapEx is tied up
Your operation has a big project that they're tied up in
And then you're waiting to grow in to the full utilization of that asset
And in a mature industry like ours, the idea of having underutilized major capital investments feels counterintuitive to what we've seen in other industries
And so, the idea that we would rightsize our assets to match the actual demand so that our capital is available to be deployed to other areas since we have ample need for CapEx in other parts of our system, it really is the leanest way to both deploy capital and provide the generation match to demand
We saw, when we did our RFP for our Cross Winds expansion, that we were our lowest bidder
That was pretty – that helped us really realize that we are competitive in the building of generation
So, we can stay true to our commitment to customers to be the low-cost provider
And given that, we would want to build our own because we've proven ourselves competitive
Obviously, siting this volume of wind turbines, if we assume current technology, we're talking about 900 wind turbines, it would take new sites beyond what we have today
But here's the good news
First of all, in Michigan, we have – I don't know if you've been in Northern Michigan, but there's a lot of land and there's a lot of areas
We need to complete wind studies and confirm the best places
We would not rule out doing outside state generation with transmission if that was more viable for customers
But it is really early, Jonathan
We've got a lot of time, and technology can really evolve
And there's a lot of things that could happen between here and there
But as a placeholder, we think that it passes the sniff test of possibilities
So we see the bilateral market as a much better indicator of how tight the market is
That's why we say the MISO auction is interesting and it can be a warning bell, but it's not a very good indicator of where the market really is
And the bilateral market is a much better indicator
Good morning, Travis
Well, I think the idea that we would have longer-term capital planning with our Commission, that there might be opportunities for performance-based riders that we, given our Consumers Energy Way, would have total confidence in being able to stack up our operational performance to anybody and any standards that would be set
And so, we think that potentially, that would be some transitions from our current regulatory model
I could imagine pricing changes and rate design versus a per unit based pricing
Maybe there's a different way to do pricing in this business
So, when you're asking me long-term, 10 years out, that's what I'm looking at
Short-term, we've got a strong regulatory construct in Michigan, we've got a great law that was passed in December
We're in the process of implementing it
As I mentioned in the call, there's a lot of work on the Commission's plate
And so frankly, just implementing the current law is going to keep us busy for a good several years
But we are looking long term, and I think that's one of the strengths of this Commission, that they are long-term thinkers, and the extension of their terms enables them to think long-term and that's exciting, and I think it is a big strength for us here in Michigan
Well, I think I'd encourage you to look at the total picture of what makes up a customer's price, which includes, obviously, CapEx and O&M, but also fuel
And so, when we look at the total cost for customers, we think there's big opportunity to further reduce O&M as we have a great track record to do, and we see lots of runway there, particularly with the implementation of our Consumers Energy Way, and technology advancements like smart meters and any grid modernization we might do
So, we see O&M reducing, enabled by CapEx, but we also see some fuel cost reductions, and PSCR and GCR reductions that enable affordability for customers
So, I think there's a total mix there that's important to take a look at
But when we compare CapEx projects, my favorite kind of CapEx is when we can improve safety, reliability and reduce cost at the same time, that's a winner for us on our lists
Thanks, Paul
Thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call
And as I mentioned earlier, Tom, Rejji and I look forward to seeing many of you when we hit the road next week following our board of directors meeting this week here in Jackson
Thanks so much for joining, everybody
