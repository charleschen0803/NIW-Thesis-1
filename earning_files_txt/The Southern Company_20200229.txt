THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Nelson, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to Southern Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]
Please note, today's call is being recorded, Thursday, April 30, 2020.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead,
sir.

Scott Gammill
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Nelson. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings
Call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern
Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.

Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical
information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated
in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and
subsequent filings.

In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the
applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well
as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at
investor.southerncompany.com.

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I hope that you're well. As you can see from the
materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the first quarter, ahead of our
estimate. This solid start to the year positions us well as we look to overcome short-term sales impacts
from the coronavirus. Drew will provide you with more detail on our financials momentarily so I will go
ahead and turn to our current operating environment amid the coronavirus pandemic.

At Southern Company, our top priority remains keeping every employee healthy and safe, while we
continue to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. We were well prepared
to quickly make necessary adjustments across our business, activating incident response teams
throughout the company in February. We continue to execute COVID-19 pandemic plans for our business.
And to date, our operational performance has been exceptional. We have not experienced, nor do we
currently foresee, supply chain disruptions for our utilities or our construction projects.

We often talk about the importance of the reliability and resiliency of our electric and natural gas
infrastructure, which has delivered remarkably well during this time. In face of COVID-19, our biggest
asset has really been the reliability and resiliency of our workforce. I want to thank our employees who
have risen to every challenge. We have been resourceful in rapidly procuring and deploying necessary
protective equipment and implementing effective protocols to safeguard against the virus.

Our operations and customer service teams have continued to work around the clock. We are finding
solutions to effectively work in teams remotely, and we are communicating with our workforce and
external stakeholders in a whole new way. We've implemented a wide range of projects to support the
physical, financial and emotional well-being of our employees during this time as they continue their
superb work to support the operations of our company.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

It is also a hallmark of our company to be a citizen wherever we serve. So we have worked to identify how
we can best assist our communities during these difficult times. Southern and its subsidiaries are targeting
a commitment of nearly $10 million in financial -- I'm sorry, in foundation and charitable contributions,
and our employees have logged thousands of volunteer hours to assist those impacted by the coronavirus
pandemic. I expect we will do even more in the coming months.

Let's turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We remain focused on meeting the November
'21 and November 2022 regulatory-approved in-service dates, and we continue to maintain an aggressive
work plan on-site as a tool to help position us to meet those dates. Recall, in February, we refined the
aggressive site work plan to reflect a May 2021 completion target for Unit 3 and a March 2022 completion
target for Unit 4.

We also laid out a November benchmark schedule and related milestones for Unit 3. Through March,
production for Unit 3 was generally consistent with the refined aggressive site work plan. April's
performance was challenged due to COVID-19 impact, which put us slightly behind the aggressive
site work plan. Despite these challenges, today, direct construction is approximately 90% complete.
And notably, just late-breaking news, we have just completed open vessel testing. That came in about
1:00 p.m. today. We also reached several interim construction milestones for Unit 4 during the quarter,
including the installation of the polar crane and setting the containment vessel top head.

Before giving an update on recent productivity, I want to highlight our commitment to the safety of our
workforce on-site and the surrounding community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken a
number of proactive measures intended to protect our workforce and the community against the spread of
COVID-19. As we implement these measures, we've engaged independent medical advisers to guide our
actions to reduce the possible spread of the virus. Among other measures, we have provided additional
protective equipment, enhanced sanitation practices and implemented social distancing strategies, such as
spreading out and increasing common areas, eliminating group transportation at the site and mandating
those who can telework to do so.

Beyond these basics, early on, our protocol on-site ensure that anyone tested and their close contacts
were promptly self-isolated off-site. We acted quickly to build an on-site medical clinic designed to
expedite test results, minimize turnaround time for close proximity screening and improve facilitation of
clearing personnel to return to work. Throughout this time, we have remained in close consultation with
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the projects' co-owners as well as local and state authorities.

We are also consulting with and monitoring other megaprojects. Notably, last month, the President of the
North America's Building Trades Unions commended Southern Company for going above and beyond the
call of duty to keep their members on the Vogtle construction site safe and healthy.

Now turning to our recent progress. Although, overall, monthly production through March was largely
consistent with the refined aggressive site work plan, mechanical, electrical and subcontract activities
began to build a backlog to Unit 3's aggressive site work plan at the end of March. That trend was
exacerbated through April as we began experiencing impacts across the site related to the coronavirus
pandemic, including an increase in workforce absenteeism.

Two weeks ago, in an effort to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we announced our intent to reduce
density on the site and take workforce down by 20%. As we work through this transition, we expect to see
a decrease in near-term production similar to the sawtooth effects that we have experienced in the past.
The longer-term objective is to gain operational efficiencies and productivity by reducing workforce fatigue
and absenteeism. As we move ahead, we will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our streamlined
workforce.

As you know, we regularly evaluate both cost and schedule, and we have factored recent developments
into our ongoing analysis. Looking first at schedule. We are prioritizing key work fronts on Unit 3 and
continue to work towards the aggressive site work plan targets, some of which have been pushed back
slightly in light of recent events.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

The next major milestone for Unit 3 is the start of cold hydro testing, which is currently planned to
occur in the June to July time frame. Considering our expected timing on the start of cold hydro testing,
we expect Unit 3 hot functional testing to commence in the August to September time frame. On the
assumption that we are able to stabilize and increase productivity to pre-pandemic levels, we are
maintaining the aggressive site work plan target of year-end for Unit 3 fuel load.

As a reminder, construction completion of about 2% per month is consistent with the aggressive site
work plan. Taking into account our performance to date, we now project that we need to complete
approximately 1% per month to meet the November benchmark schedule. Now this is slightly down from
the 1.3% we discussed last quarter. Importantly, even amid the outbreak of the pandemic, for April, our
construction completion rate was about 1.25%, which supports meeting the November 2021 regulatory-
approved in-service date. Critical areas of focus remain electrical and subcontract performance.

Lastly, consistent with the prioritization of Unit 3 and related staffing, we have shifted the target
completion date on the aggressive site work plan for Unit 4 back to May 2022, which still provides 6
months of margin to the regulatory-approved in-service date. Recall, under the refined aggressive site
work plan we laid out in February, we accelerated the target completion date for Unit 4 by 2 months to
March. So the current action takes us back to the prior date of May 2022.

Turning now to costs. Based on our most recent assessment, there is no change in the total project capital
cost forecast.

In the first quarter of 2020, Georgia Power allocated an additional $66 million of its project contingency,
reflecting cost risks associated with construction productivity, field support, subcontracts and procurement,
as well as the impact of the April 2020 reduction in workforce.

Recall the estimated cost of time between the aggressive site work plan and the regulatory-approved
November in-service date or a scheduled cost margin is embedded in Georgia Power's base capital
forecast. With this quarter's contingency allocation, the scheduled cost margin and the remaining cost
contingency combined continue to represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to
complete. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of the contingency funds as we progress
towards the completion of the project.

The team at Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have worked incredibly hard to create an environment at the site
that has led to meaningful progress over the past few months, even while managing through this
unprecedented pandemic. The next few months will be pivotal as we adjust to a smaller, more streamlined
workforce and seek to improve productivity.

The safety of our workforce and the surrounding community remains paramount, and we will continue
to guide our decision-making at the site. Importantly, we still expect to meet the November regulatory-
approved in-service dates for both Units 3 and 4.

Drew, I'll turn it over now to you for an update on our financials and our outlook.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everybody. I hope you all are well. As Tom mentioned, we had a very
strong start to the year. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.78, which is $0.08 higher than last year and
$0.06 above our estimate for the quarter. The primary driver compared to last year was constructive state
regulatory actions, which were completed in 2019 at our utilities.

In addition, through aggressive cost control, we were able to decrease nonfuel O&M year-over-year, which
helped us overcome a $0.10 impact from warmer-than-normal weather in the first quarter. A detailed
reconciliation of our reported and an adjusted results is included in today's release and earnings package.

Weather-normalized retail sales for the first quarter of 2020 were up slightly compared to last year, led
by our residential customer class with only modest impacts from COVID-19 evidenced in the last 2 weeks

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

of the quarter. We added over 20,000 new electric and natural gas customers across the system, which is
consistent with our expectation.

With COVID-19 top of mind, let's go ahead and turn our assessment of potential -- to the assessment of
potential business impacts. While we did not see a meaningful earnings impact from COVID-19 in the first
quarter, we are continually assessing potential financial impacts on our business.

At this time, we do not expect coronavirus impacts to materially affect our long-term outlook. Our
expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 4% to 6%. Our $40 billion 5-year capital investment plan is
unchanged. We do not foresee a need to issue equity through 2024. Liquidity is strong with good access
to the capital markets at both the parent and our subsidiaries. And with last week's announcement of an
$0.08 annual dividend increase, the 19th consecutive annual increase, we continue to demonstrate our
commitment to enhancing shareholder value.

As we think about the potential near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our 2020 expectations, our key focus
areas are sales, bad debt expense and liquidity.

Just a moment, I'm going to switch microphones, so folks can hear me better.

Starting with sales, as I mentioned, weather-normalized retail sales were up slightly for the first quarter,
likely reflecting higher residential demand at the end of March as people began teleworking. Thus
far, in April, total estimated weather-normalized electric retail demand is lower than our forecast by
approximately 8%. Though April loads are historically volatile as customers switch between heating and
cooling, we have seen demand stabilize at these approximate levels over the last few weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor trends as businesses within our states begin to reopen.

Looking ahead, we are basing our current forecast for the -- for 2020 on a U-shaped economic recovery
that reflects a midsummer phase-out of the stay-at-home policies with modest economic recovery across
the service territories over the balance of the year. Using these assumptions, our projections indicate an
overall decline in retail sales for the full year in the range of 2% to 5% on a weather-normalized basis,
with residential up 1% to 3%, commercial down 5% to 10% and industrial down 4% to 8%.

As a reminder, our electric sales mix is split about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 across each customer class. Retail sales in
these ranges would lower total nonfuel electric revenue by approximately $250 million to $400 million on a
consolidated basis. We plan to mitigate these impacts by continuing to aggressively manage nonfuel O&M
throughout the remainder of the year.

While the current situation is unprecedented, we demonstrated a similar level of cost discipline in response
to the 2008, 2009 recession, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver in the current environment.
Of course, actual impacts will be highly dependent on the duration of stay-at-home policies and the pace
of economic recovery. As visibility as these factors improves, we will hone our expectations around an
appropriate level of cost control.

At this time, we do not anticipate significant sales or financial impacts from COVID-19 on Southern Power
or Southern Company Gas. Due to the long-term contracted nature of Southern Power's business model,
we expect it to be largely insulated from pandemic impacts. Southern Company Gas has already achieved
roughly half of its expected full year net income in the first quarter, and we expect earnings over the
remainder of the year to be consistent with our forecast.

In addition to sales, we are also assessing the potential for an increase in bad debt expense, specifically
our electric utilities. Our utilities, similar to most around the country, are not disconnecting customers
for nonpayment, and we are temporarily waiving late payment fees. Our state regulators are taking
constructive steps to allow utilities to defer incremental bad debt expenses related to the pandemic for
recovery in future rate proceedings.

In addition, our gas utilities are largely decoupled and many have bad debt mechanisms already in place,
which help to insulate them from both sales and nonpayment impacts.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

We also expect increased federal funding for programs like LIHEAP and certain provisions in the PPP
program to assist eligible customers with bill payment. Between regulatory mechanisms and customer
assistance programs, we believe bad debt expense impacts will be largely mitigated.

Turning now to liquidity. Because of the actions we took in the first quarter, Southern's net liquidity at
the end of March improved by $800 million relative to year-end 2019 and currently stands at over $7
billion. In the second quarter, we have already taken steps to further strengthen our liquidity position,
including completion of a $1 billion issuance at the parent in April. At this juncture, we believe we have
ample liquidities for our capital investment plan, protect our dividend and weather potential COVID-related
volatility in debt markets as well as elevated periods of customer nonpayment.

With solid results through the first quarter, our current belief is that O&M reductions can largely offset
pandemic-related sales impacts. And with peak electric loads still to come, we see no reason to deviate
from our current financial objectives. Consistent with historical practice, we will address earnings for the
year relative to our EPS guidance after the third quarter.

For the second quarter, we assume that pressure on retail sales will persist, so it is too early to predict
with precision what the overall impact would be. Recognizing all of these factors, we are providing
adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter of $0.65.

Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to give a brief update on some regulatory matters. In March, the
Mississippi Public Service Commission unanimously approved the rate case settlement reached between
Mississippi Power and the PSC staff, resulting in a rate decrease for customers and an increase in the
allowed equity ratio for Mississippi Power of 55%.

On the Vogtle front, we filed VCM 22 with the Georgia PSC end of February, requesting verification and
approval of $674 million spend for the period of July through December of 2019. We expect a decision
from the PSC in August.

Before I turn it back to Tom, I'd like to thank our Southern family for an outstanding job during this
period. Everyone is taking the new normal in stride and has remained focused on our customer at all
levels. You've shown a superior -- you've shown superior performance and total commitment and for that,
I'm thankful. I hope everyone stays well. And with that, I'll turn it back to Tom.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Drew. As our nation seeks a path to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, at Southern
Company, we are resolute in our commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for
our customers. To ensure that we are actively supporting recovery efforts, southern Company and our
subsidiaries are engaged with policymakers at both the state and federal level as they make critical
decisions about reopening our economies.

Notably, Alabama Power's CEO, Mark Crosswhite and I were named as part of the President's Economic
Revival Initiative. Along with the work that I do to help lead the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council,
the principal liaison between the federal government and the electric power industry, which has been
heavily involved in pandemic recovery efforts, Southern Company continues its leadership at a national
level.

Before we take your questions, I also want to highlight the extraordinary response of our teams after the
recent severe storms. In April, we experienced 2 successive weekends of devastating tornadoes across
our Southeast service territories that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses. Our
employees on the front lines worked tirelessly to restore service to the thousands of electric and natural
gas customers that were affected by these storms.

In the aggregate, we restored service to over 600,000 customers within 24 hours, improved our capacity
to work under duress effectively with coronavirus protocols. I am grateful for and extremely proud of the
men and women of Southern Company, who continue to work hard each day to deliver value to customers
and shareholders during these extraordinary times.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

In closing, the COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the U.S. and global
economies and on the communities we serve. Under what we currently view as a reasonable economic
recovery scenario, we are positioning ourselves to mitigate potential financial impacts on our company
through aggressive and thoughtful cost control.

The next several months will be particularly instructive for Southern and our utilities as we monitor the
pace of recovery, move into the warm summer season and work to increase productivity at Vogtle Units
3 and 4. We expect our business will remain reliable and resilient over the long term in keeping with our
long history of delivering on our commitments to customers, employees and shareholders.
Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just a couple of questions here. First, just sort of thinking about some of the moving pieces. We're
looking at COVID sales impact for a 2% to 5% reduction versus prior guidance of flat to up 1%, better-
than-expected Q1, slightly weaker Q2 guidance versus, I guess, expectations, O&M levers. If we're
assuming kind of normal weather, where do you see coming in within your earnings guidance range for the
year?

And then just remind us, the sales growth figures for March and April on Slide 11, are they weather-
normalized, especially with the recent storms in your jurisdictions? So how do we extrapolate how much of
that was weather versus COVID versus anything else?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

So with respect to the first question, when we set a guidance range, I think we broadly think that kind of
the midpoint of the range is a place that, without all these other impacts we do, that we would expect to
land. I think we remain consistent with our financial objectives for the year.

I will add. I know we've received some conversation about, should we reaffirm? Let me just hit that real
quick. It has never been our practice to reaffirm guidance in interim periods. We give you guidance at the
end of the year. So that would be late January, February. And then once we get through our peak kind of
earnings season, which would be the third quarter, that's when we give an update as to our guidance.

We believe we're committed to hitting our financial objectives. Of course, there's uncertainty in front of us,
and we run the same uncertainty everybody else does. But with what we know right now with reasonable
impacts, we remain committed to everything that we've said so far. So we're sticking with that. I think
further evidence of that is the recent increase in dividends.

Shar, what else did you want there?

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Sorry, just the weather on Slide 11, the impacts that you have from March through April, how much -- is
that weather-normalized? And how much of it is impact from COVID versus the recent storms?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

That is weather-normalized.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

And so we can think of it as virtually all COVID. Shar, I think I'd just address one other piece of your
question related to our guidance estimate for second quarter. Second quarter typically is a relatively light
quarter for us in terms of total demand. And you can imagine that there's a big difference between June's
expectation and April's expectation. We also feel like this is the period where COVID-19 is going to have
the greatest amount of impact across the retail customer base, whether it's residential, commercial or
industrial.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

And even though we are putting measures in place to reduce expenses, those will largely be levelized over
the balance of the period, and you're looking at an adjusted to what is a very constrained quarter in terms
of sales. So I would just take it in that light. Also, if you look at last year, I think we reported $0.80 for the
quarter. $0.08 of that at least was weather-related. And so I think what we're putting out, consistent with
what we've already reported for the first quarter is...

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Drew, thanks for that. I actually went back over the last 8 years and just looked at what did we
estimate. And believe it or not, this is within the range of estimates. They're kind of low $0.65. In fact,
I want to say, in 2018, we estimated $0.65. And when you consider you have the effect of the covirus --
the coronavirus impact, who knows? But it seems like a reasonably conservative estimate for -- from my
standpoint. I'm okay with it.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just on Vogtle, given the impact of COVID and the move to push the aggressive unit for site
plan back to May from March, I know we've in the past, we've talked about being hopeful that we could
see the units come online somewhere between the budgeted and the more aggressive time lines. Is that
kind of not reality at this point? And I know you will continue to keep that May aggressive schedule until
there's 0 probability it could be met. What probabilities are the site managers placing now on meeting
the aggressive schedule? And at what point could you move away from May to something closer to the
midpoint between the aggressive and budgeted schedules?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Shar, let me pick at one of the predicates in your question, and that was until there's 0 probability.
That's really not the case. We always kind of do a reasonable shot. And we stick with that. Look, we have
used some margin here. We had an extra month of kind of hidden margin between hot functional tests and
fuel load. Essentially, we have seen so far losing kind of 10 days to 14 days in the aggressive schedule.
We think through May, we'll lose another 2 weeks. The site people are going to work like crazy to mitigate
the loss of that month. But we had a month of, if you will, margin in between now and fuel load that we're
just consuming. Is it riskier than it was before? Yes. But it's still a reasonable objective. Otherwise, we
wouldn't stick with it. Okay?

One last point. When we go from -- in the schedule, from fuel load to in-service, recall we have
maintained -- and I know this has been a conversation in many earnings calls. We have maintained a 6-
month schedule there. China did it in 4.5 months, and we think we can meet or beat China. So we actually
have a little more margin, even to November and to May. So look, November is what matters, we got to
beat November, and our eyes are on that. The site continues to believe they can hit a May schedule. Has it
gotten more aggressive? Yes, still is a reasonable shot at it.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So a couple of questions. So the -- has the workforce reduction been implemented now? And did it end up
being around 20% that took that plan? Okay. And is it -- okay. And is it -- and maybe just give some color
on -- obviously, there's different people doing different things there, are there areas where you need to
refill people for certain skills? Or just how did that play out?

11

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Yes. In general, what we were able to do is to bring people off of 4 on to 3. That's how we filled whatever
gaps we thought we may see. Recall, and this is in the 8-K, I think, the first reduction was voluntary. And
then we moved to what we call rightsizing. So the voluntary effort didn't produce an optimal kind of result
for all the work phases that we have at the plant. And remember, as I said in the script and everything
else, we're particularly concerned with getting the right mix and the right productivity in electrical and
with subcontracts. And so what we did by moving resources away from 4, we bolstered the mix on Unit 3
so that we believe that there is a reasonable shot to maintain the aggressive schedule, which has a May
in-service date.

So that really is what has happened. Now, the other thing I just want to put out is that we are in
transition. In the script, I mentioned the idea about the sawtooth effect. And we've seen that every time
now, and those of you that follow these calls will remember that every time we open up a new workforce
-- a new work phase in the plant, every time we lead to an increase in personnel, well, and now even with
the decrease in personnel as we remix crews and schedules and everything else, we believe that sawtooth
effect will occur. And so that's why we're being reasonably conservative with May.

In other words, we did 1.25% in April, which still beat the 1% that we need for November. May, may be
similarly challenged. We hope it's a little better, but don't be surprised if it's not that great. But then we
expect in June and beyond to really pick up the sawtooth effect and achieve what we want to do, as we
have done in the past. So when we've talked to you about the sawtooth effect in the past, in fact, it has
occurred. So let us readjust, get the teams right, get the work practices back together, and then we think
we'll get the performance we want to see.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then when will we kind of get an update of how the Commission is kind of feeling about how
Vogtle is going? Is that -- would that be in this VCM or really the next one? Are they going to do any
special hearing on it?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Well, let me answer that a couple of ways. Steve, I know you're really good about this and others on
the call are in terms of contacting the Commission directly or looking at all the filings and everything else.
So you have heard directly kind of from the commissioners themselves, I would never put words in their
mouth. But the other thing that I would just highlight to people is that Tuesday, so just a few days, the
company will be testifying. And you'll be able to see the interplay between the company and the staff and
everybody else. And so we'll get some illumination there.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then my last question is just on -- just making sure I understand the assumptions for sales.
And when you talk about kind of start-up later in the summer and then recovery, is recovery kind of off of
this very low level now? Or when you're talking about recovery, what do you mean by that?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Steve, actually, can you hear me all right? We're having some technical difficulties, as Tom and I are
socially distanced.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Good. We're modeling a lot of different things, whether it's a V, a U, a W or an L. In general, the midline of
our sort of $250 million to $400 million is probably something like delayed reimbursements from stay-at-
home kind of through midsummer, maybe even until August and then some recovery through the balance
of the year, but certainly not complete.

If we look at the different customer classes that we're tracking today, I mean our industrial segment,
which is not the largest contributor to earnings, by the way, is actually performing quite well, but it is
varied. And so things like pulp and paper, some of the larger segments, chemical, are doing quite well
because of low input costs or because of demand on product. Some of the things like precursors to
automotive or light steel are going to take a little bit longer to rebound. But those industries, as we're
watching, are starting to reopen and automotive production is beginning to restart across Georgia and
Alabama, in particular.

On the commercial side, we've seen a pretty exaggerated decrease. Some of our bigger customers there
are certainly retail and education. But some of those segments are starting to move back. And so I think
the 2% to 5% total that we gave you really represents those different actions in aggregate, but we're
looking at it in a pretty detailed way.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

And I'll just add to that, too. So everybody, I think, knows that Georgia is one of the states stepping out
and reemerging. Of course, we're doing it in a thoughtful phased process.

The other issue that I would put out there is fuel prices are really low. For the quarter, natural gas was
$1.88 per million BTU. And I think the amount of natural gas cost borne by customers was around $250
million -- $247 million lower than last year. So cost of electricity, and therefore, consumption of energy is
more cost-efficient than it has been before.

There's a lot in the mix right now. And also, I'll just say that I've been in contact with my friend, Jay
Powell from the Fed, I would complement -- and I know there's all kinds of disagreement about this, but
I would complement broadly the Federal response, whether it's the administration, whether it's Congress,
whether it's the Fed, in terms of the timeliness of their response in supporting the economy, especially
as compared to, say, 2008, 2009, these guys are on top of it. I'm sure we can all criticize one step here
or there. But I think all the necessary chemicals are in the sea to produce something that will minimize,
hopefully, the impact going forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on the status of COVID at the Vogtle work site. And you've taken steps to
reduce risk. Is there -- we're trying to sort of track the number of cases. Is there a risk of a trajectory of
more cases such that you have to sort of adjust work practices at the site further? Or do you feel that sort
of the changes you've made have made the impacts to the number of cases that you were looking for?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

No. In fact, look, we started very early on. Before there were any COVID-19 effects, we were planning
that there would be. And one of the very first things we did, I remember it was a weekend call of the
executive team, was to move to the site, essentially a medical village, staffed by nurses and doctors.
We have a disease specialist that's been advising the site daily. We have all the PPE we need. We have
turnaround and testing conservative work practices.

And in fact, our realization, I kind of -- we've debated about talking about this on the call, but I'll throw
a little bit of it out there. Our incidence rate compared to the utility industry is about half, maybe 40%,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

something like that. Our severity of cases is way lower. One of the very smart steps that the site did very
early on was to remove from the site or at least on a voluntary basis with pay, people that would be most
likely to be severely impacted. That is elderly or older. Look, I'm probably in that category. I don't want
to describe myself as elderly, and if they had a pre-existing condition. So if you look at it, one other thing
we do that's very conservative that other people aren't doing. That is, if somebody at the site just feels
funny, if they don't feel well and want to get tested, we get them tested. Not only that. We take their work
associates out that have the close contact, and we test them.

When you look at the amount of testing per person at the site relative to anywhere in the communities
we serve, it is somewhere -- we are testing between 5x and 10x more people than what's being tested
elsewhere in the region. So it's amazing stuff. Sometimes in these close contact cases, we will test
somebody that is asymptomatic, oh, and sure they turned up positive, we remove them.

And the other kind of telling factor is severity. I think we've only had 1 or 2 people be hospitalized or go
to a hospital. Otherwise, they're being tested with the folks on-site, and about half of the people that have
been tested positive have returned to work. I think that's all pretty positive stuff.

A couple more things that we're doing. At any work front, we limit the amount of people doing the social
distancing to 3 per work site. So sometimes, we exceed that with everybody's approval, but that generally
is the practice. We have eliminated close quarters break areas, close quarters lunch areas, the big [ bar ]
thing and all that stuff. We really have worked hard right away early on to make sure, and the principle
was that we wanted Plant Vogtle 3 and 4 to be a better environment for the workers there than what they
could find elsewhere in their homes or in the communities in the surrounding area. And I think we've done
that.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's really helpful color. And just checking in on the status of just equipment testing on the site. Would
you mind just giving a high-level update on, I guess, maybe percentage of equipment tested or whatever
else is most relevant as we think about just sort of overall status of testing all the equipment on-site.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, all the major equipment is tested, right? So in fact, it was -- I mean right as we entered the call, we
got the sign off from Westinghouse. The open vessel testing, the testing was complete. Just as you yell at
your children and teenagers, check your work before you turn it in, that's what we have been doing in the
past, just recent day hours, whatever. And in fact, we just got clearance from Westinghouse. And in fact,
we had -- they had verified that we had passed all the tests on OVT. So we were very happy to announce
that today. I don't know how -- what else would you want to hear?

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Well, I think that makes sense. I think in the past, there was some sort of metric or percentage of
equipment that's been inspected. But I can follow-up afterwards.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

I'd say all the major equipment is there and has been tested. We'll test it again once it goes into a system,
but we're done.

Hey, one other thing, the RCP, right, is all on-site and everybody admires it as they walk by it. It's a spare.
We got that from Summer.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just -- I wanted to take you back to '08, '09. You mentioned you were able to offset a lot of the impact
there with cost cuttings. But also, I believe it was Georgia, and correct me if I'm wrong, where you were
able to amortize some of the regulatory accounts to kind of mitigate the earnings hit there? Is that sort of
an opportunity available this time around?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, you've got a great memory, and you're correct. That is, in fact, what we did. We took some steps to
lessen the burden, but we don't feel the need to take those steps right now. Those are certainly options in
the future to approach regulators if we need to.

The one thing I think that you can just point to around the system is that I think we've received -- in fact,
I would just go broadly. Our PSC, but also, I would say, FERC and NERC at the national level, folks have
really, I think, bent over backwards to accommodate the needs of this unique environment. And I think
the issue of being able to set aside as a regulatory asset recovery of disconnect costs and a variety of
other things has been another evidence of constructive practice by our state.

And at the NERC and FERC level, I'll tell you, they've been on these ESCC calls, likewise, they're
doing what they need to do in order to help the industry get through this period. Not by imposing
overregulations, et cetera. I'm very complementary of what are generally very tough regulators taking
constructive approaches to help and assisting through this time frame.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And then let me just shifting gears and -- can you talk a little bit about the credit metrics and
you're really confident in your 2020 EPS numbers, but I'm just kind of curious as to what impact, if any,
are you seeing or do you expect to see on your FFO to debt versus the targets? And any color on -- any
dialog you may have had with the credit rating agencies?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

This is Drew. I would say that we've had numerous conversations with the credit rating agencies across a
variety of topics and did a very fulsome review of each of those individual business units not 4 weeks ago.
While we're meeting targets, FFO to debt doesn't change much. Our goal is to sort of stay with a buffer
relative to what's expected for the ratings categories that we maintain and generally, as we get through
the construction of Vogtle that are on an improving trajectory, which is a function really of just how the
economics work of Vogtle.

The other thing that we have been working through is general liquidity, which we think is paramount to
operating a well-functioning business. And we were fortunate to be a good credit in good -- in reasonable
markets, and we accelerated all of the debt issuance that we needed to do for the balance of the year, at
least put ourselves in a position to not have to face those challenges later on. So I think very comfortable
with how we're managing liquidity and credit in total.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And Drew, I'm just going to ask you if you're comfortable saying something here, but our relationship
with not only our regulators, but also the rating agencies, et cetera, is continuous, not discrete. And just
recently, you went through a pretty intensive review by the rating agencies. What can you say about their
response to that?

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Just as you would expect and probably very similar to 2008 and 2009, that they have sectors that they
worry about far more than utility. I think what they're focused on is -- are the constructive and proactive
nature of regulators and the behaviors that we've seen insulating us from things like bad debt expense, I
think, is a very protective and productive thing.

But in general, the rating agencies are still concerned with the same things they were concerned with
before. But I think, certainly, our sector is less of a concern than most others.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

And I think we got a favorable review from them?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a solid quarter, and thank you for squeezing me in here. Yes. A lot of the questions have been
asked and answered, but maybe if I can just follow-up on a couple of points here.

So firstly, on Vogtle, right, you mentioned that you reduced the size of teams to 3 people, I think you said,
and the overall workforce by 20%. And is that based on kind of CDC guidelines or your internal guidelines
that you've developed? And like when may you go back to like larger teams or reduce this? Because
obviously it would be fair to say, I believe, that this is causing some productivity declines, right? So is that
sort of a new normal for the duration of the projects in your mind? Or are we going to go back to more
normal staffing at some point?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Sophie, that's a great question. So if you recall the -- I think we've done this in the past, kind of
CapEx by quarter, we've drawn these curves. We're kind of at the peak of our curve. And assuming that
we continue to be productive, the curve actually starts to turn down on Unit 3.

It will ramp up a little bit more on Unit 4 going forward. So my sense is we're going to evaluate our
progress in the months ahead. But it could be that this level of activity is appropriate for where we want to
be on Unit 3 and 4.

We were on the downturn of activity at Unit 3, just right there. So dropping it -- dropping the whole site
from 9 to 7 isn't exactly unexpected. It's a little accelerated, which means that we're probably going to
push out some hours. But it's not unexpected, and we didn't intend it when we remapped the schedule,
the refinement we did in February. But accelerating 4 of those 2 months gave us essentially a bank of
more margin that we're able to use in moving people from 4 to 3 to accommodate the difference in the
resizing after this voluntary reduction.

So it's actually not a bad place to be. Let's see what happens in the months ahead.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then my other question was on bad debt expense, right? And we're pretty early, I
guess, in this as far as billing cycles go. But is there a point where it might be an issue for the balance
sheet where you might want to approach your regulators to maybe recover it before the next rate case

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

cycle, which is some time away? I guess, how do you think about it internally? What is the threshold, if
any?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

So Sophie, this is Drew. I'd say a number of things. In general, our gas utilities have riders or trackers for
these types of things. And so our exposures are probably more isolated to the electric utilities.

We've had very constructive regulatory conversations. And in fact, not so much in mechanism, but at least
an understanding that bad debt expense would track through a regulatory asset that we could recover
when we get together next to discuss rates.

Your question, I think, was around the interim period. And to be honest, bad debt expense is not one of
the things that I fear. It's a relatively low percentage of our total revenue. The thing that we're tracking
really is sort of late payment of bills. And so we've been monitoring the number of customers in arrears. It
has not changed materially over the last month.

We typically have about 15% of our customers in arrears at any given time, maybe more of a normal
time. And we know that if we were to have to provision to something like a 40 percentage of our
customers being in arrears, that we would probably have to provision somewhere between $800 million
and $1 billion worth of additional capital per quarter.

All of that is incredibly manageable within the existing liquidity that we have within the business. And so
we don't anticipate that there'll be anything more than maybe some temporary impact to liquidity, but
really no long-term impact to bad debt.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And let me add another comment. It's under the who knows, but I think it's still something we've
talked about getting ready for the call. And that is when you think about the intensive impact of
COVID-19, it's occurring during light revenue months for us. It's occurring during April and May, which are
not strong months. This is Atlanta particularly, but the Southeast is known for these beautiful long springs.
And our big revenue months, 60% of our revenue, I think, comes out of the summer.

So that's going to be -- so when you think about the intense impacts, it's coming during low revenue and
therefore, if we have some recovery, that's the who knows part, that will get us back to, I think, a good
spot.

Hey, Sophie, one more thing you mentioned, somebody pointed out to me that I didn't cover, you said, do
we follow CDC guidelines? In fact, yes, we do. And in fact, I think we're even more conservative than CDC
in terms of recovery and all that stuff. We keep people out 14 days, even if they've been around somebody
that's been tested, a variety of other things.

And one other thing. Yes, just one last thing. We do survey. We do stay in touch with the other
megaprojects around the U.S. And their experience is not that different than ours. I think 95% are still
progressing kind of as we are.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

On residential sales, it looks like your forecast is about 1% to 3% up, and it looks a little bit light in terms
of forecast for up compared to what I've been hearing from other utilities, in the range of 3% to 4% for
residential sales. Is there something about residential sales that you expect to be a little more, I guess,
not as enthusiastic about it, an offsetting factor?

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

No. Michael, I think probably what you're noting, maybe a difference in time period. We're -- the 2% to
-- 3% that we've got on our chart on Slide 11 really is meant to represent what we think the full year
impacts might be.

We certainly are seeing across all of these classes, commercial, industrial and residential, more
exaggerated response than what's depicted here.

What we're trying to show is just that this is what we think the full year impact would be given the point in
time, the point in the heating and cooling cycle where we are today.

And as Tom said, April is sort of an interesting month in Georgia. People are starting to change over from
heating into air conditioning, and so demand is quite light.

What we expect in May is a fraction of what we expect in June.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to come back to Vogtle here a little bit, if I could. With the lower Vogtle workforce, I was just
wondering what type of working hours per week are you guys achieving now.

And kind of what levels would have you concerned with regards to the schedule? Or asked differently,
what type of working hour numbers do you guys need to see to hit that monthly completion rate of about
1%?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think we're on [ 5 10 ]. And then we don't do as many weekends as we have. So we backed off a
little bit. That gives us a little bit of optionality should we need to work weekends. So we've backed off a
little bit during this time frame and less density and everything else.

Further, we have shifted more work into the daylight hours as opposed to the night shift. And we have
shifted more hours onto Unit 3. So that's kind of the broad approach there.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's helpful. And just want to shift gears, I guess, to load, and appreciate that it might be just well too
early to tell, but it seems like Georgia has recently started to reopen a bit here with that process started.
Just wondering if you could share anything you're seeing with us live time? And was that able to inform
kind of your load projections that you provided earlier on the call?

Thomas A. Fanning

Well, look, we're in contact with our key account customers. I think we always do a pretty good job there.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

You asked a little bit of a different question kind of what's our pulse of the community. I think there is a
positive vibe right now, that people are trying to figure out ways to start again. The restaurants are doing
all this takeout.

It just -- it feels a little better. Drew is in a different part. He lives right in the heart of the city. I live in the
burbs. What's kind of your experience?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Well, another way to sort of think about this is we have real-time data on actual usage. And then as you
described, Tom, we have forward pulling of all of our commercial and industrial customers.

And I would say that the fact that the Governor has opened the state has not changed human behavior
materially. But I would say that, in general, as we pull commercial customers, in particular, confidence
around coming back at load has improved in the last couple of weeks. The last sort of data that I saw,
Georgia, in particular. But these are just sort of early shoots kinds of signs, and we'll have to look at what
actual demand is. We certainly have some categories where we don't expect any immediate improvement.
Education is one of our top commercial segments, and we don't anticipate people being back in school for
this season.

And then there are other loads like hospital, where they've exceeded historical consumption. And that's
to be expected. And so I'd just -- give us a few more quarters -- a few more months, we'll be able to give
you a little bit better data here.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

But Drew, you reminded me, too, I think you guys would find this interesting. Drew is on the Board
-- probably half the hospital beds in the state here in Georgia anyway. And his wife is a doctor. Give a
sense as to how many of the beds are being used. Because this is kind of this capacity, flatten-the-curve
concept?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Tom, it's -- I probably have to stay away from absolute numbers, and I'd prefer that some of these
institutions report for themselves. I would just say that I am intimate with the functioning of Emory and
rating sort of safety in hospital and our academic institutions in town. I'm incredibly amazed at their ability
to ramp to an expected demand.

And in general, I think that we're seeing cases in those hospitals that are a little bit lighter than models
projected. But the ability of those hospitals to grasp what could be for them and to accommodate what
could be a crush there has been really incredible, very sophisticated set of institutions in our area.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

So we have 100% more capacity than what we're seeing in terms of actual cases right now. So when you
think about coming back to work, there's a whole lot of gating issues that we've been working on. I've
been working on in a national level in the industry and here at Southern.

One of the big indicators is, have we flattened the curve? Do you have capacity? Yes. The fact is, and I
think it's been very instructive at Vogtle, that we have to learn to work with the virus. We have to learn for
American commerce to get along because the only way you can be assured you don't have the virus is to
have widespread available vaccines, and we don't have that yet.

Until we get there, you won't have complete recovery. So how do you act? How are you able to persist in
this environment? And I think that's why -- I mean, who knows, but I think that's why Governor Kemp,
that was one of the issues he was looking at. Do we have available capacity? Yes.

Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Hope you're all safe and healthy.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we're great.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

You had initially planned turnover and testing to occur simultaneous with construction. Is that still the
plan?

And does COVID-19 complicate this due to the small footprint of the plant?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Turnover and testing and construction have been going hand in glove along the way. We get thorough
reports. I know we do thorough reports once a month with everybody at the PSC and the co-owners and
everything else. That's going according to pace. And sometimes you speed up testing. Remember, we got
into a discussion about that in past calls. Sometimes you slow it down, letting construction catch up, or
you test in other areas of the plant while you focus on construction in a particular area.

All that's going as expected. I wouldn't say that's anything other than exactly what we've expected. And I
think this approach has really served us well. We've talked about that in the past, but fail fast and learn in
other areas has been really helpful to us.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And then secondly, can you update us on how many final approvals you've had from the NRC on ITAACs?
And are you going to have to wait until construction is fully complete for a lot of the remaining ITAACs to
be signed off on? Or how should we think about the time frame for that?

Thomas A. Fanning

Yes. Let me just give you a quick numbers. The ITAACs that have been submitted, all the UIN, so this
is the ITAAC that have been submitted in form without the number, have been accepted by the NRC. So
every one of those.

So that really lessened the bow wave that we have. We had originally, I think, 449 ITAACs fully that need
to be submitted for Unit 3. And we've had a whole lot of those completed. I guess we still have about 270
left before they're certified and we get the clearance to load fuel.

That's been going well. And the NRC, I think -- let me just -- yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Paul.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I was going to just ask for the 270 to be approved, do you essentially have to wait until construction is
complete? Or are you expecting that to happen earlier?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

There's -- it's a pace along the way. There is some elements of the 270 that are after construction. But we
think it's -- ITAACs are going well. We're either ahead of schedule or whatever.

Paul, you may remember, I used to say that ITAACs would reach my top 3 of concerns. And while we're
concerned about everything, I think electrical work and subcontract work are much bigger concerns at this
point than our ability to deliver on ITAACs. I really think those guys have done great. And I want to throw
a bouquet to the NRC. They have staffed up appropriately. And the teams that have been charged with
approving the UINs and the ITAACs that are fully complete have done a very timely job of doing that.

I personally have worked with Steve Kuczynski and team, visiting with the NRC Commissioners, and they
are committed to holding up their end of the bargain. I feel good. It's still a big issue. Let me not minimize
it, but it's something I feel pretty good about.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Tom, I think the only thing that I'd add, and we've tried to emphasize with folks, is the testing and
turnover occurs constantly. And the best indicator that we're making progress on testing and turnover are
the actual starts of the milestones themselves.

So you'll see a couple of those milestones and our progress against them this summer, and that's the best
indicator that you can have of a successful testing and turnover.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And it's just been following. I forget. I did -- we did a variety of these town halls. I did one with Shar
recently and some time ago with Fleishman. And sure enough, back then I said end of the month, well, we
finished OVT end of the month.

So we're able to follow through on the schedule despite the challenges of COVID.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And then after implementing the 20% workforce reduction, are you anticipating a significant improvement
in productivity at the plant?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Oh, yes. And you just got to remember the sawtooth discussion we've had before. Anytime we staff
up or now staff down and we have to rightsize and bring new people on and getting used to a new work
front and new people working together and new supervision, there always is a bit of a learning curve.
That's the sawtooth.

Yes. We are expecting an improvement. But let me point out again, we have been ahead -- I think
this chart on Slide 7 really shows it. But even with April, it's just a slight downtick from our aggressive
schedule and, I think, pretty far away from November. Even during April, we completed 1.25%. Target was
2%. The November schedule calls for 1%. So we even made some margin to November even during a bad
month.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And then my last question, looking sort of at your Slide 11, with respect to potential cost reduction, where
-- in relation to the $250 million to $400 million of potential revenue erosion, where would you see the

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

ability to sort of offset that with O&M, towards the lower end, the middle, the high end? How should we
think about that?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think we're going to have to see how this quarter goes, but we're going to put plans in place that
would at least give us bookends to achieve at either end of the spectrum, is the simple way I'd describe it
to you.

There are certainly costs that we will categorize that are things where you reduce the absolute on the run
expense with them -- travel, entertainment -- or travel, in particular, is a perfect example. A workforce of
nearly 30,000 people, very few people were traveling for a number of months. We don't expect that, that
creates a backlog of travel that will then come back into our cost stream. There will be things towards the
far end of the spectrum where we will be delaying expenses into future periods.

And so we're just going through an effort to identify in both of those categories and across this entire
spectrum of potential revenue declines how we might function in either -- with either of these outcomes.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

We're not -- as a principle, we're not refilling open jobs without CEO approval, which really freezes them,
has the effect of a freeze.

Paul Basch Michael Fremont
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes. And then look -- I mean are there sort of examples of like past years where you've gone through cost
reduction and any numbers that you can share based on past experience?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, go ahead.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So in '08 and '09, I think the number was probably a little bit towards the lower end of this range but
I think a pretty good indication of what the capabilities are, understanding in '08 and '09 the company was
a bit smaller. So the acquisition of AGL Resources came in hence and so our cost complex is quite a bit
larger than this.

Our O&M -- total O&M is something in the $5-plus billion range, maybe addressable is a little bit smaller
than that. But I think it gives us plenty of room to be responsible around this range.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Glad to hear everybody in the Southern Company family is doing as well as possible. I actually want to ask
you about the jurisdiction that people don't ask you about, that maybe one of the best ones people don't
think about enough. Can you talk about Alabama? And can you talk about both where things stand with
the approval of both the gas plants and the solar, both the PPAs and ownership that you all filed at the
PSC?

And also, I thought there was a rate docket there this year as well or undergoing in the winter and into the
spring. Can you just give us an update on that?

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

And then finally, how different is Alabama demand trends relative to Georgia ones?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I would say, in general, you're in a giant process that's on track in Georgia for all that stuff -- I'm
sorry, in Alabama. Yes, I think everything is going as we thought it would there.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Your question about customer mix, just like in the entirety of our jurisdictions, it tends to move
toward more industrial as you move west generally.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

That's true. But what's interesting in Mississippi, 25% of Mississippi sales are wholesale. And those
wholesale sales are largely residential. So you get a bit of a different mix in Mississippi but it's small. But
Drew is exactly right, Alabama and Georgia are pretty similar.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And can you remind us in Alabama what the rate request was and also what the time line to get
approval for the gas plant, both acquisition and development?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

I think we were looking towards June, weren't we, or summer -- early summer for that process to occur.

And I think the only other piece of news there, it's not Alabama PSC news, but the FERC did approve the
gas plant acquisition that we projected early summer. So we got that out of the way.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on the O&M front. So you guys have this range of retail revenue, right? I just
wanted to be very clear about this. When you think about the cost savings effort, just to quantify this
a little bit more, basically, you're saying that you can offset anything in that range or how do you think
about the sort of the magnitude of cost savings that you're contemplating today? You're doing -- you're
looking at this as $250 million to $400 million as that's the equivalent O&M amount that you're looking at
in your planning here?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No. I think the simple way to think about it is that we're going to put plans in place or work through
plans that could help us in either end of this range. What we actually have to execute against is going to
be determined by how quickly the economies respond in our service territories.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

And the other thing I would just say, I mean, that's a range that's -- here, again, I hate to say with all this
uncertainty, it's kind of a who knows. But I think earlier, maybe a month ago, I was saying $250 million to
$350 million, we tacked on $50 million just out of conservatism and a more prolonged kind of effect.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

I don't want to give you the impression, Julien, that this is a limitless pool. There are certainly limitations,
and we're just going to have to see how the demand response evolves over time.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

But there, again, too, that would reflect even at highest ends, we're still within the range.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And probably most folks don't know, the easiest way to turn this into earnings per share is that we
generally are about $10 million per $0.01. And so you can divide this by 10 and get some sense of the
range of impact in total on a gross revenue basis and then adjust it. That's for pretax.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

You need to tax effect that. He was -- Drew just gave you an after-tax net income effect. But this is
pretax.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. Understood. All right. Let me come back to the start perhaps of the call. When you guys talked
about the sawtooth, 20% reduction here in workforce, how are you thinking about making that up on the
project? And you also talked about delaying the Unit 4 next year. Are you thinking that you're going to
be -- ramp back up labor later in the schedule here at this point? Or how do you make up for that 20%
workforce reduction cumulatively? Or is it just that Unit 4 adjustment...

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I wish I could -- yes. Thanks, Julien. I wish I could draw with my finger here in the air. But if we were
doing a one-on-one, I'd draw my little piece of paper, my handwritten things I'm so famous for there.

Just imagine this, if I had a curve that showed 9,000 people on-site, as we wind down Unit 3 construction
heading into hot functional tests, the wind-down of people on-site for Unit 3 occurs. So the curve actually
goes down.

What we're doing is and what we've said about kind of hot functional tests being kind of now August,
September, all we did was push it out a little. Imagine you pushed your hand down on the peak of 9,000,
and it pushes out a little bit to the right.

So all we've done is tried to maintain that level. I don't think you're going to see another big peak
here. We were already at the peak. And I think now that peak starts to wind down. That's why we feel
comfortable with the movement from 9,000 to 7,000 on-site, drawing some off of 4, which pushes 4 back
to its original schedule and still maintaining our ability to hit the aggressive site plan for Unit 3.

All we did was shift the curve a little bit, and we funded that curve with Unit 4.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up here to round it out here. Under what scenarios would you
consider stopping construction around COVID? So it sounds like you guys have a lot of mitigating factors
already implemented, a lot of compartmentalization of labor already going on in terms of mitigating
factors. But how do you think about what that scenario might look like and when you might trigger that,
just to address the range of scenarios here?

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. You know what, I suppose there is a hypothetical in there, Julien, I just don't think that's likely. I
think America -- let me just speak broadly, and I'll take it down to the site. America has to learn to live
with the virus.

Our experience so far, knock on wood, has been much less than what you've seen in the industry, about
half. And our experience on-site, likewise, has been less severe, I think largely because of the smart
actions the people on the site have taken, for example, removing the at-risk personnel and paying them,
well before we saw the effects of the site -- on the site.

People are now coming back to work. One other point is it looks like the average over the past, I don't
know, 4 weeks -- if you do a 4-week look and average, it looks as if we may be past the peak on the site.
Now that will only be borne out in the next few weeks to come.

But if you do a 7-day rolling average, it looks as if incident levels are decreasing. So look, there's a
hypothetical in there. I really think it's a practical matter that the job at hand is continue the good work
we're doing on-site, make that an attractive place for people to work, which I think we're doing. And I
think the labor unions at all are calling us out for that kind of unprecedented response and keep going.

I just don't think -- I don't see it right now, but we'll see.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

In the interest of time, I'll literally stick to one question here on Page 11. I'm a little surprised -- maybe
I missed this. I apologize if I did. But you're forecasting a bigger decline for commercial volumes in
industrial. Most other utilities are talking about it the other way. And I know you mentioned your mix
is roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. But can you explain why you're expecting a deeper hit to commercial than
industrial?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Look, I -- and the good news there is if that's what your big hit is, I think your ability to come back
is much better. It will come back quicker. Your ability to shut down a plant and then get it back is harder
than restarting a restaurant.

In fact, I was on CNBC this morning, and I know right after me was the CEO of IMAX. He says, our ability
to turn theaters back on is almost instantaneous.

So look, that is an assessment of our key accounts and our marketing teams across the system. That's
just what we see. Our industrial makeup, the kind of folks that we see, really have been having a great
quarter. And in fact, if you look at the month-by-month sales at industrial, gosh, our momentum statistics
-- and I'm fond of mentioning, we're showing really quite positive momentum through February. And just
with COVID, what we saw were some companies taking outages. They said, "Well, if we're going to want
to socially distance, why don't we go ahead and take an outage and do some maintenance, sending a lot
of people home." We actually think industrial will recover faster, more resilient.

The other thing that we have in the Southeast here is industrial dependent upon natural gas as a
feedstock, particularly in the chemicals area. I think that's our #1 industrial customer.

And with natural gas being where it is, those guys are producing product at really attractive levels. We
saw this again in 2008 and 2009. And especially, I would say, Alabama has been particularly proactive in
putting in place rate plans that preserve industrial load, where across the United States, they didn't have

26

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

those things. And industrials tended to shut down plants in other parts of the United States and move
their productive capacity to the Southeast.

For all those reasons, that's why we think industrial is more resilient than commercial. Good news is
commercial is going to recover pretty quickly, in my opinion.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So what I wanted to touch base with you on was sort of just basically your economic forecast, I guess.
It sounds like you guys are quite optimistic that once this -- the sort of stay-at-home and the social
distancing stuff is resolved, people will be just sort of coming back, and it will be business as usual. Is that
the case? Are you guys basically thinking that -- I'm just wondering what is your economic forecast given
your growth rate?

And are you still sort of expecting 1% sales growth after this year?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

The $400 million estimate assumes that there's more of a through-the-year impact.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I don't know that we want to portray too much optimism. I mean, certainly, U-shape, it feels better
where we're sitting today than it did maybe on the downward slope of it a couple of weeks ago. But our
projection for a 5% reduction in total retail sales is quite exaggerated relative to what we've seen in
history. And so this will not be without economic pain for sure.

We do think that our economies generally in the Southeast benefit from the fact that we've got good in
migration, and it's a good place to do business. And so long term, we -- relative to others, we think that
we've got pretty decent economic climate.

The amount of time it takes to get back to normalcy, though is inestimable.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. There are lots of degrees of freedom and all that. It's just our most reasonable guess at this point.
And I know -- and my heart goes out to most of you guys on the phone and live in the New York area.
I'm from New Jersey. We all have relatives and people that have been impacted by this. And so we're very
mindful of the grave circumstance. That's not the case down here, at least we haven't seen it. It's much
less severe in the Southeast than what you're experiencing up there.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. But just to sort of make sure I understand this, you guys see a hit this year. But then it sounds
like beginning of next year or pretty soon thereafter, you expect in terms of your earnings guidance and
everything, your long-term growth rate, that essentially that the economy will -- the global pandemic will
not have that meaningful an impact on economic activity in your region. Am I right...

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

So yes. Okay. So now that's a -- I'm sorry, that's like a different question, and it's interesting. Will there
be destruction in the economy as a result of the COVID deal? That may be. My sense is the United States
is in a pretty good position relative to global economies with respect to this issue, we'll see.

In other words, is there going to be less demand from Europe for American products? What about China?
One of the other impacts that we've been talking about at a federal level on this return to work is kind of
revitalizing the supply chain to the United States, making us a little less dependent particularly in critical
infrastructure for reliance on foreign economies.

Still sitting there in Congress is an infrastructure bill. My sense is there's more energy, excuse the pun,
behind future legislative initiatives that could overcome some continuing sustaining impact of destruction
in the economy. Some other things could emerge. My sense is, right now, if I just sit here and think about
2021 and 2022, there may be some continuing impacts. But at this point, I don't think they're at all
significant to the point where we would change our forward guidance on a 4% to 6% EPS growth rate.

Recall, the dominant issue for us is getting Vogtle built. Once we clear Unit 3 and Unit 4 to service, the
rate of increase, because of the earnings rates inside the construction period recover to a full return on
capital, it's hard to beat that down.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. Just on Vogtle, just sort of quickly here. It looks like you guys are, if I'm correct with what I've been
estimating, it looks like for the people that you've been testing, and I think it's up into the 400 range now
or something, it looks to me from the reports I'm seeing that it's remarkably pretty consistent at 28% to
30% or something.

And I'm just wondering, is there any thought of maybe -- I mean, obviously, there are a lot more people
than that working at the site. Is there any thought about doing antibody testing? Or are you guys thinking
anything about herd immunity or anything like that? Or is it just basically sort of people who come in and
say, "Hey, I don't feel well, give me a test," kind of thing?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Look, we're -- we got early availability on the best test we can get at the time. The antibody tests are
really pretty interesting. In fact, we're talking about that at a national level. We have had Admiral Giroir
from HHS. He's the Director of Health, and he kind of has the whole testing regime in place.

That's something that's attractive, but it's just not available right now. We can test all over the place. And
in fact, you can test everybody, and they go home, and you'll have to retest them the next day and the
next day and the next day.

Testing is really valuable, and I don't underestimate it, but it doesn't solve the problem. Until we get a
vaccine in place, we're going to be having to live with this environment in the nation.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then just really quickly on the sales numbers. They include -- they're not adjusted out for leap
year, is that correct, for the quarter?

Thomas A. Fanning

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Just one question. You got a $40 billion 5-year CapEx program. The bulk of it is not Vogtle. You've given
us great detail on Vogtle. You had a statement, no expected supply chain problems, disruptions.

What -- I get that, but what is causing you some concern within the supply chain? Is there something
that's going to be more expensive in that CapEx? Is there something maybe you've pushed out a year or 2
that you'll still get done within the 5-year plan?

Any additional color on that no expected supply chain disruption comment would be appreciated.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we're the size of the nation of Australia in round numbers. I get that statistic. We're a little bit
smaller. But when you think about energy production, we're kind of in that league. We have long-standing
relationships, and we are considered a high-priority customer with a variety of resources.

And when I say we don't see any problems in the long run, that doesn't mean people aren't working really
hard to make sure that they understand what the perturbations may be and what they're going to do to
resource them.

We have been seeing some challenges, but we've always been able to overcome the challenges. And I
want to say, Drew, we have about at least a 6-month kind of forward window where we're absolutely
confident of no problems. So that's kind of our safety margin, if you will.

When you think about the nature of our CapEx budget, however, it is really tied up in making our system
more resilient from a transmission and distribution standpoint. It is tied up in future generation, whether
it is renewables or some of the new generation required in Alabama and Georgia. And then it is tied up in
environmental matters, particularly for us, ash ponds, which I think is $10 billion over 10 years in round
numbers.

So it is stuff that I think we've got great visibility into the availability of the equipment required to support
that program. It's not subject to, I guess Drew uses the word smalls, we have a lot of visibility, and we're
a big customer, and people generally work very hard to meet our needs. And we have pushed on this a lot.

We've got a great guy, Jeff Franklin, that runs our supply chain for the system. We don't see a problem
right now.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'd say labor is a large component of our total CapEx plan. And as you said, environmental
remediation at ash ponds isn't really reliant on technology in general. And we've got enough material for a
pretty decent work front for a good period of time and expect in the long term, supply chains will replenish
to meet whatever need we might have...

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

And let me throw one more factor out there. I'll throw another bouquet at somebody. The Director of
CISA, in Homeland Security, is a guy named Chris Krebs. He's doing a terrific job within the confines of
his responsibility in calling out, in my words, they put out an advisory bulletin of essential functions in
America.

And of course, Health and Human Services is right at top right now. But right behind that is the electricity
function in America. That's also part of the recommendations by NIAC, National Infrastructure Advisory
Council, and also the work product of the Solarium Commission that I'm on.

Look, people will put a high priority on making sure that our needs are met.

One last point. We have a terrific relationship with our valued partners in the labor market. So the U.S.
building trades have done a hell of a job making sure that the people are there. And I think we work very
hard to make sure that they are valued partners and treated as well as anybody treats them in the United
States. They are strategic partners for decades, and we treat them like that. And I think the labor will be
there when we need it.

Our last question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition.

Ashar Khan
Verition Fund Management LLC

Doing -- the progress is, I would say, exceptional and really very well you guys are doing. Can I just ask
-- I didn't want to ask the question, but I thought because of regulatory -- because of disclosures and less
contact. Usually, you have earned around $0.80 for the last 4 years in the second quarter except for 1
year, '17, where we had like $0.05 or $0.06 of dilution which hurt that quarter. And even then, we earned
$0.73. So can you just ascribe to me why the pattern of earnings is going to go from the average $0.80
to like $0.65 in the second quarter? What is it making it an abnormal second quarter versus the prior
trajectory of how the earnings have come up?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Ashar, let me -- actually, I went deeper in preparing for this, for the call. But like I said, I have in
front of me the data, last 8 years. Our low was $0.66. But we had 3 years in the $0.60s, $0.66, $0.69,
$0.68, $0.71, $0.73, $0.75. And only the last 2 years have been $0.80.

All we're doing is taking a conservative shot at what the second quarter COVID-19 thing is. It's always a
fight. I always laugh. I used to be CFO, and I had to always extract an estimate from the system CFOs.
And well, the inside joke inside Southern is when the CFOs kind of report what they think, they always
have a conservative bias. And the joke is that the positive variances are always temporary and the
permanent variances -- the negative variances are permanent. So we always have to fight through what
the right answer is.

I think Drew has done a great job. I can't say that $0.65 is light. I'll just say that it's reasonable. There's
a lot of degrees of freedom of conservatism around what's going to happen with COVID-19. We'll see, but
that's the data. I got the data right in front of me.

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

And Ashar, it is fair to say that this quarter will have most -- hopefully, the largest COVID impact --
COVID-19 impact of any quarter that we'll experience. That's the hope, and that's the expectation.

If we're going to reduce our expense structure, and as Tom said, that's generally through halting, adding
additional head count, which was part of our plan, that is something that will reduce expenses over the
course of the year and not be isolated to the second quarter.

So we have to plan for a light revenue in second and less expense mitigation than we think we can
achieve over the balance of the year.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

But we're still committed to our financial objectives for the year. I wouldn't get excited about the second
quarter. We're still committed for the year. And boy, we had a good first quarter.

THE SOUTHERN COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

I know you did. Excellent quarter.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So good start.

Operator, anything else?

Operator

That will conclude today's question-and-answer session, sir. Are there any closing remarks?

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

Drew, you want to lead us off?

Andrew William Evans
Executive VP & CFO

Again, I'll just say thank you to all the folks that are working hard on behalf of customers every day. I
think we're living our core values. And I'm impressed that with 15,000 or 17,000 people working from
home, we're getting the job done. So thank you very much to all the work teams that are working hard to
have such a great outcome for us.

Thomas A. Fanning
Chairman, President & CEO

And from my perspective, working at a national level, whether it's thinking about Homeland Security
with Chris Krebs and his team, Department of Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, all of his team is doing a
terrific job.

The industry is responding exceedingly well. And you should know that the industry, in this case, is a
union of the investor-owned utilities and the cooperatives and the municipals.

We are all working together to solve the problems as they arise. And in fact, the favorite Gretzky saying of
skate to where the puck will be, I think this industry is way beyond reacting to the present and really into
thinking about the future.

We're very mindful that hurricane season, storm season is ahead of us and being able to demonstrate, as
we have for decades, effective mutual response to the problems that will arise this year.

I think the industry is doing a terrific job. So kudos to all of my brothers and sisters out there.

And then finally, for Southern, what a great start to the year. That's given us some tailwind, I think,
to address some of these things. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead. I'm very encouraged with the
team at Vogtle. When you look at the data, I think they're managing these unexpected conditions in an
exceedingly prudent manner. And the rest of the system is going great with their ability to respond to the
storms and still serve customers well with this coronavirus protocol in place.

I'm just very encouraged about our ability to deal with whatever comes our way for the rest of the year.
That's why we remain committed.

I want to thank you all. I know, especially those of you all in the Northeast, you know I'm from New
Jersey. I got relatives up there, and I know you guys are dealing with some very tough times. And I know
maybe your families or maybe friends of families are all being impacted. Our thoughts and prayers go out
to you all. And I think, working together, we're going to get through this thing.

Thanks, everybody, for being with us today. I know it's an extra-long call, but I hope we gave enough
color around not only Southern's situation, but the national situation to give everybody confidence in the
next steps forward.
