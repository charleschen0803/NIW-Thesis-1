IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the IDEX Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer.
Thank you. You may begin.

Michael John Yates
VP & Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you, Diego. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer
for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX First
Quarter 2020 Financial Highlights.

Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the
3 months ending March 31, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during
today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com.

Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer.

The format for our call today is as follows: we'll begin with Andy providing an overview of IDEX
performance drivers and addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as
the company's response to date. Bill will then discuss our first quarter 2020 financial results and walk you
through an assessment of the company's liquidity and financial durability through several scenarios. And
finally, Andy will conclude with our current framework for second quarter and closing remarks. Following
our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.

If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning
approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and
entering conference ID number 13694804, or you may simply log on to our company's homepage for the
webcast replay.

Before we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are
subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Silvernail.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Mike. I appreciate everyone joining the IDEX Q1 earnings call today. I'm starting off on Slide
6. The world's spinning with great uncertainty. But as you leave this call today, I want you to feel certain
about one thing, IDEX is well positioned to survive and thrive through this COVID-19 crisis. We have the
quality of businesses, we have the people and we have the financial wherewithal. We've invested our
company aggressively over the years to build a very special organization. Most important, we build a
culture.

We built a culture with incredibly talented teams who run great businesses that matter to the world. Our
culture has helped us react very early to this crisis. We've made swift and smart decisions to keep our
people safe, to keep our businesses moving and ensure liquidity, making sure that we do everything we
can to help win this COVID-19 fight. IDEX has an important mission that we capture in 4 words, "Trusted
Solutions, Improving Lives." Our mission has never been more important. In a world consumed with
physical, emotional and the financial impact of COVID-19, IDEX plays a critical role in keeping people safe
and healthy while helping directly with the fight to defeat it.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

I'm going to move now to Slide 7. There are so many ways that IDEX is in this fight. In our Fluid &
Metering segment, we enable food, energy and industrial supply chains. In Fire & Safety and Diversified,
we've acted swiftly to quadruple the production of our mobile medical tents used by hospitals as they
struggle to handle the surge in COVID-19 cases. And in Health & Science technologies, we're making
compressors used in ventilators, mobile carts that produce hospital-grade air where it's not available
and compressors for mobile disinfecting sprayers. And of course, we're also a critical supplier enabling
the genetic sequencing that decoded the RNA of the coronavirus, enabling the development of tests for
COVID-19 and its antibodies as well as finding therapies and hopefully, an eventual vaccine. There are
dozens more examples across the company where we bring essential products to a market in need.

I'm turning now to Slide 8. I want to pause here for a moment and thank all of our people across IDEX,
especially those in manufacturing, shipping and other roles that require a presence in our facilities. We
have robust safety protocols at our sites worldwide to protect our people performing essential jobs.
The safety of our people will always be the most important consideration as we continue in this new
environment. In a crisis, especially one as devastating as this, your true values are exposed. I've never
been proud of the people of IDEX. From the first sign of the COVID-19 crisis in China, our teams have
been collaborating, problem-solving and acting. While great strategy is a product of this crisis, we're also
seeing the best in who we are.

I'm now moving on to Slide 9. On March 20, I held the conference call with investors where I laid out our
operating context, and our priority is to steer IDEX successfully through this crisis. Much has changed
in 5 weeks, but our point of view and our priorities remain the same. We've built our strategy and our
operating plans based on 4 phases of this evolving crisis. I believe we're now moving out of phase 1, the
acute phase and into phase 2, which will be a period of ongoing uncertainty and significant challenge for
the next 3 to 6 months. There'll be a little visibility as quarantines are lifted, and we all work to gradually
restart the economy safely.

During this phase, we expect to see a significant drop in demand and production capability as customers,
suppliers and our own teams are regularly impacted by shutdowns and shortages. The third phase will
be learning to live and work with COVID-19. This will require significant changes to much of what we do,
and this period will extend until there is a solution that gives people confidence to engage socially and
professionally without fear. While this phase will not be easy, we've seen from our businesses in China,
which have rebounded quickly, that we can successfully pivot our approach.

The final phase will be the post-virus world. I know we all look forward to this day when normal returns.
I'm convinced, however, that normal will be redefined just as it has been another severe crisis. Like
the Great Depression, the Second World War, 9/11 and the Financial Crisis, there will be significant and
permanent societal and economic changes. The coronavirus will shape our lives and our economy in
countless ways, some easily predictable and others yet unknown. Over the next 12 to 18 months, as we
move through these phases, it is our job as leaders to successfully transverse phases 1 through 3 and
enter phase 4 with a company that is financially strong and an organization that is positioned to thrive.

I'm now turning to Slide 10. We've outlined 4 strategies that guide our way to a better future. Our top
priority is safety, protecting our teams as we try to remain open to serve customers that are essential to
our society. While we are normally highly decentralized, this is the time when we have carefully weighed
safety protocols and mandated certain standards worldwide. These have included temperature checks at
the beginning of all shifts, guidelines for face coverings, cleaning and sanitizing practices, and processes
for addressing a variety of scenarios from COVID-19 cases to possible exposures.

Our COVID-19 issue and response team has led the way and regularly provides guidance to our local sites
as issues arise. And because of the strong procedures we have in place and the handful of incidences
where employees have contracted the virus, few if any, co-workers have been quarantined. Not only is this
good for business, but it's great for the health, well-being and morale of our employees. I'm glad to report
that every IDEX employee who has contracted COVID-19 has so far recovered.

To ensure business continuity, which is our second priority, we have developed plans for each site to use
in the event of a ramp down of operations. We want to ensure these are handled smoothly and in a way
that prepares the business to return quickly to operations. We are also regularly addressing supply chain

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

concerns. While our supply chains are generally shorter than many of our other global manufacturers,
we have quickly addressed issues from lockdowns and travel restrictions. So far, our business continuity
planning, like our security plans, have helped us avoid more significant business disruptions. In the
months ahead, we expect we'll be choppier. This extensive planning and support structure we've built
should serve our businesses well.

Our third area of focus is liquidity. IDEX entered this time with a strong cash position, and we have
remained cash flow positive since the beginning of the crisis. Our goal is to remain so throughout,
protecting our liquidity and our balance sheet. We're working with our businesses and finance leaders to
help them manage through a period unlike anything they've seen in their careers. Bill Grogan, our CFO,
has instituted daily cash management practices that he's working with all of our leaders across the globe.

Finally, we're playing offense. That means different things in different areas of our business. In some
instances, it means pivoting to focus on the needs of customers who are now blooming as they're selling
essential products. In other instances, it's meant helping businesses in need like we did in Novotema,
that's just outside Bergamo in Italy, that was closed. Our sister company, PPE in England, stepped in and
produced seals for a medical ventilator manufacturer as Novotema was struggling.

Playing offense also means being prepared to accelerate acquisitions when the market unfreezes and a
thoughtful approach to share repurchases.

With that, I'm going to pause here. I'm going to turn things over to Bill, and he's going to walk you
through an overview of our financials and liquidity.

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 12. Q1 orders of $645 million were
down 2% overall and organically. The slowdown in our industrial end markets that we discussed during
our previous call was compounded by the impact of the pandemic in most of our geographies and end
markets. However, there was positive momentum in our life sciences and pharma businesses. The backlog
we've built will help fill the decrease in orders we expect in Q2.

First quarter sales of $594 million were 4% -- were down 4% overall and 5% organically. Results early in
the quarter were better than expected in most areas of the business outside of china, but as the impact
of COVID-19 ramped, most of our businesses with the exception life sciences and pharma took a negative
turn and drove us to the low end of our guide.

Q1 gross margins expanded 10 basis points to 45.7% and were up in all 3 segments, primarily driven by
strong price capture, continued productivity initiatives and discretionary cost control. These actions more
than offset the negative margin impact of lower volume leverage.

Operating margin was 23.5%, down 30 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by the dilutive
impact of the Velcora acquisition, which had op margin of 8%, but EBITDA margin of 25% and lower
volume leverage. This was offset by our gross margin expansion and SG&A cost actions we took in the
fourth quarter of last year.

Our Q1 effective tax rate was 20%, which was higher than the 19.5% in the prior year due to a reduction
in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation.

First quarter net income was $102 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.33, down $0.11 or 8% compared to
the prior year EPS.

Finally, free cash flow was $72 million, down 5% compared to the prior year, but was 71% of net income
compared to 69% last year.

Turning to Slide 13 on liquidity. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ending March 31 was $473
million or 113% of net income. We continue to be well positioned to weather the current environment.
IDEX has consistently generated positive free cash flow in excess of net income through margin
expansion, ongoing working capital initiatives and an effective capital allocation philosophy. LTM-adjusted

leverage was 1.5x, providing sufficient capacity to fund all of our business needs and allowing us to quickly
pivot to offense as the economic environment improves. Leverage increased slightly in the quarter as we
drew $150 million on our revolver in late March in response to temporary challenges in the short-term
funding markets.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $569 million at the end of the quarter. We also have $642 million of
availability under our $800 million revolving credit facility. With cash on hand, available financing and
conservative leverage, we are confident in our ability to continue to meet our obligations, fund operations
and make critical investments in the business.

In relation to $300 million of notes due at the end of the year, we are currently exploring potential
options, including availing ourselves to the capital markets. As Andy mentioned, we have put in place
additional processes to enhance our focus on liquidity, and we have actively monitoring conditions with
our customers and our suppliers to ensure that we're able to maintain positive cash flow and mitigate the
impact of the challenging environment on cash and working capital. We're taking all necessary actions to
make sure we're appropriately positioned to operate effectively during this period.

Moving on to Slide 14. While we believe that we are well suited to operate in this environment, we are
continually monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and are modeling a number of possible
scenarios. These examples are meant to give our investors a picture of our durability, not a reflection of
what we expect for full year sales. Under our current cost structure, which reflects the structural actions
we took in the fourth quarter of 2019, we believe that our annualized breakeven revenue, the point at
which we continue to generate positive cash flow, is approximately $1.8 billion or a 30% decrease to our
2019 sales results.

To be proactive in this uncertain environment, we have developed a playbook with actions to reduce that
breakeven point. We've identified approximately $120 million worth of additional cost reductions, which
will drive our breakeven revenue closer to down 35%. This would include bonus actions, eliminating travel,
marketing and supplies and many other discretionary cost items. If the conditions warrant it, we are
prepared to take structural cost actions and generate an additional $40 million of reductions, resulting in a
breakeven revenue point of down 40%.

Lastly, although we intend to fund our dividend, if we were to suspend it, our breakeven point would be
as low as 50% down on an annualized basis. We are taking all prudent actions to manage discretionary
spending as we continue to gauge the impact of this volatile environment. At this point, we do not believe
that further structural actions are necessary, but we're staying closely tuned into our end markets and
supply chains and are prepared to take additional steps, if necessary.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Andy to review our current view on the second quarter.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Bill. Everybody, I'm on Slide 15. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe the
next 3 to 6 months are going to be extremely challenging. Everyone will face the same uncertainty
as we reopen the economy safely and execute an environment where COVID-19 exists and impacts
operations potentially in waves. While we believe strongly in the IDEX business model, and we're very well
positioned, we acknowledge the challenges that we face across our business units. We expect revenue
in the second quarter could be down as much as 15% to 25%. We know that some of our end markets
will be significantly challenged, but those headwinds will be somewhat offset as we continue to deliver
mission-critical components to essential customers worldwide.

We've taken prudent actions to significantly reduce our discretionary costs across our businesses, and the
steps we took in the fourth quarter of 2019 have positioned us to react to a market that is significantly
more challenging than we expected when we started the year. We are closely monitoring our markets and
our businesses, and we will react quickly to changes.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

To conclude, I'm extremely proud of how our employees have responded to this crisis. And even though
the next 12 to 18 months will be challenging for all of us, I know that we will meet this challenge and
come out strong on the other side.
With that, let me pause here and turn it over to questions from the audience. Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

It's great to hear the IDEX team, and I'm wishing everyone the best. Appreciate the -- all the details in
terms of the potential scenarios this morning. And the first question really picks up where Bill left off on
Page 14 on those scenarios because, Andy, I want to say for the past year, you've been asked about the
IDEX playbook for a normal recession. And it really feels like -- I don't even know what that is anymore
because we're far beyond that.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Even do we, Deane.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So it's just -- the idea here, as you said, if things progress or get worse, it just feels like we're already
there. So talk about, and I know this is a tough conversation, but the deeper cuts that you're likely going
to have to take, like is that $120 million of cost out, is that enough? What are the milestones that you're
looking for here? And then maybe some comments on decrementals.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes, you bet. So first of all, that first look at the $120 million, that's stuff that we are very actively putting
our arms around and taking the cost out of. And obviously, you can see that even impacted in a positive
way to some degree in the first quarter because we started those actions really as we were coming
into February and early part of March. And so there's some benefits there. So we're grabbing that lever
already, and we're grabbing it very aggressively, Deane. So that's the first thing.

One of the main priorities that I have going through this crisis is to maintain as much of the structure and
the talent that we can in IDEX appropriately. And so I am willing for a short period of time to eat some of
the incremental costing to maintain that talent base and to position the company well. That being said, as
you know, we're a very diversified and decentralized business. And so you have companies that -- some
companies are absolutely growing in this environment and some are really taking it on the chin. And so
we'll have to get the appropriate footprint in the appropriate places, depending upon how much deeper
and how much longer this goes. And -- but our first priority is to certainly keep the integrity of IDEX intact
as much as possible. So I look at that secondary group of actions, the incremental $40 million as steps
that we will take if we have to, but would prefer not to, Deane.

In terms of decrementals, if you look at it on a sequential basis versus year-over-year, I think that's
probably a good way to look at it. Obviously, we're a very high-contribution margin company. So we're --
we have contribution margins in the low 60s. And so if we can offset a good chunk of that and end up in
the 40s or 50s, without having to make massive structural changes to the company, we would do so in the
short term. But obviously, in the longer term, you've got to have the appropriate cost structure.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's really helpful. And then I just -- I appreciate the 4 phases that you've laid out, and I don't want to
minimize how much heavy lifting and, frankly, some pain to get through all 4 of these phases. But looking
beyond into that new normal and maybe the idea of when you will start to shift to offense? And you've

got balance sheet now. You didn't chase expensive deals the last couple of years. When does M&A make
sense? We know markets have to normalize a bit, but when do you start to flip the switch and play offense
here?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Well, some of that is in our control and some is not. In terms of overall playing offense, we're doing some
of it right now, Deane. We are -- if you look across our businesses, those places where essential products
are booming, so disinfection, many of our Health & Science markets, pharma reshoring, which we think is
going to be a major trend. We're playing offense now. We have redirected our people and investment and
are making sure that we can, first and foremost, help with this fight, but also make sure that we're doing
the right things for our shareholders, our owners. And so some of that's happening now. As it regards
to M&A, there are really 2 challenges with M&A. The first one is having enough confidence in your own
situation to deploy that liquidity in that balance sheet. And the second is that you have willing sellers. We
are doing an awful lot of work right now on both sides of that equation.

So let me talk about the liquidity side. So there's liquidity that is to survive that a lot of people are
having to utilize. And at the end of this, they will have a stretched balance sheet and a very difficult
circumstances. That is not our situation, and I don't want it to be our situation. Our drive, and why
we have so much focus on this breakeven level of cash flow, is because I want a balance sheet that is
deployable, aggressively deployable as the world starts to settle itself. And so if we can maintain this
north of $1 billion of liquidity as cash flows become more certain and the markets stabilize, we will get
aggressive, no doubt about that.

Now the other side of that equation is who are the sellers. And so as you can imagine right now, when you
guys are talking to a lot of folks, that's frozen. It's just a frozen marketplace. I think it will take through
a quarter or so for that to start to unfreeze when boards of directors and families are going to look at the
situation and recognize that it's going to take a while and that an attractive price in this marketplace might
make sense. But I think it will take a little bit of time, Deane.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So a couple of things. First, when you look at that down 15% to 25%, what's that predicated on? Is that
based on what you're seeing now? Are there signs of stability after that initial shock downward? Any kind
of context on what kind of logic you're using to get to the 15% to 25% down?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So what I'd first say is that the 15% is our experience as March unfolded and what we're seeing
here in early April. And being a short-cycle business, we certainly saw the reaction pretty quickly, both on
the ups and the downs, by the way, in terms of things that are struggling. The industrial businesses are
certainly taking it on the chin more so than other businesses. So if you look at FMT, that's just going to
be more painful there. You've got the combination of the coronavirus impact and then, of course, what's
happening in the energy world that's unfolding. So that 15% is what we've experienced here for, call it,
6, 7 weeks, Mike. My view is it's likely to get worse than the 15%. And we see kind of slippage happening
in a number of places that especially have more impact, if you've got, say, if you're in energy, you're in
transportation, those places, in particular, are really getting pounded and others are holding up. So I feel
pretty comfortable with that range, Mike.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

And then you alluded to it earlier, but maybe just talk about how you guys are thinking about what the
structural changes could look like here? What are some of the themes that you're thinking you might
rotate to, obviously, some of the pharma medical stuff you already mentioned? Anything else you're
thinking about. And then how do you prepare for it in the short term here and balance that with all the
other things that you have up in the air?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think one of the things that really works in our favor in this environment is our structure. It could
be an impediment. We put that rapid response team in place very early on because we knew that our
decentralization and in terms of kind of how we're structured worldwide, we knew that we could end up
with kind of 45 different answers. And so there were certain things that you just couldn't have 45 different
answers on, and we've been able to move very quickly. In this case, in terms of playing offense, Mike, our
structure helps us a ton because the places that are really struggling with massive demand fall-offs, you
can isolate them specifically, and you can start redirecting resources to things that are exciting.

I'll give you an example. So in the world of Health & Science, we have a significant demand for
engineering right now because of all the new things that are developing, whether it's from testing,
which you're seeing PCR tests take off that we're helping with. We needed engineering. And we actually
redirected engineering from our business and rescue to help our business in Health & Science. And so
we're doing a bunch of things like that, Mike. So we're definitely moving to those opportunities and
moving people and resources.

In terms of the big structural changes, I think they're going to happen around a lot of things touching
our Health & Science world. I think -- if I think about, say, the food supply chain, that's going to be an
area that I think will be impacted. There's a lot of talk of reshoring in terms of moving things out of more
difficult or more risky environments. I think that will happen. That was already happening. But it's not like
a big boom, Mike. I think it's a relatively slow phase. But overall, I feel like we're positioned well, and our
structure really helps us move to the areas where opportunity and demand are likely to be and move away
from places that are likely to be hit harder.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then one just clarification. On Slide 14, the breakeven cash flow. Is that a free cash flow before CapEx
or after CapEx?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

After. Correct, Bill? Bill, that's right, isn't it?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. I thought so. I just want to make sure. Appreciate it.

As usual, Andy, thank you for your frankness and clarity. So I just want to make sure that we're -- that
I'm at least thinking about what you're saying about decrementals correctly. So if we're at 15% to 20%
thinking for decline in this quarter's sales, if I choose the midpoint and say minus 20, just for example
sake, taking that number, multiplying it by 50%, and that's your decline in operating income this quarter,
this is simple as that, right?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Plus or minus, yes. Yes. That's close enough. Yes.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

And within that, how much of the $120 million discretionary are we talking about? In other words, what
I'm trying to get to here is that, it's at $50 million this quarter. Next quarter, it could be $40 million and in
that sense and so on, that would be helpful.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Okay. I think I understand your question, Scott, but if I don't get it right, just reiterate or help me out
here. So the $120 million is an annual number, right? And because we're not that seasonal and our fixed
cost structure doesn't -- isn't that variable, you could basically take the $30 million a quarter. And that's
going to come out of there. And that's pretty much coming out now. It might be a little bit more as time
goes on, but that's coming up pretty darn rapidly. And that's what enables you to go from instead of
having to be a 62% or 63% negative flow through, that's what helps you kind of ratchet that down over
time. So Bill, is there anything you'd add there?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

No. I think some of the items, maybe a little bit less in the second quarter that would ramp up, but it's
close.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Did I that answer your question, Scott?

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Yes, for all intents and purposes, the $30 million quarterly is kind of the exit rate right now?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's -- I mean, we've clamped down so hard here that we're not spending money on things that don't
have kind of a direct -- that aren't essential, right? That $120 million is really clamping that down.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got you. 2 other questions. What would be the trigger for the $40 million? What level of sales? Is it
this 35% to 40% decline in sales, that's the trigger for the structural?

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

There is -- to some degree, Scott, it is an amount. But more than anything else, it's what we think the
duration is going to look like, right? So if we're going to reset the business, let's just say, down 20%, let's
just use that number, just as an example. And you're no longer a $2.5 billion company, you're now a $2
billion company, you have to have a different cost structure, right, if you think that's going to be sustained
for a period of time. And so that's what we're really trying to evaluate is what we think the duration and
the depth is likely to be. And it's a combination of those 2 that would trigger us to look at the $40 million.
We didn't feel like we had to do that today. We felt like we should buy ourselves some time, and we have
with the $120 million. And so we'll continue to evaluate that.

As you know, we took out a big chunk here in the fall. We took out $15 million, and we had another $5
million, which obviously we've gone and got. So we were -- although we hadn't predicted this, we did
predict a tough year. And so we went and proactively got that $20 million out. And so we'll decide on
depth and duration here as we go through this quarter to figure out whether or not we want to take out
the other $40 million.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

No, I got you. That's very clear. And then I think you actually in that answer just answered my third
question, which was sort of the way that Slide 14 was structured to do, 30%, 35% and 40% and higher
revenue declines. That is both depth and duration in these numbers?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

It is. It is. Yes.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Right. Because your organic -- you're thinking for the second quarter, if it's minus 15 to 25, even if it ends
up at 25, what you're talking about here is on an annualized basis, there would be a duration here that
would get us to these numbers.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

That's right, Scott. And I want to be very clear, Bill said that in his remarks, but just so everyone hears
this correctly, we are not -- do not use these as guidance for where we think the world is going. This
is really, for an example, only. And we're trying to get a couple of messages across here. And I think
probably they have landed, but give it just in case. Message one was there's a lot that can happen in this
world before we become -- before we have a cash flow issue. And therefore, we don't have a liquidity
issue. We have tons of liquidity, but we're not going to -- I don't believe we're going to have to utilize that
liquidity to stay afloat. I want to utilize that liquidity to play really aggressive offense. And so hopefully,
that came across to number one, we're in a great position from a cash flow standpoint to number two, our
liquidity is really being pointed towards playing offense from the moment is correct aggressively.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Yes. Page 14 is much clearer to me now.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Great. Thanks, Scott.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I guess I'll go a little further on the cash flow side. Slide 14 here, we're looking at revenue changes and
expense changes. Maybe we could look at the working capital side of this. I guess you should clearly have
some source of cash out of inventory. Maybe you could talk about what you're expecting there. If you're
seeing any slowdown in DSOs or changes in receivable collections or any changes in customer behavior as
maybe they're getting stressed out? Any more color you can give us on that side of the equation?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll comment on this. And then Bill, I'll let you comment on it also. From -- in terms of how we're
managing this, I think of this in a couple of ways. The first one is inventory, we got to make sure it comes
out naturally as volume gets affected, right? That is -- that has been a winning move in any slowdown for
us. And historically, we have taken out inventory, and that's obviously had a very positive cash effect in
any kind of slowdown. So you should expect us to continue to do that and take cash off the balance sheet
or cash out of inventory, rather, and on the balance sheet.

In terms of payables and receivables, my philosophy here is don't be the bank, meaning we can't
get caught between customers and suppliers. At the same time, I want to be very careful about not
damaging customers and suppliers in here. So if we can end up neutral in that regard, and really play that
strategically, I think that's important. Obviously, we've got suppliers that we want to make sure they are
healthy. They're our partners. This is not a time to beat on them when they're struggling. At the same
time, we can't finance them. And so as our customers are coming to us and asking for relief, we're really
weighing that against what we can do across the working capital spectrum. And so we're being pretty firm.
We've got excellent service levels. We've got great lead times competitively. We're not going to become
the bank.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. So the target, payables and receivables, net cash neutral and inventories are sourced?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. My second question is on pricing. You guys have reported positive net pricing every year for as long
as I can remember, including 2009. This is clearly a little different thing, maybe a little steeper in the short
term here. Do you guys think you can still be net price positive or at least net price neutral in this kind of
environment?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

I'm pretty hopeful that we can stay positive. The price that we put out at the beginning of the year was
already out and going, and so I don't see why that won't stick. But I think there will be some challenges
next year as we think about pricing about whether or not we can -- how aggressive we can be there. Bill,
on those 2 topics, do you want to give your view?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I would say our price capture in the first quarter was in line with what we experienced for most of last
year. And I guess, my only comment on the working capital piece is there are some selective businesses
that took some actions to target to build some buffer stock relative to supply chains in certain countries

that were shutting down. So first quarter inventory performance was good, impacted slightly based upon
some of those builds. And to Andy's point, we fully anticipate to bleed that off here in the second quarter.
But price capture is still strong across the portfolio.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Bill, what's your view of price here as we think about the -- as this year unfolds?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I mean, obviously, it will get more challenging as we go through the balance of the year as customers
are more impacted, but I think our core pricing initiatives that we have across the portfolio will remain
positive. Does it come down slightly potentially, but overall, price cost is still positive for us.

Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So Andy, I just want to talk maybe higher level. IDEX, you built a really solid foundation here. You've
talked about that. And then you mentioned sort of these phases, but particularly as you go to that -- the
new normal, is there anything that's really coming to light here in terms of portfolio growth? It sounds like
you're starting to pivot some of that near-term organic investment to some of these new applications. I'm
just trying to get a sense if that's temporary or if it's sort of potentially a new direction here for IDEX?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I think we've had a lot of things come at us, Allison, in terms of opportunities that -- where people
have come to us on trying to help with very specific things relative to the COVID-19 crisis. And as we have
evaluated those, we've been pretty careful. And what I mean by that is what we don't want to do is take a
bunch of people and resources and shift them to something where the lead time is so long that effectively
when you bring your solution to bear, it doesn't matter anymore. And so there are going to be a bunch of
boom-and-bust cycles in this -- of different things that are coming to market, both because they are very
effective and then they're just no longer needed or they weren't particularly effective and they wash away.

And so we're trying to avoid those kind of things. And we're trying to move the portfolio to things that
are really about helping them fight where we have capabilities and we can ramp really quickly. And I use
the mobile medical tents out of our Vetter unit in Germany. We sold more in the month of March. We sold
as much in the month of March as we sold all of last year. And so we've ramped that up. They've literally
quadrupled their overall capacity here as we go through the rest of this year. And so that makes a ton of
sense. It doesn't take any major investment or capability that we don't have. So we're moving to those
sorts of things very aggressively.

As we think longer term, I think there are some trends here that are very natural for us. So obviously,
around global testing, that was already a trend that, that was growing and it was what we had positioned
ourselves behind in IDEX Health & Science, and that is going to accelerate. I think that's indefinite. And
what I mean by testing is testing kind of anything and everything that analytical equipment is used for
and biodiagnostic testing is used for it. That stuff is just going to continue to grow very aggressively, and
we're going to continue to position ourselves against that.

And then things like -- I think the pharma reshoring is the real deal. And so our material process business,
as an example, will absolutely play in that. And I think that's going to be a long-term trend. It's going to
take a long time for that to happen, but I believe that, that sort of thing is going to develop. And then
you have kind of all those other trends that, I think, are going to get accelerated because people, frankly,
have had to change their lives so much that it's going to be easier to move into some of these trends. I'm

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

thinking trends like digitization, mobile communications and how that impacts even, say, a Viking Pump
where the customer is going to become a lot more comfortable utilizing and expecting digital results and
information-based results, and I think that will move some of those things forward faster.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then you mentioned China, it sounds like it's coming out -- it's coming through
this and going into the recovery phase. As this rolls through globally, any lesson learned or your approach,
has it evolved differently as you hit each region based on what's been going on in China? Any color there?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes, that's a great question, Allison. And I think kind of moving from East to West in terms of how this
has -- this crisis has unfolded, we've been learning along the way, and we've done a few things. So our
Chinese businesses, they really led the way here in creating protocols for safe working. And we have --
every single one of our plants is up right now. Not everything is at full capacity, but even our places in
Northern Italy are up and working. And I'll give a lot of credit to that because we learned very early on
how to ramp down, how to ramp back up and how to work in an environment where the virus is with you.
And we've created a protocol and a playbook out of that. We then changed that and augmented that for
different parts of the world. And we actually very -- assumed -- we actually shared that with the MAPI
group, the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity & Innovation. We shared with them that, and they
shared it with all of their members. And our team just did a great job putting that together. And so that's
the basis of that, and we're continuing to learn.

We also here -- I guess it was last week we did a General Managers call -- a global general managers and
site managers call, and we had 4 of our general managers from Italy on that call taking people through
their experience. And -- I mean, the physical experience of what they've gone through, the emotional
side of it, how to keep people safe. We did kind of a virtual lunch and learn for everybody around those
learnings. And so one of the things that we're trying to leverage here is the network effect of having so
many sites around the world where we can learn and share and get the best practices out in people's
hands. So we've been trying to do that really intently, Allison.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic

That sounds great. Stay safe, everybody.

Joseph Craig Giordano

about your overall exposure there? What you're seeing in the way you guys play in the energy markets?

Andrew K. Silvernail

Yes. So Joe, I think as you know, we are principally a midstream player. And so we're not really anywhere
near the wellhead. For the most part, we have some things here and there, but not a ton. Look, across the
energy business, which today is sub-10% of our total portfolio, we have an expectation that, that's really
going to get hammered here. So far, we haven't had that -- it hasn't been as severe as we expected to be.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 24, 2020

But we are certainly seeing all of those indicators now on the order front. And so we'll have to get our cost
structure right and our overall footprint right to make sure that we can sustain there.

I think everybody learned the lesson in 2015, 2016, that the overall impact of capital spending and how
the energy economy impacts the global economy can't be overestimated, right? It's -- that's going to be
-- obviously, it's going to exacerbate this whole situation, and we're going to have to make sure that our
businesses are positioned correctly as we go forward. But thankfully, we're not in the -- on the wellhead
and seeing some of these just ridiculous declines. And we will see declines, but it won't be like we're
seeing upstream.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

When you think about -- I mean, it's hard now to think about like new investments you have to make
when you're -- we're trying to rip out costs at the same time. But as you think about your global footprint,
does something like this make you have to step back and like rethink the way you even have your facility
set up? Like does the workflow have to look different in the future, do you have to -- does head count
have to be totally different and it has to be more automated? Like what kind of -- how do you just think
about how your global plants look coming out of this?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Joe, I think that question as we move now through that, what I call, phase 3, is going to be one of the
most important questions that we're wrestling with because when you think about a manufacturing facility,
especially one that is principally assembly and test. I mean, obviously, we do have businesses that are
more than that. But we tend to be light machining, assembly and test, and we have a couple of businesses
that have the boundaries, and that's pretty unusual though. And in a world like that, obviously, we've all
embraced lean manufacturing here for many decades. And the natural output of lean manufacturing, the
cellular manufacturing, which did not work with social distancing the way it's constructed today, people are
not 6 feet apart.

And so we are -- we're already in the process of doing that is how do you see the elements -- how do
you keep the elements of lean manufacturing, which is the elimination of waste and bringing down
lead times. How do you keep those while having the principles of social distancing in place, and that's
something that we're working on, and I know a lot of people are. And we're not going to move to batch
manufacturing. We're not going to do that sort of thing and destroy 3 decades of great work. But it does
change how people work. And not just in the manufacturing environment, it's going to change in the office
environment, it's going to change how we interact with customers. So many things like that are going to
change until people have that comfort to be closer together again.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

If you could talk -- I'm getting the sense directionally for the year, FMT gets hit probably the worst and
then Fire & Safety maybe second worst, and then Health & Science maybe third worst as there's some
partial offsetting factors, would you agree with that?

Andrew K. Silvernail

I would.

Yes.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. In those other segments, are there -- I'm talking about some partially offsetting factors, maybe in
Health & Science. Are there any in the other 2 segments? Is there anything else you're seeing that could
go the other way as a positive?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. So I think as you look at, say, let's look at FMT first. I think that, obviously, the whole
agricultural space has been really beaten up, but I do believe that food supply chains are going to be --
continue to be really critical. And so I think that's overall a good trend as you talk about Ag, in terms of
where we play there. And that would be both from a material handling business, material process business
and for Banjo. I put in both of those.

Our ABS business, we are seeing some benefits of actually -- there's some very interesting analytics that
can be done for what's going on in sewer systems, believe it or not. I know that sounds incredibly strange,
but there's a whole bunch of modeling and analytics that are allowed to or can happen because of our
ability to monitor those systems. So our ABS business, we think will probably hold up pretty well in there.
And then I think that the more industrial facing, kind of general industrial is going to have a bunch of
things that are pretty negative, offset by small things that are positive.

So example, if you're selling into the chemical industry, obviously, there are some chemicals around
disinfectants and things like that, that are absolutely booming. And then you have other things that are
going into large CapEx that are likely to really struggle. So there are a few trends there over in Diversified.
On the Fire side, interestingly enough, there are a number of applications where you can use some of that
technology for disinfectant. So you'll see some of that. You've got a really long -- a very, very long pipeline
of -- for -- in the fire business for trucks in the U.S. particular, we've got over a year of backlog.

What we don't know yet is whether or not we'll see cancellations. We have not seen that yet, but we'll
have to monitor that pretty closely. We've seen in China the rescue business pick back up aggressively. It
slowed down as tenders slowed down and it has picked back up aggressively. And so I think those hold up.
BAND-IT and dispensing both, I think, take it on the chin here in the short term because of their exposure,
one, around the retail space and -- for dispensing. And then for BAND-IT, you've got some exposure to
transportation and oil and gas that will get hit, but other parts will do quite well.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. Yes, that's good -- that's some good color there. If you could -- maybe just one last question on --
same question, but related to margins. I would think FMT would get hit the hardest because it seems like
in Fire & Safety, you've got some -- you've made some changes there that structurally, and maybe those
are okay or not okay, but fair better than FMT. Is that safe to say in terms of like the decline we'll see?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the FMT will fair -- will be the most challenged and then Diversified and then Health & Science.

geographies, as we do reopen commerce, how are you thinking about the pace of return between the U.S.
and Europe?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Just to make sure I understand, Brett, the question you're asking, are you asking kind of the range of
outcomes kind of business by business, like how bad to how good? Is that what you're asking?

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Well, I mean -- yes. I mean you're saying on average, things are down mid-teens. I mean there's probably
some growth in there, which does imply -- there are some businesses down 30%, 40%. Is that the right
math?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We've got a couple of businesses that we think are going to be down in that 40% range. Very few
are that severe, but then you do have a couple. And again, it's energy, transportation exposure, we don't
have really hospitality exposure, so to speak. So we don't have that. But we do have some businesses that
are down there that much, and we expect we'll probably in the next quarter or 2, we'll have that kind of
impact. We don't think that will stay long. And I think that to your question, our experience in China has
been a very, very aggressive snapback and -- but it's actually bifurcated. You have businesses that are
kind of COVID facing, so to speak, that are helping with the fight, that are growing like crazy. And then
you've got a few businesses that are kind of really in the dumpsters, but it's actually come back pretty
quickly.

I don't think that, that's the model for the rest of the world and for a number of reasons. Obviously,
China has some very unique circumstances in how they are able to manage people and businesses and
democracies, just don't have those tools. And that's the cost of democracy, which is, I think, a good cost.
And so I think it's going to look a lot more like we're seeing in Europe, which is you're going to see people
starting to figure out how to live with this virus and figure out how can you still have social distancing but
get back to work, get back to friends and family. And so that means it just takes longer. And that's what
we're seeing certainly in Italy. And that's what I expect here.

And just to be clear, our expectation here is that this is going to be fits and starts. I am not someone who
has bought into a super aggressive, everything gets fine in the fall sort of thing. I think that's crazy talk.
And I think we have to face the reality that's in front of us. And you know what, if we get lucky, and for
some reason, this goes away with weather or something else or a vaccine is found more quickly than we
think or you have very, very effective treatments, great news. I don't think anybody should bank on that,
and I certainly wouldn't manage the company expecting that.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then just one last one. I was hoping you could spend just a moment
on the evolution of the portfolio, not so much from a product standpoint, you gave a lot of good examples
earlier. But just in terms of service or the recurring elements of the portfolio, what's that mix look like
today? I mean, obviously, service is going to be impacted here near term. But kind of in the new normal,
what is the recurring aluminide decks look like?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We've never been a company that has the classic sort of high recurring revenue, so to speak. And the
reason I say that is that we don't have a big parts business, but we tend to sell into like-for-like in a very,
very high percentage of our applications. And so Bill, I don't know, what's your estimate of total sort of
recurring? How would you characterize that?

Yes. I agree with that. And so look, when you had the financial crisis, our total business was down 14%
during that year, right after that over the entire year. Our Health & Science business was down 5%. And I
think our industrial businesses were down, say, 20% in those environments, which set itself off. We have a
better portfolio positioning than we did then, meaning it's less cyclical and there's more Health & Science
in the mix. And so I feel good about that. So overall, I think our portfolio and our positioning is pretty
good, albeit there will be a couple of places that will get hit really hard.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.

Walter Scott Liptak
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask a question about the municipal businesses. Your comments so far that Fire okay, China
picked up pretty quick. I wonder how the municipal businesses you think will do this time. If there's
anything different, more challenging, either financially or maybe benefits? I think you mentioned the
sewer business could have some benefits. I wonder if we can just talk about muni.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think historically, the municipal businesses have had 18-month to 2-year lag time compared to other
businesses, and that's really driven by receipt, right, especially in the Western World. The -- as you -- as
the receipts come in, that really sets the overall operating and capital budgets. And so I expect there to be
a little bit quicker reaction than you saw in the financial crisis. That -- in the financial crisis, that took time.
I remember that well where the municipal businesses held up really well as we went into that crisis. And
then they started to really struggle as you got into 2008 -- excuse me, 2010, 2011.

That took some time for that to make its way through and then obviously has had a pretty strong overall
run. I expect that will generally follow a similar path, although I think it will be more. I think people will
act faster just because it's been such a shock to the global system and everybody's top of mind that
municipalities are good. Will probably clamp down a little more quickly on their spending. I expect to see
that. But I do think it will still lag the overall industrial economy.

Okay. Great. And then the last one for me, just about the share buyback. I wonder if you can just remind
us how much is left on the share repurchase authorization. How you're thinking about it in the second
quarter or in the second half?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. You bet. So we did buy just over $100 million of shares. We had a 10b5-1 in place going into this.
And so we did buy just over $100 million. We did shut that 10b5-1 down as we looked at the value of
liquidity and the uncertainty that we were in. We valued this certainty more than we did the incremental
share buyback. So we did pause that. Look, I know there's going to be a lot of -- people are going to be
looking really hard at those who buy back shares. And I know in some ways, it's turning into a political
football.

I don't think that we are in that category. Number one, obviously, we're kind of pretty low on the overall
visibility food chain here. So I don't worry too much about that. Second, we're not going to be a company
that takes cash from the government. I can't see where we're ever going to do that in a way that restricts
us in any way to our behaviors. And then finally, look, we are going to utilize our liquidity the best way
we can to help all of our stakeholders. And if what that means is to buy back shares, then we will do so
appropriately. In terms of what we have in total, I want to say, we only have the $500 million that we got
authorization for it back a few weeks ago, plus you add that on, I think, Bill, to what about? Around $700
million?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

It's a little over $700 million. Yes, a little over $700 million.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Just a quick one. Most of mine have been answered, but just with respect to life sciences and pharma, the
strength you're seeing there. Is that COVID-19-related or is that something else? And could you put that
in the context of the $50 million improvement, I believe, you saw in overall backlog, how that component
plays out looking forward?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. You've got -- there are 2 stories in there, Matt. So the first one is, yes, there is absolutely a pickup
from COVID-related activities. There's no doubt about that, that we're seeing in life sciences. But also, we
have a number of very important customers that have programs that are ramping. And we have won some
substantial business, and we had some really nice orders here in the quarter relative to that. And so that's
been strong. So it's both ongoing programs that are really important and then you've got the impact of
COVID-19. So you've got 2 things going at once. And Bill, I don't know, in total, what does that make up
of, of the $50 million of backlog build?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

It was a little over $30 million from HST.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So that will give you a sense, Matt.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to management for
closing remarks.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Great. Thank you very much. And thank you all for being on the call. I know that we're sitting in a time
that has shaken us in many ways. And I think -- I'd like to close with a couple of comments. My first one

is that, as I said in my prepared remarks, I could not be more proud of how the team here at IDEX has
handled this. I have seen a level of collaboration and teamwork and positivity that -- it really warms the
heart. It's just incredible. And when you see that sometimes the news cycles have a tendency to get you
down and -- but when you see how people are coming together in the real world and tackling this, it is
awesome. And it's why I am in business.

I believe that the purpose of business is to make life better, and I could not be more proud of the team at
IDEX for what they've done. It's just remarkable. Second, I'd like to say thank you to everybody who's on
this call and your interest in IDEX. We -- while the IDEX brand is not well known in the consumer world,
we play a very important role in a lot of places that really do matter. And that mission that I talked about,
about Trusted Solutions and Improving Lives, we live that here at IDEX. And we're seeing in this crisis, in
this fight with COVID-19 how important that is.

And I want to thank the people who are investors in the company and prospective investors for your
support, your partnership as we move through this. And we will move through this, and we will get to the
other side and we will have a very strong company that's positioned extremely well.

So thank you, everybody. I appreciate it, and look forward to discussions as we go forward. Take care.

Operator
Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.
