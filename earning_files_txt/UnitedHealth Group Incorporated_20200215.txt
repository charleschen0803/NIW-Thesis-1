UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded.

Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under
U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some
of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.

This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts
is available on the earnings reports and SEC filings section of the company's Investors page at
www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we
issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated April 15, 2020, which may be accessed from the Investor
page of the company's website.

I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David
Wichmann. Please go ahead.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With all that is going on, we've structured things a bit
differently today. We'll get directly to what's likely top of mind for all of you, the impact of COVID-19
global health crisis on our businesses and the actions we're taking to support our communities, members,
patients, care providers, customers, government partners and team members and their family. These are
still the early days in the response to COVID-19, and we anticipate we will experience and learn more as
events unfold in the months ahead. UnitedHealth Group was consciously built with the restless mindset,
adaptable capabilities, culture and the enduring human values to respond and serve in meeting challenges
such as we are seeing today. The commitment, ingenuity, compassion and engagement of the 325,000
people of UnitedHealth Group has never been stronger.

I will start today by expressing my gratitude and admiration to this restless team for the extraordinary
efforts and personal sacrifices being made every day. They are doctors, nurses, pharmacists, social
workers and other clinical and nonclinical health care workers on the front lines of care as well as
customer care representatives, transaction processors, supply chain experts, technology engineers, data
scientists and others supporting them, the health system and our communities. The COVID-19 pandemic
is deeply personal to them and to all of us. They're connected digitally, triaging people with symptoms,
engaging directly with our most vulnerable patients, ensuring essential chronic and COVID-19-related
medical and behavioral health services are available and accessed while helping keep the health system
coordinated, connected and working for individuals and their doctors.

They are enhancing safety for those most at risk, making sure the right medicines are getting to the
right patients when and where they need it and the right testing and protective gear is available to
properly safeguard the health workforce. They are driving innovative solutions around testing, health care
workforce safety, improving critical product, supply and services availability, helping develop and evaluate
therapies and applying advanced analytics to identify, predict and combat COVID-19.

For our heroic clinical team, we have further hardened our safety-first workforce environment for those
caring for patients across our more than 1,500 facilities and those providing medications and services
caring for people in their homes. Like all of us, they are concerned about the health and safety of their
own families and friends. Yet they remain front and center, engaging fully each day to serve many
selflessly away from their families for weeks so they can ensure care is provided to those most in need. I

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

have never been more proud or more humbled to be on their team. Every team member at UnitedHealth
Group remains fully employed, supported, protected and engaged in the COVID-19 crisis.

Let me pause to acknowledge and add a note of deep gratitude to Andrew Witty, who has announced
this morning will be taking a leave of absence to provide leadership for the efforts of the World Health
Organization to find and distribute a vaccine for COVID-19. Our gratitude for Andrew is grounded in all he
has done to guide UnitedHealth Group and Optum so effectively and sensitively for all who we serve and
all who work at this enterprise and his willingness to apply his leadership and phenomenal talents to this
new assignment for which he is so aptly suited. We couldn't be more proud to call one of our own -- to see
one of own serve in this way. And we look forward to both his success in leading this effort and his return
to our company once this important work is done. He is on the call with us today and available to respond
to your questions before he reports to duty with the World Health Organization.

From the outset of COVID-19 outbreak, we mobilized to keep our entire enterprise fully intact and
functioning at the highest performance levels. As we stand today, we are supporting all of our products,
services and commitments across all of our businesses and markets. We have long had a high proportion
of our more than 200,000-person nonclinical team working from home, and we were able to quickly move
nearly all of the rest to work at home as well. They have been performing well. And our service levels
remain strong for our clients, members, patients and the health system broadly.

For the millions of people we are privileged to serve through UnitedHealthcare, we have taken every step
possible to broaden access to care. We have offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who
previously declined employer-sponsored offerings, eliminated all COVID-19-related cost sharings and
removed prior authorizations to speed patient transitions of care so health systems can diagnose, treat
and redirect patients. We have developed revise payment time frames to help people sustain coverage,
and we're helping people displaced from their job to smoothly transition to affordable coverage which
meets their needs.

Last week, we moved to provide nearly $2 billion in liquidity to the health system, accelerating payments
to care providers whose clinical operations have been impacted. We have been partnering with other
companies and academic institutions to develop and validate protocols and processes to more rapidly
and frequently test health care professionals on the front line, applying new technology to ensure safe
and full availability of this critical workforce. This leverages the self-administered collection innovation we
developed, which is simplifying COVID-19 testing. And we have been tracking infectious disease pattern to
identify supply-demand inequities and resource needs in every major metropolitan statistical area across
the U.S. health system. This will emerge as a new capability to provide enhanced disease surveillance in
the future.

Our high-risk members have been identified, and we are surrounding them with services to reduce the
impacts of social isolation on their access to physical and behavioral care while keeping them as safe
as possible. And we have provided over $50 million in initial domestic and global grant funding and
investments to advance health workforce safety, support those in geographies most afflicted, aid seniors
secluded in their homes and help communities address rising levels of homelessness and food insecurity.

Like the broader health system in recent weeks, we have seen a reduction in elective care, which
is impacting both the UnitedHealthcare benefits and the OptumCare delivery businesses. Most
traditional procedural work has been postponed at our SCA ambulatory surgery centers. Likewise, the
UnitedHealthcare and Optum at-risk care delivery businesses have seen lower demand for these services.
We are seeing time frames and discussions for new business opportunities being extended as most
business partners focus on crisis response. Many employers have had to furlough employees, driving
higher levels of unemployment, which may ultimately affect the outlook for growth in our group benefits
business while increasing our membership in individual lines and Medicaid coverages.

While it feels awkward to be talking about earnings outlooks at this moment, you saw our press release
we are maintaining our 2020 earnings per share outlook established at our investor conference. We view
this as the most reasonable baseline posture in these uncertain times as we continue to grow and operate
our businesses while assessing the multitude of potentially offsetting factors across our uniquely diverse
enterprise. These factors will become clearer in the months to come. Their related financial effects on

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

our business will clarify as well. As they do, we commit to providing swift relief even as we consider the
uncertainty of the environment going forward. While there is still much to understand, we can be very
clear with you today that we are committed to ensuring that any financial imbalances which arise from this
situation are reconciled proactively and addressed fairly and timely for all those we serve.

Let me now share a few of the specific actions underway at Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum has
cared directly for more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients to date and is operating more than 400 test
sites across the country. We quickly shifted more than 4,000 additional OptumCare physicians to our
digital care clinics on our way to more than 10,000 in the weeks to come. This rapid response was made
possible by the swift work of the regulatory agencies allowing flexibility in state licensure requirements for
clinicians across service categories and state lines. We thank and commend them for these actions and
encourage long-term continuation of these policies.

Our digital health consumer engagement has accelerated in many directions. For example, we've applied
new COVID-19 clinical pathways to our device-based remote monitoring services to identify and prioritize
high-risk individuals for follow-up care. Our newly developed COVID-19 symptom checker provides people
with recommendations on how to proceed based on their results. And we provided access to our digital
behavioral health care services, which give clients on-demand help for stress, anxiety and depression. All
content, coping tools and peer support are free to everyone.

Because it's critical everyone receives their needed medications, we are providing early refills, extended
authorizations and increased home delivery options. We also extended hours at our behavioral health
pharmacies to ensure medication adherence for those with mental health and substance abuse challenges.
The spread of the virus has created a significant health risk for those receiving life-sustaining infusion
services traditionally administered in the hospital or hospital clinic settings. For these patients, we're
providing infusion services through our Optum infusion ambulatory suites and in their homes through
our nurse infusion specialists. Finally, Optum is innovating on the front lines of care delivery, developing
screening protocols to identify patients who are likely to need hospitalizations and collaborating with
health and care delivery organizations to share this knowledge.

UnitedHealth care is working at full speed as well with partners across the health system to address
the current global emergency. For consumers, UnitedHealth care has made it simple and easy to access
care, waiving cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment and eliminating many administrative
requirements. Tens of thousands of people have taken advantage of a special enrollment period we opened
for those needing coverage for health benefits. And more than 2 million consumers took advantage of our
offer to obtain early prescription drug refills to ensure no one experienced gaps in treatment.

UnitedHealthcare digital and Telehealth services were ready, and as a result, extensively used as a safe,
simple and free way to connect with care providers, either through a partner or directly with the patient's
own doctor. UnitedHealthcare is paying careful attention to vulnerable members, especially in Medicare
and Medicaid, by expanding access to our personalized digital care platforms, which provide up-to-date
information about prevention, coverage and care. People can quickly talk to a nurse, refill and schedule
home delivery for prescriptions and get access to emotional support 24 hours a day. We are also helping
federal state and local authorities address system capacity shortages by supporting them with domain
operating experience. One example involves 2 UHC community and state leaders, Dr. Jeffrey Brenner and
Kathleen Stillo, who are now working exclusively with the state of New Jersey for the next several months
to establish a critically needed field-based hospital system. These are just a few examples of how the
people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare have mobilized to respond to this public health challenge. There
are many more and they're happening every day.

Now I'll turn it over to John Rex, our Chief Financial Officer.

John F. Rex
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave. I know you've had an opportunity to look through our first quarter financial results this
morning. And as such, given the unique circumstances, I'll be brief about the quarter. As Dave said, while

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

it feels somewhat uncomfortable to be speaking of the financial aspects of this challenging situation, we
know this is what you need to understand for your work.

Given the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak and its progression in the United States, the first quarter
financial impact was limited. As you know, incidence rates in the U.S. only started moving meaningfully in
mid-March. And elective care trends did not begin to be meaningfully impacted until later in the month. At
the segment levels, UnitedHealthcare and the OptumHealth, Insight and Rx businesses all reported first
quarter operating earnings that were in line with our own expectations going into the year.

Looking ahead, we are maintaining our full year 2020 earnings per share outlook. As I'm sure you would
expect, this view is subject to a number of key considerations that have yet to play fully out, including
the full incidence and intensity levels we experience; the duration and ultimate impact on economic,
employment and business activity levels; and the duration and extent of disruptive care patterns as the
virus runs its course.

Beyond our maintained earnings per share outlook, we anticipate other key investor conference metrics
likely will play out differently than we expected at that time. And our quarterly progression will likely vary
from historical patterns. For example, the environment today suggests the second quarter could be the
lowest medical care ratio of the year, potentially meaningfully so with elective care demand still restrained.
Offsetting this impact, we would anticipate the second half medical care ratio could be meaningfully
elevated.

Among some of the factors we consider, people will hopefully have more comprehensive care access by
the second half of the year and some of the currently deferred care can be restored. Individuals with
chronic conditions are among those for whom we have considerable concern in this environment. While we
are mitigating the impact through other means, missed treatments can aggravate health status, resulting
in initially more intense care needs as the system reopens. We will proactively work to help them quickly
seek care, and the impact of testing and coverage expansion, such as serologic tests. These are just a few
of the factors we must consider, and I'm confident you are eager to probe into all of these areas and likely
more.

We appreciate your understanding of our need to defer on providing point estimates and even ranges
today given the evolving situation, the multi-variables at play and their interdependencies and our regard
for the many thoughtful views that will shape this situation.

Our strong financial position and liquidity enable us to fully meet both our operational and strategic needs.
We ended the quarter with an intentionally higher excess cash balance and a higher-than-normal debt-
to-capital ratio. This was a prudent response to what we saw in more volatile financial markets during the
month of March. When considering our quarter ending excess corporate cash position, we size our debt-
to-total-capital ratio at about 40.5%. As markets become more normal, we will return to our previous cash
management and leverage positions.

Given our critical relationship with our health care delivery partners, we moved quickly to implement
policies to provide enhanced liquidity for care providers by accelerating nearly $2 billion in payments,
provided needed support to health systems and individual care providers. These types of actions are
important to help provide more financial stability for the system. We expect some metrics such as days
and medical claims payable and cash flow will be impacted as a result of these actions while that will be
transitory as we move through this situation together.

With that, I'll turn it back to Dave.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Thank you, John. I hope this gives you some insight into what we are seeing and the actions we are taking
to serve people, communities and the health system during these unprecedented times. We are committed
to applying the full capacity of our enterprise to serve not just our patients, members and customers, but
also the hundreds of millions of people impacted across the nation and around the world. We will continue
to protect our team members and their families, apply our skills, energy and broad capabilities to serve

and aid others in this time of crisis. Our mission is to help people live healthier lives and to make the
health system work better for everyone.

This moment of challenge is proof of the resolve of the 325,000 women and men of UnitedHealth Group
to achieve this mission. And you can also expect us to be fully prepared to excel on the other side of
COVID-19, ready to respond to demand for health system resources and adapt our strategic priorities
to emerging opportunities to lead in the development of the next-generation health system in a socially
conscious way.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Wondering if we could get the quarter end IBNR before the quarter. And if you could just comment on
OptumHealth's performance from 2007 to '11 and how the business is different today in terms of more
risk-based business. You've added some fee-for-service businesses, but how you'd expect the performance
of OptumHealth to track versus how it performed back in the financial crisis?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Gary, can you clarify the first part of your question, please?

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. I was just hoping, within the medical claims payable number, if you could give us the IBNR number
that typically shows up in the Q.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Do you want the dollar estimate?

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The dollar amount, yes.

John F. Rex
Executive VP & CFO

So Gary, this is John Rex here. We get our Q out very, very quickly, and we'll have that for you. And you
can follow up with Brett also if you need any color on that particular metric.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

And so as for -- I think you can see that our days payable are consistent with quarter end last quarter
and then also slightly elevated year-over-year as well. So I think you can take something from that. And
then also just generally speaking, what's gone on with development in terms of the continued conservative
posture of the business and how it records its year -- quarter end, year-end and other IBNR estimates. I'd
just also rely on the fact that it's consistently applied to the best of our ability, as always, and informed
not just by claim lags but other things as well.

So on OptumHealth, just I might suggest that rather than responding directly to your question, I'd just
suggest that it is right on our expectations. I know there's some commentary about it this morning, but it
was definitely on our expectations. What people don't think realize about this business is that the elective
and chronic disease management deferrals work both ways in a business that has 2/3 of its business or
revenues are risk-based and 1/3 of them are fee-for-service based. So you might want to think about that
as you think about the performance expectations of this business going forward. I just want you to know,
I'm very proud of this team and how they've served and how they've adapted.

And if I can, I'd ask Wyatt Decker to provide you with a few examples of how the teams performed.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

Wyatt W. Decker
Chief Executive Officer of OptumHealth

Thank you, Dave, and thank you, Gary, for the question. Yes, to characterize the response to COVID-19
of Optum and OptumHealth, I would use 4 adjectives: courage, compassion, collaboration and a can-do
spirit. The over 65,000 doctors, nurses and advanced practitioners and others of this team have been
on the front lines of the COVID response, as you heard earlier from Dave, and has stood up over 436
testing centers. We have dramatically scaled our ability to care for patients digitally, including through
Telehealth vehicles and will, by the end of this month, have over 10,000 providers on Telehealth platforms
and solutions. We have been proud to be also on the front lines of innovation, collaborating with R&D on a
whole host of solutions.

And just as an example, in New York and New Jersey, we have over 329 care sites, including 49 urgent
care centers, and stood up the first drive-thru testing solution for the state of New Jersey and continue to
work very closely with those states and cities within them to respond effectively to COVID. So much more
to come. We anticipate to emerge on the other side of this an even more sophisticated, digitally enabled
national provider of health care that is focused on serving our patients and delivering value-based health
care. Thank you, Dave.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

So that was Dr. Wyatt Decker. I think most of you know Dr. Decker well enough by now, having been with
us for a while. But just as a reminder, he was the CEO of Mayo Scottsdale, which is obviously one of their
strongest flagship locations. He's also an emergency room physician, which clearly showed through in
this crisis or is showing through in this crisis. He is intensely calm right in the middle of a crisis. And if
you think about the numbers of things they've had to deal with, let's just say, it's been an honor and a
privilege to have him here with us today.

Operator

We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

First, I wanted to dig into early trends on commercial membership. Would love to hear what you're seeing
in the commercial risk book, for instance, in terms of premium collections in April. Through mid-month,
right, how much have you collected in April, given all the uncertainty here, versus a typical collection? And
how many of your members, you think, have been furloughed? We're just trying to understand the impact
of furlough versus unemployment.

And then I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there. But as you go into commercial renewals that
have to be priced for [ 7 1 ] and have to set Medicaid -- Medicare bids in the next 4 to 6 weeks, a lot of
questions on how you're going to bid or set price relative to the potential for deferred utilization coming
back next year, possibility of a COVID return during flu season, et cetera. So any color you can give us on
pricing as well would be really helpful.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Okay. Dirk?

Dirk C. McMahon
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. So on a premium relief, we're working with our customers on a daily
basis to find the right solutions to ensure their employees can continue to have access to the care they
need. I'll give you a little bit of numerical context. In a typical month, we extend grace periods or offer
payment plans to customers that represent about 0.4% of our premium base. For March 1 premiums, we

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

collected most of the premiums prior to the COVID impact really kicking in. And these extensions increase
to about 1% of our premium base. So for April 1 premiums so far, the amount of extensions have grown
to about 3% of our premium base. So a little bit elevated, but we're going to continue to work with our
customers on payment plans to give them the options for coverage that they need.

Let me switch to your second question. You talked a little bit about commercial pricing. Of course, we're
in the process of developing our pricing for 2021. We're closely monitoring the emerging COVID-19
information, including things like the claim experience from our members who have been diagnosed
with the disease as well as the abatement of other procedures. We're going to continue our commitment
to pricing to our forward-look of costs, including estimates of things like significantly increased testing
costs as well as hopefully the cost of the vaccine. Our view of the 2021 cost will continue to evolve as we
learn more about the virus. The majority of our member months, I should note, are really priced after
September. So we'll have time to get a better view on what the 2021 environment will look like.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Yes. And if it's okay, Dirk, the one of the more immediate needs as well as what we're doing on pricing for
Medicare. So Tim, do you want to take that?

Timothy John Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement

Justin, thanks for the question. And as you know, some of the key inputs to the 2021 Medicare Advantage
bid process were published by CMS only last week, so really early in the process and we never hardened
our position at this stage. In 2021, as always, we strive to provide consistency in benefits to the members
that we serve. We have a long track record of stable to improving benefits and have accomplished this in
some challenging circumstances in the past. The HIT dynamics that played out over years are an example.
So too early to talk in detail about our benefits and some of the assumptions there, but our clear goal is
stability. Stability is always extremely important to our members, and it's especially important at a time
like this.

Operator

We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays.

Steven James Valiquette
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Just to follow up further on the commercial enrollment trends. I guess I'm curious for 1Q '20,
curious how that membership shook out relative to your own expectations. Think there was any impact
you have related to the rise of unemployment in late March in those 1Q numbers? And how are you
thinking about unemployment impact on overall membership for the overall company as the year
progresses, implying that you may recapture or gain some members in Medicaid book as well?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Dirk, do you want to take that?

Dirk C. McMahon
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So thanks for the question. As I said in January, we were expecting to be down for both fully insured
and self-funded membership in the first quarter. But we expected to gain that membership in both areas
as we pace through the year.

With the current COVID crisis, we expect to be down for the year as business is closed and employers
reduce payroll associated in driving group attrition. At this early stage, I can't tell you what that will be.
Again, I will say we'll continue with our pricing discipline and remain focused on delivering the unique

value proposition for both our customers and consumers. We do expect to see, as you noted, increases
in Medicaid and our individual products to ultimately offset some of the losses we experienced in the
commercial group business.

Steven James Valiquette
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Just one quick confirmation question. Just on that $2 billion of accelerated payments to care
providers, that's certainly commendable and very much appreciated on the receiving end. Just from an
accounting standpoint, does that have any impact on the reported MLR of 81% in 1Q? Or does the timing
not change in your P&L from a cost recognition perspective around...

John F. Rex
Executive VP & CFO

This is John Rex here. No, it didn't have any impact on that.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

It could affect our cash flows in the Q2. That's maybe the way to think about it.

Operator

And next is A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

John, you mentioned in your comments about the slowdown in some recontracting RFPs. And that makes
sense that people can't have face-to-face meetings when they're considering big deals. I assume that
that would impact essentially group sales on the insurance side, the OptumRx selling season and the
OptumInsight selling. Can you just maybe flesh out a little bit more of how big an impact that is, what
you're seeing in those different businesses with respect to large sale activity?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

So A.J., it's Dave. I'm the one who said that. So yes, as this hit, there was a lot of activity in the
commercial markets, let's call it, where folks were trying to get their employees to a safe place, work at
home and kind of reestablish our operations, as you would expect. It isn't as if everything dried up, but
it did slow down a lot. And at least as it relates to the commercial markets, I would expect that that will
come back online here as we get to the other side of COVID-19 or at least for a period of time. Where
I think the other place I'd like maybe to have a commentary on would be with Andrew Witty, if Andrew
might want to talk a little bit about the impact of the COVID-19 on the appetite for health systems and
health plans and others and what their availability has been for business as well.

Andrew Philip Witty
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Thanks very much, Dave. And A.J., thanks for the question. As Dave said, it's a very interesting
situation. I would say pipeline opportunities for Rx and for OptumInsight are very strong, but timings of
meetings obviously disrupted by the COVID crisis, as Dave just referred to. My focus really is just now
on the OptumInsight portfolio and pipeline. We're actually seeing significant engagement and interest,
I'd say actually a step-up, in terms of general interest for innovation of how to start thinking through to
improve health care delivery, how to try and improve their economics as different players in the system
become under pressure. We've seen particularly more and more interest in the John Muir-type deal that
we announced last year, the more comprehensive engaged system.

So timing is unpredictable. We just don't know. But in terms of appropriateness of our offering for
the needs that we're hearing our clients and customers express, we feel very good about that. And I

would also say the team led by Robert Musslewhite at OptumInsight are working super hard in terms of
innovating our offerings in response to some of the new needs that are being expressed by our clients
at this time. So I would say, overall, it feels like continued meaningful opportunities for OptumInsight.
Timing, unpredictable, and we have to wait for a little bit more time to go by before we can be certain of
when some of these things get closed.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Thank you. A.J., so my view is that we'll see a strong demand for Optum's value proposition once we get
to the other side of this situation.

Operator

And the next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I appreciate the commentary about the seasonality in MLR lower in Q2 and then higher in the back half of
the year. Do you guys have any just general thoughts and framework about whenever things do get back
to normal, I know that's still a moving target, but how much of what is deferred actually comes back when
you see disruptions like this? And how long does it take for that deferred volume to actually come back
into the system?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

It would be very difficult for us to project that at this stage, given all the uncertainties that are out there,
Kevin. It's a really great question. It's something that we're going to monitor closely. And I think by the
time we get to the second quarter call, we'll probably have a better view of all that. John, do you have
anything you want to add?

John F. Rex
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I would just add that this situation is just so different than anything we've seen before. When we look
back at prior situations when you've seen a cessation in demand, it's a different event. It's a hurricane.
It's some other event where the system shuts down. And when the system opens up, that demand comes
back quite quickly actually as long as everything is up and operating. But this is one of these times where
we just haven't been through it before either. So in terms of us trying to step out and understand both
when systems are up, open and operating, when comfort levels are there to reengage with systems, are
elements that we certainly haven't experienced yet. And so I wouldn't want to step out and kind of predict
that the past events that we've seen when something like this has occurred are predictive at all of that.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

So it will have a lot to do with whether it comes back in the fall, what the time frames are of wearing off,
whether the elective procedures come back online, at what pace. There's just so many unknowns right
now, Kevin. So I wish we could answer your question more fully, and we hope to be able to provide you
guys more guidance going forward.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

Just wanted to -- first one is more of a clarification. When you're saying guidance is unchanged despite
the moving parts and the metrics moving, is that just at this point you view the COVID impacts to be
offsetting? Or is this just simply we're going to wait to change anything overall? And then my real question
is just on the physician groups. You talked about 2/3 of the payments being capitated. So obviously,
that's a huge help from a liquidity perspective to the providers. But is that 2/3 of the total dollars of the
OptumCare physicians? Or are you talking about just 2/3 of the dollars from UnitedHealthcare to the
OptumCare providers?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

It's across the entire business, Josh.

John F. Rex
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Josh, it's John Rex. So 2/3 of OptumHealth revenues are premium revenues, capitated revenues.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

So obviously, there's -- if there's deferrals of services, their utilization is lower against their capitated
base as an example. So -- and as it relates to the guidance going forward, based upon what we see at
this stage, we're maintaining that guidance. There's really not a whole lot more to be said about it. What
you -- what I think John articulated well would suggest that the elective deferrals to date are offsetting
COVID-19 costs. And what we committed to, to date is to the extent that that drives any imbalances in
terms of, call it, performance or economics across the system, we're committed to rectifying those as
swiftly as possible. Obviously, we have to be thoughtful about how we go about that. But it is -- that's one
of the commitments that we're making today.

John F. Rex
Executive VP & CFO

Josh, clearly, we have a number of surveillance tools that we use in kind of both the data and the direct
communication we have with members, patients, our clinical workers. And all these are going to continue
to inform our response in our forward planning.

Operator

And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I just wanted to clarify and understand the commentary around sort of that, what you just said in terms of
ensuring financial balances are reconciled. Does that mean potentially rebating back this year beyond any
MLR triggers? Or just hoping to understand the context a bit more there.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Yes, it could be. So there's a number of things to take into consideration. There was challenges with
health system funding and liquidity at the beginning. So we put $2 billion to work. There was clearly
homelessness and insecurity issues evolving. So we put a fair amount of dollars to that. There's a
shortage of PPE broadly across the country, including with our own care delivery capacity, so -- and
we remain resolved and committed to making sure that not only our health workforce but the health
workforce broadly stays protected. So not only did we source PPE, but we also focused on generating new
and innovative testing capacities that would resolve PPE use as well as keep broadly the health workforce
safe across the globe.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

So those are all good examples of what I'll characterize as imbalances that occurred throughout. And
obviously, there's the possibility of financial imbalances to occur as well. And so as we think about those,
employers are having to furlough employees. They have no revenues to date. They need and want to
keep people in coverage. And it very well could be that under the circumstances, deferrals of services
outweigh COVID-19 costs. In those situations, not only would there be normal MLR rebate situations,
but we very may well find ourselves in a position where we can provide some additional premium relief
to those clients. It remains to be seen whether or not we are able to do so and to what extent. But it is
something that we're deeply committed to doing.

Operator

Our next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

My question is just thinking about the individual business and your current footprint there. And if we
assume that the economic impacts persist for a period of time and that impacts commercial group
enrollment, just interested in your thinking about potential appetite for reentering the ACA exchange
markets that you had exited. And I guess just given the timing of when you need to submit those filings, I
would assume that that's probably a decision that even though there's a lot of uncertainty right now, you
guys are probably going to have to start thinking about right now. And just interested in how your thought
process is right now on that.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Well, what you can count on is we'll make no snap reactions to this situation in terms of making strategic
decisions about going into markets. But we have given this considerable thought leading up to this crisis
and through it all. Dirk, would you want to comment?

Dirk C. McMahon
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Sure. Thanks, Dave. Yes, we began to look at participating in more exchanges prior to the COVID-19
crisis. And so -- but we're still in the process of going through it market-by-market, evaluating the relative
efficiency of our network, our ability to compete and states where we would like to extend Medicaid. To
be honest with you, we'll have a more hardened view of our individual exchange intentions on the second
quarter earnings call.

Operator

And we'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So one follow-up question and a real question. So first of all, I understood obviously that it's very difficult
to predict now the -- when procedures are going to come back. But when you think about the capacity
of the system to catch up on elective procedures, if we're going to see things coming back in the fall or
this is just kind of like a 2Q phenomena, how much capacity is there to catch up by end of year versus
what might spill over to second quarter? And the follow-up question was on the pricing. Your membership
guidance provided in the 4Q assumed some level of mid-year renewals. So any color about pricing from
mid-year in light of all puts and takes of the situation?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Yes. Sure. I'll give the second question to Dirk. The first, we just don't know exactly when elective
deferrals will come online and what the overall capacities are broadly for them to come online, given the

15

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

circumstances. I think you just think about the evolution of this disease, how fast it came on in the United
States, which is where 95% of our revenues are across our company. But think about the evolution of that
and then think about the tail and then the possibility of it coming back or not and the timing of a vaccine
and a number of other things that need to be taken into consideration. They just create an uncertain
future to get specific around things, our ability to respond to questions like you just asked. So I apologize
that we can't. But it's just very difficult for us to give you the responses to those kinds of details. Dirk, do
you want to talk about mid-years?

Dirk C. McMahon
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Well, the -- like you said to begin with, the majority of our member months to start off with are we're
pricing for the -- the majority of our member months for 2021 are going to be priced after September. So
we'll have a little bit better view. Now many of the mid-year renewals have sort of gone out the door. So
that's sort of the scenario we're in.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

And let's say, just say, as it relates to our care delivery practices, we've been evolving our -- the ways in
which we provide care and ensuring that our chronic members, who have also deferred treatment, that
they have the option to get treatment through these Telehealth capacities, the way in which we're working
on OptumRx to make sure that they are compliant with their pharmacy solutions and the way in which
Genoa pharmacies are available in community mental health centers and in federally qualified health
centers to ensure that those patients who have high needs are attended to as well. So there's evolutions
that are going on underneath what's happened here to make sure that we're opening up capacities in new
and different ways.

And then the only other thing I would just say is that when we get to the other side of COVID-19, our
operations are all standing ready to respond to the demand that might be there. So our ambulatory
surgical care centers will be available immediately to respond to the demands, the pent-up demands that
will exist for joint replacements and the number of other things that they do so well. So part of what we're
doing is making sure that when we get to the other side, we're ready. And not only ready to respond to
the immediate demands, but also we're ready to adjust and evolve our business strategies to respond to
the things that we've learned through this crisis.

Operator

And next is Charles Rhyee with Cowen.

Charles Rhyee
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. So I know you guys have been hesitant to put sort of hard numbers around how you expect elective
procedures to sort of rebound back, particularly in the back half of this year. But Johnson & Johnson on
its earnings call yesterday noted that, there's a slide also in their presentation, that elective procedure
volumes to be down about 65%, 80% in the second quarter, the third quarter also down about 40%
with a rebound really above baseline in the coming -- in 4Q, up around 15%. This seems sort of more
conservative in terms of a rebound than you're kind of noting. Maybe you can -- can you kind of give us
some of your thoughts on what's behind your assumptions and -- or your thoughts on how they're looking
at the situation perhaps? And then John, I know you said that this is not like other situations. Obviously,
natural disasters, things bounce back fairly quickly because the demand hasn't really gone away. Is maybe
looking at something like the financial crisis a better proxy than for how we might think about elective
procedures kind of coming back?

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 15, 2020

Sure. Thanks, Charles. So a couple of thoughts, and then I won't opine on anyone else's, any other
company's comments they put out there. But let me just kind of try to give you a few of our comments.
I think one of the very important things to keep in mind in this extremely different situation are the
codependencies and the interplays across a business like us, when you -- in terms of all the things you're
describing. And so when you talk about -- there's a lot we don't know right now, and we're actually not
going to try to make calls on some of those. Keep in mind that there are factors that move differently
in a diverse enterprise like this. Intensity levels, duration of the virus, impacts to also the duration and
intensity of the deferral of elective procedures, so there are factors in there as you go across the range
of options that we consider, the multivariable factors that we look at when considering our outlook, that
interplay. And so that informs kind of how we think about -- how we just think about trying to consider
different ways that things would play out.

Certainly, Dave did mention that, yes, and I mentioned also that we did -- we have seen declines in
procedural volumes. And we saw those starting kind of late in March and those continued into April. But
trying to use some of these other examples, even as you mentioned, the financial crisis as a measure,
from our perspective, aren't necessarily still measures that we think are all that instructive because we
haven't seen a cessation in activity before like this. And the reasons for this cessation in activity are very,
very different and the duration of those also quite different. So I don't know that I'd even go to that one
as kind of as the instructive measure for us.

Operator

And we'll go next to Dave Windley with Jefferies.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wondered -- my question is on capital deployment. I wondered if you might comment on how the crisis is
impacting your thinking around that with maybe 2 opposing specific thoughts, one being your comments
around conservation of liquidity at the corporate level, but then also the thought around, say, larger health
systems being more capable of responding to a crisis like this and the strain on some providers perhaps
presenting some consolidation opportunities. So wondering if you might comment on capital deployment.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

John?

John F. Rex
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So I think our long-term capital deployment strategies remain our long-term capital deployment
strategies absolutely in terms of how we think about allocation of our capital into our businesses, into new
organic growth opportunities, M&A opportunities and as we think about things like dividend and share
repurchase also. Clearly, you saw we responded. We were in a fortunate position of being able to respond
to what we saw as the -- some instability in the financial markets in March by increasing our cash position
in order to fortify that and in part, kind of given the role that we play in being reliable partners for the
broad health care delivery community. And so that part being important.

You can be sure that as we think about things in kind of the very near term, we're respectful of markets,
that is financial markets and how they're behaving. And we'll continue to be respectful of those and
understand kind of that they are functioning and functioning fluidly as we consider those elements.
And that may impact timing of how we think about different capital allocation activities. We're going
to be super respectful of that because of the important role that we play in the health system and our
obligations to be -- provide health security for the people we serve and to be ready and able and reliable
partners for the health care delivery community broadly.

My comments would be that this is an exceptionally well-capitalized company. It's been maintained with
the -- the capital structure has been maintained very consistently with high integrity. And I think it's one
of the strengths of an organization going into this situation to have the capital structure that we have
today and the financial backing broadly.

Next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes. And I appreciate all that you guys are doing. I thought it was a great job outlining the number
of things that you're contributing to the system. I just want to ask a couple of questions really more
OptumHealth, OptumCare-related. And it's just one variant of the same question. But for right now, can
you describe how you're standing up Telehealth enablement and virtual care delivery within the services?

And then as you -- before you get to the kind of post COVID, as you're thinking about that transition
period, as you're ramping back -- as the economy is ramping back into service, have you guys come up
with perhaps how you will scale back, meaning are you going to be doing temperatures, mask for patients,
things like that, to try to get a sense of how quickly you can start to ramp back in the ASC business and
some of the other physician businesses?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Lance, and appreciate your comments about the company's performance during this
time frame. Dr. Wyatt Decker?

Wyatt W. Decker
Chief Executive Officer of OptumHealth

Yes. Thank you, Lance, for your question. And on the digital health and telemedicine side, we have both
our internal capabilities, which we're leveraging extensively, including our telepsychiatry that's the nation's
largest telepsychiatry platform. We're also working with partners, collaborators and vendors and have over
half a dozen national partners who are assisting us to stand up solutions quickly. I would also add that
we believe that telemedicine is not all created equal. And we're very focused on keeping the personal and
intimate nature of health care alive and well.

One of the ways we're doing that is by making sure, whenever possible, that our OptumCare patients can
reach out to their already established provider using telemedicine, which is a very different experience
than a random or unknown provider as an example. So we'll continue to leverage this. We're also
leveraging the Internet of Things, caring for people in their home and AI-enabled symptom checkers as
other examples of how we're really dramatically accelerating our digital health solutions.

And then to your second part of your question around the other side of this and how do we adapt.
Obviously, that's something that is evolving. We will, of course, work, and have been, work hand in
glove with local, state and federal recommendations and authorities on, one, is it safe to resume elective
and scheduled care and procedures? We will -- also as Dave mentioned, are taking great care of our
health care workforce so that they are able to resume activities really quickly, which we expect to be a
differentiator.

And then the final thing I'd say is that when you look at OptumHealth, one of the remarkable things is
what a resilient and diversified health care business it is. So we're in 43 states. We have ambulatory care
surgical centers. We have primary care. We have specialty care. And because the COVID epidemic --
pandemic is playing out differently across the United States, we feel we're really well positioned and have
been able to keep our workforce busy, contributing to the communities they serve while we adapt to this
changing environment. Thank you.

And one of the things we did was, as part of all this, we created a -- leveraging that swabbing testing
capabilities, so it allows for self-administration in a clinical setting. We also alongside that, developed a
new set of testing protocols, procedures and applied technologies for the health workforce. And part of
it was to ensure that that workforce is safe to apply their services, but also that we were able to ensure
that they were as fully available as possible, which I know is on the top of minds for each and every one
of them. So that technology, those protocols, that process that was developed likely finds its way not only
into a clinical setting but also could find its way into other essential business settings as well as a normal
course of business going forward. So we could see applying those types of concepts across OptumCare but
frankly across the industry.

You've had a lot of success with engaging physicians to taking risk. And I'm just curious, how do you think
this long-term impact of the pandemic will affect the interest from physicians in participating in the risk
model?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

I think as it relates to this one, at least so far, they probably have performed just fine. Obviously, it will
remind a number of them about how important it is to align with certain partners that have a strong
financial standing. And I would characterize UnitedHealth Group, in particular Optum and OptumCare, as
being those kinds of entities. So I hope what they do is they seek a greater sense of alignment towards --
with partners or choose their partners based upon the strength of them in multiple different dimensions.
And I think Wyatt has done a great job of building that business in a multidimensional way with a great
number of strengths. So hopefully, we'll see greater alignment to UnitedHealth Group.

Thank you for your question, and thank you all for your time and your questions today. As we've shared
with you, we're going to continue to apply the full breadth of our resources, technologies, innovations and
compassion to support our members, our patients, provider partners, our team and the broader health
system as we see our way through this global health crisis together. Please be safe, each and every one of
