ONEOK, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 ONEOK Earnings Call. Today's conference is being
recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir.

Andrew J. Ziola
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Affairs

Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to ONEOK's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings
Call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those
materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. During
the Q&A session, we would appreciate it if you limit yourself to one question and one clarifying follow up,
so we could fit in as many of you as we can.

A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions
should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the
Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-
looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our
SEC filings.

Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your
continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer
and Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer.

Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids;
and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.

I'd like to start by commending our employees for continuing to operate safely and responsibly and
remaining focused on providing excellent customer service in a challenging environment. In recent weeks,
we've seen cases of COVID-19 increase across the country. And in response, we've asked employees
who are able to continue working virtually. For those critical employees who are reporting in person to
operating sites, we continue to ensure that enhanced safety protocols are in place for their safety and for
the safety of their families and communities.

Second quarter results were interrupted by the pandemic's effect on worldwide crude oil demand,
extensive production curtailments across our operations and low commodity prices. After bottoming out
in May and June, volume trends across our operating areas have sharply increased in recent weeks as
customers have started to bring production back online with the recent stability in commodity prices,
providing positive momentum as we enter the second half of 2020.

As a matter of fact, many of our facilities during July have returned to pre-COVID levels. For example,
our July average total NGL raw feed volumes are exceeding first quarter average NGL volumes, benefiting
from higher propane plus volumes in the Permian Basin and increased ethane recovery in the Mid-
Continent. Williston Basin volumes have also strengthened significantly off the lows experienced in May.

The earnings impact we saw in the second quarter reflects significant production curtailments in the
Williston Basin, where our earnings on a per unit of throughput are some of the highest due to the broad
level of services we provide our customers. As curtailed volumes recover to more normalized levels, so
too will our earnings. While volume trends are greatly improving, there remains continued global demand

uncertainty due to COVID-19. We expect 2020 earnings to be at the low end of our previously provided
outlook ranges, which Walt will discuss shortly.

Despite these challenges, we continue to deliver value to our investors through the prudent management
of our large, strategic and integrated assets located in the most prolific NGL rich basins in the U.S. These
assets are supported by strong, stable customer base and growing demand for the products we deliver.
There have been many reports written on the possible implications of a DAPL shutdown for ONEOK. So
I'll get right to it. Many producers in the region are developing contingency plans to address their oil
transportation needs. While DAPL does currently provide meaningful crude takeaway capacity from the
region, there are alternatives through other pipelines and substantial rail capacity. It wasn't long ago that
nearly 800,000 barrels per day of crude were leaving the basin on rail.

Specific to ONEOK, we estimate 30% to 40% of DAPL crude oil volume is from the producers whose
gas volumes are dedicated to our gathering and processing business in the Williston Basin, and about
half of those volumes have alternate methods of crude transportation currently available. This means
that approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of the nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day currently
connected to our system is associated with crude oil production that may not have an immediate
alternative takeaway option. From the constant conversations we have with our producer customers in the
basin, they remain committed to finding solutions to takeaway constraints.

In our view, any impact from a DAPL shutdown would mostly impact 2021, providing some time for more
solutions to develop. Even in an extended shutdown scenario, we estimate our 2021 Williston Basin
natural gas processing volumes could approach our first quarter 2020 average of more than 1.1 billion
cubic feet per day due to curtailed volumes returning, the capture of flared gas and the completion of
drilled but uncompleted wells. Kevin will provide some additional data points during his remarks.

At the beginning of 2020, we had all the assets in place to produce annual EBITDA of more than $3
billion. Our extensive infrastructure that now has substantial available capacity is still there, providing
significant operating leverage to the upside and no additional capital spending is needed to realize that
earnings potential. As it relates to our dividend, with our business improving and volume strengthening,
we don't see the need to take action on the dividend. We do recognize that it is a lever we could pull if our
deleveraging expectations are not being met.

Financially, we've taken the proactive steps to provide ample liquidity and protect our investment-grade
credit ratings during the pandemic, while continuing to return long-term value to our shareholders.

Our employees and management team are doing an excellent job in unusual conditions, and I have
tremendous confidence in them to see us through to the other side of this downturn. They've found ways
to successfully navigate industry challenges before, and they will again.

With that, I will turn the call over to Walt.

Walter S. Hulse
CFO, Treasurer and Executive VP of Strategic Planning & Corporate Affairs

Thank you, Terry. Instead of a typical run-through of our quarterly financial performance, which was
well detailed in yesterday's news release, I'll walk through a few of the strategic financial decisions we
made during the second quarter and how those have positioned us for the remainder of the year. We
completed 2 proactive capital market transactions, raising capital of more than $2.4 billion during the
second quarter, providing us additional liquidity and balance sheet flexibility in a still uncertain market
environment. In May, we completed a $1.5 billion senior notes offering and used the proceeds -- a portion
of the proceeds to repay the remaining $1.25 billion of our term loan agreement, which was maturing in
2021. And in June, we completed a public offering of common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $937
million. Both of these transactions were undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet and provide a clear
and accelerated path towards our deleveraging goals. We still intend to manage our leverage below 4x as
business strengthens to pre-COVID levels and to maintain 3.5x as our long-term aspirational goal.

ONEOK, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Both transactions were successful in that respect. As we sit today, we have ample liquidity and balance
sheet strength and flexibility. We ended the second quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5
billion credit facility and more than $945 million of cash.

Interest expense increased in the second quarter, primarily due to the settlement of interest rate hedges
related to the early repayment of our term loan, resulting in a onetime impact to earnings per share of
$0.09 in the second quarter.

With yesterday's earnings announcement, we said we expect 2020 net income and adjusted EBITDA
results to be at the low end of our previously provided outlook ranges. As we return to volumes achieved
during the early March 2020, we expect our earnings run rate to be in line with our previous expectations
and to provide a continued path to deleveraging. We also expect total capital expenditures, including
maintenance capital to range from approximately $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2020.

Total annual capital expenditures, including maintenance and growth of $300 million to $400 million will be
maintained until producer activity levels provide visibility to volume growth warranting expanded capacity.
But we remain flexible with the ability to scale capital back up quickly as our customers' needs evolve.

Last week, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized
basis. We continue to look for cost efficiencies across our operations. So far this year, we have
implemented measures across our systems, including optimizing assets, power savings and discretionary
spending reductions, totaling approximately $50 million. We expect additional cost-saving measures in the
second half of the year to result in total 2020 savings of approximately $120 million compared with our
2020 plan.

I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations.

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Thank you, Walt. The backdrop we're seeing related to activity and volumes across our system has greatly
improved since second quarter lows in May and June. Our recent conversations with producers have been
focused on bringing wells back online, resulting in increasing volumes on our system, and in some cases,
producers are beginning to add completion crews and/or rigs. Comparing our lowest average total monthly
volume levels in the second quarter with our highest volumes reached so far in July, we've seen increases
of more than 25% in NGL raw feed throughput volume and 20% in natural gas processed volumes.

Our natural gas pipelines segment continues to provide stable fee-based earnings with firm, contracted
capacity, totaling nearly 95%. The importance of this segment's stable and predictable earnings is
highlighted during times of market uncertainty and underscores the strong demand for natural gas we
continue to see from our customers, including electric generation facilities, utilities and industrial markets.

Now let's take a closer look at the current activity across our operations. In the Rockies region, we've
seen a sharp increase in volumes in July, as Terry mentioned. Total NGL raw feed throughput volume
from the region has reached more than 200,000 barrels per day in July, a nearly 50% increase from May
lows. Natural gas volumes processed in the region have reached 945 million cubic feet per day in July and
nearly 35% increase from June lows. There are approximately 10 rigs currently operating in the basin with
about half on our dedicated acreage. Drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin totaled more than 950,
with approximately 400 on our dedicated acreage. Our customers in the basin are some of the most well-
capitalized producers in the industry and have communicated they are positioned to resume activity as
commodity prices and the demand outlook improves. We are frequently asked what price it would take for
producers to bring rigs back to the basin. But the important point right now is the price it takes to bring
curtailed wells back online. We believe that if current market conditions sustain, the remaining curtailed
production will come back online during the third quarter 2020.

In the Williston Basin, we had approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas connected to our
system in March, which includes volume that had been captured on our system and volumes being flared.
The latest data shows 220 million cubic feet per day was still flaring in the basin with 125 million of that
on ONEOK's dedicated acreage, which provides a continued volume uplift opportunity for us in 2020. Our

ONEOK, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

completed infrastructure is in place to capture this volume, and no new drilling activity is needed to reach
our pre-COVID volume levels.

We are on track to complete the extension of our Bakken NGL Pipeline in September of this year, earlier
than our previous target date of the fourth quarter. This new lateral will connect with an expanding third-
party plant and will provide NGL takeaway in an area of Williams County, which has historically had limited
NGL transportation options. We expect the lateral will provide additional NGL volume to our system as we
exit 2020, and it includes a minimum volume commitment.

During the second quarter, curtailments varied greatly across our producers. Some curtailed nearly 100%
of their production and some curtailed virtually none. The percent of proceeds and fee components also
vary across our customer contracts. Curtailments on large producer contracts with higher fee and lower
POP components were the primary contributor to our lower average fee rate. Another factor was that
we experienced greater curtailments in our higher fee Rockies region compared with our lower fee Mid-
Continent region. Given what we see today, with curtailed volumes continuing to return, we expect the
average fee rate for the gathering and processing segment to reach pre-COVID levels of approximately
$0.90 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter 2020.

In the Mid-Continent region, second quarter average NGL raw feed throughput volumes of 521,000 barrels
per day increased compared with the first quarter 2020, and volumes from this region have reached over
600,000 barrels per day in July, a 15% increase compared with the second quarter 2020 average. Ethane
volumes in the Mid-Continent averaged 260,000 barrels per day in June 2020 compared with the second
quarter 2020 average of 210,000 barrels per day, a more than 20% increase driven by nearly all our Mid-
Continent plant connections, entering recovery during the quarter. We expect ethane recovery on our
system to continue through the remainder of the year due to strong pet chem demand and favorable
ethane extraction economics.

In the Permian Basin, the connection of 2 new third-party processing plants in the first half of 2020, and
the full completion of our 80,000 barrel per day West Texas LPG pipeline expansion in June, position us
well for future growth from the basin. With the expansion complete, we will continue to transition volumes
away from third-party offloads on to West Texas LPG. We are currently offloading 25,000 barrels per day,
which will provide full transportation and fractionation revenue when they move on to our system in the
future.

Terry, that concludes my remarks.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Kevin. With a challenging quarter behind us, there are opportunities ahead. What we've seen
proven time and time again is that producers in the midstream industry are resilient, innovative and able
to find solutions when market conditions are tough. We saw in 2015 and 2016, when producers were able
to drive significant efficiencies in their drilling programs. And again, in 2018, when the midstream industry
worked together to add Gulf Coast fractionation capacity.

From the ONEOK perspective, our management team will continue to be proactive and innovative in
how we can become even more efficient. We remain focused on creating value for our stakeholders and
continue to prioritize the long-term sustainability of our businesses. The events of 2020 have certainly
been disruptive, but have not distracted us from focusing on the right things. I am proud of the resilience
and focus with which our employees have approached the last several months in keeping our employees
and assets safe, and I am inspired by the way our employees and the company are navigating important
social issues within our communities with compassion, understanding, empathy and generosity.

We will provide more detail on these important issues and many others in our upcoming environmental,
social and governance report, which will be available on our website in the coming weeks. This report is
particularly important in times like these, when staying focused on the right things is more important than
ever. The report includes expanded disclosures in each of the ESG categories and will mark an adoption
of the SASB sustainability reporting standards. While ESG reporting isn't new to us, this report will be our

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Charles W Barber
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Charlie. I appreciate all the color in the opening remarks. Just as you noted with your updated
guidance reflecting potential DAPL headwinds there, curious if it also takes into account the high plains
pipe that could be shut? And also secondly, I was curious, should a DAPL shutdown commence, can you
address the possibility to temporarily repurpose an NGL pipeline to crude service, if that would make
sense and kind of what the puts and takes of that would be?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Jeremy (sic) [ Charlie ], this is Kevin. The first question, as far as a DAPL shutdown, we really don't
see much impact at all to 2020. As we said, we see that more as a 2021 issue. As curtailed production
comes back, we believe there will be enough other pipeline capacity in rail transportation to handle the
volumes that are currently being curtailed. And as it relates to the second question, yes, we physically
could convert the smaller Bakken NGL Pipeline into crude service. We're evaluating that and looking at all
of our options and watching that closely. And -- but yes, that is something that's physically possible.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then looking at kind of at second half guidance here and trying to parse one half to the second
half, how should we kind of think about Rockies and Mid-Con well connects relative to the first half given
the sort of rig count and pricing environment we're in? And then maybe secondly, specific to G&P, what
sort of pricing assumptions go into -- to point you towards what you gave us on guidance? Maybe you said
differently that $30 million decline you saw related to the POP exposure contracts, would you expect that
to reverse in the back half of this year?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Yes. There's a couple of questions in there. I'll answer your last one first. I mean, yes, we -- like we
said, we do believe that if we see this environment sustain, you'll see that, that fee rate improve. And
obviously, that's going to help on the POP side if you get price -- some pricing strength as well. And what
was the first -- your first question in that second grouping?

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's about well connects in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half, just given what we're
seeing on the rig count side and the price environment.

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Yes. We are seeing -- I mean we -- again, the 2020 numbers really aren't dependent on well connects
as far as new rigs and things like that. That's more, again, of a 2021 impact. We -- again, recent
conversations with producers, we are -- they are having conversations in this environment about
completing DUCs, potentially bringing completion crews back. So we don't have -- it's not like we've got
rig counts go into 40 in the next 2 months or something.

Chuck, do you have anything to add to that?

ONEOK, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Yes. I mean, what I had to tell you is based on producer discussions, as Kevin mentioned, what we see
on the drill schedules that are provided by our producers to us, DUCs are currently being completed here
in Q3. As Kevin mentioned, we've also got some line of sight to Q4 with additional completions. And what
producers have told us is they want to complete these wells before winter in anticipation of more demand.
And in addition to that, some of our larger producers have indicated to us that they're going to run 1
to 2 rig programs through the remainder of the year on our acreage. So we've got some line of sight to
increase DUC completions as well as increased well connects forthcoming. So hope that gives you little
more color.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust.

Tristan James Richardson
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just appreciate all your commentary on sort of the new range for EBITDA. But I guess just thinking about
higher LPG prices and the volume improvement you've talked about in July as well as C2 recovery and
enhanced well completions. Does these dynamics all add up to really support a run rate EBITDA as we
look towards the end of this year, somewhere much closer to the high end of that range of outcome you
provided last quarter, namely the $3 billion type of EBITDA range?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Yes. This is Kevin again. And yes, I do think it supports that. If you think about where we were, not
necessarily first quarter average, but you think about where our volumes were right as we entered into the
COVID and the OPEC situation, those types of volume levels was what supported that kind of the upper
end of that range that we talked about. So as we get the curtailed production to come back online, and I
think a key point in that is those March numbers included substantial gas that was flaring. As -- since that
time, we put additional infrastructure in place, and as the volumes come back, we would expect the flaring
numbers to go down. So that's why we have the confidence in those numbers. And that's what gets you to
that run rate that we're looking at towards the upper end of the range.

Tristan James Richardson
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then what -- I think you've spoken in the past on the 2021 CapEx opportunity being just
generally lower than 2020 or kind of halfway through the year, should we think of the spend opportunity
next year is something sub $1 billion? Or is there kind of a bookend way to think about how's your spend?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

No. I just said in my prepared remarks that we would be in that $300 million to $400 million range for
2021, including maintenance and growth, and we will sustain that level of CapEx as long as producer
activity -- until producer activity is generating growth that we need to expand capacity. As Terry
mentioned, we have all the assets in place to get us back to that EBITDA level north of $3 billion. And
so we're in a great position here where we don't have to jump on the CapEx level until producer activity
warrants that for growth.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ONEOK, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Just maybe I wanted to just start off with the -- with your dividend comment that you made in the
prepared remarks. You had mentioned that it could potentially be a lever down the road and so forth.
When we sort of think about things, you've got a lot of headwinds, obviously, the COVID, potentially the
DAPL, which can impact CapEx for the basin for your producer customers. I was wondering if you can
give us the case studies or scenarios as to how you think about the dividend either being maintained
or potentially being reduced? Is the $2.6 billion guidance range for this year enough to maintain the
dividend? What levels are you thinking about would become an area where you would become concerned?
Is it a $2.4 billion run rate? How much does S&P rereviewing your rating matter? Just wondering if you
could sort of give us different paths and different outcomes as to how you're thinking and would be
recommending the dividend to the Board?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

So Shneur, this is Terry. So I'll just make a comment and then Walt can follow up. As we think about 2021,
I think this gets to the core of your question is how do we think about this business going forward? And
we've looked at a number of scenarios, and the key variable -- a key variable, of course, is DAPL, what
happens is the key question. So is DAPL going to be shut down? Or is it going to continue to operate? As
we think about that scenario and we think about 2021, and even with the DAPL shutdown, we could see
mid-to-high single-digit growth in EBITDA over what we've experienced in '20 -- or expect in 2020. So
in 2021, we could see that mid-to-high single digit. If we're fortunate and DAPL doesn't become an issue
for 2021, we could see 12% to 15% EBITDA growth over what we experienced or expect in 2020. So in
both of those scenarios, we don't see a need to have to take a dividend action. And as Walt indicated,
capital spending would be a very, very modest, $300 million to $400 million range. So given that outlook,
certainly, we don't think it's appropriate to take any action at this point in time. Walt, anything to add to
that?

Walter S. Hulse
CFO, Treasurer and Executive VP of Strategic Planning & Corporate Affairs

No. Just to top up, we obviously stay in touch with the rating agencies. They saw that the action that
we took with the equity was a proactive step to accelerate deleveraging from what it would have been if
we had not done that, and we're very focused on that credit rating. And -- but we're pleased to see the
strength that we're seeing in the -- from the producer activity, bringing curtailed volumes back on and the
trend that that's showing us at this point in time.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

I think that -- Shneur, the only thing I would -- Shneur, the only thing I would emphasize, and we said
it a couple of times in our opening remarks that if this 1.5 Bcf a day, particularly in the Williston Basin,
that deliverability is connected to our system and doesn't really depend on a whole bunch of rigs coming
back into the basin. As we think about 2021, the -- our growth, that is our throughput growth on our
G&P business is a function of capturing and accelerating that capture of that 1.5 Bcf a day. So you think
about this first quarter 2020 volume of about 1.1 Bcf a day in the Bakken. As you think about 2021, that
number, we expect to grow as we move throughout the year, and it's a function of capturing that 1.5 Bcf a
day of deliverability that's already there. That's a point we can't emphasize enough today.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Well, I really appreciate that. A better answer than I expected. Maybe it's a good way to transition. You've
answered this a little bit in the prior questions to some of the questions you've received in the prepared
remarks, but when we think about the drivers for a strong second half recovery, and as we sort of think
about '21, as you just talked about, if I remember, and I'm dating myself a little bit here back at the 13,
14, 15 cycle Bakken you did something in the neighborhood of like 200 rigs. In the most recent cycle, the
Bakken you did 50 rigs, and we could see growth. Do you see that trend on efficiency continuing and that
maybe we're zeroing in on the wrong type of rig count for the Bakken to be able to generate enough DUCs

for you to be able to maintain and potentially grow production? Could we see something where 30 is really
the more normal run rate that can sort of run a 1.4 million, 1.5 million barrel type market. Just kind of
wondering on what you're seeing in terms of thoughts on efficiencies and how things are moving around?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Shneur, this is Kevin. I'll start. You're a little muddy. And so make sure -- if I don't answer your question,
make sure you jump back in here. Yes, I mean, we continue to -- the reserves have been fantastic in the
Bakken. Producers have been year-over-year delivered better and better wells. The rigs have gotten more
and more efficient. So they continually had shown they can deliver more volumes with less capital, is what
that ultimately goes to. So I think that's part of the story that over time you won't need as many wells
or completions to keep your volumes at certain levels. I think we've talked about that in that 1.4 to 1.5
type range of Bcf a day of volume, you're probably in the 30 to 40 completions per month on our acreage.
And we think that's absolutely doable. And -- but we do believe the quality of the wells will continue to
improve.

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Kevin, I would add another data point.

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Go ahead, Chuck.

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Another data point I'd add, Shneur, is we work closely with all of our producers, and a couple of them have
been in the past 6 months or so, I wouldn't say experimenting, but working with longer laterals as long as
3 miles. And based on the results of this, we're being told that less wells will be needed for the increased
deliverability that they're seeing due to the longer laterals. So for that part of your question regarding
continued either technological enhancements or efficiencies, I would say the producers didn't dial anything
back, and we're really seeing some good results from some of these folks with a much longer laterals now.

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

And Shneur, one last thing on this topic, and I apologize, I should have brought this up sooner because
we haven't mentioned it in our remarks either. Just to remind everybody, the gas to oil ratios continue
to strengthen. So as you look at crude oil forecast, then you've got to apply the strengthening gas to oil
ratios. And you can see some of the materials we've provided on the presentation that shows that -- what
that's done over time. And it's continued to strengthen to where now it's north of 2.2. So that's another
factor when you look at the basin of what's going on, on the gas side, don't just focus on what's going on,
on the crude oil side.

We'll take our next question from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

Colton Westbrooke Bean
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

Appreciate the comments there around some of the green shoots of activity and how you might return to
those marked levels. I think as we look at getting back to the 1.5 Bcf a day, understandably, reversal of
shut-ins is a large component of that. But I think the other key piece that the market is struggling with is
what base declines look like. And so can you update us on how the wells that you have still connected to
your system producing over the last couple of months, how those have fared?

Chuck, do you want to take that?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Yes. This is Chuck. Could you repeat the last part of your question, I didn't quite hear, decline -- from the
decline on?

Colton Westbrooke Bean
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Chuck, I think in terms of understanding what level of completions we might need to see to get back
to something that looks like a more stable throughput rates and then ultimately growth. I think the base
decline has been debated. So just on there, interested to see if you guys have a view on what a TGP
profile might look across your system?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Yes. So similar to other shale plays, what we see typically or what we run in our models in year 1, 50%,
55% decline rate; year 2, in the 20% to 25%; year 3, 15% and then just maintain and step down from
there. So your first year is, obviously, as you know, is your large decline in a shale play. So we run that at
50%, 55% range.

Colton Westbrooke Bean
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And so you all feel comfortable that 30 to 40 completions in 1 could be sufficient to fully offset that
base?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

We do.

Colton Westbrooke Bean
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division

And then on the flaring side of things, I think we've heard from producers that the wells that we're flaring
were preferentially shut-in. So if you look at that 125 million that's being flared on ONEOK acreage today,
would you expect that to increase as you bring wells back online? Or alternatively, have you still been
connecting to wells that are actually shut-in today to accelerate that gas capture?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Yes. What we've done here in the second quarter to help with the flaring, you won't really see that until
third -- we expect to see that -- the results here in the third quarter relative to our flaring percentages as
we've completed some pretty good-sized trunk lines into an area here for it's been very, very limited and
being able to get gas egress. So put a couple of 20-inch trunk lines completed and tied in wells that had
been flaring as well as some new wells that we're getting ready to come on. So some of our infrastructure,
obviously, is going to help on that 125 million a day.

One question I wanted to ask was just about ethane recovery. Can you talk about -- I'm assuming you're
not seeing much increase in the Bakken, but I really want to talk about that. And also, to the extent you
are seeing increased recoveries in the Mid-Con, how that's trending? And any way to quantify that?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

Michael, this is Sheridan. You are correct out of Bakken, where any recoveries are not improving out
of the economics. At this time, don't warrant that. But we have, as we mentioned, seen good ethane
recovery, increases in the Mid-Continent. And what I'd tell you today is that in June and July, the average
percentage of ethane in our y-grade is 45%. We are up over 60,000 barrels a day more ethane in the Mid-
Continent than we were in the first quarter and over 50,000, what we experienced in the second quarter.
That's for June, and July has continued on that. So I think we, as mentioned in our remarks, all the ethane
or substantially all the ethane that's in the Mid-Continent that can come out, is coming out at this time.
And we do predict that to continue through the rest of the year.

Michael Jacob Blum
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then a somewhat related question. There have been a lot of discussion about the gas dynamics
in the Bakken given the Btu issues. Obviously -- that's obviously changed a bit. But just curious of your
views if you think any of the proposed expansions, including, obviously, northern border, are any of those
still in play? Or do you think that whole expansion discussion's kind of shelved here for a while until
Bakken levels recover?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Michael, this is Chuck. I would say -- we answered a similar question in Q1. And at the time, again,
with things in flux and trying to forecast, we kind of -- as far as we were experiencing or working
on expansions, kind of pushed that out a little bit. I think it's fair to say that an expansion should be
forthcoming, just can't tell you when. I would say it is pushed out probably 12 months anyway. We just
need better line of sight on some longer-term forecast, but I think an expansion will definitely be needed
in time.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Great. And then just a quick one. What's the latest estimate of when you would be a federal cash
taxpayer?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Well, nothing's really changed from the tax standpoint, other than the fact that, obviously, the rate of
our EBITDA is going to be lower than we had expected in 2020. So if anything, it's moved out a little bit
because the assets that we ultimately will complete in Bear Creek 2 and MB-5 down the road when growth
is back and those are needed, will mean that, that depreciation will come at a later date, and we'll be able
to just optimize the timing of that. So we don't expect to be a meaningful taxpayer yet still for several
years. And eventually, we'll get into a situation where there are some limitations that are currently out
there on the utilization of NOLs, but it's still a few years down the road.

We'll take our next question from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.

Sunil K. Sibal
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Walter S. Hulse
CFO, Treasurer and Executive VP of Strategic Planning & Corporate Affairs

Yes, yes. Yes, we can hear you.

Sunil K. Sibal
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

I just had one follow-up question on the leverage metrics. In the press release yesterday, you had
indicated a covenant-based deleverage tracking at 4.5x. It seems like to me that there is a fair bit of
project EBITDA baked into that based on projects, which did not contribute to EBITDA yet. First, is that
correct? And secondly, when you bake that EBITDA into the covenant metrics, is that based on cash flows,
which are contracted? Or is it more driven by your expectation? And then how frequent is that expectation
kind of revised?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Could you repeat the first part of your question, please?

Sunil K. Sibal
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

So in the press release, you had indicated that the covenant-based leverage was tracking at 4.5x. So
when I look at your debt balances, we're -- which is LTM EBITDA, I come up with a higher number. So I
was just trying to reconcile that disconnect?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Okay. Yes. So in -- the covenant calculation does not track exactly to GAAP. Under the bank's
covenant, there is a provision that allows for an EBITDA assumption associated with CapEx that's come
into -- either come into service or will come into service down the road and that scales down over a period
of time. And so there's a mismatch. There always has been a slight mismatch between the GAAP and the
covenant calculation. And at this point, the covenant calculation is at 4.5x versus the covenant at 5x.

We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Can you comment a little bit about what you're seeing in frac volumes at Belvieu? And I'm kind of going
back a little bit to kind of what's the trend, could you kind of call that data out a little bit about what
you're seeing frac-wise? And are you saying that not having export capacity, especially given LPG exports
have kind of held up relatively strong during the last 3- or 4-month period, that not having a dock capacity
or export capacity actually impact you at the frac level, your volumes relative to maybe what you think or
what you're seeing your competitive peers around fracs and at Belvieu as well?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

We -- right now, because of the way our system is set up, all our fracs can be a Belvieu frac. So when you
look across our system, we have plenty of frac capacity because any of the volume that we frac in the Mid-
Continent with the Sterling system, we can make that volume show up in Mont Belvieu. So right now, as
we look forward, we have plenty of frac capacity through 2020 or until we see a much better improvement
into a producer productivity that we would need to bring MB-5 back on. So we're in pretty good shape on
the frac capacity side. In terms of do we need an export offer, does that impact us on the frac side, it does
not at this time. Right now, there's more export capacity than frac capacity, really. And so we are able to
contract and have contracted a lot of volumes in a short period of time to exporters because they need
that volume to fulfill their commitments across the dock. So at this time, we don't see that it's a hindrance
not to have the dock. Of course, as we look into the future, that's still something on our list that we would
like to look at a period of time when we see more supply come online that would warrant additional dock
capacity. But at this time, we do not see it as a hindrance or as a competitive disadvantage to us.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

No, that's super helpful. Can you just talk a little bit about what you think the utilization rate in the
quarter was for your fracs and how July is looking?

Could you repeat that again?

Walter S. Hulse

Michael, we are having difficulty hearing you.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Guys, could you all talk a little bit about what you think your frac utilization rate was in the quarter? And
what you're seeing in July? I mean, help me with the step up. You kind of gave a lot of detail about what
July looked like across setup, throughput across multiple basins and in gas. I'd love just kind of the same
level of detail on the frac side.

ONEOK, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Right now, we are over 80% on our frac utilization. We've seen a big step-up on that because we brought
more ethane on, and that doesn't -- that capacity has always been there. But we're sitting about 80% --
a little over 80% of our frac utilization will be. And so as we continue to grow into the third quarter, as we
see it, have already seen that volume increase that we talked about in July. We still move up closer to the
-- maybe closer to the 90% -- 85%, 90% and still leaves us plenty of frac capacity.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then one final one, if I may. Terry, will you and the Board kind of evaluate capital allocation?
I know you talked today about not needing to do anything with the dividend. How do you think about the
balance between evaluating the dividend versus evaluating the incremental equity issuances, if needed.
I mean, you kind of have the shelf outstanding for the forward sale agreement. I'm just trying to think
about how you and the Board think about what's the like -- kind of source of equity capital if equity capital
is needed?

Walter S. Hulse
CFO, Treasurer and Executive VP of Strategic Planning & Corporate Affairs

Yes, Mike, there are a couple of different aspects to that. I mean, is it related to deleveraging, any
dividend action that would when considered from a deleveraging standpoint, would have taken quite a bit
of time to actually have an impact here with the equity offering. There was an immediate impact from the
credit standpoint. The other side of that also as well is that as we see the business going forward and that
the COVID is a -- has a defined period of time that it will take the play through, and if there is anybody
who knows exactly what that defined period of time is, that to the extent that it's measured in quarters,
we didn't believe that it got meant that we should be adjusting our dividend for a quarter or 2 or more of
disruptions. So we needed to make a positive step on the deleveraging standpoint. And the quickest way
to do that was to do the equity offering. And then as we see the strength of the business coming back, it
will be there to support that dividend in the long term, we've continued to get on that path.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

And Michael, the only thing I'd add to Walt's comment is that from a priority standpoint, maintaining
investment-grade credit rating is extremely important to the company and important to this Board. So it
remains a high priority. And certainly, that was in the mix in terms of the capital allocation decisions that
we were making.

We'll take our next question from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers.

Craig Shere;Tuohy Brothers;Analyst

It sounds like a wonderful outlook heading into the second half here. That's great clarity. On potentially
repurposing the Bakken NGL Pipeline, how long would that take? And would any concurrent upsizing
needed on Elk Creek be done in the same time frame?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

Craig, this is Sheridan. We're still evaluating all the aspects of that, turning it into crude or if that's
warranted or what needs to be done. So we continue to look through that. So as we continue to evaluate
that more, we'll have a better understanding of what it takes to convert it through.

I don't think it's a couple of years, but it will take some time.

Craig Shere;Tuohy Brothers;Analyst

All right. And, well, I apologize. I guess I'm a little confused about the CapEx guidance. I thought I read
the second half will be an absolute $300 million to $400 million, but then do I understand that ongoing
until there's a lot of -- more clarity on COVID and upstream volume that the annual rate into '21 will be
$300 million to $400 million?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

That's correct, Craig. Yes. As we finish up 2020, we've got things like the north laterals that has the
minimum volume commitments that we're finishing up and wrapping up some of those types of projects.
But as we get into 2021, we'll be able to continue to keep that $300 million to $400 million range,
including maintenance CapEx. And obviously a pickup in volumes would get us above the level that we
had been originally forecasting for 2020. So we've got some significant headroom with there, and we can
obviously prioritize those cash flows as we go in towards our deleveraging goals.

Craig Shere;Tuohy Brothers;Analyst

Very good. And last question on storage and ethane recovery was spoken up a lot on the first quarter call,
I think we already addressed ethane. I know storage is only maybe tens of millions of uplift, but I don't
know, Sheridan, maybe you want to talk about when exactly that might be hitting? I know it's a hedged
position. What should we be looking for into the second half?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

Yes. I think the contango that represented itself or presented itself in the second quarter because of how
we sold that product out for, and we will see that benefit show up in the second half of the year.

Craig Shere;Tuohy Brothers;Analyst

And should that be mostly in the fourth quarter or…

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

It is not only in fourth quarter you'll see that in the IFM unit as well.

Craig Shere;Tuohy Brothers;Analyst

Should we see most of that in the fourth quarter?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

Yes, you could see some of it in the fourth quarter. I mean, we've sold it throughout the third and fourth
quarter. So you could see it through the remainder of the year what's going to happen on the swinging
prices through that period of time, but it will be spread through the second half of the year, our contango
storage flow.

Maybe just a couple of clarification questions. If I heard it right in your -- earlier in the Q&A portion,
referencing kind of a DAPL impact. I believe we referenced that due to the extended shutdown, it would be
sort of a kind of mid-to-single EBITDA growth year-over-year. And if it won't shutdown, it would be 12%
to 15% kind of year-over-year EBITDA growth rate. And is that also the $2.6 billion number for 2020? Just
want to make sure I heard that right.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

That's correct. That's what you base. Those percentages that I provided earlier are based upon the low
end of the range that we provided for 2020. You base it off of that.

Derek Bryant Walker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then I think in the formal remarks, you also referenced some cost efficiencies. Was it
coming from a variety of angles such as optimization to power saving. If you capture $50 million in the
first half of the year and we talk about $120 million I think relative to your 2020 plan. I guess as we start
to see things recover in the second half, we feel most of that cost savings is sustainable or do you see
some of that coming back?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Yes. This is Kevin. Yes, we absolutely believe those cost savings are attainable. I mean, as we move
through the year and we've taken -- our team has done a fantastic job of finding opportunities and some
of those opportunities you identify, but it takes a little bit of time to actually go implement, and we've
been doing that. So we do believe even with the volume strengthening, we'll realize those savings in the
back half of the year.
