CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Centene Corporation First Quarter 2020 Financial Results. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to
Jen Gilligan. Please go ahead.

Jennifer Gilligan
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2020 earnings
results conference call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff
Schwaneke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call,
which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com. A replay will be available shortly after the
call's completion, also at centene.com, or by dialing (877) 344-7529 in the U.S. and Canada, or in other
countries by dialing (412) 317-0088. The playback number for both dial-ins is 10141297.

Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-
looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements
as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-Q
filed today, April 28, and the Form 10-K dated February 18, 2020, and other public SEC filings, including
the risks and uncertainties described with respect to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business
and results of operations. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its
estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some
point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.

The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most
directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2020 press release, which is
available on the company's website at centene.com under the Investors section. Additionally, I'd like to
highlight Centene's upcoming Investor Day scheduled for Friday, June 12, 2020. This will use a virtual
format, and we will provide more information as we get closer to the date. With that, I would like to turn
the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
I'd like to welcome Jennifer to Centene as Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. She
has taken the reins from Ed Kroll, who many of you know so well. We'd like to congratulate Ed on his
retirement and thank him for his impactful contribution over the years. We look forward to celebrating him
in person when gathering together is considered safe.

Let me start by saying, I hope you, your families and loved ones are all staying safe and healthy. Our
hearts go out to all that have been impacted by the crisis. And we are thankful to the essential workers on
the front lines and the family supporting them for fighting the pandemic everyday. We believe we are in a
strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and abundant liquidity. We have always been effective
managers of our balance sheet, which has become more important than ever as it enables us to fund our
priorities as well as respond to the pandemic.

With that, let me start with our response to COVID-19 crisis. Our mission at Centene is clear. We have
to provide accessible, high-quality, affordable health care to our members, some of whom are among
the nation's most vulnerable population. As we are seeing both in public health and an economic crisis
of unprecedented nature and scale unfold, we are acutely aware of the vital role we must play. We have
never been more resolute in serving our members as well as supporting our providers. We will maintain
our approach, which focuses on our members' whole health, which is exceptionally local and provider-led.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Looking at these critical challenges in front of us, our priorities are as follows. First and foremost, is the
health and safety of our employees. We have taken significant steps to support our employees and are
doing everything we can to protect their health and safety while ensuring continuity of our operations.
To this end, we have implemented our business continuity plans and have taken actions to support our
workforce. I am proud that we are able to transition approximately 90% of our workforce to remove --
to work remotely within just 3 days. This allows Centene to continue to operate at close to full capacity
without disruption. I'd like to give a special thanks to the remaining 10%, whose roles are critical and
cannot be performed outside the office.

Second, it is critically important that we safeguard people's access to high-quality health care, especially
the most vulnerable in our society. It is with this in mind that we have taken important steps to support
our members during the pandemic, including cost waivers for both testing and treatment and increased
access to telehealth services. We also announced a series of investments that build on the long-standing
commitment to address broader social determinants of health. We continue to support initiatives that
address hunger, connectivity and increased demand for health care and educational supplies, to name just
a few.

For example, we are donating 1 million meals a month for 12 months to feed our neighbors and
communities all over the country, and delivering 50,000 gift cards to be used to purchase essential health
care and educational items.

And our third priority is to support the organizations and our partners on the front lines. As a result of
our exceptionally local provider-led approach, Centene has long-standing deep relationships across our
provider network. We have initiated a broad range of efforts to support those on the front lines. These
include provision of PPE and facilitation of additional medical personnel across virus hotpots, relaxation of
administrative burdens for physicians and access to financial resources. We will continue to be proactive in
thinking through how we can best contribute as the situation evolves.

To that end, let me touch on how we're thinking through the trajectory of this pandemic. We are preparing
for a range of scenarios relating to the shape, intensity and duration of the pandemic. We are in close
contact with the relevant health authorities, and we are closely tracking the data and organizations such
as the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, the CDC and the World Health Organization are providing
on an ongoing basis. While it is difficult to predict precisely what future weeks or months will bring, we are
prepared for various scenarios, which incorporate a number of key considerations including the potential
for multiple peaks as local federal and state governments balance the need to reopen economies with
the risk of increased viral transmission; and a return to normalization may take some time until we have
widely available testing, effective medications or a safe vaccine.

Next, let me provide a brief overview of our performance in the first quarter.

Overall, we delivered solid results including adjusted diluted EPS of $0.86. First quarter revenues were
$26 billion, representing a 41% increase on the prior year, primarily driven by the acquisition of WellCare.
Organic growth from our marketplace business and the addition of new members through expansion and
new programs across our states. Our managed care membership now stands at $23.8 million including
$11.8 million in our Medicaid business, $2.2 million in Marketplace and $5.4 million across our Medicare
products. As I mentioned, our financial position is robust. We remain focused on ensuring we have the
right capital structure and capital allocation policies in place that ensure we'll continue to effectively
manage through this crisis.

Now on our full year outlook. Our earnings trajectory remains consistent, as you can see from the
unchanged adjusted EPS guidance range. That said, there will be some variability when it comes to how
we get there. We expect our results to be choppy from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, we continue to view
our prior guidance range as the most reliable baseline. Let me offer a few other variables that we continue
to monitor. First, membership. We expect economic impact and resulting unemployment to drive increases
to members. These increases will be partially reversed as and when the economy reaches the recovery
stage.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Second, utilization. There have been and are expected to be continued declines in general types of
deferrable services, for example, dental and optical business. That's mostly in the second quarter. Large
provider groups expect pent-up demand to return early in the third quarter and continue into our fourth
quarter. We expect utilization to increase as restrictions are lifted and members return to more normal
pre-pandemic behavior.

Third, costs related to COVID-19. We expect to see an impact from the cost waivers for COVID-related
testing and treatment during the second quarter, which could continue throughout the balance of the
year. The way this dynamic materializes will be dependent on how the pandemic evolves. We also expect
costs to be significantly greater in the third and fourth quarter as the intensity of utilization rates increase,
especially for members with chronic conditions and other medical needs, which may not have been met
during this period of uncertainty.

Fourth, intensity and duration of the pandemic. Working with leading epidemiologists, we continue to
monitor closely the potential for multiple infection rates. As we prepare for significant levels of seasonality
and choppiness, we continue to work with our state partners and other stakeholders, including regulators,
such as CMS, to establish holistic ways to address these different cost dynamics. We continue to apply
an abundance of conservatism to our outlook. We anticipate an increase in membership but at the same
time, acknowledge the fluid nature of the employment landscape. It is prudent to recognize the various
unknowns this operating environment creates. We will continue to update you as the impact from the
pandemic take shape. If we see developments that materially change our guidance assumptions, we
commit to updating you on those immediately outside our regular calendar.

Turning to WellCare. The integration remains a positive and important aspect of our operations. The team
continues to focus on education and the execution of a seamless transition and delivery of synergies.
While our view of the total run rate opportunity remains unchanged, the current operating environment
could generate some variability in the timing of synergy capture. For example, in Georgia. The time line
to combine the 2 plans has been delayed from 2020 to 2021 by the state. Recognizing the economic
environment and the difficulty of finding new physicians, we are offering extended benefits to those
impacted by the integration of such a daunting time for our nation. Jeff will discuss these dynamics in
further detail.

In closing, our mission has never been more vital. To date, we have taken significant actions to ensure
we serve the most vulnerable during this time of need. We are undergoing rigorous planning processes
and will continue to be guided by the facts as we know them, while remaining flexible in this dynamic
environment. Our organization is united in our focus to deliver for our members, providers, state partners
and shareholders as we face this pandemic together. As noted by our press release, we have raised our
revenue guidance, we continue to make significant progress on the WellCare integration, and our balance
sheet remains very strong.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff, who will provide the financial details.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Let me just start by echoing Michael's comments. I hope you
and your families are all staying safe and healthy. Today, I'd like to keep our discussion of the quarter's
performance relatively brief, and we'll spend more time on our outlook in light of the extraordinary
circumstances we are facing, and provide you with more detail on our expectations for the year.

Overall, it was a good start to the year. We reported first quarter revenues of $26 billion, an increase of
$7.6 billion or 41% over the first quarter of 2019. As a reminder, we also closed the WellCare acquisition
this quarter and completed several other capital structure items that are included in our first quarterly
report as a combined company. The closure of the acquisition and the inclusion of WellCare in the results
beginning January 23 has impacted a lot of the usual metrics.

I'd also refer you to the detailed explanations in our press release. We reported adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.86 compared to $1.39 last year. Both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

earnings per share for the first quarter were negatively affected by approximately $0.05 associated with
lower investment income and higher interest expense. Our investment in other income was $167 million
during the first quarter compared to $99 million last year and $126 million last quarter. The increase over
last year reflects the gain on the divestiture of our Illinois business as well as higher investment balances,
partially offset by the sharp decline in interest rates in March, which negatively affected the fair values
of some of our bond portfolios that flow through earnings and our deferred compensation investment
portfolio, which fluctuates with its underlying investments.

Interest expense was $180 million for the first quarter 2020 compared to $99 million last year and $113
million last quarter. The increase reflects a net increase in borrowings related to the issuance and of an
additional $7 billion in senior notes in December 2019 to finance the cash consideration of the WellCare
acquisition and the $2 billion in senior notes issued in February 2020. We decided to defer the redemption
of the 2022 senior notes as a result of the COVID pandemic to maintain further flexibility.

Operating cash flow used in operations was $240 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was
negatively affected by a delay in premium payment in New York of approximately $700 million and the
growth in the PDP business, which used working capital.

Given that the COVID pandemic did not accelerate in the United States until the second half of March,
we experienced a minimal impact during the quarter in terms of claims. We did experience a significant
drop in dental and vision claims, which was offset by investments in our technology and employee
infrastructure to support a work-from-home environment and a higher COVID costs in our international
operations, primarily in Spain, which was affected much earlier in March.

Turning now to our outlook for 2020. Broadly, we are maintaining our guidance for the bottom line,
demonstrating our ability to navigate this environment. That said, the pandemic has impacted the various
dynamics that affect our business. I want to take a few minutes and highlight the headwinds and tailwinds
of the current environment on the top and bottom line to provide as much transparency as possible in
terms of how we believe these dynamics could potentially play out through the remainder of the year.

First, total revenues. Setting aside the effects of the pandemic, we are increasing our total revenue
guidance by $2 billion at the midpoint. This is driven by an increase in pass-through payments of $1.3
billion and $700 million due to actual membership and premium changes as we exited the first quarter.

Second, as a result of the higher unemployment rate in the U.S., the suspension of eligibility
redeterminations and our product mix, we are increasing our total revenue guidance by an additional
$4 billion at the midpoint, bringing our total guidance increase to $6 billion at the midpoint. We are also
widening our guidance range, reflecting the lack of visibility with regard to the magnitude and duration
of the high unemployment rate in the U.S. We have seen early evidence of membership growth in April
driven primarily by state suspending eligibility redeterminations and special enrollment periods for
Marketplace businesses in some states. However, we are also conscious that some of these trends may
lessen significantly as economic conditions improve. We now expect our total revenues for 2020 to be in
the range of $110 billion to $112 billion.

Next, GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share. There are numerous items that affect the bottom
line, and I'm going to highlight those that are most material. As I just discussed, the additional
membership will be a tailwind to 2020 earnings, particularly in our Medicaid business, although we expect
normalization of enrollment during the second half of the year as the economic recovery progresses.

Next, utilization. While we saw a minor effect of lower utilization on the first quarter's results, we expect
to see a significant impact of shelter-in-place policies on utilization rates during the second quarter. We
also expect a potential reversal of these trends during the second half of the year. While we cannot, at
this stage, predict the exact scale and scope of normalization as this will be highly dependent on where
we will be in the economic recovery at that time, we expect that there will be pent-up demand for medical
services in the back half of the year. We also expect that the deferral of medical services may lead to
higher cost of treatment once members return to seeking medical care as their health issues may have
become more acute.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

In terms of the cost impact of COVID-19 and the waivers for test and treatments, we expect the bulk
of those costs to begin in the second quarter and continue through the second half of the year. We
also expect lower investment income and higher interest expense due to the lower interest rates and
maintaining the 2022 notes. On another note, we expect our Marketplace risk adjustment efforts for 2019
to be lower than our previous expectations as a result of the current environment.

Finally, while we continue to expect to achieve our run rate synergy target of $700 million associated with
the WellCare acquisition, the timing of synergy capture will be affected due to shifting regulatory time
lines and relax provider policies in the current environment. We expect our synergies to be lower than our
previous expectations in year 1. At this point, it is too early to predict the effect on synergies for 2021,
but we continue to drive to the $500 million net synergy target. When you combine all these items, we
continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the same range as our previous guidance.

We have a strong balance sheet and are well positioned to meet our operational and strategic needs from
a liquidity perspective. We have taken proactive measures to strengthen our liquidity even further in this
environment. We had approximately $2 billion of unregulated cash on hand at the end of the first quarter,
and approximately $1.4 billion available on our revolving credit facility, creating almost $3.5 billion of
immediate liquidity. The increase in leverage at quarter end was intentional, driven by the decision to
defer the redemption of our 2022 senior notes. This increased our cash on hand and our debt by $1 billion
each at quarter end, driving our debt-to-capital ratio to 41.9%, excluding our nonrecourse debt.

Our debt-to-capital ratio would be 38.9% when netting our unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end.
In addition, as we highlighted at our earnings guidance call in early March, we utilized $500 million of the
divestiture proceeds to repurchase shares at a weighted average price of $57.66 during the quarter. As we
progress through this year, we will continue to revisit our capital structure and adjust as appropriate.

Overall, we had a good start to the year and have a strong balance sheet and liquidity position for the
environment we are dealing with today.
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. I want to -- I appreciate the EPS bridge that you guys walked through. I would love to get a little
more color, though, about how much of what you're seeing has kind of an impact is going to flow through
into next year. I guess the expectation, if we assume that COVID is -- if we think we're basically back to
normal next year, would you assume how much of that interest headwind is going to persist into next year
versus paying it down the synergy capture? Do you get back to normal a year or 2 achievement? Or does
that -- does everything kind of get pushed back 6 to 12 months? I'd just love to go through those line
items and kind of see which ones are kind of more this year versus maybe have an impact beyond 2020?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Kevin, I'll start off. It's -- I think the biggest issue we have is, we've never seen anything like this before.
We have seen all the models. We -- it's difficult to model when you have no prior experience. And the
biggest issue I see is, for example, unemployment. It could reach as high as 20%. It's right now around
15%. That's a depression level. And the forecast I see, say that in the first quarter, first half of next year,
you're not going to see a normalized return even if they have the vaccine because you're going to have
probably 7%, 9% unemployment.

And so what the various programs are -- so while we would love to be able to say, "This is what it is,"
our planning assumptions have to be to take it quarter-by-quarter. And that's why we thought it's very
important to maintain guidance because we really believe that's achievable. But that's a baseline from
which we can judge. When you have nothing out there, what's the baseline from which you compare and
look at? And so I wish I could say what I think 2021 will be. I'm hoping it will be improved. We don't even
know how many peaks we're going to have this year. We're trying to return to work. We understand that.

I'm giving a long-winded answer. It's the things we talk about. And I work with epidemiologists. And they
keep telling me that the return to work before we have the -- in a massive sort of way, the vaccine, it's
unpredictable where this is going to go. And I think the earliest we hear, hopefully, vaccine sooner, but
first half of next year is probably the earliest we'll see an effective well-tested vaccine. So I guess what
I'm saying is, as we plan through this, we're going to do rolling quarters and try and get a sense as we
look at the models of what unemployment is going to be and what's that mean to our business, what
support the states will be able to provide. I wish I could be more definitive.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

No, that's fair. And then maybe you mentioned the $4 billion of extra revenue. I guess how do you think
about the MLR on that business? I guess the last time, if I remember correctly, there was some pent-up
demand on the new Medicaid enrollment for the first 6 to 9 months. And obviously, on exchanges, you
might get some of that COBRA membership that was high MLR dripping onto the exchanges. How do you
think about the MLR of that new $4 billion?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think the MLR, I mean from the new membership, I think I have to take the approach that it's
fairly normalized. But at the same time, these are people who have just lost their jobs and they may have
had insurance previously. So they may not have a lot of pent-up demand, there may be some. That's
part of the variable we're dealing with. But the biggest issue is when are people returning to work? We

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

-- everybody believes that we -- our visual planning was that the second quarter, we would see reduced
utilization. Now the issue there is, I'm talking to major hospitals; went just right here in St. Louis, WashU,
Barnes and others.

They're doing everything they can to get things back to normal today and get people back in because of
their income and everything is being affected by it. And they don't want people to lose confidence in the
hospitals. So while I thought we may not see anything until July, third quarter, we're now -- we may now
see it well in May and June starting to return, which means it will be a more normalized MLR. So we are
typically -- and Jeff can go into more detail, we are typically booking from historical levels, expecting that
because -- I'll give you one more big variable.

And I've said that was true when we looked at the first quarter. The submission of bills does not have a
normal pattern because the people who deal with the physician and other offices who are working from
home are not doing it. And so -- IBNR lab team, we have the finest. I've had the greatest confidence in
them. It's all predicated on data service to submission of bill. And that's been thrown out of whack and will
be for 12 months until it normalizes. So it's a long-winded answer again, but this is the toughest thing. So
I think the MLRs will normalize, and Jeff can talk about why the increase in Q1, which was anticipated, and
we've talked about it historically. But Jeff, why don't you give a little more color on the MLRs.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I think we highlighted in the press release, obviously, the Q1 MLR and exchange normalization.
Obviously, the addition of WellCare and the blending of the 2 companies. WellCare has a higher HBR in
the first quarter because they don't have a significant Marketplace business. And then obviously, they had
a lot of growth in the PDP business this year, and that's the highest MLR for the PDP businesses in Q1.
We had new markets with the start-up of the LTSS in Pennsylvania, and obviously, Iowa carrying over
from last year. We had leap year, we had the effect of New York rates. So I guess a lot of things that were
driving the MLR in -- on a year-over-year basis higher. Partial part of that was offset by the health insurer
fee, but...

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I think what I'll just add is, I think we've talked to people that recognize our systems and it's allowed us
to be on top of it to the maximum extent possible. And I think we'll -- as we go through the quarters,
we'll be able to give you more color. But that's why I made the statement because it is unusual to do that.
But this is so variable that if we see some trend develop, that we have some confidence and is real and
realistic and material, we're not going to wait until the next earnings call to tell you. We're going to -- we'll
issue the 8-K or whatever, set up a call or whatever, because that's the world we're living in. It requires a
different approach. And you can count on us continue to keep you informed as quickly as we know things.

Operator

Our next question will come from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I just -- as we try to better understand how the patterns of behavior and care have changed, what --
is there anything you can spike out in terms of the care patterns that you're seeing between Medicaid,
commercial Marketplace and Medicaid?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I'm not sure that there's a lot of differences right now. I think everybody is very much focused on the
safety, home, avoiding it. The biggest issue we see right now is delayed services. And I'm very candid,
Matt. What worries me is there is some -- and I'll give you just -- this is anecdotal, but I was talking to the
head of the Pancreatic Cancer at WashU and surgeon. And he was saying how hospitals are not so much

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

and that they're doing surgery where it's emergently necessary. But there are people that are saying, in
other locations, nonspecific, well, we have to do maybe chemo before we do the surgery because of the
surgical suites and things. So the patterns of care are going to be adjusted based on what the availability
is of hospitals and the PPE, et cetera. So it's difficult, and I don't think we can call out a difference in the
various populations because it's -- the pandemic kind of overrides it all.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And maybe just one more on pent-up demand. Some experience, maybe this is anecdotal, suggests that
the delayed care doesn't necessarily flow through -- that maybe more than half of it goes away. I realize
we certainly don't have a precedent for this experience. But I'm just wondering if you could comment on
that.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'll make 2 comments. One, I mean it seems like ER utilization that -- we won't mean when that's
not -- depending on who they are, that's gone, but that's a small percentage of it. It's -- because there's
still people going in the ER because they worry about the pandemic and that type of thing. But I can't say
that other care will not return. In other words, if somebody needs back surgery, they may have delayed
it and be -- do an exercise thing, but it's going to come back. And there's a balance. There may be some
cases that they say, "Well, I'd lived without it, you do without it." But there's some with the intensity and
they're probably more acute. So as you summarize it, we've never lived this way. I always tell people,
experience is a sum of experiences. And nobody's had any experience in this to where they can rely on
anything. So it's you're guess and my guess.

Our next question will come from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

Michael, so first question is just on the headwinds that you spoke about. I'm curious if we could get a little
bit more color on the sizing. And I know it's imperfect, and there's no experience. But even just relative
magnitude of what's biggest versus smallest, et cetera, on the WellCare synergies, on the COVID costs?
And maybe any color on if states are talking about direct reimbursement or to kick payments as we've
done in the past? And then if you could just talk a little bit more about those risk adjustment initiatives.
I'm not sure I fully understood that.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. I'll let Jeff respond. So I'll just talk a little bit -- I'll give you an example of the WellCare synergies.
I mean the state of Georgia is -- because of their capability to do the readiness and everything else, they
delayed the combination of the 2 plans for a year. Fine. We can live with that, and it's -- it doesn't mean
that synergies won't be there, it will just be delayed. Another thing we've done, and I alluded to is, with
the unemployment rate being what it is and individuals who -- where we've done and just through the
sheer combination, we've extended their severance pay and their benefits. You just don't -- that's just the
humanistic side of things. It's not their fault. They are a very capable people. But -- so we've extended
that. And that's a few million dollars here and there. But it's that type of thing. And then Jeff can comment
on the others.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Josh, this is Jeff. Just a couple of quick things. Obviously, we've sized the revenue piece in our
revenue guidance. And you can imagine, as with our income statement, the sizing of the categories is
revenue and cost would be the -- from a dollar perspective, just because they're the largest dollar captions

on the financial statement. So real quick on the risk adjustment initiatives. I mentioned in my prepared
remarks around 2019 risk adjustment.

As you may be aware, usually, in the first half of 2020 or the first half of every year, there's a significant
amount of chart chase effort that goes on. Even though risk adjustment is relative to your competition,
we have data that would indicate that we're disproportionately affected because we do a better job
of capturing codes. And so because of what happened in March, that submission date goes through
May. Because of what happened in March, we think there's going to be an effect there on the 2019 risk
adjustment. And it's kind of hard to size the magnitude at this point. But you can think about it in that
context.

Delay in WellCare synergies. Again, I think we've mentioned in the past that the WellCare transaction was
effectively breakeven without the share repurchase. I think we'd still be at breakeven even if you include
the share repurchase this year. So I think from a transaction perspective, that can give you a relative size
on the synergy shift. And again, we're still trying to capture those synergies. But as Michael mentioned,
there's obviously some regulatory changes that will delay some of that capture.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I think, Josh, I just want to make one other comment. We put in the press release some of the things
that have impacted it, the pluses and minuses. And we didn't put -- we put the one place we've had the
knowledge of, the interest. We put the $0.17 a share. But we wanted to give investors the sense that
these are the things we're watching. And the order of magnitude in this current environment is yet to be
fully determined.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

And then, are the states reimbursing for COVID treatment costs? Are you having discussions? And I
understand you're now in literally dozens and dozens of states, but -- and it's all sort of individual. But are
you getting feedback the states are going to pay for those treatment costs?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean, it's going to be within our premium. It's a -- we have the premium, and we have to look
and see where the whole total, which will see how many of our members actually have the cost. And so if
there's an issue, we'll sit down with the states. But -- and that's going to vary state by state.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

All right. I'm sorry, last one. Just on the $4 billion of higher revenues, not the past or the actual higher
revenues. How much of that is Medicaid versus exchanges in terms of the expected growth?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Josh, I mean, it's hard to bifurcate. I will tell you on the Medicaid piece, I would say the large portion
of that is in the Medicaid side because the eligibility redetermination is suspension, right? So in order
for states to get the FMAP, the enhanced FMAP, they have to suspend the eligibility redetermination
process. And so when I mentioned that we've already seen increases in April, part of that is because of the
eligibility redetermination suspension.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Can you provide us some color on your conversations with states around budget pressure and whether
that could impact rates or program changes?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Obviously, states have budget pressures. I mean municipalities, everything, with reduced tax revenues.
But in our conversations, we remind them that the FMAP was 6%. And in recent legislation, they're going
to talk about moving it to 12%. So that their revenue and their cost of the sharing for these premiums will
be absorbed more by the federal government. So we have to work and see how it all plays out.

But I -- we're confident that the revenue will be there. Most states understand the cost and the need to
still be. And CMS has been very clear. Some states have asked for -- some -- they ask for a waiver or a
change on actuarial soundness. And CMS said clearly, no. They understand that. So the basic principles,
Sarah, is still there. And that's where the strength of our balance sheet comes in handy that we can -- we
have the strength and where we're going to work with all them and get issues resolved.

Sarah Elizabeth James
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And can you just remind us from the last recession, I know that there's more actuarial soundness by a
rate-sell level protection that came in. There's other Obamacare protection that came in. So if we went
back to last time, were there program cuts? And would that even be possible this time? Or is there too
much for the states to lose?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I don't really recall program cuts. I think the states are doing everything they can to normalize these
types of things. And I feel for them. I mean their biggest pressure right now is on the education system,
more so than our system. And if more schools are out of session, there's that type of thing, but I don't
think we're at risk there. I think health care is something that needs there, and they realize that actions
that reduce it and reduce the programs really come back to haunt them very quickly.

Our next question will come from Charles Rhyee of Cowen.

Charles Rhyee
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to maybe touch on -- you were talking about earlier about a potential for multiple peaks. And
just kind of thinking about when you were thinking about the -- your guidance here, particularly as we
get to the end of the year, are you anticipating sort of a second wave for COVID-19 to recur? And as you
think about some of the delays you're expecting, particularly in WellCare synergies, et cetera, are you
assuming that sort of COVID-19 is more of a regular occurrence as we -- as you kind of go forward? So as
we think about 2021, should we be thinking about sort of this recurring [ in a way ], so it becomes more
normalized, I guess?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, you -- I'll tell you the factors we're thinking about. Actually, I feel like [ we're into ] for both, but I'll
try and keep it. The epidemiologist -- I'll give you a factor. I haven't seen much -- having much about,
there is a factor that measures the intensity of the virus in somebody. And what people don't realize is
that in the first 3 days that somebody has contracted the virus, it is at the highest acuity and intensity. So
you have people walking around that have the virus who don't know they have it and spreading it more --
I really remember, I think it was 1 person came from China, got this whole thing started here.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

And so when we look at the peaks, what we worry about is that kind of factor and to what extent people
take the steps to protect themselves. We're planning on -- we've said -- we're telling employees, we got
this going out today that we expect that -- we know we will not open before the end of May, and that may
be pushed back another 30 days, just in the abundance of conservatism and caution. But we're installing
equipment that will measure employees' temperatures when they come through the turnstiles that go to
work. We're working hard to get what we call seat partitions, a 6-foot high partitions in. We're working to
figure out how we get random testing in.

Now those are the kinds of things that you do to try and minimize it. If somebody seems asymptomatic or
symptomatic, send them home. But I -- we don't know. But we are saying that if there is a second and --
peak, we have to be ready for it in terms of PPE, what we're going to do, working at home. But we want
to get people back in the office because it's more efficient because you develop people more, and we're a
high-growth industry. But we have to be ready as we were last time. And I'm very proud of the IS people.
They, in 3 days, had 66,000 people working at home with the training, everything on iPad, just got it all
set up.

So when we talk about planning for it, we plan to say, okay, what can we do to improve it? And they make
it more -- even more productive at home and protect those essential workers as it comes. So I don't have
an answer. We just have to figure out what happens if we do and what's our response going to be. And
pray it doesn't -- pray they have medicines that protect and cure this thing until we get a vaccine.

Charles Rhyee
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Maybe if I could just add one more. To an earlier question, you talked about delays in the WellCare
synergy capture. I think you've previously indicated that synergies would be split between sort of 50-50
between medical costs and SG&A. When you consider sort of delays that are -- you're expecting now, does
that skew to one or the other more so?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I would say it would -- the delay would skew more to the medical line is what I would say, not much
but a little bit.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. But you also, Jeff, said there's some offsets there, so that our breakeven in the first 12 months is
still there. I mean we tell people we're -- we like to think of ourselves as managers, not [ victims ].

First question, just interested if you could maybe help us just walk through some of the key dynamics that
you're seeing in the New York market, just given obviously how much more disrupted the dynamics have
been there. So specifically, obviously, there were the delays in payments, what's the visibility you have
on getting paid in New York, the final rate updates that you saw on the budget from New York? I think it
ended up down 1.5%, but interested in what you're seeing there. And then also just from the member

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, I'll start on a couple of things. So on delayed payments, as you all may be aware, it's New York's
fiscal year-end. So it's not uncommon for states to delay their payment for a few days at the end of their
fiscal years, which is what happened. So we've subsequently been paid. On the rates, the rates still aren't
final. So we really don't have any update, I would say, that's with some finality based -- compared to what
we said on the March 3 and March 4 when we gave guidance. So there's no real change there from that
perspective. And what was the -- your last one?

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

On the medical costs, essentially, Jeff, just in terms of sort of COVID members being impacted, things like
that.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. We're certainly seeing some costs from New York as compared to our other states. But in general,
and this is no different than, I guess, what I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, as we sit here today,
the amount of, I would call it, paid dollars associated with COVID has not been substantial, right? So there
is obviously a delay from when the people seek services and when we obviously get the bills in-house. And
so we haven't seen a large amount sitting here today.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean the normal submission patterns just aren't there right now, and that's part of the variables. I
mean it's like things we haven't seen before.

Operator

Our next question will come from Steve Valiquette of Barclays.

Steven James Valiquette
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So a couple of questions here. I guess first, from an actuarial perspective, I don't know how much you
can dive into this or not. But I guess, I'm curious if you're able to give a little more color just on how you
approach the medical reserve process for the full year calendar 2020, just in relation to COVID-19 medical
cost. And was there any bias to potentially over-reserve just out of an abundance of caution? And then
you obviously see how the prior period reserve develops later this year and early next year. And also tied
to that, I'm curious, just big picture, did medical reserves for the full year for COVID-19 have any material
impact on the MLR that was reported in 1Q '20 in particular? Just to clarify that as well.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I'll start off a little bit and then let Jeff give you a little more color on it. But we are looking at what
is a normal reserve. And that's our starting point. Now I will say that I use the words abundance and
conservatism. I would hope that we're going to be somewhat conservative in our bookings where there's
all these variables because I've often said, I mean, I'd much rather come back to you in 12 months, said,
9 months, whatever, and say we had a prior period positive adjustment than a negative adjustment. And
that's -- but even that, it's just because these are things we've not seen before, submission patterns,
so many variables here that we're using historic patterns. I think it's fair to say, Jeff, is a starting point.
That's why, to you, it was anything variable. But that's been the basic approach. I don't know, you want to
add?

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Yes. Yes. Just in general, just to maybe get a grounding point, the actuarial standards require reserving
under moderately adverse conditions. And anytime there's uncertainty, generally, you would add additional
margin or additional cushion, if you will, because of the uncertainty of the environment you're in. So 2
things. We can only accrue for and record our best estimate of what we think our claims liability is going
to be under the accounting standards. And that best estimate would only be for claims that we believe
have occurred prior to quarter, month or year-end.

And so at the end of the first quarter, that's what we did. To Michael's point, early -- in the first quarter, as
we closed the books, we did not really see any difference in the claims submission patterns. It looked like
the claims that we received were in line with our forecast. And so we recorded a normal level of reserve
that's why we indicated that in the first quarter that COVID didn't really have an effect. And that's because
in a normal month, we really only receive a very small percentage of the claims for the last 2 weeks of the
month. So hopefully, that gives you a little insight on Q1 and kind of how the reserving process works.

Operator

Our next question will come from Dave Windley of Jefferies.

David Anthony Styblo
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. Just to follow up on the first quarter MLR and to understand. I think
previously, you guys had indicated that the MLR would be up year-over-year. And I think consensus maybe
took that to be about 50 basis points. And obviously, it was up over 200 basis points. I just want to make
sure that there weren't any other major differences that came up during the quarter that affected it,
whether that would be a mix issue for more PDP lives and the WellCare book or some of the investments
that you might have made in the quarter, knowing that volumes are going to be a little bit lighter going
forward, just to help understand the delta again between consensus and what you were previously talking
about.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I appreciate the difficulty in modeling the Q1 MLR or HBR. Obviously, we had a lot of moving parts,
specifically with the closure of the WellCare transaction and the proration of their results. We also divested
3 businesses: 2 legacy WellCare, 1 legacy Centene. And so it became challenging. We did not give a MLR
Q1. What we did do was in early March, when we gave our guidance, we indicated that the high $0.80s to
low $0.90s range from an adjusted earnings perspective. And the way I would think about that is if you
look at the $0.86, we had $0.05 that was purely driven by what happened in the second half of March with
interest rates. And so that was unknown to us at the beginning of March when we gave our guidance.

And so I guess, from that perspective, we would kind of view we were in line with what we told people
at the beginning of the month. And obviously, we said COVID costs were neutral. And so that's where
we were from our perspective. We didn't give really any guidance on the Q1 MLR. And we appreciate it's
higher, but a lot of the things that, I think, I highlighted earlier were really the drivers. We previously
talked about exchange normalization, yet the addition of WellCare, which runs a higher MLR in the first
quarter, and specifically, they did have a significant PDP growth, which it's the highest MLR for the quarter.
New markets in Pennsylvania. We have leap year and then, of course, the New York rate effect. And so I
guess, from our perspective, it was kind of where we thought it would be.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I'm going to jump in here, Jeff. We have an annual meeting coming up in a few minutes. So I'm going

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just real quick. One point of clarification on the revenue increase. You referenced the special enrollment
for the public exchanges and the lack of predeterminations. Does that [ encount ] in your mind for the full
$4 billion increase? Are you assuming, as the year progresses, you'll see incremental Medicaid enrollment
due to the weakness in the economy and maybe split that out between what you actually have in hand
now and what you're sort of anticipating as the year progresses? And then just real quick, any update on
North Carolina or other states that are either in the RFP process or in the rollout phase of new business?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, A.J., you're spot on. It would include both our prediction on the higher unemployment as well. So it's
both components, eligibility, redetermination, suspension and higher unemployment. I'm not going to split
those out at this point in time because, I think, as Michael mentioned, there's a lot of uncertainty here. So
we were comfortable with the number in aggregate, and I think that's what we're going to stick to at this
point.

As far as state updates, I'm not aware of any significant updates. I think we still have North Carolina in for
10/1. We'll have to see how that plays out.

Just 2 things here. One quick follow-up on MLR question. The MLR for the full year, can you give us any
color in terms of where you think about that directionally relative to the previous guidance of about, I
think, it was 85.9% and 86.3%?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Yes. I guess here's what I would say, Justin. I mean obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty here
with respect to the cost line and the pandemic and everything. I would say, excluding the effect of the
pandemic, our range would still hold. The real variable is going to be how the costs play out for the year,
both the revenue and the cost play out for the year associated with the pandemic here.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Sure. But within -- you took up the top line. You took down investment income. I assume SG&A benefits
a little bit, and it hits a little bit. But in terms of the MLR, you're just saying we still think that number is
good relative to the EPS guidance? Or do you think it would be higher or lower?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke

Well, I don't know about that. But -- and then just my question, just a quick follow-up on this FMAP
and the redetermination and the lack thereof. I'm curious, I know you don't want to delineate the exact
revenue benefit from this. But can you share with us what the typical turnover is or churn rate is from
redeterminations that's not going to happen now or some level of some period of time? On a monthly
basis, I've heard numbers like 3% to 5%. I'm just curious what you've experienced over time.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

We said -- we had commented prior to all this that the redeterminations were tailing off because they have
gone through it. So redeterminations right now would be very difficult if they wanted to do it because of
the number of people have lost jobs and where we are. So to try and put any percentage on it, we just --
when we had our White House meetings, we raised the redeterminations and balanced billing as 2 things
that the regulations had to deal with, and I guess they heard us.

I'm sorry, I missed that first one, Ricky. Could you repeat the first question? I didn't hear it.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. The first one is just on the MA bids and how are you thinking about pricing for next year given all the
uncertainty. And then the second one, when you just think longer term, given that this pandemic and the
public health crisis, how do you think about expanded government role in health care as a result of this?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think there's 2 aspects of it. One, on the bids, our group will continue to work through the normal
process, and they have to go through and look at their -- as they always do. So I see no change there.

The government's role, I don't think this is a time that politically, economically, socially or any other way
that I see a shift there. I think this is a time when you want to keep as much constant as you can because
there's enough variables out there. So I don't see any real shifting taking place there.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then just lastly on the MLR. I know a lot of uncertainty, and I think -- thank you for the comment in
what you're seeing in St. Louis in terms of hospitals are actually starting to potentially go back to a more
normalized environment or a new normal in May and June versus July. But within the MLR guidance that
you provided, you said that obviously second quarter is going to be meaningfully below the [ second ] half.
Should we think right now with current guidance that second half is going to be in line with what we've
seen in the first quarter or higher than that? Just that we have some context.

Our next question will come from Lance Wilkes of Bernstein.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Just wanted to talk about kind of balance sheet impacts and the flow-through in net investment income.
And I was just interested if you could talk to both what regulators are having to do and what you guys are
doing with respect to premium payments from states, allowing delays and that, premium payments from
individuals and public exchange? And then on the payables side, what you're doing as far as extending or
accelerating payables? And what kind of impact that's having on that $0.17 for the full year impact on net
investment income?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Just -- this is Jeff. Just real quick. It's not really having an effect. I mean the $0.17 is really just
driven by the lower interest rates. I mean half of our investment portfolio is effectively set aside to pay
claims, and it's invested in short-term daily liquidity instruments. And so when you lower the short-term
interest rates substantially, that just has an effect, right? And then the other piece of that number would
be the higher interest cost. We were going to redeem our 2022 bonds. Instead, we've decided to defer
that redemption and leave those -- leave that cash on the books. And so there's a higher interest cost
there. And those were 4.75% notes. And so that's really what's driving the $0.17.

On the provider front, we have historically and continue to pay claims as fast as we can. So I think
Michael historically has told stories of if a claim comes in today and it's a clean claim, it's automatically
adjudicated. It's ready to be paid the next day. And so that's -- we've run it that way for a long time. So it
hasn't had any impact, if you will, on the payables side.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

And any impact on the receivable side on the individual or anything?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No. No. I mean certainly, we've seen some members have delayed payments, but we just haven't made it
that far yet, right? I mean it's been 30, 40 days. So here -- so we'll just have to see how that plays out.

Our next question will come from Mike Newshel of Evercore ISI.

Michael Anthony Newshel
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the Medicaid rate situation in New York. Earlier, Jeff, I think you were referring
to the rate cuts that were already implemented in January, and can there's still some discussions, so a
possibility that will be adjusted. Is that right? And then, in addition to that, for the Medicaid cuts in budget

for the new fiscal year, is there any update on where things stand with our redesign team that's figure out
the details there and whether premium cuts or other changes affecting your -- or the mix of what they're
considering?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Thanks, Mike. I think that's the kind of the point I was making is that from my -- from our
perspective, I think that's still open. And so we really are just waiting to get a final resolution there on
what the effect is and then ultimately discuss that when it happens. But right now, I'd say they're still
open at this point. And so more to come.

Michael Anthony Newshel
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And just like, I mean, it's all very highly dependent on the outcome here on just whether a federal funding
bill comes through for the states? Just if you have a better idea of what the budget is going to be?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I mean that could be a driver. But in general, I think it's just process related right now, meaning I think
the Medicaid review task force came out with recommendations, and I think we've had 1 meeting with the
states since then maybe. So it's just -- there's a long way to go, I think, before those get finalized.

Our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Just a quick one for me. Can you just give us a sense of average claim cost of COVID on a Medicaid
patient? And does the 20% higher Medicaid rate apply in Medicaid as well?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, so, I mean, we have not seen enough claims. As we said, there's been -- we don't know what degree
is lack of claims and what degree is, they haven't had time to submit them. So we have not seen enough
to see the average cost, but it has not been significant. It's been more the testing, and we haven't seen a
lot, too. We know there's some cheap ones out there with the number of members we have, but we just
haven't seen that. Jeff?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No. I think Michael is right. I mean we've certainly paid some claims. But I would not want to give an
average cost because we just don't have the volume yet to give a credible number is what I would say.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Fair enough. And then just real quick, I may have misunderstood. Did you say you're assuming normal
or normalized MLR on new HICS members? And why wouldn't it be higher just considering what could be
adverse risk sort of coming on to the exchange?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, no. We didn't get into the specifics on the product level as far as going forward. Again, I think that's
part of the uncertainty that we're dealing with.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I think what I said is I cannot -- I'm not going to anticipate that these are all new members that have had
no health care. These are people who have lost their jobs and maybe chose not to go through the other
process to keep insurance with the company. So it's not like that somebody has had no insurance at all. So
there's a -- I'm just trying to give a balance and give you a sense of how we're looking at it.

Operator

Our final question today will come from George Hill of Deutsche Bank.

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I guess Mike and Jeff, if you think about the conversations that you're having around the various state
program changes, are you seeing any changes that you think could become permanent after the crisis and
maybe could meaningfully impact the business?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we're not seeing that. We're not -- the states right now are -- we're talking about things we can
get to if we get there, PPE for their state troopers and a lot of other things to just be supportive of the
environment we're in. And they are pleased with the coverage of what we're doing. And I don't see any
major changes now or in the future.

Well, I guess, we're done with the questions. I just want to -- just in closing, I want to help everyone
understand that this is -- this business is as vital and viable as it's ever been. We are comfortable, we
have the systems and capabilities to manage through the uncertainty. And the key here is that while we,
at this point, are confident on our guidance for the year, I cannot emphasize nothing. It's going to be
lumpy. It's not going to be a normal progression depending on how people come back, how the intensity,
how are the services.

These are the things we're managing through, and we have managed through in the past -- this past so
far this year. And so our employees are in sound working conditions. The business continuity is there.
The growth is there. Our ability to work on the cost is there. So going forward, we'll continue to keep you
informed, and we're going at this with full confidence that we'll get through this and continue to be very
successful for our shareholders.

I thank you for your interest. Look forward to talking to you soon.
