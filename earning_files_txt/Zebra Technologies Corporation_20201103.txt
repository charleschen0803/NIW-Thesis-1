Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Zebra Technologies Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I now like to turn the conference over to Mike
Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Michael A. Steele
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's Third Quarter Conference Call. This presentation is being simulcast
on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year.

Slide 2 conveys that the forward-looking statements we make today are based on current expectations
and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to
factors discussed in our SEC filings.

During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance.
You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release.

Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-
year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12
months following each acquisition.

This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer;
and Nathan Winters, our acting Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our third quarter results,
then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Anders
will conclude with progress on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and trends in our end
markets. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Senior Vice President of Global Sales, will join us
as we take your questions.

Now let's flip to Slide 4 as I turn the call over to Anders.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are honored that our
solutions are empowering frontline workers in the battle against COVID-19. I am proud of our employees'
resiliency and focus on serving our customers' critical needs during these challenging times. Our top
priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners as
businesses continue to progress with their reopening plans.

In Q3, our results continued to be pressured by the global macro environment. For the quarter, we
realized net sales growth of 30 basis points; adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.3%, which contracted by 240
basis points; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.27, a 5% decrease from the prior year.

As a result of excellent execution by our teams and a faster than expected recovery in demand, each of
these measures exceeded our outlook. Demand from our large strategic customers has been at record
levels, driven by accelerated trends to digitize and automate workflows. Not surprisingly, the pandemic
has disproportionately impacted our smaller customers in certain end markets, which has resulted in
a significant shift in business mix. Together with premium shipping costs, this has weighed on gross
margin. In light of this pressure, we have continued to diligently manage discretionary costs to preserve
profitability and cash flow.

Despite the challenging environment, our enterprise customers have been prioritizing spend with Zebra,
and I would like to highlight some notable Q3 success stories. We expanded our relationship with a leading
e-commerce retailer experiencing significantly increased order volumes. They require trusted technology

solutions that enable improved supply chain and order fulfillment execution to empower their labor force.
We are deploying our mobile computing, scanning and printing solutions across their growing global
footprint. Innovation, quality and value are critical partner attributes cited by this customer, and we are
proud that our team is delivering to their high standards.

The hospital system in Denmark has chosen to replace a competitor with our clinical point-of-care
solution. In Q3, they began a multi-quarter deployment of our health care-purposed TC5 Series mobile
computers and accessories, which will interface seamlessly with their electronic medical health record
system. We have continued to deploy TC7 Series mobile computers to USPS postal carriers as planned
and are now pausing through their peak holiday season, expecting to resume in late Q1 with the goal of
completion by mid-Q3.

We are proud that we are able to help our customers meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly
on-demand economy. We continue to view acquisitions as a vector of profitable growth for Zebra and a
way to elevate our role as a solutions provider. In early September, we closed on the Reflexis acquisition.
In a few minutes, I'll elaborate on how this acquisition is synergistic to our offering.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results and discuss our Q4
outlook.

Nathan Andrew Winters
Acting Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. Net sales increased 30 basis points before
the modest net impact of currencies and acquisitions. As Anders mentioned, large order volume was
much stronger than the prior year. This was offset by a decline in small and midsized business through
the channel, which disproportionately impacted printing and data capture. Our Enterprise Visibility &
Mobility segment sales increased 4%, driven by solid growth in mobile computing and services. Our
Asset Intelligence & Tracking, including printing and supplies, continue to be most impacted by the global
recessionary environment with sales decreasing 7% from the prior year. This was a notable 18-point
sequential improvement from the Q2 decline.

We realized solid growth in our managed and professional services and Zebra retail solutions. Location
solutions declined from last year due to lower project activity during the pandemic. We realized significant
sequential improvement in each of our regions from Q2 as we continue to recover from the peak of the
pandemic. In North America, sales increased 6%. Mobile computing and data capture returned to solid
growth, and services continued to perform well.

EMEA sales were flat. Services and mobile computing were bright spots. We also continued to see
strength in Central and Northern Europe. Sales in our Asia Pacific region declined 13%. China was a bright
spot, returning to modest growth. Latin America sales declined 20% with all major product and service
categories declining.

Adjusted gross margin contracted 390 basis points to 43.8% driven primarily by more than 3 points from
unfavorable business mix and nearly 1 point from premium freight cost, which was partially offset by
improved services margin. Underlying margin trends across the business, excluding mix dynamics, remain
healthy. Adjusted operating expenses declined $17 million from the prior year period and improved 150
basis points as a percentage of sales. This improvement was primarily due to disciplined cost management
and lower compensation expense while preserving our planned investments in the business.

Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.3%, a 240 basis points decrease from the prior year period,
driven entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.27, a $0.16 or
5% year-over-year decrease.

Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $482 million of free
cash flow in the first 9 months of 2020. This was $106 million higher than the prior year period, primarily
due to a lower use of working capital as well as our expanded accounts receivable factoring program.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Our balance sheet is strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q3 at a comfortable 1.8x net
debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, 0.5x higher than last quarter, due to financing the acquisition of Reflexis.

Now turning to Slide 8. We have demonstrated that we can deliver solid results in a challenging economic
environment while continuing to invest in our future. Our consistently strong free cash flow generation
is driven by our capital-light business model, flexible cost structure, diversified end markets, strong
execution and disciplined cost management.

Let's now turn to our outlook. We are encouraged by the faster-than-expected recovery with small and
midsized businesses and are beginning to realize the benefit of pent-up demand from many customers
who have paused their spending earlier in the year. Based on these trends and our healthy channel
inventory levels, we expect Q4 adjusted net sales to increase between 3% and 7%. This outlook assumes
an approximately 150 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and a neutral impact
from foreign currency changes.

We believe Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin will be between 21% and 22%, which assumes modest operating
expense leverage from the prior year. Gross margin is expected to be slightly lower than last year,
reflecting higher large order mix in a soft but improving macro environment as well as an offsetting year-
on-year impacts of premium freight and tariff expense. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the
range of $3.70 to $3.90.

You can see other modeling assumptions on Slide 9. Note that we now expect free cash flow to be at least
$650 million for the year, which is higher than 2019.

With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how Reflexis is synergistic with our Enterprise Asset
Intelligence vision as well as trends in our end markets.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Thank you, Nathan. Slide 11 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our
value proposition with customers as a solutions provider. Our unmatched access to frontline operational
data from our vast installed base of products uniquely positions us to solve our customers' complex
challenges at the edge.

We are investing in emerging technologies that help our customers better orchestrate their workflows
by leveraging real-time data to gain actionable insights. We are excited to have Reflexis onboard, which
further helps Zebra bring our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision to life for retailers and other end
markets.

Reflexis is a demonstrated leader in intelligent workforce management and task execution. Their platform
is utilized by hundreds of retailers around the globe to drive employee productivity and retention while
also improving customer engagement. Reflexis is synergistic with our existing suite of solutions as a
service.

As you can see on Slide 12, these include: SmartCount, which is an innovative self scan and physical
inventory management solution; our SmartSite robotic solution, which uses automated intelligence to help
identify issues on the store shelf in real time; our Workforce Connect data and voice communication and
collaboration application for mobile workers; and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, which provides data-driven
insights and a prioritized list of prescriptive actions that help maximize efficiency and reduce shrinkage.

Zebra's suite of solutions work in unison with our product portfolio to provide real-time contextual tasking.
This capability is critical for successfully addressing the inevitable unplanned events that occur throughout
the workday. Over the next few quarters, we will continue to invest in the seamless integration of Reflexis'
market-leading platform with our complementary software offerings to optimize the experience for
frontline workers. We are also investing in our go-to-market efforts to drive accelerated traction with our
unmatched suite of solutions. We believe that our enterprise customers will realize a compelling ROI by
empowering all of their associates with these solutions.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

On Slide 13, we provide an update regarding the mixed impacts we are currently seeing in the primary
vertical markets that we serve. We also highlight the exciting longer-term opportunities in our end
markets as customers invest in our technology in an increasingly on-demand economy. Trends are
improving since our last quarterly update, although it is still a mixed picture depending on the sector.

In health care, our solutions helped hospitals intelligently flex their capacity to serve patients. There
was a pause in noncritical care during the peak of the pandemic, straining the budgets of health service
providers, which is changing now that elective procedures are assuming. Longer term, the need for
increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and the demand for innovative solutions to
provide safe and efficient care continue to make health care a high-growth end market opportunity.

Retailers are prioritizing investment in our technology for their complex omnichannel fulfillment strategies
and related warehouse automation needs. Demand from large retailers is at record levels as e-commerce
and buy online-initiated transactions have increased dramatically through the pandemic. We have also
begun to resume business with many department stores and specialty retailers that have been reopening
their doors.

In the transportation and logistics space, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes
and last-mile delivery, which is favorable to Zebra. Passenger airlines, rental car providers and other
related businesses remained challenged. The manufacturing sector continues to be most impacted with
COVID-19 and global trade tensions. Key segments within process manufacturing, such as food and
pharmaceutical companies, have held up relatively well, continuing to operate through the pandemic.
We've seen mixed trends in discrete manufacturing with those in aviation and discretionary specialty
goods, particularly challenged, a bright spot is our solid recovery in Chinese manufacturing.

In closing, we are successfully navigating through this challenging environment while we continue to
invest in advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. This is enabling Zebra to emerge from this
crisis in a stronger competitive position. We also believe that our longer-term prospects are strengthening
as secular trends to digitize and automate workflows have accelerated.

Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike.

Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens.

Thomas Allen Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Anders, I wanted to start on the Reflexis deal. Could you articulate for us how important integrating
software as part of your revenue mix will be going forward? And what are some of the strategic rationales?
In other words, what does that allow you to do in terms of increasing stickiness with the customer
relationship? What are the other advantages it brings to Zebra?

And then as a related point, as you do head into more software-driven sales, should we think about that
market as one that's more competitive than where you've traditionally competed? Or how do you want to
frame up the competitive dynamics there?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. That's good. I'll start, and then I'll ask Joe Heel to help out also. First, just -- Reflexis is a great
company. We're very excited that it's part of our portfolio, part of the Zebra family here now. I mean it's
been a demonstrated leader in intelligent workforce management and task execution for many years,
and it's been deployed by hundreds of retailers around the globe to help drive employee productivity and
retention.

And many, many of those customers are common to Zebra and to -- also to our Zebra Prescriptive
Analytics solution. So when we look at Reflexis and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and other software
solutions we have, we see them as being very synergistic with our overall solution.

If you think of our framework around Sense, Analyze and Act, I think that's probably the easiest way
maybe to show how we think about creating more complete solutions for our product customers. But we
have had historically a great strength around the sense and some in the analyze part, but being able to
sense what's happening in the physical world has been kind of our foundation.

But over the last few years, we have expanded our capabilities around the analyze and the act side quite
a bit, and both Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Reflexis are examples of that. And now when we -- prior
to actually the acquisition of Reflexis, we had a number of customers ask us to do more tight integration
between Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Reflexis. They felt that, that would be something that would help
get more value out of those investments.

Zebra Prescriptive Analytics is going to continue to feed actions into Reflexis' action engine to help
combine all the different actions that the retailer might do in a prioritized way. And then we look and
leverage our other software assets like Workforce Connect to be able to let it all tie it back into our mobile
computers. So our store associates can either scan items in the store or enter other data that can be
fed into ZPA or into Reflexis but also then be receiving updates or actions from that so that the Reflexis
system can deliver even greater value by being able to do that.

And for Zebra as a whole, with our suite of solutions as a service, we can become more strategic to our
customers. We can start enabling them to address more complete workflows. And by that, we can increase
the ROI of our overall solutions and be a more strategic thought partner as they think about how they
develop their business. So we definitely feel that this is a very compelling path for us and very excited
about what we can do with this. Joe, you want to add something?

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Yes. Perhaps I'll underline two things that you touched on. One is the fact that we're synergistic, not
just on the product level, as Anders described, how we think we can bring together the different product
capabilities we have, but certainly also on a go-to-market and sales level, where we have a very strong
share in the retail market already, and bringing Reflexis to those retail customers is immediate cross-sell
opportunity that we have.

We're actually discovering that it also works the other way around. That Reflexis has some customers that
they can bring us into and cross-sell that way. And that leads into the strategic opportunity that Anders
described, right, which is -- Reflexis generally has a strong presence in the operations side of retailers.
And this now gives us an opportunity to solve their problem strategically. And this perhaps also addresses
the second part of your question around do we see this as a more competitive space.

Certainly, there are different competitors in the pure workflow software area. However, none of them have
the capability that we have to bring together the Sense-Analyze-Act part of the EAI vision and to solve the
problem holistically. So we look at this as a space where we can now differentiate ourselves actually from
both the traditional competitors that we had and the competitors that Reflexis currently has.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Just to round out, say, I've been on the phone with many of the largest customers of Reflexis over the last
month or 2, and I'd say that, formally, they are very excited about the combination. They are passionate
about the Reflexis solution, but they also see the value that a combination with Zebra and the extra
resources we can have and how -- our vision for how we can continue to add value to their operations. So
I think so far, it's been a great feedback from the market and from our customers.

Thomas Allen Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

That's all very helpful. As a follow-up, I wanted to shift to some of the end market commentary you
offered, Anders, specifically within retail and e-comm. It just sounds like some of the larger customers
have accelerated their plans for the omnichannel integration or leaning into their e-commerce platforms.
So 2 related questions.

How durable do you see that trend being -- or maybe you could frame up qualitatively, if not
quantitatively, how far ahead you think your current backlog gives you visibility into maintaining a robust
pace of sales?

And then moving to the smaller customers or potential new smaller customers, are you seeing anything
-- not even in terms of order trends, just interest level that suggests that maybe the playing field here
has expanded? If you just look around the retail landscape, they're a lot more engaged in omnichannel or
talking about it at least now than there were a year ago. So I just wonder if maybe there's a TAM aspect
to this dynamic as well where it's shifted in your favor?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start, and then I'll ask Joe to add a little bit of color to it also. First, I think in this environment,
our solutions have become even more critical for our customers. We are, I'd say, uniquely positioned to
empower frontline workers across all our vertical end markets. And COVID-19 has been accelerating a
number of secular trends around digitization and automation, and it's probably most apparent in retail
around e-commerce, around omnichannel and buy online pick up at store.

Here, we've seen, particularly around mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers, that they have been the
most -- the quickest, I guess, to pick up on this, and that's about 2/3 of our business. But I'd say, the
largest retailers have been the -- mostly been the most aggressive or the earliest to start adopting and
investing in solutions around omnichannel and e-commerce.

They have seen a great growth in their omnichannel and buy online, pick up at store businesses. And they
have -- still believe that there's lots of market share that they can continue to grow and take. So they

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

are continuing to invest heavily in building out their capabilities and scaling their capabilities compared to
where it was, say, just 6 months back.

For smaller retailers, they -- I'd say generalizing a bit now, they were maybe not quite as quick to
invest in omnichannel capabilities. It's a big investment and a complicated one at times. But I think the
COVID-19 and the changes in customer buying behaviors and the step-up in change in how comfortable
consumers are with omnichannel and buy online, pick up at store, as an example, has made it, I think,
abundantly clear for smaller retailers, too, that if they want to compete, they need to build these types of
capabilities.

So we see the pipeline of business around these larger trends around digitization, automation and
particularly in retail as quite robust. And we think that this is a trend that will be going on for quite some
time. And we're just saying that, I think for now, we see then the pipelines of these types of opportunities
as we look into 2021 as being as robust as we would have expected them to be in prior years at this time.
Joe?

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. I'll add perhaps 2 thoughts. I do think there is a TAM expansion that's going on, but I see it a little
differently than you were perhaps suggesting. One big area of -- it has to do with the fact that in order to
enable all of these omnichannel capabilities, you need a deep capability in the company more broadly than
just at the front where the items are being picked up.

And 2 things in particular that you need to do that, I think, favor us in this case is, number one, you need
to enable your associates in your store because that's where most of the instant omnichannel capabilities
is being created. And that means you need to digitize and give every worker a device in some form, and
we're far from that today. So that's a TAM expansion.

And the second piece is you need to extend that modernization into your supply chain, and we're seeing
a lot of activity in terms of digitizing and automating the supply chain, and that's clearly related to this
acceleration of e-commerce.

Operator

Next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Follow-up on that some of the last commentary that you were making, Anders. And it sounds like you're
still anticipating a fairly robust environment with your larger customers. So it's not as, potentially, there's
some digestion from the investments that they have been making. And then as it relates to the small
medium segment of, it wasn't if -- to what extent you are seeing a recovery there? I mean, is there the
potential over the next 1 to 2 quarters that you could have both areas of the business, both large accounts
and the SMB, actually moving in a consistent fashion toward stronger growth?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. First, I think we're seeing a faster-than-expected improvement in our end markets, and we're
cautiously optimistic about how the economy will recover into 2021. I think here, our industry leadership
and our investments in our business will also enable us to rebound stronger than our competitors. And to
that point, that's why we feel confident to guide for a both top and bottom line growth in Q4. When we
looked at our Q3 performance here, our run rate was improving. It's not back to pre-COVID-19 levels, but
it is definitely improving and strengthening. And I think that was something we saw globally. And our large
deals were obviously very strong in Q3, but we still have a good pipeline into our larger customers and
how they're looking to invest in Q4 and beyond. Joe, do you want to add anything to this also?

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes, perhaps just 2 things. If you look at our pipeline as an indicator, it's as strong as it was on a relative
basis a year ago. So we have a strong pipeline that gives us good confidence, and our run rate has been
recovering. We didn't say that clearly enough, but it's clearly a driver of the growth that we've been
seeing, and we expect that to continue as well.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just as a follow-up question. This relates more to some reports that we've begun to see,
including one by a large retailer that had been considering deploying in-store robots for inventory analysis
and has now pulled back apparently on that initiative. And I know you guys have looked at that market.
But I guess my question is, if you look at the opportunities there, does it appear that it looks like some of
the major retailers may opt for simply putting more devices in the hands of store personnel as opposed to
maybe looking at some of in-store automation with robots and things like that?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. First, I'd say that -- I don't think that our customers see one solution as being able to solve all
problems for them. Deploying more devices or putting more devices in the hands of more associates is
clearly a trend and something that our customers see as being able to drive a high ROI and enabling all of
them to be connected to their applications and systems and be able to be fully utilized in that respect.

With respect to the robot solutions, you mentioned also, we believe that there is a good market
opportunity for those types of solution, in addition to using handheld computers. We have our Smart Sight
solution for this, and I think that's progressed very nicely since we announced it in -- at NRF this year.
We've seen an increase in demand and pilots from any customers, particularly, I would say here now in
the last few months from grocers.

I think so far, our pilots have proven the technology, and we've been able to prove the ROI around -- just
based on labor savings alone, and the accuracy of our reads have been very strong. And we -- here is
an area where we leveraged our Cortexica acquisition. So we've employed a lot of the computer vision
technologies from that into Smart Site, into some of our other solutions to accelerate our ability to extract
useful information from digital images.

So we see a good, healthy pipeline of customers who are interested in piloting this solution with us.
And we have pilots in North America and Europe at this stage. Although it's also fair to say that we
-- COVID-19 has made it harder for us to engage on customer sites, which is making it a little slower
to ramp these pilots up. But the interest is as high as it was pre-COVID, I would say. Joe, any further
comments from you?

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

I'd like to add maybe one thing here. Let's remember what were the retailers trying to solve with this
robotics automation solution. What they're trying to solve is the accuracy of inventory in the store, and
there are many different capabilities and solutions that solve the inventory accuracy problem in the store,
and they are suited differently to different types of store formats as well as merchandise assortments.

And while we do believe that there is a place for the robotic inventory accuracy improvement, other
solutions like RFID or simply using the data from associates' devices like you can do with Zebra
Prescriptive Analytics are capable solutions for certain store formats and merchandise assortment.

So the key, in our mind, will be having the capability to look at all of these different solutions and
bring them to a customer. And that's what we're going to be in a position to do, including the robotic
automation.

CEO & Director

Yes, I think that's a good point just on -- to emphasize, again, from -- going back to the first question we
had. This is where the breadth of our portfolio enables us to go in and talk to our customers about what is
the problem you're trying to solve and then look at how can we bring our solutions, our technology to bear
to best solve the problem they're trying to solve versus coming in and saying, "Okay, I have a -- whatever
your problem is, my hammer is what's going to solve it." So I think this is a great example of how the
breadth of our solution plays to our advantage.

Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.

Meta A. Marshall
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Maybe a couple of questions for me. One on the Denmark Healthcare win. Just any context as to
-- was that your traditional kind of partner ecosystem that brought you into that deal? Was that a more
health care-focused partner that brought you in? And then just maybe on the improvement that you're
seeing in SMB. Are there any particular geographies or particular type of customer that you're seeing more
movement from?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. Again, I'll start and then I'll ask Joe to provide some extra color. So first, on Denmark. The Denmark
health care win we had, and it's a very exciting win for us. And I would say, almost uniformly, our health
care partners are uniquely focused on health care. It's very rare that we have partners that are strong in,
say, retail or manufacturing and also in health care.

Those are very different end markets. The solutions are very different. The problems are very different. So
it tends to lead to a much more vertically oriented entire value chain for us. Then around SMB, we did see
improvements in our run rate across all geographies on a sequential basis. I think that this is something
we expect to -- that we'll continue to see as the economy recovers into Q4. We've certainly seen a good
progression of the run rate in the SMB business here as we get into Q4 but also as we look further into
2021. Joe, any more comments from you? Are you muted, Joe?

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

I am. I do apologize. 2 comments. On the health care partners, one particular type of partner that is very
important for us in the health care space are the electronic medical records companies. We have excellent
relationships with them, both from an ISV and a resale perspective, and that has been a good source of
growth for us in the health care market.

In the SMB segment, the one -- other one I would call out, in particular, is China. So in China, we've seen
a resurgence, I think, of the -- in particular, manufacturing customers that are so essential for our printing
business, and they have certainly contributed to the return of that business.

Our next question will come from Richard Eastman with Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. I just wanted to explore the gross margin for a minute here, the adjusted gross margin by segment
here. Both segments were down 300 to 400 basis points. Maybe a little bit surprised around AIT segment
being down. So my question maybe is two-fold.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

I mean, first of all, around the freight expenses, we're using the term in a premium freight. Is the freight
expense up structurally, given the realignment around our subcontract manufacturing base? Or is that
specifically to the urgency around some of these e-commerce large orders and getting to here? What does
that impact?

Nathan Andrew Winters
Acting Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Rich, so I'll take this. I want to start by -- I think our teams have been executing well on what we
can control around gross margin. And if you look at the drivers, it's pretty consistent across both of our
segments both from an unfavorable business mix as well as the premium freight costs. And if you look at
the -- one of the 3 points, and again, spread between both segments from both large deal mix as well as
unfavorable business mix. And just an example, in Q3, the mix of large deals was actually greater than
what we saw in Q2. Another example, which speaks to the AIT point, if you look at our printer business,
it has a larger proportion within run rate and exposure to the manufacturing vertical, along with generally
higher gross margin. And then another point on premium freight costs. And to answer your question,
really, it's from capacity constraints not so much from the change in our manufacturing footprint. And
we're seeing our cost per kilo up 2 to 3x from what we saw pre pandemic, so again, just as some of the
capacities come offline with reduction in air travel internationally.

And I think what's important, if you look at the underlying gross margin trends, excluding the mix
dynamics, they do remain healthy. And as the economy recovers and our run rate business improves, so
will gross margin, which you'll begin to see here in Q4.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And AIT has the same, again, large order impact on AIT on the printer side of the business as it does on
the MC and scanning?

Nathan Andrew Winters
Acting Chief Financial Officer

What I'd say it's less reliant on large deals, but it has a higher proportion within the run rate -- a higher
proportion of run rate business.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And when you look at -- let's move out when things normalize here around the mix of business
between the channel and large orders and then this -- kind of this freight, this premium freight starts to
dissipate, are we still kind of at this normalized gross margin level for Zebra, that's, let's call it, 47% with
modest upside? Is that still a normalized gross margin here?

Nathan Andrew Winters
Acting Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So as we get past the pandemic, we do expect to get back to pre pandemic levels for both EBITDA
rate and gross margin rate. And like I said, the like-for-like margins remain healthy. We also would expect
the vast majority of our OpEx to return as the environment normalizes. We have, I'd say, some bit of that
will be permanent savings that we'll look to reinvest around the OpEx side. But again, we do get -- we do
expect to get back to the pre-pandemic levels, both in EBITDA and gross margin rate.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Maybe just to add one thing to that. We continue to also develop our portfolio. So as you think of our
-- the software solutions we talked about here earlier, they tend to come with a higher gross margin
certainly, and scale, we would expect them to have a very attractive EBITDA margin, too.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Understood. Yes. And then just my second follow-up question, just around the sales and sales channel.
Just a quick question. When we look at the fourth quarter revenue guide of plus 3 to plus 9, is the
assumption in there that the channel, both North America as well as Europe, is up year-over-year? Is that
assumption in your guide -- revenue guide for the fourth quarter?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

So your question was if the channel is expected to be up year-over-year? Yes.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So channel and run rate. I'm sorry.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

As in run rate, yes. Okay. So yes. So I'll start here again, and I'll have Joe provide some extra color again.
But first, we're quite pleased to be able to guide for both top and bottom line growth year-over-year in Q4
here, but the 3% -- 3% to 7% expectation in growth, and that includes 150 basis points of positive impact
from Reflexis.

First, the large deal activity remains very strong, but the underlying business is recovering faster than
we expected, and we are also benefiting from some pent-up demand in Q4. As we entered Q4, though,
we also had a strong backlog that helped us in this area. The higher large order mix that we've seen
compared to prior year will continue but not the same degree as in Q3. So we do expect the run rate and
the channel business to continue to sequentially grow. And Joe, any more color for you?

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

I don't think I have anything to add. You said it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair.

Brian Paul Drab
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

At this point, I guess 2 quick follow-up questions to the recent questions that you were just addressing.
So I appreciate that gross margin should get back to the pre-pandemic level. I'm wondering if you could
put a finer point on that. Is that something that we could expect in 2021? Or does the large postal service
order maybe weigh on that somewhat in the near term? Is that a longer-term expectation? Or is that a
2021 expectation?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

I think it's a little too early for us to give a detailed 2021 guidance at this stage, but we do expect that
our gross margins will continue to sequentially improve, along with the economy and along with the
improvement in our run rate business.

Brian Paul Drab
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. And then, Anders, you just highlighted also that the software business, of course, should be a
tailwind for gross margin as that business grows and which Reflexis, it's obviously a bigger piece of the

business. Can you give us any sense for it? How -- what percentage of revenue now we are at in terms of
software? Is it -- can you even say if it's more or less than 5%?

I know it's not something you've really said in the past, but it's becoming a more meaningful piece, and
we don't really know how to model the impact on gross margin without some sense for that.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. Obviously we're very excited about the software business, and our software and services business has
been growing quite nicely. The software business as a whole, I think, is still in the single digits for us, but
it's been, as I say, has been growing quite, quite nicely. And we would expect it to be a much bigger part
of our business as we go forward.

Operator

Our next question will come from Keith Housum with Northwest Research.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

And Nathan, congratulations, and welcome to the call. Guys, want to dig in a little bit further into the U.S.
postal service. Anders, I think I heard you say that the deal is on a pause until late first quarter, and then
we will finish up in 3Q of next year. So is the plan still to end, I guess, late summer? I'm just trying to
get a little bit more idea on the third quarter. And in terms of a pause, are we talking the end of the first
quarter, so don't expect much in the first quarter of '21 from the U.S. Postal Service?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. First, the pause that we now have is a planned activity from USPS. This was always their intent to not
deploy new devices during Canada peak season, and it will start ramping up again in the second half of
the first quarter. So the Q1 would be certainly lower than Q2 and Q3, and we expect that late summer, we
will be basically wrapping up. And then we'll continue obviously with other projects and expansions of this
project with USPS.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Great. And then just as my follow-up. In terms of the Temptime business, can you just perhaps cover, is
there an opportunity with that business to take advantage of perhaps COVID-19 vaccine that might be out
there on the horizon? And how is that business doing? And how does that go to play here?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Sorry. You said Temptime?

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Correct.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. So Temptime has been doing very well in Q2 and Q3 based on the traditional vaccines that they
cover, all the vaccine vials that we cover there. We are working with WHO and a number of pharmaceutical
companies, logistics companies, to ensure that we are well-positioned to provide solutions with respect to
a COVID vaccine when that becomes available.

addition to the business in 2021.

Operator

Our next question will come from Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research.

Blake Geelhoed Gendron
Wolfe Research, LLC

I do want to circle back on the deal size evolution here. I know we've been talking about it this morning.
But if you were to quantify the year-over-year impact of deal mix in terms of bps or whatever, that would
be super helpful.

And then on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being pre-pandemic normalized mix versus 1 being sort of the trough
where large deals dominated in the second and third quarter, I would imagine, where do you expect the
fourth quarter to be just because you do anticipate some of the smaller deal size coming back?

And then as an offshoot to that on working capital, you offset some of the receivables friction with
payables and things like that. Are the receivables, AR, is that impacted by deal size as well, where we
should expect maybe a little bit of friction just given the mix?

Nathan Andrew Winters
Acting Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So to answer your first question around the growth we're seeing in both respect to the large and
nonlarge deals. So again, just to clarify, when we say large deals, those are greater than $1 million. In
the third quarter, the large deals grew over 35%, and our nonlarge deals were down over 15%. And that
-- hard to put a 1 through 10 classification on it. I would say, as we get into Q4, it is going to be slightly
higher large order mix than the prior year, but definitely not to the same degree as Q3, and we'd expect
that to continue to maybe go back to pre-pandemic levels as we head into 2021, as we see a gradual
recovery in the economy.

And on your last question around AR factoring. I wouldn't say that we've seen any additional friction
relative to deal size. It had a modest impact on our year-to-date cash flow, and we'd expect to see a
relatively modest impact on our full year guide.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Maybe just one more -- add to this and the prior question. So we've had a lot of focus on investors on
USPS and the impact of USPS had on our business. And U.S. is obviously a large deal, but it was not what
drove our Q3 overachievement. USPS came in very much as per our expectations.

Blake Geelhoed Gendron
Wolfe Research, LLC

Understood. I appreciate that additional color. And then a follow-up, if I could, on the regional growth, you
broke it out in the slide deck. Looks like North America, Europe, Latin America, kind of trending actually a
little bit better than maybe some of your indicators would suggest.

APAC was down pretty heavily, maybe more so than other companies have disclosed, at least directionally.
So on Asia Pacific, is the issue there, just -- first of all, is it a discrepancy? And then is it due to China
versus non-China?

Is it health of specific end markets or customers? Is there something going on with the channel inventory
levels there? I'm just trying to get a better feel for, I guess, the weakness in APAC.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Well, first, more globally, I'd say what you see globally and also in Asia Pac is some of the secular
trends that are supporting our business have accelerated as part of COVID. So around omnichannel, the
digitization and automation, those are all -- those are global trends.

And in Asia Pac, that we have -- our business has been driven more by, say, a run rate business rather
than large deals. So the run rate business in manufacturing has been larger parts of our Asia Pac business
than in other areas.

And specifically in Q3, I think the COVID-19 drove bigger declines in Southeast Asia and India, where
good parts of those countries were more or less shut down. So that was more impactful for Asia Pac. But
Asia Pac was up from -- sequentially from Q2, and China actually returned to growth.

And as I said, we have new leadership in China, a new General Manager who's doing a great job there for
us. We did also see some relative strength in Australia in Q3.

Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

I just wanted to clarify something on the USPS award. So you said you're going to wrap up most of the
deal -- or most of that award by end of Q3. I think the deal was -- the award was $570 million in total or
upwards of. I guess, what portion of that will be fully wrapped up? Because I know there's follow-on stuff
that is comprised within that $570 million.

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. I think the contract award was up to a maximum of $575 -- $570 million. I don't think at this stage,
we can give you -- I won't break out and say specifically how large the volume for the USPS will be as part
of this contract.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Also in your Q4 guide, it was a nice guide, and I think about 1/3 of your sales is EMEA, which
didn't quite rebound as much as North America, and now we're starting to see lockdowns again. So I
guess what have you contemplated in that guide? Is it conservative? And does it take into account, kind of
what's going on in Europe?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

So we feel confident in our sales guide for Q4. It reflects the positive momentum we have in the business.
We entered the quarter with a strong backlog. We had very healthy levels or lower levels of inventory in
the channel. So the quarter is actually more front-end loaded than normal. So we do see that has -- as
giving us great confidence in our guide.

But there's obviously still continued pressures from COVID and some uncertainty around this. I'd say,
though, with -- specifically to Europe and some of the lockdowns there that I think if you compare this to
April when -- or end of March when the lockdown started, I think now companies -- most of the first --
most of the lockdowns are intended to be more on the aspect of the social life rather than enterprises and
business life.

And I think companies like ourselves we have learned, I think, how to operate much better in this
environment. So I would expect that the impact of a lockdown would be less severe now, and the
lockdown would, again, I think, drive some of the trends that we've talked about around omnichannel and
buy online, pick up in-store and so forth, which would have some offsetting positive impact for us.

Our last question today will come from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

What -- when you talk about providing a full, let's call it, recurring revenue SaaS-type of solution that
you're developing going forward, which vertical markets have been -- which vertical markets do you think
have been most interested in at least talking about how to get to a, if you want to call it, a full Zebra
solution for them at this point?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

I'm not sure if I can say that any vertical has more -- been more excited about this than others. Maybe
I can say, though, that our -- if you look at some of our more recent software acquisitions like Reflexis
and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics or Profitect, as it was previously known, the primary vertical markets that
they address have been retail. So we're probably further along in retail than we are in other markets. But
I say I would highlight health care is certainly an industry or a vertical that has a lot of interest in broader
solutions and acquiring them as a service.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And a follow-up, in terms of what types of services and/or technologies might be add-on to USPS,
once you've done the first part of the contract? Would that be instructive for other -- for other areas in
which you might be able to expand your total available market?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

Yes. I'm not sure if I want to get ahead of ourselves and talk about what possible business we might win
from USPS in the future. USPS is a customer of many of our products already, so printing, scanning and
mobile computing services, some software solutions. So I see opportunities for us to engage across a
broad suite of solutions, but I don't know that I want to highlight any specific ones for you.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And just quickly, in that line of thinking on new types of technology, with regard to your mobile
scanners and with the other technologies that you're employing, have you been taking a look at the
increase in other types of identifiers, such as BLE or NFC? Other types of technologies that may be
complementary to what you're using right now?

Anders Gustafsson
CEO & Director

So I guess the broad answer will be yes. We're certainly looking at all sorts of data capture type of
technologies. And our mobile computers, many of them have NFC already. So we're always looking to see
how we can provide the right type of functionality to enable our customers to get the best ROI for those
solutions.

Joachim Heel
Senior Vice President of Global Sales

Yes. You might -- this is Joe Heel. You might remember that we introduced the proximity monitoring
solution. That's based on Bluetooth low energy, which is built into our devices. And NFC technologies, for
example, are used in solutions we have for railway ticketing. So those are all technologies we're already
using, and we think have more potential in the future.
