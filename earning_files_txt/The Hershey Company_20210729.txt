THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

First off, I guess, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the cost to serve dynamic that you talked about in
the prepared remarks. I guess it should not come as a surprise that 15% organic sales growth in a given
quarter would kind of stress any supply chain, no matter how efficient. So my question is, I guess, are
there any structural investments needed in the supply chain going forward? Or any capabilities that were
exposed by the volume spike? Or is it simply you sort of suck up the higher cost as they're transitory,
particularly the labor part and not need to necessarily make any changes as this sort of volume growth is
really not likely sustainable at these extreme elevated levels?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So Andrew, let me start, and then let me have Steve dig in with some more details. I would say at the
highest level, there are certainly key parts of our portfolio that have had just extraordinary growth, and
we cited some of the numbers, for example, on Reese's. So one thing that we are very focused on is
investing in capacity behind the brands and businesses that we know have demonstrated track records of
strong growth over time and particularly where we've seen strong spikes that we think will have continued
strength going forward. Let me have Steve talk a little bit more about some of the other elements of cost
and cost to serve.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would add to on the structural side, one of the benefits is we've been working on our Supply
Chain 2.0 program and the inbuilt fulfillment center comes online later this year. That will provide some
additional flexibility and agility. So that will certainly be helpful. And as Michele said, continuing to
invest where we need to on capacity, especially on those fast-growing core brands, like Reese's. From
a cost standpoint and getting into some of the pieces, clearly, like you said, Andrew, putting that much
pressure on the supply chain at one time pushed us in a number of spots, it pushed us from an overtime
standpoint, it pushed us from getting to contract manufacturers and expanding some of their work often
outside the contract rate and the same on the freight and warehousing side.

So I look at those as pressure points in particular on top of that or as a result of the higher volume.
And then in addition, I'd say labor rates in general and labor availability in general are a pressure points
beyond just volume. The market for labor is challenging. And so just like everyone, we want to make sure
we are staying ahead of the curve on hiring, making sure our value proposition in our plants is attractive
and packaging inflation is similar. Packaging inflation, we touched on a little bit on the last call. It's still
a pressure point. I think we're still optimistic we're going to see that moderate as we go forward, but we
haven't seen it yet. And so it is a combination of those transitory costs on the back of the higher volume
and a few things that are a little bit more sticky here as we look across the balance of the year.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then just using our back of the envelope math, it seems like the operating profit upside in the quarter
maybe is roughly offset in equal parts by higher full year tax rate and some of the higher costs that you've
talked about just now sort of leaving the full year EPS guidance intact. I just wanted to see if I had the
magnitude of each of those impacts for the full year, more or less right. It seems like they're kind of equal
magnitude essentially.

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

No, I would look at it as the tax piece was by far the biggest impact on us not taking up our earnings
guidance alongside the top line. I think, but for the tax piece, we would have raised guidance. The cost to
serve is a component, but think of that as a 10% or 15% of the impact where the majority really was the
tax impact in the quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Steve, you mentioned that there's a 130 basis point tailwind from inventory loading this quarter. You said
there'll be a de-load in the back half. Two questions on this. First, what's your best estimate for how large
the inventory reduction will be at retail in the back half? And number two, I know it's not always easy to
forecast this, but how should we think about the cadence of that? Is the majority in the third quarter or
the fourth quarter, just for modeling purposes?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think in terms of total magnitude for the back half, think 1.5 to 2 points of impact. And I would
-- I don't think we're clever enough to give you the precise quarter. I would say, look at it across both
quarters, maybe a little bit skewed to the fourth quarter.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then I think it's fair to say there's some frustration among investors this morning
that you didn't raise your EPS guidance. I recognize the $0.04 beat wasn't huge in the second quarter.
There's some uncertainty around the world in the back half of the year, but your business is doing great.
So I'm just curious, internally, was there any consideration of raising the bottom line guidance? Or did you
just feel it's a little early given some of the inflation and the macro risks?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think, again, but for the tax piece, we would have risen -- or taken up our guidance. Certainly,
there's caution in the back half relative to inflation and cost to serve. I think we have our hands around
what that looks like and have a pretty good beat on that. But if that were the only piece, we would have
taken up our guidance, but tax was really the piece that we had to take into account. And we want to
make sure we're not sacrificing investment in the back half of the year.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. For perspective, tax was $0.17 on EPS. So very meaningful.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Crédit Suisse.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

What do you think about the tax rate going forward for 2022, Steve? This looks like a onetime impact.
So do you think you'll have an easy comp in 2022? And then secondly, you talked about some of the cost
elements, some are structural, maybe some are short term. Does any of this impact how you're thinking
about pricing going forward for this year and for 2022?

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. On the tax side, we look at it as a one-off. So if we were to reset next year -- and again, we'll talk
a lot more later in the year about 2022. But as a starting point, we wouldn't factor this into the starting
point for 2022. So I hope that's helpful.

And then from a pricing standpoint, and Michele can add on here, we -- pricing is a key part of our
strategy, maintaining and growing our gross margin is a key part of our strategy. And so we are -- we
say we execute against that strategy, but we are very aware of the dynamics at play from an inflation
standpoint and so on, and what competitors are doing, what retailers are doing. So we are evaluating that
environment all the time. And as always, we're not going to kind of tip our hand as we think through it.
But pricing is and will remain a key part of our strategy going forward.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. As you recall, we did take 2 different price increases earlier this year on our confection portfolio that
will really just begin flowing through in the second half of the year, and we'll also have some upside from
that in the first half of next year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So I guess the first question is whether you can give us any thoughts on the gross margin outlook from
here. Obviously, a lot of other companies are seeing an awful lot of pressure. I remember back in 2018,
when there was freight cost inflation, I think you also saw some pressure. Input costs are going up,
packaging costs are going up, and yet you held it pretty flat this time around. So just some thoughts on
that, and then I have a follow-up.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. We were pleased with the Q2 gross margin. We were -- it was a little bit ahead of our plan. I think
we managed it well. And of course, implied inside our guidance for the balance of the year is a little
softening of the gross margin outlook from being up slightly to being in line with last year. And I think that
performance in face of the inflation that we've seen would be good. But our goal, again, looking to next
year, building on the last question a little bit is we want to continue to grow gross margin over time. And
we want to do that through a pricing strategy. We want to do that through productivity. We want to do
that through all the levers to manage inflation and commodity costs. And so driving that forward remains
an important goal. We'll give more color on next year's gross margin as we get closer to the end of the
year, but that goal remains firmly in our mind.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just a question on the Lily's acquisition. You recently sold Scharffen Berger and
Dagoba, the company has been trying to make premium work for quite some time. What's different
about Lily's that makes you confident that you can actually make that work this time versus some of the
problems that you've had in the past?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. What we really like about Lily's is it is a scale business. So it is close to that $100 million in size,
whereas Scharffen Berger and Dagoba were much smaller, in the $30 million range. And we found over

time, and I think we've shared this before, that for us, a good acquisition being around close to that $100
million mark has been built enough that we can really best apply our capabilities around distribution,
manufacturing, synergies, additional marketing, kind of more broad-based marketing, et cetera, to really
help to make the acquisition a success.

The other thing I would say is Lily's is single-mindedly focused on better-for-you. So while it is premium, it
has a very distinct understandable benefit that those consumers understand, which is about being the lack
of sugar. So that also gives us a lot of confidence, but it fits very neatly into our operating model. As you
know, we have already launched a broader portfolio of better-for-you on our core brands. And so that will
-- better-for-you area is a big point of focus for us, and there's some nice synergy in terms of our focus
there.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just curious how you think about elasticity. And I know it can be hard to measure. The ways we've tried
to come at it, you tend to score quite well. Does that -- is that your sense as well? And how do you
think about that in terms of your pricing, how aggressive you may try to be or not be and just how you
anticipate the consumer response to that?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We have seen -- we have a very complex and sophisticated price elasticity models where we look not
only at price points within our own category, price gaps, price thresholds also with around other snack
items as well. And I think over time, I think we've consistently seen that our business, our brand and our
category tend to be on the less-elastic side versus perhaps some other categories, which is what gives us
confidence in pricing power and the ability to take price when we feel it is the right time.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on Reese's. Can you give a sense for the organic Reese's launch?
Just how that might be tracking versus your expectations? And maybe a little bit of how it compares
from a margin perspective. It looks like with its price point, it's probably pretty nicely accretive. Is that
directionally correct?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So it is performing in line with our expectations. It is early days, but it's absolutely in line with what we
expected. It is really in kind of a test-and-learn phase as we move forward. And it's not, I would say, a big
material piece of our better-for-you launch at this point in time as organic is a little bit more of a targeted
offering than, say, Zero Sugar or sugar free.

Yes. And to your second part of your question, from a margin perspective, we do charge a higher price
point for it, but it also does cost more, obviously. So the margins are comparable to the core.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ed Zaslow (sic) [ Ken Zaslow ] with Bank of Montreal.

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

I had just 2 quick questions. One is the tax -- is it a cash item or a noncash item? And then the second
thing I'll ask is, implicitly, you're actually raising the EBITDA, which is more cash oriented. Am I not
understanding it correctly?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

So the first question is, for the second quarter, it's noncash, but a portion will become or could become
cash in the balance of the year and a portion will probably be noncash for the balance of the year. So it is
a mix of both for the balance of the year. On your second question, yes, you're thinking about it the right
way from an EBITDA standpoint.

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And then just a follow-up on this. The magnitude of the increase on the EBITDA exceeds the amount
of cash that will be needed to pay the taxes. Is that a fair way? And then I'll leave it there. I just want to
make sure I understand the tax units. It just seems like it's more -- cash flow is actually coming up, not
going down based on what you're saying. I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, that's true. But I'd say the caveat is time, right? So if you're looking at a longer period of time, it's
more possible that a portion of that reserve could be some cash. And so if you're looking at next quarter
or the balance of the year, that might lead you to one answer. If you're looking at the next 2 years, it
could be a different answer.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I guess I wanted to maybe follow up a little bit on Andrew's kind of questioning at the beginning. And
Michele, maybe just stepping back a little bit, in this environment, right, where we're seeing not just
higher cost inflation, but in addition to that, with effectively labor shortages, right, when we've seen this
across a lot of the companies in our coverage universe. So I guess I had 2 questions related to that. One
is if supply chains are kind of running all out, just how you think about stimulating demand when there's
some challenges in terms of just getting product on the shelf?

And I guess the second is just as you step back and you look at all these different dynamics in the
economy and the environment in general, it's definitely a situation that is in some ways unique. So
just your perspective, have you seen some of this before? And maybe just how you're thinking about
approaching planning for the business over the next, I don't know, 12 to 24 months, if we continue to be
in this type of environment?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. It's certainly something that we spend a lot of time thinking about and working on. And I guess what
I would say is, yes, we do realize that it is somewhat of a volatile time still, certainly with all the talk of
the Delta variant and CDC guidance recently. So too much of a reminder that we clearly aren't fully out of
the pandemic. And I personally believe, in September, we know that a lot of companies are implementing
kind of a return to office. It seems like a lot of companies are doing that then, kids going back to school.
And so there will be more for all of us to learn about consumer behaviors and what some of those changes
mean for that.

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

The way that we think about the supply chain and managing where we are right now is, I guess, in a
couple of ways. So how do we maximize -- how do we efficiently maximize and profitably maximize
revenue. And so one of the key things we do focus on is really looking across the portfolio and focusing on
really maxing out where we have available capacity and leaning into some of those brands and businesses
with greater investment, reallocating investment to those businesses so that we can really take full
advantage of that.

If there are areas in the portfolio where we -- like a Reese's, for example. I think we keep pointing it
out as an example because it's such a big piece of our business and growing at such a hefty rate. We
have total confidence making big capacity investments on that one just because of the track record and
the dynamics around that. And then -- so we'll invest in capacity as a piece of that. And then there are
parts of the portfolio where we're not going to lean in right away in investing capacity because we want
things to play out a bit here more. So we really leverage the breadth, one of the strengths we have is
the breadth of our portfolio. We've got our seasonal portfolio. It's the consumable take home. We have a
range of different brands. And so we really try and leverage that as best possible to manage through.

So it's kind of a balance of investing to build supply chain even stronger, which we're always doing, but
we're doing even more of that right now. Doing what we need now, kind of no regret move and then
planning for the future from a contingency perspective, depending on what the potential outcomes are.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And if I could just follow up with one quick one. Just as you -- as you've sold in merchandising for
holidays in the back half of the year and maybe just more in general, has -- have service levels come up
more as a sort of a factor that retailers are focusing on, like you can sell a program or they can take a
program, but are they more sensitive to actually wanting to be in stock? Is that becoming more of a sort
of a factor in that decision-making right now?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, I mean I would say absolutely. I mean retailers were under tremendous pressure this past year with
all of the huge shifts that COVID caused on many manufacturers' businesses. And they had, as we all
know, tremendous issues with out of stocks. And so their goal is to make sure they remain in stock. In
fact, right now, we've seen retailers really lean in a bit to inventory and carry a bit more inventory than
they have in the past because I think there's a little bit of a scarcity mentality. They want to make sure
they have product. They also know that manufacturers are taking price. And so in some cases, it may
allow them to hedge a little bit there.

So I think it is definitely a focal area and, of course, something that we always focus on and are proud of
how we've been able to deliver for retailers because they've continued to come to us, given how we were
able to deliver during the worst of the pandemic last year and have continued to rely on us this year.

[Operator Instructions] It seems there are no other questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to Ms.
