Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone
As Jim mentioned, the strength of our operating results in the second quarter can be seen most directly by looking at our cash flow from operations and free cash flow
In the second quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $813 million compared to $762 million in the second quarter of 2016. That's an increase of $51 million or almost 7% in spite of an additional $83 million in cash taxes
The significant increase in cash from operations for the quarter is the result of two things: operating EBITDA growth of $78 million or about 8%, and our disciplined focus on improving our working capital metrics
We're particularly pleased with the operating leverage that we can see in our cash flow from operations conversion metrics
In the first half of 2017, our operating cash flow as a percentage of revenues has been consistently over 22%, which is a 400 basis point improvement in the measure over our long-term average
Both capital expenditures and proceeds from divestitures were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, so the growth in cash flow from operations converted straight through to free cash flow growth
We continue to expect the $100 million to $150 million increase in capital expenditures in 2017 as compared to last year, and our full year capital expenditure guidance is unchanged
Due to the timing of truck purchases and certain other project spending, we expect this increase to impact our free cash flow in the back half of the year
We generated $520 million of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $59 million or 12.8% from the second quarter of 2016. For the first half of the year, we've generated over $900 million of free cash flow, putting us well on our way to meeting the upper end of our 2017 free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion
The growth in free cash flow positions us to continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and to fund acquisitions
In the second quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our outstanding stock, paid $187 million in dividend, and funded $41 million in tuck-in acquisitions
We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that prioritizes using 100% of our free cash flow to pay our dividend, execute strategic acquisitions, and buy back our stock
We will do this in a disciplined way to continue to deliver the best return on invested capital in the industry
Our record high free cash flow in the first half of the year and the positive outlook we have for the remainder of 2017 and beyond supports the continued execution of our capital allocation plan
And so, in the third quarter, we plan to enter into agreements to repurchase an additional $500 million of our stocks, representing our remaining current year authorization for share buyback
Our disciplined management of SG&A costs also benefited our results for the quarter
For the second quarter of 2017, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.6%, which is a 30 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $353 million in the second quarter of 2017 or $13 million higher than in the prior year period
The second quarter increase is largely attributable to revenue and earnings growth, which drove up our incentive compensation cost and commission
We are successfully offsetting some of these cost increases by improving process efficiency
And we will continue to drive down SG&A as a percent of revenue by better leveraging our fixed costs
We remain confident that for the full year, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue will approach 10%, which would represent a 40 basis point improvement compared to the full year of 2016. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants remained at 2.4 at the end of the second quarter, indicating that we have a strong balance sheet and are well positioned for strategic acquisitions at the right price
Our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 4.2% and 12% of our total debt portfolio was at variable rates
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was approximately 36.6%, which is in line with our expected full year 2017 adjusted tax rate of about 36.5%
Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 34.7%
The increase in our tax rate from 2016 is largely due to growth in our pre-tax earnings, which is meeting the benefits of tax credits
The higher tax rate impacted EPS by $0.02 per share
In summary, the first half of 2017 has shown the combined value of our focus on executing our core operating objectives: generating price, growing profitable volumes, and continuous cost improvement
I want to thank all members of the Waste Management team, the best employees in the industry, as once again they have executed extremely well
They delivered fantastic results so far in 2017, and we are well on our way to achieving our 2017 goal
With that, Marcus, let's open the line for questions Question-and-Answer Session
So, to follow-on with the 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement that you referenced, when we think about that, it really was going to come from two places, and we're seeing both execution in both of those things in the first half of the year
And we expect that to continue
And the two places that was going to come from, and we're seeing results, are core solid waste business improvement to operating expense margin; and then secondarily, SG&A cost control driving margin improvement there
So, what Jim and Jim just described was a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin for our core solid waste operations, and then we saw a 30 basis point improvement in our SG&A cost in the quarter
So, those two things together get us to the top end of that 50 to 100 basis point range
You're exactly right, Hamzah
With the free cash flow conversion that we saw in the second quarter, what we're really focused on is the positive trend that we're seeing of conversion, of revenue dollars, EBITDA dollars to free cash flow
We tend to focus more on the cash flow from operation piece because of the lumpiness of capital expenditures and just timing differences that can affect that
Our capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, we still target that at about 9% to 10% of revenue
And we were a little below that in the second quarter
And if you were to have normalized that, we would have still seen some really positive flow-through and continued execution of our focus on taking revenue dollars and putting them through to the bottom line, but what we think is important is to look at that cash flow from operations metric
And as I said, that increased to over 22% of revenue in the quarter and for the full year
And when we look at what's driving that, it's two things
It's operating EBITDA growth and it's our focus on working capital
We do think that the focus on working capital will continue to provide us benefits, but we're more focused on that core solid waste operating performance, driving free cash flow and cash from operations growth over the long-term
So, as a reminder, in the first quarter, we had a couple of headwinds on a year-over-year basis that aren't going to repeat throughout the remainder of the year
And those two things were severance costs and then a higher year-over-year comparison in how we accrue our incentive compensation costs
And so when you normalize for those two things and think about really what we demonstrated in more of a normal quarter and second quarter, we are confident that we'll get better performance in the third and fourth quarters than what you've seen in the first half of the year
So, a piece of that incentive compensation accrual in the first part of the year has to do with a timing difference that will benefit the fourth quarter
And so that is a piece of this
But then, as I mentioned, we're seeing some process efficiency opportunities that continue to give us confidence that we're going to be able to reduce some of our general overhead costs, as we look for more efficient ways to carry out processes, things we've mentioned in the past, our call volumes as an example
And as we're driving more and more customers to do business with us through the e-commerce platform, we're able to reduce the number of calls that come to our call centers
And things like that are going to reduce our costs over – both the second half of the year and as we look forward
So, our authorization for the current year was $750 million
So, the $500 million that we'll spend in the third quarter will take us to 100% of that authorization
We'll continue to look at our free cash flow allocation as we discuss future authorizations with the board going forward
And we typically do that in the fourth quarter
With regard to our leverage, 2.4 times is low historically when you look at Waste Management, but what we focus on is the fact that that's a healthy balance sheet that positions us for opportunity
And so we don't anticipate that we're going to reduce our debt balances in absolute dollars, but you could see the leverage balance, or the leverage metric reduce over time as EBITDA continues to grow
We really see opportunistic balance sheet – a well-structured balance sheet as something that gives us opportunity to look for strategic M&A that's priced well
And we think that that combined with our free cash flow really positions us to execute upon that if it presents itself
I can tell you that I -
I can't tell you that I followed the numbers specifically, but I can tell you that the 70 basis point improvement is the number that we have calculated internally
Absolutely
And, Michael, I think – part of the conversation with flow-through of that revenue growth through to the bottom line, whether it be the EBITDA measures or the free cash flow measures
And so, what you can see is that this volume growth is coming in with very strong flow-through in both the collection and landfill lines of business and providing revenue growth that is so accretive from a margin expansion perspective and generating a free cash flow conversion that we expect
So, we were at about $130 a ton on an average basis in the first part of the year
I don't have last year's numbers at my fingertips, but Ed will be happy to get those to you
And what I would point out is the fuel tax credits that we've talked about all year, that's a $0.04 impact on a year-over-year basis that was not included in our guidance for the year
So, that is an element of softness that we didn't anticipate
But if you back out the impact of the impairment and the fuel tax credit on the second quarter, our EPS growth was 12% on a year-over-year basis
So, we certainly are happy with the performance
And as Jim said, $3.18 EPS target for the year is definitely an optimistic view compared to where we started this year when we set guidance
Well, we certainly – it's interesting because we look at that same math
And when we look at 2017 and how it compares to 2016, the year-over-year comparison, you're spot on that it's most difficult in doing that math and just applying it consistently on a year-over-year basis, is the recycling impacts that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year
And the recycling benefits have been more heavily weighted toward the first half of this year
And so, it's difficult to just apply that math in the current year without adjusting for the recycling impact
And we continue to prioritize return on invested capital when we make those decisions
