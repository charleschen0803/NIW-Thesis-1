Hi, thank you Bill
Good morning everybody, thank you for joining us this morning
I’ll begin on slide 4. Our net interest margin improved one basis point this quarter which helped to drive the $28 million increase in net interest income
As anticipated, deposits betas did increase but much of the sequential change was due to a one time reprising of certain suite deposits and brokerage accounts in late June
Therefore, while betas will likely continue to nudge upward overtime, the slope of increase will not match this quarter’s level
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect the net interest margin to decline by one to three basis points
This is consistent with our view that NIM grind down in quarters without a rate hike given lagging deposit costs and sprint compression in the C&I book, which is partially offset by continued positive mix shift in the overall portfolio
Beyond that, NIM trends will depend on the rate environment and we expect some NIM expansion as the short-end of the curve continues to rise
Moving to slide 5, you will see that non-interest income increased by $19 million sequentially primarily driven by our continued success in meeting the capital markets needs of more clients across the entire wholesale platform
This quarter specifically, capital markets related income increased to $24 million sequentially largely due to M&A and equity which both had record quarters, a great sign of SunTrust’s increasing strategic relevance with our clients
Across the capital markets platform, we’re encouraged not only by our current success, but also by the significant growth opportunities that remain as we leverage our competitive advantage to expand and deepen relationships with our investment banking, commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth clients
Mortgage related income was also up by $7 million sequentially as a result of improved gain on sale margins
These gains were partially offset by lower commercial real estate related income given slower levels of activity
But we do expect that to rebound in the fourth quarter
Let’s move on to expenses on slide 6. Expenses were stable relative to the prior quarter and as Bill mentioned, we did have some discrete items
First, several legacy legal matters were resolved in the third quarter, which totaled up to $58 million of legal accrual reversals
These benefits were largely absorbed by several discrete charges, including an elevated severance accrual
In addition, we also wrote down certain software related assets, as we accelerate technology enabled efficiency initiatives, particularly our transition to the cloud
Our strong overall business performance also resulted in increased incentive compensation expense this quarter
Compared to the prior year, expenses declined by $18 million, due to improved expense discipline and ongoing efficiency initiatives
In particular outside processing and software declined by $22 million, partially as a result of increased focus on third-party costs
As you will see on slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 59.2%
This includes the net result of discrete benefits and charges recognized in the quarter and I am pleased to note that our core efficiency as a company continues to improve
Clearly the efficiency initiatives we have been executing against for many years, are driving positive operating leverage and there is still more progress to be made
Across the company we are demonstrating heightened focused and vigor around reducing less productive expenses to provide funding for investments in talent, technology and improved product offerings, while also achieving our goal of a sub 60% tangible efficiency ratio by 2019. Moving to slide eight
Our asset quality metrics remain strong, evidenced by only 21 basis points of net charge-offs and 48 basis points of non-performing loans
These low levels reflect the relative strength we are seeing across our entire portfolio
The ALLL ratio increased by 3 basis points this quarter, as a result of anticipated losses from the recent hurricanes
As it relates to hurricane impacts, there will be a modest uptick in NPLs and charge-offs over the next several quarters, primarily driven by consumer and residential loans
In advance of that, this expectation is incorporated into this quarter's allowance bill
Overall, we still expect to operate within a 25 basis points to 35 basis points net charge off ratio over the near term, and also continue to forecast the provision level that should roughly approximate net charge-offs
Let’s take a look at the balance sheet on slide nine
Average loans were stable sequentially, as growth in consumer lending offset declines in C&I
On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew 2%, with broad based growth across most consumer lending products
As Bill mentioned earlier, C&I loan balances have been declining, as solid core production is being masked by lower revolver utilization and elevated paydowns
Conversely, we are benefiting from this to some extent, within the capital market business, a good representation of our broad and diverse capabilities
That being said, we are having good dialogue with our clients, as clarity on various policy front develops, we believe our clients will be ready to invest and we are well positioned to meet their needs, whether buy a lending, capital markets or other solutions
Turning to deposits, average client deposits were stable sequentially, and up 3% year-over-year, with growth across most products and both segments
Period imbalances were up 2%, largely due to temporary corporate deposits
Consistent with our commentary in July, the strong deposit growth we've produced over the past several years, in addition to our access to low cost funding, enables us to prudently manage our funding base, and therefore more effectively managed our overall deposit beta
Our goal continues to be to maximize our value proposition outside of [repeat], by meeting more of our clients' needs, via strategic investments in talent and technology
Slide 11 provides an update to our capital position
Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phase-in basis was 9.5%, stable with the prior quarter, even after we commenced our 2017 capital plan, which provided for 54% increase in the dividend and a 38% increase in share repurchases
As a reminder, we issued $750 million of preferred stock in May, and we may look to take advantage of strong market conditions to further optimize our capital stack over the coming quarters
Also, late in the third quarter, the Federal Reserve released the notice of proposed rulemaking, tailored towards simplifying capital rules for regional banks like SunTrust
While we do not currently expect the changes to materially impact our fully phased-in capital ratios, the rules combined with recent legislative proposals in the house incentive, are commendable steps towards tailoring regulation to the actual risk profile and complexity of regulated banks
Efforts we strongly encourage, given our simple and domestic business model
Let’s take a look at the segment reviews, beginning with Consumer on slide 12, where we continued to deliver healthy overall business and revenue momentum
Our 2% sequential revenue growth was largely driven by net interest income, which was up 3% and 8% year-over-year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, in addition to continued improvements in loan mix
Our targeted investment in consumer lending are consistently yielding good results, and offsetting the declines in home equity balances, evidenced by the 2% sequential and 4% year-over-year increase in average loans
Non-interest income was down 15% year-over-year, largely due to the lower mortgage related income, given the elevated refinancing activity we saw last year
But more recently mortgage related income has begun to stabilized, which drove the 2% sequential increase in non-interest income
Within [indiscernible] particularly, we’re pleased with the improved momentum we have developed as well as management related revenues beginning to stabilized and to grow slightly
This is a reflection of our client first focus and continued improvement in capabilities, resulting in our ability to attract and retaining top talent and grow AUM
More specifically in the past few months, we've hired teams in New York and Texas, which contributes further to our ability to grow AUM and expands our geographic reach
Provision expense did increase on a sequential and year-over-year basis largely due to the reserve build associated with hurricanes in addition to strong loan growth
The hurricanes will also modestly pressure revenue in the coming quarters given relief we’re providing for certain clients by waiving fees and providing payment forbearance consistent with our purpose oriented culture
This increase in provision was largely offset by the legal accrual reversals which was the primary driver of the decline in expenses
Overall, we’re making progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the consumer segment evidence in part by continued growth in mobile engagement and usage and the 7% year-over-year reduction in branch cut
Our ongoing process of integrating mortgage into consumer will also yield further results
By bringing all consumer products and services under one segment, we will be able to create an enhanced client centric approach resulting in a more efficient, effective and improved client experience
Moving on to wholesale, we delivered record quarterly revenue and net income in part due to strong markets conditions and a benign credit environment but also reflective of the continued strategic momentum we’re having with our clients
Quarterly revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time and was up 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, primarily due to the combined strength of investment banking and trading
Growth in investment banking was broad based across most products and client segments
More specifically, M&A and equity two businesses which have been key areas of investment for us each have a record quarter
As we continue to become a more relevant strategic advisor to our clients, we’re not only growing these two advisory businesses at a faster pace than the traditional debt businesses, we’re also increasing our average fee per transaction and reducing our reliance on providing balance sheet, thereby improving our return on equity
In fact, CIB’s ROE in the third quarter was 13.5%
Net interest income was also a key contributor to the strong revenue growth, up 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, as a result of improved loan yields and continued discipline on overall returns
Despite record revenue, non-interest expense was stable sequentially and up 8% compared to the prior year as a result of higher compensation tied to strong revenue growth, the acquisition of Pillar and ongoing investments in technology
Specifically, our new loan origination platform is now fully deployed to commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth management with deployments to CIB scheduled in early 2018. We also continue to roll out our new treasury and payments platform [indiscernible] to more clients
As a reminder, we announced the sale of our insurance premium finance business back in September and the transaction is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter
This is a solid performing business but does not fit with our broader wholesale banking strategy and capabilities
And we'll provide details on the financial impact after the transaction closes
But we do not expect it to be material to SunTrust’s overall financial performance and trajectory
In conclusion, while market conditions can drive quarterly variability, our differentiated business model and wholesale banking continues to deliver strong results and we expect to see further growth in 2018, particularly if economic growth accelerates and we gain greater clarity around tax refund
Additionally, as you may have seen, we have recently announced an expansion of the commercial banking business in to new markets in Ohio and Texas
Given the success that we have had in wholesale, our commercial banking business is following our investment banking and corporate banking businesses into new and high growth markets
Now let me turn the call back over to Bill
We’re thinking something in the mid-20s John
If I look at our cumulative beta over the last couple of years just on interest bearing deposits, its 17% and we think it is going to continue to nudge up a little bit over time
So not sure exactly where it's going to be but we’re modeling something into the 20s now
Ken, as you know, there is a little bit of seasonality in that business and Q4 is normally a little bit better
So, we are optimistic that Q4 will be better than Q3.
Well for efficiency, overall you know where we are headed
The targets that we’ve set for ourselves and we’re working towards those and we’re working towards those and making investments in both areas, as you said consumer and commercial
I guess first of all, in technology, we’re making investments in consumer technology and you’re going to see some of those actually show up this quarter in the payment space in consumer with the introduction of a new consumer payment product, and in commercial, some of the investments we’ve made have actually just shown up in treasury and payment solutions with the introduction of SunView which we’re rolling out across our commercial client base in several ways, some of which have already been implemented and some of which go into Q4 and Q1. So those are a couple of examples of investments that we’ve made in technology in each one of those spaces in which we’ll continue to improve efficiency
I think in other areas Betsy you know that the severance chart that we took in the third quarter, we continue to take a look at it as you would expect, add our total amount of overall business, how our clients are reacting, what it is that they expect from us, and how we respond to that across all kinds of distribution channels, including the human one, and as we think about sort of overall skillsets needed and total amount of team in responding to clients in each of those spaces, we continue to make improvements in structuring the efficiency of each of our businesses from both a front and back office perspective
So, all of that is underway now
Great, thanks Marty
Absolutely between the second and the third quarter you did see a move up in all of those spaces which we expected coming into this quarter given that we’ve got a rate hike in June
So as a result of that rate hike, we were expecting our overall NIM to climb just a little bit this quarter as it did
But in quarters without a rate hike, those are the quarters where we’re looking for NIM to probably grind down a little bit and again not substantially, we’re thinking one to three basis points but we’re grinding down primarily on the asset side is the lone turnover in C&I and where cost is a little bit on the liability side is a little bit of that normal delay you get in deposit repricing in quarters without a rate hike and that’s just from a maths perspective results in a little bit of beta and a little bit of downward pressure on that
Yeah, typically I would think about that as generally on the order of three basis points in that first quarter after a rate hike depending of course on when the rate hike is in the quarter and what we are thinking of Erica in terms of a number of rate hikes for 2018 or let’s say between now and the end of ’18 as we’re thinking there is probably going to be two
So, over the course of the next 15 months, as we put together our plan right now for 2018 we’re going to be incorporating two rate hikes in that plan
I think the other point to think about also is remember Q1 is also is kind of always a weird quarter in terms of day count and is a little bit beneficial in terms of NIM because of Q1 day count every year
So, let me start-off with the efficiency ratio point
Yes, there was a big improvement in efficiency ratio quarter-on-quarter, but that’s really caused by or really benefited by the reversal of those legal accruals, several of the items that we settled during the quarter were legacy items that dated back several years, relating to mortgage and one of those benefited the efficiency ratio for consumer for the quarter
So, I wouldn’t think about a core efficiency ratio for consumer as 62 immediately, we’re working obviously to get there and better overtime, but I wouldn’t think of that as a Q4 automatic number
Yeah Mike, think of LightStream as a whole new distribution channel, a digital channel for connecting with clients and potential clients all over the country, rather than a replacement for the brand channel
