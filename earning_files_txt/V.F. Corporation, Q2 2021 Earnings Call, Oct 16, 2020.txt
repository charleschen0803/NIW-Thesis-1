Presentation

Operator

Hello and welcome to the VF Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions]

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Alkire, Vice President, Investor Relations, Corporate
Development and Treasury. Please go ahead, sir.

Joe Alkire
VP of Corporate Development, Treasury & Investor Relations

Good morning, and welcome to VF Corporation's Second Quarter Fiscal '21 Conference Call. Participants
on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations
and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are
detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.

Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today's call will be on an adjusted constant dollar basis,
which we define in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted constant dollar
amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true
operational performance and underlying results of our business.

You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations
of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in
the release which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this
information is useful to investors.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company determined that the Occupational Workwear business met
the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, the company has reported
the related assets and liabilities of the Occupational Workwear business in discontinued operations as of
the date noted above and included the operating results of this business in discontinued operations for
all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing
operations.

Joining me on today's call will be VF's Chairman, President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and CFO, Scott Roe.
Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter call. As always, I hope my
comments this morning find you and your loved ones healthy and safe.

For those of you that have stayed close to the VF story, you are familiar with our now and next approach
in navigating the most challenging days of the pandemic while also preparing ourselves to emerge
stronger within what we believe will be a new normal environment. While the global pandemic continues
and certain geopolitical uncertainties persist, I believe we are officially entering the next. That isn't to say
the challenges brought about by the global pandemic are behind us. In fact, we expect the impact of this
crisis to be prolonged, requiring us to remain agile and adaptable to whatever may come our way. We
should accept that uncertainty, change and the need to operate in an increasingly volatile world is what
the next is all about, and it presents great opportunity for our company and our strong portfolio of brands.

Fortunately, because of the continued dedication, commitment and perseverance of our associates across
the enterprise, we are entering the next from a position of strength.

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Throughout today's call, I hope you can sense that we are pleased with the stabilization and early recovery
we're beginning to see across the entirety of our business. And with this confidence, we have decided to
increase our dividend for the 48th consecutive year. We are increasingly confident with our positioning
as we head into the next year and the opportunity to drive our portfolio against our long-term vision and
commitment to top-quartile value creation. Our success is anchored in our strong financial underpinnings
evident in how we've managed the heightened uncertainty of the past 10 months.

VF has always been known for its industry-leading operational rigor and financial discipline. Our
proactive measures to protect our people, strengthen liquidity, manage inventories and prudently control
discretionary spending have allowed us to continue investing in what matters most in this environment.
The capabilities required to ensure that our consumers not only transact directly with us but that we
can maintain ongoing direct relationships with them, further strengthening the affinity they have for our
brands.

We're using our position of strength to continue playing offense to ensure we are able to regain the strong
momentum we had heading into the crisis. We are focusing our investments behind our transformation
to become more consumer minded, retail centric and hyper-digital in everything we do. Our investment
priorities for this year balance near-term, brand-specific initiatives with longer-term, enterprise-wide
platform investments that create leveraged capabilities to deliver greater value. These priorities were
pressure-tested during the early days of the pandemic, and we quickly aligned on the right mix of
priorities to maintain strong near-term momentum while we execute our plan for long-term value creation.

The long-term strategic vision guiding our actions is not new. It was set in motion nearly 4 years ago
with the launch of our strategy, and I'm pleased with how far we've come on our transformation journey.
Through thoughtful and disciplined investments in talent, digital infrastructure and ongoing strategic
repositioning over the past 4 years, we have evolved VF from a wholesale-dominated business with
only 5% digital revenue to a streamlined portfolio with over 40% D2C and more than 25% total digital
penetration.

The evolution of our business has been accelerated through active portfolio management, which will
continue to be our first strategic priority. Following the divestiture of our Occupational Workwear
portfolio, our operating model simplifies further to 12 brands with the greatest capacity to thrive in our
hyper-digital, retail-centric enterprise, yet another milestone in VF's strategic and disciplined portfolio
transformation.

Scott will cover our Q2 results and full year outlook in more detail, but I'd like to share a few highlights
around 2 of our most critical strategic pillars: digital and China.

Looking back at the building blocks of our 2024 plan, over half of VF's planned revenue and earnings
growth over the 5-year period came from these 2 growth drivers. We knew entering this crisis that digital
and China would help us weather the storm and drive accelerated growth on the other side.

As the year has progressed, we continue to gain confidence from the momentum of these key growth
engines. Our digital businesses grew 42% in the quarter, with strength across regions and brands. We also
continue to see strength in key digital wholesale accounts, particularly internationally. Together with digital
pure-play wholesale, our total digital penetration was nearly 25% in the quarter.

I'd like to spend a few minutes unpacking our digital momentum across our largest brands. Vans digital
business grew 49% as the brand continues to engage with consumers by providing new content and
activities to deepen consumer connectivity through purpose and creativity. The brand's deep connection
is reflected in continued improvements in loyalty and member engagement. The portion of Vans Family
members transacting on vans.com has doubled relative to Q2 last year, with loyalty members accounting
for nearly half of U.S. D2C sales. Continued advancement in the Customs platform also remains a
differentiator for the brand, enabling more unique creative journeys of co-creation With Our consumers,
driving significant increases in dwell time and engagement. Coming next month, Vans will be the first
major global brand to offer customization on Tmall, a testament to the scale and sophistication of the
Customs platform and the strength of Vans relationship with one of our most valued digital partners.

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

The North Face also saw strong digital growth across regions, up 40% globally. The brand continued to
connect with consumers through engaging, purpose-led marketing activations, including The North Face
Summer Base Camp, Walls Are Meant for Climbing and The North Face-Girl Scouts partnership. Recent
high-profile collabs, including the announcement of our first-ever collaboration with Gucci, also contributed
to brand heat and engagement. Digital loyalty members increased over 20% as the brand continues to
attract new female and younger consumer cohorts.

Timberland's digital business increased 62% in the quarter. In the Americas, recent high-profile influencer
adoption and the Jimmy Choo collaboration contributed to strong brand interest over the quarter, driving
90% consumer acquisition growth with our data platform. We are encouraged by the brand's recent
momentum, including the brand heat outside of just core classics. The brand delivered a successful
nonclassics digital launch in China called My First Eco Kicks Madbury campaign, which drove a nearly
270% increase in traffic on Tmall during the event.

And finally, Dickies generated 34% digital growth with momentum from both core Work and Work-inspired
categories. Brand interest accelerated in the quarter to multiyear highs, supported by engaging online
maker workshops and the launch of the brand's first-ever global campaign, United by Dickies.

Collectively, our big 4 brands achieved digital growth of nearly 50% this quarter. The brand's continued
momentum, in addition to ongoing improvements in digital consumer engagement, give us confidence in
our fiscal 2021 target of greater than 40% digital growth and 25% digital penetration for the year.

Moving on to China, which we continue to view as the leading indicator for the recovery path of our other
regions. Our business returned to positive growth in Mainland China last quarter and has accelerated
to 19% in Q2, driving our Asia Pacific region to overall positive growth. Consumer resilience and
confidence remains strong, particularly with brands able to engage in new and effective ways through
digital channels and through an elevated brick-and-mortar shopping experience. Our performance in
China was led by 25% growth at Vans and nearly 60% growth at Dickies. We're also excited about the
appointment of Winnie Ma as our first President of Greater China. Winnie's deep experience in the region
and understanding of the Chinese consumer will help us accelerate our growth strategy in this fast-paced,
digitally driven marketplace. China presents a tremendous opportunity for VF and our brands, and Winnie
is an ideal leader to drive this growth.

Moving on to the global consumer. It is evident that secular trends in fitness, health and wellness,
casualization and the desire to get outdoors and live an active lifestyle are accelerating. Our portfolio
of brands sits at the epicenter of these fundamental tailwinds, which will be a meaningful contributor to
growth in the years to come. Our consumer insights are also increasingly pointing to another fundamental
change, which may be less apparent to those outside of our sector: consumers are increasingly expecting
brands to use their business as a force for good.

Consumers are prioritizing purchases that align with their values. Our research shows that over 2/3 of
Millennials and Gen-Z have changed their purchasing habits due to climate change. And by 2027, we
believe this generation will account for 2/3 of apparel and footwear revenue in the U.S. The combination
of our exposure to large, growing addressable markets as well as our brand's purpose-led positioning give
the VF portfolio a unique opportunity to thrive in this evolving consumer environment.

The VF and our brands continue to take a leadership position within our industry on matters related
to inclusion, diversity and racial equity. We recently published our second annual Inclusion & Diversity
Annual Profile, which I encourage you to review on our website. Additionally, our brands are stepping
up and activating their own programs to address racism and engage their consumers in the process.
The Vans brand recently announced their specific commitments, and the Timberland brand just began
communicating their own initiative, Operation Purpose, which focuses on 4 pillars to fight systemic
racism inside the workplace and the community at large: people, community, design education and
entrepreneurship. I'm incredibly proud of the way VF and our brand teams have responded to the racial
and social issues that plague our world. I look forward to providing continued updates on the progress and
positive impact we make.

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Before concluding my prepared remarks, I want to provide some additional context to the organizational
structure announcement made earlier this week. Given our continued focus on our transformation, we're
taking steps to further refine our operating model to become an integrated brand building company. As we
do this, we know that our brand's success requires differentiated approaches based on the unique profiles
and opportunities. To support this work, we are evolving our organizational framework and have begun to
map our leadership to the structure of Core Brands and Emerging Brands.

Core Brands, traditionally referred to as our global brands, are large brands that are significant financial
drivers for VF. Vans, The North Face and Timberland are VF's Core Brands today. Emerging Brands are
brands that present strong potential to become a Core Brand by accelerating consumer acquisition and
loyalty through differentiated growth strategies and capabilities, geographies and new categories.

It has become evident over time that Emerging Brands require a more agile operating model than our
largest brands. They require a different playbook driven by an emphasis on continuous learning and
testing. We see our Emerging Brands as being the ideal proving ground for VF in terms of consumer,
product and talent strategies.

These organizational actions are an important beginning to what we're calling Project Enable, a multiyear
initiative designed to enable our ability to accelerate and advance our business model transformation
and position ourselves to drive long-term growth for all of our brands. We'll do this by evolving the
organizational designs for our enterprise-led functions and Core and Emerging Brands to ensure we have
the right structures, capabilities, resources and talent in the right place to propel us forward. One of the
key objectives of Enable is to deliver global cost savings of about $125 million over a 3- year period. These
savings will be used to fuel our transformation agenda and highest-priority growth drivers. We are highly
confident that these changes and our strong group of leaders will help us move forward toward this vision.

And now I will turn it over to Scott.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. With the first half of our fiscal year behind us, I'm proud
of our execution and optimistic about the stabilization and early signs of recovery we see across our
business. Our year-to-date results have surpassed our internal expectations across all brands driven by
our key growth pillars, digital and China. We have a great handle on inventories, both owned and across
the wholesale marketplace. And last but not least, we continue to see strong engagement between our
brands and a relatively resilient global consumer.

We were quick to act in the early days of the pandemic to put our people first, strengthen liquidity,
manage costs and tightly control inventories, thus positioning our brands to exit this period of disruption in
an advantaged position.

Our financial and operational discipline has provided VF with the ability to continue to invest in consumer
engagement and product newness throughout this crisis while rolling out critical omnichannel capabilities
ahead of the fall holiday season.

Before covering the details of our second quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the current state of
our business and operating environment by region. I'll start with APAC.

China continues to lead our recovery, growing 14% in the quarter, including 19% in the mainland, as
our stores were essentially open throughout the period. Our relationships with partners in the regions
remain strong, and we continue to expand partner doors in Mainland China, led by Dickies and Vans. We
continue to enhance the synergies between our brands and our digital wholesale partners, continuously
developing our digital ecosystem in the region to elevate the shopper experience and seamless online-to-
offline integration.

We are pleased with the steady recovery in EMEA, where most markets outperformed expectations in Q2.

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Our retail business returned to growth with D2C up 6%, led by 54% growth in digital as our stores have
fully reopened. Traffic remains depressed across countries, but we continue to see much stronger in-store
conversion. During the quarter, we continued our rollout of omnichannel capabilities, activating ship from
store and Buy Online Pickup In Store at Vans, Timberland and The North Face. We continue to see sell-
through momentum building in the region, particularly at Vans and TNF, giving us further confidence about
our positioning heading into holiday.

And finally in the Americas, we're pleased to see stores essentially fully opened for the first time since
mid-March. By the end of Q2, only 19 doors remained closed in L.A. County. Traffic remains challenged.
However, productivity was strong, and we're encouraged by continued momentum in our digital business
in the region. Americas digital growth grew 45% in Q2 but accelerated in September to over 60% as
we began to enter the critical Q3 holiday period. Ship from store functionality was activated across 200
Vans stores and all TNF full-price stores in late August. Buy Online Pickup In Store and curbside pickup
capabilities have also been implemented in certain stores with promising early results. We're pleased with
our progress in rolling out these capabilities as consumers increasingly expect this functionality heading
into the holiday season.

We're also encouraged by the performance of the Americas wholesale business during the quarter, with
sell-through trends accelerating across the big 4 brands. Our key accounts remain healthy, and the
channel inventory levels have progressed ahead of our initial planning, which should be a positive setup
heading into Q3 as well as for next year's fall order book.

So moving on to other Q2 financial highlights. As expected, the back-to-school environment was uneven,
and our brands experienced limited disruption due to the timing of inventory receipts. However, we were
pleased with the underlying sequential improvement as the quarter progressed.

Total revenue declined 19%, which exceeded our expectations of down less than 25% for the quarter. Total
D2C declined 17% driven by store closures and weaker back-to-school traffic. Our own digital business
grew 42% with broad-based strength across the portfolio. For example, our big 4 brands collectively
grew 47%, and our key Emerging Brands saw over 50% digital growth this quarter. Our brick-and-mortar
wholesale business is also progressing ahead of expectations as a result of stronger-than-expected sell-
through and an earlier anticipated start to holiday sell-in window. Our brands continue to successfully
navigate some modest supply delays, which impact the cadence of our business.

As expected, gross margin contracted 350 basis points to 50.9% driven by promotional activity and a 110
basis headwind from the timing of net FX transaction activity. Mix represented a 50 basis point headwind
due to wholesale timing noise, which is unique to this quarter. We still expect the mix benefit for the full
year to be 2x our normal structural long-term target primarily due to our accelerated digital penetration
this year. We still expect a somewhat elevated promotional environment in the second half of the year,
with margins stabilizing by year-end.

SG&A declined about 14% in Q2, supporting a roughly 40% earnings flow-through on the revenue
declines, in line with our guidance from the last call. Consistent with our earlier comments, we're taking
advantage of our position of financial stability to invest ahead of revenue to support a greater acceleration
in the business. Given the stability we see across the portfolio today, we expect this investment philosophy
to remain in place as we enter the second half of the year.

Our inventories declined 10% during the quarter, slightly better than expectations. We're pleased with the
progress made across both owned and channel inventories through the first half of the fiscal year and are
confident with our inventory positioning heading into the fall holiday period.

As we covered in our last call, we've been thoughtful with our forward inventory commitments this year,
infusing appropriate innovation and newness into our fall holiday product offerings while ensuring we exit
this year in a clean and healthy position. While this may ultimately cost us sales in the current year, we
believe this is the right approach given the uncertain environment and an appropriate investment in brand
equity and gross margins going forward.

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

As I alluded to earlier, we continue to experience supply disruptions, which at times present shipping
timing delays. However, we have seen sequential improvement over the course of the year and expect
delivery timing to be largely normalized by year-end. We have plans in place to manage peak holiday
deliveries and are generally pleased with our inventory levels in the marketplace today. And we're
confident in our ability to exit fiscal '21 with the appropriate inventory levels to service our forward growth
plans.

Our liquidity positioning remained strong with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term
investments, in addition to over $2.2 billion remaining undrawn on our revolver. We still expect to
generate at least $600 million of adjusted free cash flow this year and for the sale of Occupational Work to
add additional liquidity over the coming months.

Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, supported by our robust liquidity position. We
remain fully committed to our dividend, which continues to be an integral part of our TSR model and a
differentiator in our space. As you likely saw in our release, we're raising our dividend to $0.49 per share
payable in December. This marks VF's 48th consecutive year of dividend increases and underscores our
confidence in the future. And while the dividend remains a critical part of our ongoing TSR algorithm,
M&A remains our top capital allocation priority. And given our excess liquidity position and the stability we
observe across the business today, our confidence to execute an acquisition is clearly greater today than
it was just a few months ago. We will remain prudent and disciplined, guided by our 3-lens approach and
focus on delivering top-quartile TSR. And as a reminder, our share repurchase program remains suspended
to preserve optionality.

Moving on to our fiscal 2021 financial outlook. While the operating environment remains uncertain, our
performance through the first half, coupled with increased visibility, gives us more confidence in the
stability and trajectory of the business. We, therefore, are providing a more detailed outlook for this year,
assuming no material deterioration in current business conditions due to COVID.

We expect our business to continue to sequentially improve in Q3 and return to growth in Q4. And for the
full year, we expect revenue of at least $9 billion and adjusted EPS of at least $1.20. And we continue to
expect adjusted cash -- free cash flow of at least $600 million.

Across the brands, we expect Vans to decline at a low double-digit rate, implying at least high single-digit
growth in the second half. We also expect TNF to decline at a low double-digit rate for the year, implying
low single-digit growth in the second half. We forecast Timberland to decline at a high-teen rate for the
year, with continued sequential improvement through the back half.

Finally, we expect Dickies to increase at a high single-digit rate in fiscal 2021, implying at least low
double-digit growth in the second half.

As we head into the balance of the fiscal year, several fundamentals give me confidence in the underlying
health of our model and our ultimate ability to exit this crisis in an advantaged position: first, accelerating
tailwinds in our core categories: Active, Outdoor and Work; second, continued broad-based momentum
in China and across the digital channel driving an acceleration across our big 4 brands, coupled with
continued strength in consumer engagement; third, clean inventory levels across our channels of
distribution; and finally, our excess liquidity position, providing optionality both for continued organic
investment and M&A.

The strategy we laid out 1 year ago at Beaver Creek remains the playbook for success in a post-COVID
world: an aggressive digital transformation focused on direct consumer engagement, concentrated
exposure to growing structurally attractive addressable markets and a commitment to continuous
reshaping of the brand portfolio to accelerate our strategy.

While we don't know how much longer this current period of disruption will last, we are confident in our
ability to ultimately return to our long-term algorithm on the other side of this crisis.
So now I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jonathan Komp from Baird.

Jonathan Robert Komp
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I want to first ask, just given the comments about September that you made, any chance you could shape
the third quarter, what you're thinking in terms of the sequential improvement, a little bit better for us.

And then maybe more broadly, looking into fiscal '22, given the trajectory you're implying for the fourth
quarter, can you help share any thoughts on how you're going to balance kind of the pace of the top line
recovery with the need to invest but also to show a nice recovery on the bottom line and maybe tie that in
with the new Project Enable dynamics that you mentioned?

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Looks like I'm right out of the box here, so happy to take that. So first of all, the question was around Q3
shaping for the year. We didn't give specific guidance on Q3, but I'll just go through what we did say, and I
think this will get you pretty close.

So the top line we talked about, at least $9 billion, implies low single-digit second half growth. And we
said we would return to growth in the fourth quarter. So from that, you can imply kind of a trend line in
how you balance that between Q3 and Q4.

As it relates to gross margins, we said they'd be about flat by the fourth quarter and progressively
improving. We talked about the mix will be there for the year, about 2x what we've seen from our normal
40 to 50 basis point structural advantage that we see from mix. And promotional headwinds have begun
to abate, and we'll see that continuing through the balance of the year. So that should give you some color
on gross margin.

We talked about SG&A being flat in the second half, and that includes additional investments that we've
made to continue the momentum and really build on the momentum as we exit from the COVID period in
the back half of the year, as Steve says, the next period.

And finally, $1.20 from an earnings standpoint implies about a 40% flow-through for the full year.

So I think within that, Jonathan, you've got a lot of the data that you need to get the shape. And if not,
then John and Mallory can take you through that in more details.

I think the second part of your question was around the desire to invest versus earnings. And again, we've
given you a shape in terms of what you can expect, at least $1.20, from an earnings standpoint.

Hopefully, what our prepared remarks have given you some context on is we -- while we are cutting costs
in what we would call discretionary costs in the short term, we're also leaning in on our transformation
agenda. And with that $30 million additional investment, based on the additional confidence we have,
we're leaning in a little harder right now on those investments primarily around our digital transformation,
digital demand creation, et cetera, that we believe are going to give us continued momentum as we exit
this year and enter next year.

We haven't really given you any guidance on '22. So stay tuned for that.

And the last question was around Enable. Steve talked about what Enable is about. It's really -- I don't
need to repeat that in terms of not just layering on our digital investments but really repurposing and
rethinking our organization fundamentally.

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

And we talked about a target of $125 million over a 3-year period. What we haven't done is broken that
down for you by year. What you should know, though, is that as we think about the transformation, the
ongoing leverage as we combine working smarter and rethinking the way in which we organize, coupled
with the growth that we see longer term, will allow leverage and margin expansion over time. So that's
probably as much as I can give you on that right now, Jonathan.

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.

Omar Regis Saad
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Steve and Scott, I wanted to ask you guys. This moment we're having in Outdoor, is this a once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity? Should you guys really be accelerating your marketing given your Outdoor exposure
across your brand portfolio to really take advantage of this moment in time where people are spending so
much time outside? That's my first question.

And then I also wanted to kind of ask for an update on North Face. The management changes there,
any sort of additional color around Arne, who's been important to the recovery of that business and the
turnaround there?

And then our retailers also, are you seeing any reorders acceleration given that a lot of them had cut their
orders for North Face for the fall? Are you seeing any sort of retailers coming back and asking for more
again?

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Scott, I'll start. If I leave anything out, jump back in and fill in the blanks.

So 3 questions there. The Outdoor moment, we absolutely see, and I think you've spoken about it quite
well, there is a trend towards outdoors and people's desire to get outside linked to health and wellness.
And I think there is a moment in time.

And as we came into the pandemic, the outdoor sector was in a position of growth as well, and I think this
is -- really bodes well for our brands and for the sector in general as people continue to focus about that
outdoor activity, health and wellness and how can they kind of take advantage of this particular moment in
time. So we're very well positioned for that.

You asked about The North Face management. I'd kind of pull you up one notch. In my prepared
remarks, and Scott just spoke about Project Enable, as we think about our future and we think about our
transformation, we find ourselves today with a smaller portfolio of brands focused on 3 very specific parts
of the total addressable market that are growing. And as we seek to simplify our structure and really focus
our energy against those key aspects of our transformation, we saw an opportunity to really start on the
top and best align our talent with our biggest opportunities. And Arne has been a strong part of The North
Face performance, and we wish him well.

This is really about simplifying our organization structure, putting our very best people against our biggest
opportunities and really looking to leverage those key enterprise platforms that we've been investing
behind, driving our Core and Emerging Brands forward.

The last part of your question, Omar, was about retail reorders. I would tell you it's a little early, as we
come into this fall holiday period, to talk about reorders. What we have seen is a great interest in our
wholesale partners to take those initial drops of their fall order books and get those placed a little bit
earlier than we may have expected. So I think we're positioned as we enter the fall holiday period.

We've seen good energy, start here in September, carried into October. And if that continues, I think
there's an opportunity. But I would just remind you that we've been very thoughtful and controlled with
our inventory purchases. There is not a tremendous amount or any excess inventory to service a big

reorder pop. What we would expect to see is really good sell-throughs, clean inventories and positioning
ourselves well for those next 2 season, spring and fall, order books that our teams are working on.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

The only add I would say is on one part of your question was around should we be leaning in on
investments, and we are. I mentioned the $30 million of digital. And certainly, a good chunk of that is
focused on The North Face as well, just to address that point.

Our next question today is coming from Camilo Lyon from BTIG.

Camilo Russi Lyon
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

I want -- I have a couple of questions. First, on gross margin and inventory. Scott, you talked about
inventory in the channel, feeling very comfortable with that. Maybe just square that up with the
progression of gross margin? And why in Q4 we should expect to see flat gross margins as opposed to
a little bit earlier in Q3. Maybe just help articulate the distinctions between those dynamics while still
anticipating the promotional environment. It seems like you've got your inventory in a much better place,
you're comfortable with it, yet it seems like there should be a faster gross margin uptick.

And then my second question is on M&A. And more specifically, we're approaching the election here within
a couple of weeks. If there is a Biden victory, the anticipation is that capital gains taxes will increase. Does
that incentivize you to complete a deal faster and get it done before year-end? We'd love your thoughts on
that.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So it sounds like this one is me, Steve.

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Yes.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Camilo, as you think about gross margin trajectory, I guess really, just consistently from what we've said
all year, we see it largely playing out the way we anticipated. So remember, those promotional activities to
clear inventory, excess inventory and that inventory that was in the stores, et cetera, we said that would
be accelerated in the first half and moderating throughout the year and really kind of back to "normal" by
the fourth quarter. And we really saw that.

If you look even in the second quarter, when you take out the transaction impact, the rest of the decline
is largely due to promotional activity, and there's 200 basis points or so of that promotional impact in
the second quarter. That number was about 500 in the first quarter, right? So still high, still elevated but
sequentially improved from the prior quarter, and we see that trend continuing and moderating by the end
of the year, I guess, back to "normal". And that's why we've been aggressive in getting after it, right, so
that we didn't have all that excess inventory either in our own warehouses or inbound or at retail. And it's
not perfect. I'm not saying there aren't pockets here and there. But by and large, we're really clean by
historical levels. And that bodes well for less promotion on a go-forward basis. And we know that's good
for brand health, and that's also good for creating demand and scarcity, which tends to bode well for the
future. So that's one point.

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

The other -- another point on gross margin, again, is that mix benefit, which will continue through the
balance of the year. So we expect to see continually improving gross margins, again, in a "normalized"
level or back to "normal" levels by the fourth quarter. So that's how the shaping is coming together.

I guess, Steve, maybe the first thing I'd say is timing -- we don't try to outguess politics in terms of timing
because you can't outguess it, right? It's impossible to do. So I'll let potential sellers speculate on whether
that's going to impact their timing or not. I don't know, Steve, if you'd add anything to that, but...

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. No, not really, Camilo, other than M&A continues to be that #1 choice for capital allocation. And as
opportunities come, we're certainly prepared to act. But it will be disciplined. It won't really be driven by a
political situation. It'd be more around is it the right asset at the right time fitting into our strategy.

Camilo Russi Lyon
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Understood. And Steve, if I could follow up on that. Do you feel that you have enough visibility and
confidence in the available opportunity set such that -- and in your own business, it sounds like you do
-- such that you don't need to wait for a full recovery to be active on that front, that you have enough
information in the discussion that you're having to engage in a transaction?

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

I guess I'd answer your question this way, Camilo. In our -- now in the next approach, I mean, we've
moved quickly against our objectives to really strengthen the foundation of our enterprise through
our actions early in this pandemic. We're sitting in a good place with ample liquidity, a business that is
improving and an outlook where we see stores opened, supply beginning to meet our demand and really
good connections with our consumers through our digital assets. Digital performance is exceeding our
expectations. So we're in a good position. We are feeling confident around the future outlook.

I would tell you that we do think that this situation we find ourselves in today will be prolonged. But with
this focus on being agile and adaptable, we're in a good spot. So if the right asset were to come, we're
well positioned to be able to act, and I think you would absolutely see us pull the trigger.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And Camilo, just one add-on, on that is that and it also depends on what type of asset, right? And
where -- while we said we have more confidence today than we did 90 days ago, that's a fact, but it's still
an uncertain environment. And so the resilience and the type of asset would matter in terms of the timing
from an acquisition standpoint.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Michael Binetti from Crédit Suisse.

Michael Charles Binetti
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So Scott, just one near term one on -- and then I have a longer-term question. But on Vans, when you
look at the big swings in the wholesale business quarter-to-quarter, the America wholesale business was
down about 80% in the first quarter then up 10% in the second quarter. You said that your customers
that channel had inventories that were very low. And Steve last quarter told me you thought back-to-
school was delayed, not canceled. It was nice to see that, that looks like it came true. But we -- it looks
like September had some pent-up demand that got unleashed. I guess anything you're seeing in October
that may benefit -- in a period where we may benefit less from pent-up back-to-school? I mean I'm really
trying to figure out, what gives you confidence that there's not another deceleration ahead for Vans on

13

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

the wholesale side in third quarter, fourth quarter, whenever, if the POS trends don't hold up just since we
know September was a pretty meaningful pop that could have had some onetime demand in there?

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I think you kind of hit the key points in your question there, Michael. But we did see -- if you'll
remember, Q1, we had a relatively more difficult quarter in Q1 for Vans, and we talked about some
inbound delays and that, that was timing between Q1 and Q2. And indeed, we did see that come to pass.
So that's one proof point.

Encouragingly, we saw our China business accelerate for Vans, up 25%. Our digital was plus 50% in Q2.
Great proof points of the health of the business and give us confidence for the future.

And lastly, we did see wholesale orders move to the left, right? And I think that's a combination of interest
and demand, clean inventories. And it was encouraging to see that some of that demand on the wholesale
side shifted into the quarter based on demand.

So listen, it's still an uncertain environment generally, but we continue to make progress. And it was really
encouraging to us to see that -- the strength in the brand and particularly in some of those what we would
say forward-looking indicators like China, like digital.

Michael Charles Binetti
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then I know you reflected again today that you're not going to give us much outlook for 2022
yet, but I think you dropped some hints that some of the components, the building blocks in the 2019
Analyst Day. I think you feel like the algorithm is intact, but there might be some changes to the path to
which you get there. I think you've said that a few times over the last few months. Maybe some initial
thoughts on what you see as the same and some of the big differences in the 2024 plan. And if one of
those is the fairly obvious fact that it's a bigger digital world ahead, maybe talk to us about how the -- a
bigger digital business would impact the operating margins of the business. And if you plan to hold the
algorithm intact, I guess that would imply if digital has positive impact to your margins, you'll find ways
to reinvest some of that to get back to the same operating margin or EPS cadence. Maybe just a few
thoughts on how you look at the high-level plan as you go out to '22.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we're not going to talk about it, but you're going to ask me about it anyway. That was pretty good.

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Right.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

That was good.

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Right.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

That was good. Here's the thing. We're not -- the problem when you isolate on one aspect of the plan
without the benefit of the full context is that you don't get the full context, right? And so I'm always
cautious, and I would always caution you guys, not to get ahead of us here, right?

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

All the factors that we see are -- give us confidence that we have the levers to pull to maintain our
investment and also to maintain the margin expansion that we've committed to longer term. Let's set
aside that. We don't know exactly when this rebaselining occurs and when we're out of the COVID impact.
These are things that are unknowable, although the progress we've made so far has been largely in line
and maybe a little better than what we expected.

But a few things that we know, right? The digital acceleration that we had been planning for has lurched
forward, and that's not going to change, right? We don't know exactly how it's all going to balance out, but
we believe that the investments we're making and the fact that our digital channel is our most profitable,
those are all good things and allows us, both the gross margin and the operating margin, to continue to
invest back in the business. That was part of your question, and I would agree with you, right? We want to
be a leader in this area, and this is what our whole transformation is about.

So what I would take away from it, Michael, is we have the levers -- based on the changing algorithm,
we think we have the levers in place that would allow us to both continue to invest and to get the margin
expansion consistent with that algorithm. And that's why I and Steve and others continue to make the
comment we're -- we'll come back, we'll give you guys -- once we get some stability here in the situation,
we'll come back with another Investor Day. We'll clean all this up for you. But in the meantime, as you're
trying to figure out what these puts and takes mean, what I would take away is we have the ability to
invest and we have the ability to expand our margins and you should feel good about that long-term
algorithm. I'm afraid that's about as far as we can go right now, yes.

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

And Michael, I would just add a little more simplistically here is we entered the crisis in a good position.
We had good momentum. We've reshaped our portfolio with very unique and differentiated brands that
are squarely planted in the parts of the market that are growing and in fact are seeing even greater
headwinds.

We have confidence in the long-term -- in that long-term algorithm we've laid out last year in Beaver
Creek. What's unknown, and it would -- we'll just have to have time really play this out for us, is what's
the shape of the recovery. We're positioned to move along that path. The investments we've made around
our transformation, the digital growth that we're seeing are really strong proof points of the strategy that
we have in place. But really it's -- it will be a timing issue related to the shape of the recovery. We're
positioned to move well as that all starts to become more clear.

Steve, so maybe to switch gears to Timberland, well ahead of forecasts this quarter. What drove the
better-than-expected top line? And any signs that you're seeing that you believe gives you renewed
confidence in a turnaround for that brand?

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. No, great to have that question come out, and we're really pleased with the results that we see with
our Timberland brand. The sequential improvement in this quarter is a proof point of what we've been
talking to you guys about for the last number of quarters. The people we have in place, from Martino
providing that brand leadership to the creative talent driving the product creation, our new marketing
leader, I think you've seen a change in the tone and the quality of the creative.

And I think what you see at this particular point in time is people looking for those authentic icons that
they've depended on in the past. But the Outdoor trend has been benefiting Timberland through the last 6
months. Our Outdoor category is doing well. The new release that we had here in China of the Madbury is
a new, contemporary execution of Outdoor. The Garrison peak that you see coming here in the U.S., that's
up on our line today.

Just the -- there's a good introduction of some new styles. This is part of the work that our teams
have been doing. We're seeing energy building around some of those core icons, the yellow boot, but,
even more importantly, variations of that boot. We've had some great influencers show up wearing our
products, and I think that's just a proof of the quality and authenticity of this brand. But it's early. We're
encouraged and excited for our team and the work that they're doing.

We will continue to do the work to diversify the product offer away from -- to build on the nonclassics, to
build on our women's. Our Pro business is doing well. It grew low single digits in the quarter. So there's
a number of proof points across the Timberland brand that continue to give us confidence that this brand
has the ability to achieve its long-term growth algorithm and really driving against the new creative you
see coming from a brand engagement standpoint and how that's coming to life in the products.

Matthew Robert Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then...

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Hey, Matt, can I just add one perspective here, too? Remember, from an order book standpoint and the
inventory at retail coming into the season, it was not quite as strong from a Timberland standpoint. And
so we've -- our buys and -- given the lead times have reflected that. So our ability to chase is going to
be somewhat limited, but this is really positive, a really positive development for the brand. As you think
about cleaning the inventories, creating some of that scarcity, people are making more money from a
margin standpoint. All of that sets up well as you think about the future for the brand. And it's a change in
sentiment which is really positive for Timberland right now. Sorry to interrupt, but I think that's...

Matthew Robert Boss
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

No. Absolutely, that's great color and great to hear.

Maybe to circle back to Vans. So you've cited a number of the accelerating tailwinds out of the pandemic,
and casual is clearly one of them. How do you think about the total addressable market for Vans
multiyear? Could it actually potentially be larger?

And then just maybe circle back. What's your market share today? What do you think the opportunity is?

Just larger picture, how would you rank the growth opportunities for the brand multiyear from here as we
think about Vans?

Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Scott, I'll start.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure.

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

And if I -- fill in the blanks here.

So I think the total addressable market, Matthew, that we see for the Vans business continues to be same.
The active athleisure part of that marketplace is large. It's growing. And Vans kind of moves over into
that streetwear category as well, and I think that's where the power of the messaging of creative self-
expression and just the efforts that the team have taken as of late to really increase the quality of the
content, how we engage with that content across social media channels and in our own environments
to drive that long-term loyalty and to hear our team talk a lot about brand love, we're really in a good
position to continue to grow in that active athleisure marketplace. And the efforts that they've made
around classics, the progression footwear, the apparel, all of that -- al that work continues to be paying
dividends as we see really balanced growth across regions and across categories.

And I think you see the brand continued to be very thoughtful around the product launches. The Simpsons
collab that we launched just a few weeks ago was extremely successful. You see some new styles, Sk8-
Hi and our Ultra category up with the new MTE aspect that we come into the winter months. So just
continue to be very thoughtful around how they are creating products and matching that up with the
brand position.

Market share, we don't -- I don't think we've come out and really talked about our absolute share. Scott,
Joe, help me here.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

No. No. Yes, we haven't. We haven't, Steve.

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

But we continue to think that we're growing and the opportunity to continue to acquire more consumers.
The Vans Family membership program has been a really huge success. We're approaching 13 million
people as part of that. And 50% of our U.S. D2C sales this last quarter came through that Vans Family
membership program. So absolutely proving that we can engage consumers, grow the number of
consumers that the brand speaks to and really building that brand's family around a whole passion around
creative self-expression, which is a very unique position for them in the market versus their competitive
set.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

The only thing I would add is this total addressable market -- and I would say markets because it's --
this brand plays across multiple areas, as Steve just mentioned, and it's one of the strengths, the broad
consumer base. Everybody is trying to say, well, what does the post-COVID world look like in light of
where you were before COVID? And we would say the trends that we see accelerating, casualization the
deep brand love and engagement, only are stronger through this period. So while that TAM was always
attractive and we have a unique positioning which is both distinct but broad, if anything that's more --
even more attractive now in light of what we see changing consumer behaviors look like.

Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then can -- with Vans, is -- a lot of people are concerned, is what's happening
with Vans in maybe some of the way the sales are? Is this more, do you believe, more of a supply
situation or a demand situation?

And then also, can you give us the status of the factories in the Dominican for Timberland?

And then lastly, is the FX transactional headwinds, the 110 basis points, is that expected to continue for
the balance of the year? I may have follow-ups, but yes, those questions.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Wow, a lot of questions there, Sam. Can I -- so the last one, I'll say yes, FX continuing for the balance of
the year but moderating as the year goes on. That was one.

Timberland -- and Steve, I'll just rip off this, and I'm sure I may miss some. So Timberland, we made
some recent announcements. As you know, we're reducing our own manufacturing footprint, and some of
the actions we've done in the DR are really related to that. I think you can assume that we've -- this is a
well-thought-out strategic move, and we've got -- our supply chain team is on it. And we've got an orderly
transition planned for those actions, which have been announced. So that's really not different from the
long-term path that we've been talking about for quite a while here. It's just one step in the way.

I'm sorry, you had a question relative to Vans, and I didn't -- can you repeat that?

Samuel Marc Poser
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Sure. I wondered, there's a lot of concern about the momentum of Vans and the changing. Is the Vans -- I
don't know if it's weakness or perceived slowdown based on questions. Is this -- is Vans more of a supply
issue right now where you're making sure it's very, very clean so business really can't sort of get ahead of
itself? So it's not a demand-driven issue, it's much more of a supply-driven issue? Or is there something
else there relative to the momentum of the brand?

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Well, you guys have talked about weakness. We never have. We...

Samuel Marc Poser
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

No. I understand that. But people keep...

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I understand. I just couldn't help it. But anyway, the -- I mean, demand is there, come on. The
engagement of our consumers around Vans has been consistent. And some of the things that get
commented on -- remember our plan here, which we've talked about now consistently, right? We said
we were a bit toned down early on, and we changed our marketing talent that -- what we call Project
Pivot. And we moved away from some of the more transactional-related communications and bottom-of-
the-funnel activations when people were going through a lot personally in their life and focused more on
deep engagement with our consumers as opposed to transaction. As time has gone on, we're changing
that cadence both in terms of the raw amount of investment and also the tone and execution of that
investment.

So if you think -- look at things like surge in interest, of course that's going to be impacted by those
actions in the short term. But over time, we're seeing those investments increase, and you're going to
see that continue to build. Underneath all that, we've seen consistent demand for the brand. I'll just

V.F. CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

point you back, Sam, to digital up 50%, 70% up in the first half, China leading the way. I mean from our
standpoint, this has played out largely as we expected and actually even a little bit better based on some
of the demand moving to the left. That doesn't happen just because of supply. That happens because of
interest, right, and engagement with the brand.

So I guess what I would say is this is playing out largely as we had anticipated and, if anything, maybe
slightly better. I don't know, Steve, if there's any color you would add there, but...

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Maybe on a couple of these, Sam, just to kind of build on Vans. We have spoken about the impact that
Vans has seen due to their outsized exposure to California and the store openings. That's the mix and the
concentration of stores for Vans in the U.S. is unique for them and certainly we've had to navigate that.
And there were some supply delays, some due to how we quickly moved our inventory but also the impact
that the pandemic had on our suppliers, who we've worked very closely with to assure their people were
as safe and cared for as our own. But as we move through the pandemic here, we are seeing really good
improvements.

And we have great momentum with this brand. I mean we're -- first half, digital growth up 70%, the Vans
Family membership program continuing to grow and the ability for this team to create compelling content
and continue to drive those really compelling drops. Continue to feel very confident about Vans and our
opportunity.

On the DR Timberland question, Sam, just a quick add here. As part of our portfolio transformation as
we -- KTB has -- standing up as their own public entity, the divestiture of our Occupational Workwear
business, we have looked to transform that internal manufacturing footprint that we have historically
maintained. I think the good news here as we do that is that internal talent that drives -- has driven those
capabilities over the years will maintain their presence with us. And we've talked a lot about our third
way manufacturing footprint and how we partner with our manufacturing partners across the globe. That
knowledge base and skill stays.

But as Timberland grows, we will have a -- we'll continue to differentiate the product offer. And the type of
manufacturing, the type of skills required to produce these new styles is evolving, and that's what's giving
us confidence as we transform our portfolio. The need and ability to transform our supply footprint and the
partners that we work with will continue to evolve. So it's really a key part of our transformation.

Samuel Marc Poser
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

If I just had one more thing. On the gross what, what -- if everything's clean and you were down 100
basis points in your gross margin in the fourth quarter of last year, why wouldn't the fourth quarter look
more like, let's say, '19 -- sorry, yes, fiscal '19 levels rather than last year's level?

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Well, we've given you shaping, Sam. And while we have more visibility, we don't have perfect visibility.
So could it be better? Maybe. There's still a lot of moving parts. We've got a lot of D2C that needs to
happen in the second half. And so I think you can assume that what we see today based on the trends and
everything we know is what we're confident in. And that -- could it be better? Yes. I mean could there be
some negative things that happen that we can't see? That's possible, too. So that's why we ended where

Steve, Scott, I was hoping to understand the cadence of North America versus EMEA. They both declined
at the same rate year-over-year. How do we think about the cadence for the third quarter? I know you're
not giving us the top level -- top line overall guidance for the third quarter, but should they be moving in
tandem again? And any thoughts on how Europe is playing out especially since there is some lockdown
measures put in place with some countries out there?

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Maybe -- I guess the only thing I would say here is that we have generally seen Europe from a
recovery standpoint slightly ahead of North America. That's notwithstanding what may happen, to the
point -- the last point that you just said, Laurent.

So we haven't seen a significant impact, but we watch the same news that you do. And I would say this
fits in that category of the uncertainty and unknowable. But in general, our Europe business has been a
little bit ahead from a recovery standpoint than what we've seen in North America, and that would be what
we assume. You can see that in the business evolution slide, Page 29 on the deck, that we provided with
the announcement and how we see it. And that's really about as much color as we can give you right now,
Laurent.

Laurent Andre Vasilescu
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

No, that's very helpful. And then maybe on capacity constraints. I think there was a number of brand
operators out there who talked about capacity constraints for this peak holiday shopping season. Any
thoughts? Is there a limitation for your digital business to grow as -- certainly just because of a higher
base? Are you using 3PL? Any thoughts on that would be helpful as we think about DTC versus wholesale
for the third quarter.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

You want me to start that, Steve, or...

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Go ahead, Scott.

Scott A. Roe
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. So we've -- to the best of our ability, we've prepared in light of whatever COVID restrictions we
have, and we have looked at whether it be off-site storage and just different things that our supply chain
has looked at looking at peak volumes. And to the best of our ability and knowledge to see it, we think
we're prepared. The -- that being said, it's an environment where things can change. And if you should
have an outbreak or whatever, that we're people first. So we're not going to take any chances, and we
would react to that in the event that it would happen. So without any unforeseen circumstances occurring,
we think we're well prepared, Laurent, for the peak, and we think we'll be able to meet those objectives.

Now I will say this, too. Service levels aren't great in every aspect because of really things that have
already happened. Our supply chain is largely back in business and operating today, but that doesn't mean
that things that happened 4, 6, 8 weeks ago aren't impacting us now. They are, right, in terms of new
product deliveries being a little late, certain things that are not at the levels of stock that we would want
to see. Those -- it's getting better every day.

Again, largely, we're paying the sins of the past. In other words, we're back up and running today. So
we're not creating new problems, we're getting out of the issues that are in the past. But it would be
wrong to give you the picture that this is normal because it's not normal. It's just getting better and we

have better and better visibility to when those get-well dates are and how that whole supply-demand
match is setting up.

So with everything we can see, just to reiterate it, we've got the capacity lined up. We've got DC, last
mile, all those things, and we believe we're prepared for this peak.

Operator

We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Steve for
any further or closing comments.

Steven E. Rendle
Executive Chairman, President & CEO

Great. Thank you, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. I hope you're walking away
with a sense of just how happy, how comfortable we are with the stabilization and early recovery that
we're beginning to see across VF. As we enter the next, I think you see us leaning in, investing behind
marketing, continuing to invest behind our transformation, the confidence that we had -- our Board had to
increase our dividend coming out of this quarter. There's many proof points that are giving us confidence
as we begin to enter the next.

We're early. And though we are seeing signs of improvement, we will remain cautious. We remain agile
and adaptable and really drive against those opportunities that we see coming here in the future.

We are positioned extremely well in those parts of the markets that are growing with a very unique and
differentiated portfolio supported by strong enterprise functions and regions with very specific skills that
enable the success of our brands. And we look forward to continuing to talk to you here in the coming
quarters and wish you all a great day and stay safe.

Operator
Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have
a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
