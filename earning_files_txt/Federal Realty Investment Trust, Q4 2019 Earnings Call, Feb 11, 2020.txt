Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to Federal Realty Investment Trust Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over
to your host, Ms. Leah Brady. Thank you. You may begin.

Leah Andress Brady
Senior Manager of Investor Relations

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings
Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker and
Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.

A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated
events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual
performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we
can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental
reporting package that we issued yesterday: our annual report filed on our Form 10-K and other financial
disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

These documents are available on our website. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn the call
over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Leah, and good morning, everyone. So for the tenth year in a row, FFO per share was higher
than the previous year, excluding, of course, last quarter's Kmart real estate acquisition charged to the
income statement for accounting purposes. And barring some unforeseen collapse, 2020 will be the 11th
year in a row, as Dan will talk about in a few minutes. Please let that sink in. We've grown earnings,
bottom line earnings, every single year over this past decade and expect to do so again next year. Yes,
growth has slowed, as the industry continues to morph into something different. But it's still growth, and
there's not a single other publicly traded strip peer that can make that claim.

In fact, of nearly 200 U.S. equity REITs in every sector, less than 5% were able to grow FFO per share
each year. Not surprisingly, those companies have a combined average multiple of nearly 21x. One of
the things that differentiated Federal a decade ago when growth flowed following the 2008 recession
was the way we relied on our balance sheet strength and broad skill sets to move forward with initiatives
that would power us in the years that followed, but which were not helpful with generating immediate
earnings. We aggressively move forward with master plans for Pike & Rose, Assembly Row, other long-
term initiatives despite the challenging environment. And as a result, we were able to outperform a
sentiment change because we were that far ahead. This feels like that to me. At this time, rather than
dealing with a broad recession and planning a large, decade-long, mixed-use projects, we're dealing
with oversupply and changing consumer preferences, but we're doing equally forward-thinking things.
Things like doubling down an already successful mixed-use communities with less risky and mostly
nonretail additional phases that capitalize opportunities we've already established. We're constructing
new midsize projects like CocoWalk in Miami and Darien Shopping Center in Connecticut, and listening to
what retailers, restaurants, and the communities they serve, tell us about what's important to them. By
the way, if you look at our year-end balance sheet, you will note $760 million of construction in process,
more than we've ever had in our long history. We're aggressively moving forward with solidifying our core
portfolio by proactively acknowledging the haves and have-nots among retailers and shopping center

environments. We're beefing up incredibly well-located, high-quality centers for the next decade with
better tenancy, with alternative and additional uses and with attractive place-making using sustainable
methods and environments.

We're recycling assets with little opportunity for future growth, nearly $300 million worth at Plaza
Pacoima, Free State Shopping Center, the office over retail building in Hermosa Beach, California and the
Kohl's portion of San Antonio Center. And we're reinvesting those proceeds in far better opportunities
in Hoboken, New Jersey; in Brooklyn, New York; and Fairfax, Virginia. In other words, in a naturally
cyclical business, we're always focused on growing long-term FFO per share, no matter what the current
environment looks like.

So let's talk about the transactions that closed in the fourth quarter to demonstrate the point. We did what
we said we would do. First, we received the full $155 million in December from the Los Altos, California,
School District for the 12-acre portion of San Antonio Center through the condemnation process we've
been discussing for months now. The elevated cash position on our year-end balance sheet reflects this.
And while we have the obligation to use a portion of those proceeds to pay existing tenants on the site,
the timing and amount of those payments is uncertain at this time, but the net value to us is more than a
little impressive.

We also closed on Costco-anchored Plaza Pacoima in Los Angeles in the quarter for $51 million. When
these fourth quarter dispositions are combined with the sales of Hermosa, Free State and a couple of
smaller parcels earlier in the year, $300 million of capital was raised at a mid-4% cap rate based on
expected 2020 cash flows.

And where did we recycle that capital into? Hoboken, New Jersey, where 37 of the 39 buildings we bought
in our new partnership, closed in the fourth quarter. The other 2 buildings will close this month. We
also closed on Georgetown Shopping Center in Brooklyn, and in January, the retail strip adjacent to our
previous holdings in Fairfax, Virginia. Basically, $300 million invested in properties, which generated going-
in yield modestly in excess of the assets that were sold with an IRR that's 200 basis points higher. And we
expect to be able to expand further, given that Hoboken partnership and the opportunities we're seeing.
Transactionally, the fourth quarter was extremely active. Operationally, it was, too.

We ended 2019, having signed 457 retail and office leases for nearly 1.9 million square feet at average
rents of $41 a foot. And we signed more than 2,300 residential leases at average rents of $2.82 per foot,
$34 per foot per year. Just the retail and office leases combined created $77 million of growing annual
contractual rent obligations for the next 7 plus years. Our rental stream comes from an incredibly diverse
set of retail, office and residential tenants.

On the development side, we're incredibly active with 700 Santana Row complete and just turned over to
Splunk last week; $210 million, which is on budget and yielding 7.5%. This building is a home run at the
end of the street anchoring Santana Row and really something you should check out on your next trip to
Northern California; it's impressive.

Across the street, at Santana West, construction is well underway, roughly $100 million of spend in '20,
$150 million of spend in '21, with no income until '22. Strong interest in the building at this very early
stage is encouraging. Full-blown construction at Assembly, on both the residential and the office building,
continues unabated. Both projects are on schedule and on budget. Roughly $200 million of spend in 2020;
$100 million in 2021 with no significant income contribution until late 21. This is one big development
phase that will really change the field of Assembly Row. PUMA's North American headquarters is the office
anchor there.

Construction of 909 Rose, the flagship office building at Pike & Rose that will house Federal's new
headquarters in August of this year, is on budget, is on schedule, with roughly $50 million in spend
expected in 2020. We're currently trading paper with other tenants for more than 40,000 square feet in
line with our underwriting.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

CocoWalk is moving along beautifully, with 87% of the retail space and 57% of the office space spoken for,
under signed lease or fully executed LOI. Another $30 million of capital is programmed there for 2020 and
income will begin to be generated here later this year.

And finally, we can now say that demolition and construction are underway at Darien, where we will
completely change the character of the grocery-anchored shopping center, where we'll add 75,000
square feet of new lifestyle-oriented retail space to complement our strong Equinox asset banker, 122
apartments, and 720 parking spaces directly adjacent to the Noroton train station in Darien, $120
million at an incremental 6% yield with $25 million spent in '20 and most of the balance beyond that. No
incremental income here this year or next.

I'll go through the status of just those large development projects for obvious reasons. Our balance sheet
at year-end shows $760 million of construction in progress. And while the Splunk building at Santana
delivers this year and will reduce that number, an additional $400 million or so will be added in 2020 and
$300 million in 2021 before these projects have turned over to rent-paying tenants after that.

Back to the remarks I made initially. We're doing a ton of investing in leading-edge real estate projects
and markets as we look toward a very bright, but different future, with change in consumer demands and
retailer business plans. We expect to be at the forefront of that change, all while continuing to grow FFO
per share, albeit more slowly, in the near term.

That's about it for my prepared remarks. All the focus on short-term occupancy, current earnings
and lease-up expectations at this uncertain time is understandable and it's certainly important. But a
company's clear path to growth and mid- and long-term relevancy of its real estate long after the current
vacancies have been leased up is, in our view, far more important.

Let me turn it over to Dan before addressing the questions. Dan?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Another record year of FFO per share as we posted $1.58
for the fourth quarter, with the full year for 2019 at $6.33 as adjusted for the acquisition of the Kmart
at Assembly. An uptick in FFO versus the same periods in 2018, and remember, in 2019, we faced an
increase in G&A of roughly $0.02 per quarter from the new lease accounting standard. The numbers in
the fourth quarter were driven primarily due to higher term fees and higher rental income than last year,
offset by a shift in timing on property level expenses. Both from real estate taxes were a meaningful
forecasted tax refund was pushed into 2020 and nonrecoverable property-level expenses, which were
pulled forward from 2020. Both of these are primarily timing issues that should come back to us positively
in 2020 but represented roughly $0.02 of drag in the quarter versus forecast.

While this quarterly FFO result may seem muted, this was driven primarily by timing, and we had a really
successful quarter in terms of all the positive activity Don highlighted in his comments. Our comparable
POI metric came in at 2.4% for the fourth quarter and 2.9% for the year, basically in line with our
previously increased annual rents. With respect to retail space rollover, the 99 comparable retail leases
during the fourth quarter for 462,000 square feet were written at an average rent of $37.78 per foot, 7%
higher than the prior rent. Those results closely tracked the 379 full year 2019 comparable deals, which
were written at $40.48 on average or 8% higher than the deals they replaced.

Our portfolio remains well leased at 94.2%, though we do expect that to move lower in the first half of
2020. While we don't typically provide guidance on our occupancy metrics, given the aggressive level of
proactive re-leasing and some of the recent retailer fallout, we expect our occupancy metrics will trough
in the first half of 2020 to the mid-93% level for leased and the mid-91% range for occupied. However,
we should see a steady rebound back up to historic levels over the latter half of 2020 and into 2021, given
our strong pipeline of leasing activity.

A few additional comments I'd like to highlight in our disclosure this quarter that further demonstrates
the strength in our business that is not directly reflected in the quarter's numbers. On our development
schedules, in the 8-K, please note on Page 17, we closed out another $50 million in projects in 4 of

them, on time and on budget. And on Page 18, we raised our projected yield on 1 Santana West to 7%,
reflecting continued strength in rental growths at submarket for the amenitized office product we offer
there.

Now, why do I mention this? It's because the redevelopment and mixed-use development we do is
challenging. And it's really difficult to execute effectively. Through Federal's experience and 20-year track
record, we have meaningfully derisked these parts of our business model.

Now we'll turn to 2020 guidance. We have formally provided a range of $6.40 to $6.58 per share. This
formal guidance takes into consideration some of the projected tenant failures that have occurred since
our late October 3Q call. A.C. Moore, Pier 1 and Fairway are the most prominent. We felt it prudent to
take a more conservative posture as these restructurings play out. This range represents 2.5% growth in
2020 FFO at the midpoint. While this guidance range reflects some discrete headwinds facing us in 2020,
which I will get to shortly, our diversified platform is executing on all cylinders, as evidenced by delivering
Santana -- 700 Santana Row to Splunk last week at a return in the mid-7s, the stabilization of the Phase
2s at Assembly and Pike & Rose, delivery of smaller projects over the course of 2020, including the prime
store JVs, Freedom Plaza aka Jordan Downs beginning delivery to start this year; Bala Cynwyd residential
opening in Q2; and a newly renovated CocoWalk expected to start delivering to tenants in the second half
of the year. While none of these smaller projects will meaningfully add to 2020, they will be additive in
2021.

We also have the stabilization of the $50 million of redevelopment at a blended incremental yield
averaging 9%. And we also have a core portfolio, excluding headwinds caused by term fees, repositionings
and recent tenant failures, which otherwise would deliver comparable growth in the 2.5% to 3% range.
Also note that we executed on roughly $300 million of new investments and over $300 million of
noncore asset dispositions during 2019, which will be a couple cents accretive in 2020, but provide more
meaningful value creation and growth over the longer term.

What other retail REIT can tout an asset recycling program that's accretive to FFO in year 1? These
items together would drive FFO per share growth into the 6% to 7% range, if not for some discrete but
somewhat disproportionate headwinds. Let me give some additional color.

First, term fees. We had a record year in 2019, earning over $14 million in gross fees, whether it provides
headwinds or tailwinds we include term fees in our metrics because it is part of our business. And the
overall strength of our lease contracts provide us with a competitive advantage we can leverage over
time. While we expect a strong year again in 2020, we do not forecast getting back to 2019's levels, and
therefore, forecast a meaningful drag here.

A second headwind. Late last year, we identified several attractive, proactive, remerchandising and
repositioning opportunities across our portfolio and continue to evaluate additional opportunities, which
will drive significant longer-term value creation but at the expense of 2020 FFO. Changing out struggling
retailers with limited runway in terms of long-term relevancy and replacing them with tenants who we
project to be thriving in 2030 and beyond will be another source of 2020 drag.

Add in the forecasted impact from the recently announced retail failures on top of those previously
identified, such as Dress Barn, and collectively, these items get us to a range of 1% to 4% FFO growth in
2020.

With respect to other assumptions behind our guidance, comparable POI growth is expected to be at 0%
to 2%, which reflects the headwinds we just highlighted. The first and second quarters of 2020 will be the
weakest and may even be negative due to turnkey drag. We assume roughly 100 basis points of credit
reserve comprised of bad debt expense, unexpected vacancy and rent relief. This is roughly in line with
past year's projected reserves and actuals. Please note that projected lost revenues from the recently
announced tenant failures, previously mentioned, have been incorporated into our guidance and are not
part of this reserve.

With respect to G&A, we forecast roughly $11 million per quarter, up modestly from 2019's run rate. On
the capital side, we project spend on development and redevelopment of roughly $450 million to $500

million. As is our custom, this guidance assumes no acquisitions or dispositions over the course of the
year. We will adjust guidance for those as we go. And finally, we are projecting roughly $60 million to $80
million of free cash flow generation after dividends and maintenance capital.

Now on to the balance sheet. As has become a Federal Realty custom, we have positioned our capital
structure exceptionally well, to handle the current wave of value-creating development and redevelopment
activity at the company. We finished the year with over $100 million of excess cash and nothing
outstanding on our newly expanded and extended $1 billion credit facility. As a result, our net debt to
EBITDA now runs at 5.5x, our fixed charge coverage ratio holds steady at 4.2x, our weighted average debt
maturity remains near the top of the sector at 10-plus years and a weighted average interest rate on our
debt stands at 3.8%, with all of it effectively fixed.

Our A-rated balance sheet equipped with a diversity of low-cost funding sources allows us to execute
our diversified business plan with a meaningfully lower cost of capital than anyone in the sector, which is
another way we derisked the development activity we have underway. Our game plan for 2020 has all the
components in place to position Federal for sustainable outperformance in both FFO and NAV growth over
the next decade. That's all I have for my prepared remarks, and we look forward to seeing many of you in
Florida in a few weeks.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Just first question on the guidance. If you look at the FFO range you put out versus the goalpost you talk
about on the last call, you mentioned that A.C. Moore, Fairway and some others, I think, affected things.
Was there also a decision to start more redevelopment? Is that also causing any additional drag versus
what you expected last quarter?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, no. I think that -- hey, Nick, by the way. Good morning. We -- the additional redevelopments really
didn't come into. It was really just taking a more conservative posture as we looked at some of the news
that has come out since late October, 3.5 months ago. Really, that was the primary driver.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful, Dan. And then, I guess, the second question is, as we think about this year, and you
talked about earnings growth being affected by a few significant move-outs that are unrelated to tenant
bankruptcies and you've always been sort of ahead of the curve in terms of remerchandising boxes, but
this year is clearly a more impacted year than most. So what I'm wondering is, is this a function of the
retail environment and is it going to be a new theme in the Federal portfolio? How should we think about
risk of there being a similar type of downtime vacancy impact in 2021?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Nick. Let me start on that. We've taken a very holistic approach to all of our centers and really trying
to take a look at where we believe these things will be more powerful in 2025 and 2026. And that means
the notion of place and place-making is a much -- it's always been an important part of what we do, but
it's a more -- it's a bigger focus in terms of what we're creating, including the type of co-tenancy that
is happening there. Clearly, less clothing if you will, more experiential type of stuff, including health and
beauty, including food and different food sources. So we look at this holistically as a major change in how
retail and centers, including mixed-use centers, serve their communities over the next 10 years. And
as you know, our stuff is not in the middle of the country generally, it's sitting in the coast, in populated
areas, with lots of money and lots of people around. So we are forward-thinking, if you will, in terms of
that. And it's not just about backfill of space. So does this continue? Yes, I do think it continues because
I think this is a major change in how people are going about their lives when it comes to interacting
with retail, but we do it on a balanced basis. And there's nothing more important than that to us to note
that as a public company, we can't tell you, "Well, you know, our earnings are going down, but it's going
to be great in the future." We need to balance both of those things, current earnings along with the
sustainability of great real estate, and that's the needle that we thread.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

All right, Don. Yes, that makes sense. Just last question is, on the re-leasing progress on the spaces that
are a drag on 2020 NOI, for example, Kmart at Assembly, Stop & Shop, Darien, and Banana Republic at
3rd Street in Santa Monica?

Donald C. Wood

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me go through those because those are big ones. The Kmart at Assembly, we may temporary
lease up the space. But the purpose of that was -- that's an acquisition to be developed. And that will be a
continuation of Assembly Row. Now we've got entitlements to do, that takes a couple of years. The timing
and the planning is necessary, so we'll certainly look for some kind of mitigation, if you will, of the lost
Kmart rent, but it's not the driver. The driver is the value that will be created on that 6 acres, which is why
I -- [ still owners ] in the accounting that has to go through the P&L, frankly. That is an acquisition, all day
long.

Come up to Darien. We are now under construction. That Stop & Shop is gone, going away. And so as
a result, that will be a completely different use on that parcel and so you won't see income contributed
there. We're not trying to backfill the Stop & Shop; we knock it down. And so the whole notion there is
how to create a whole bunch of value on a piece of land that was obsolete. That shopping center wasn't
needed as another grocery-anchored shopping center at that train station. So look forward to that in the
coming years.

In terms of Banana, Jeff, I don't know how much you want to say at this point, but we're making some
real good progress on backfilling that at an incremental rate.

Jeffrey S. Berkes
EVP & President of Western Region

Yes. Thanks, Don. And Nick, we can tell you more, hopefully, next quarter. We're down the road, but
not to the point where we can really give a lot of detail on the leasing progress there because we're in
negotiations. So more to come on that one, but trending in the right direction.

Operator

Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi.

Christine Mary McElroy Tulloch
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And thanks for the call-out on our conference for promoting it. In terms of -- Don, you talked about $400
million of additional spend in 2020, $300 million in 2021. I know you have many options for capital you're
using to fund that. But just sort of generally, how should we think about the mix? Dan, you said free cash
flow this year is $60 million to $80 million. You've also got equity issuance as an option, but how should
we think about the potential for additional depositions as well?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, that will always be part of our plan, Christy. So first of all, let's start with the balance sheet that
you're looking at, which has over $120 million of cash on it. So starting out with a balance sheet that, as
you know, is about as strong as it can be, including a completely unutilized $1 billion credit line. So that's
not a bad start. On top of that, there's no doubt we will continue to recycle the portfolio that you should
still assume, and I can't -- I'd love to say $150 million or $200 million of dispositions, but the reality is
that's very opportunistic and it depends. We just did $300 million last year. We did much less than that
the year before. I don't know exactly where that will be in 2020, but it's part of the program. It's part of
the capitalization, if you will, of the company, and we're comfortable in doing that because of the uses of
capital that we have to reinvest. So between the existing balance sheet capability, along with asset sales,
along with cash flow generated by the business, we're more than covered, I think, as kind of we've shown
you for the past 10 years.

Christine Mary McElroy Tulloch
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And then, Dan, thanks for all the color on sort of the drivers behind the comp POI range. I'm
wondering if there's any properties that are sort of entering the pool in 2020 that have sort of an impact

10

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

there. And then in regard to the term fees, it sounds like they'll be relatively back-end loaded through
the year. I'm wondering if you could say how the 2020 absolute amount is supposed to come out in FFO
relative to the $14 million in 2019.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Okay. Well, maybe I'll start with the term fee question. $14 million is significantly in excess of our 20-year
average, which typically is about $5 million per year per annum over the last 10 years. It's been about $6
million per annum. Maybe a better way to look at it because we've grown over time. It's roughly 80 to 90
basis points of total revenues. So that creates a bookend of maybe $5 million to $8 million of term fees,
which is kind of what we have currently in the range. We don't expect to get back to the $14 million level.
I wouldn't say necessarily it's back-end weighted. We'll probably have a little bit of a tougher headwind in
the first quarter from term fees because we had such a big one in the first quarter of '19, with the lowest
term fee at Orchard Supply.

And then with regards to your first question, can you just repeat it?

Christine Mary McElroy Tulloch
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Yes. So just what's entering the pool in 2020 that might have an impact there?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

There will be some things moving around. I mean, I think that we're -- but they won't be materially kind
of moving things. We are going to move the residential at Assembly Row into the pool. We're going to be
moving Phase 1 of Pike & Rose as well as the residential in Phase 2 into the comparable pool. And we'll
probably also be moving house and residential, but all of those have stabilized. And so there won't be a
material boost that you'll see from those entering the pool. They've stabilized in kind of the -- kind of 1-
year seasoning we do as part of that methodology for comparable, but you won't see a big boost there.

Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore.

Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess just shifting subjects a little bit here on the acquisition front. You guys were pretty active in 2019,
kind of wondering what's in the pipeline at this time.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Samir, you don't want me to give you the LOIs that we've got, right? I mean at the end of the day, the --
our pipeline for acquisitions does change all the time. There is no question that we were heavily focused
on the New York metropolitan area in 2019, and that will stay. So we will continue to try to increase our
holdings in those markets where we just entered. But that doesn't mean that -- and then, by the way,
the same thing for the Northern Virginia market. That doesn't mean something else won't pop up. One
of the things that we are noticing, right now, are clearly more sellers who are looking to get out for all
the reasons you would assume. The trick, for us, is making sure that we're picking up assets that we
believe in the long term for. That could even be a box center in the appropriate play in a place or 2, but it
really depends on the metrics. So there isn't anything that is imminent at this point, but you should see us
active, if you will, throughout 2020, particularly in the areas that we've targeted for future growth.

And what about on the disposition side. I know you guys -- you kind of had the strategy to sort of dispose
some of the noncore assets. You're a little bit active at last year? I mean, what should we -- how should
we be thinking about that sort of disposition volume possibly in 2020 from a modeling perspective?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I don't know how to say too much more than I did on the first question to Nick, whether -- I don't
know whether the number is $150 million or $200 million or what it should be. I will tell you, we've
identified assets that we would like to dispose of because we have things to spend that capital on. But in
the preparation for the -- those packages and figuring out what the market -- what makes sense in the
marketplace, we do that very opportunistically. And so there is not a budgeted number, if you will, that
you can just put in the model of how much dispositions we would have. You should assume that anywhere
from $0 to $2 million or $250 million is what we have historically done, and we'll approach it the same
way in '20 as we have over that period of time.

Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So we're going urban, so Hoboken and now Brooklyn. Can you go through the near-term opportunity
at Georgetown Shopping Center, mark-to-market opportunities, merchandising improvements you're
planning? I mean, they have a Fairway, they had a Dress Barn, a GameStop, a buffet; to be fair, some
stronger retailers, Starbucks, Carter's, Five Below, Chipotle. So the question is, what's the near-term
plan? And where are you actually going with this longer term? It's a 9-acre parcel and has 575 parking
spaces.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

So Derek, let me just start something, and I'm going to ask Wendy to jump in there after that, but we're
going urban. I mean, we've built around the density and the population centers. So I don't think there's
any change in Brooklyn, New York than there is for Bethesda, Maryland; or Santa Monica, California; or
Fairfax County, Virginia. That is what we are. We're those close-in suburbs, if you will, of major CBDs. And
so I think, frankly, a grocery-anchored shopping center with the density that Brooklyn has, at the price
that we got it at, was hard to pass up, to tell you the truth. And obviously, we underwrote the weakness
in Fairway, as the -- as part of that underwriting process, didn't know and still don't know the timing, in
particular, of what we can do there, but we know the demand for grocery there is ridiculously strong. And
so you should assume that that will be a grocery-anchored shopping center in the middle of a very densely
populated area with rent upside, based on how it was previously managed and run compared with how we
will previously -- how we will prospectively run that shopping center. So you shouldn't expect it to be torn
down and something else happening there. You should expect that to be a really -- in my view, hopefully
better run, higher rent, better tenanted 9-acre park -- open parking lot, in the middle of Brooklyn.

Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then San Antonio Center, certainly, seems to have worked out fine. I think you guys paid
around $62 million in 2015. So it was sold under condemnation for the $155 million. When will you have
to pay out the tenant award portion from the proceeds? And can you share how that's determined and
how that works?

mechanical. But it's not going to start -- not going to start for a couple of years. So, Don, I don't know if
there's much more than that, that we want to add.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Well, the only thing I would point it to, maybe a point or 2, is the financial statements where there is a
recorded gain. And obviously, inherent in that gain is an estimation of the expenses that are -- that have
to be paid out. So I hope that's helpful. And you should know that that is by design very conservative.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

And it's very conservative, but it's actually in excess of what we expected, and we had kind of guided folks
to the kind of net proceeds after those payments of $90 million to $100 million. And net-net, we're closer
to $110 million. So -- and that's with a conservative estimate. So obviously, a good result and better than
we had hoped.

Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. On Page 17, you break out the delivered projects, which are returning at 9%, and then the active
redevelopment projects, which are delivering at 6%. I wonder if the 6% is the new norm or it's just a
temporary mix issue.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, a little bit of both, Craig. I think it's a great question. The result is -- the reality is: man,
construction costs are high. And they are significantly higher than they were a couple of years ago as we
started these other projects. So that's certainly part of it. Call it -- I don't know whether it's half of the
difference or whatever else. The other half is certainly mix, certainly mix. And you can see that Darien
has a disproportionate piece in it. That's a complete redevelopment of a shopping center. And one of the
reasons we're willing to do at Darien or something like that at an incremental 6% is because of the nature
of the project and where we believe the future in that asset goes. This isn't the same as putting a pad out
on a -- out in front of a shopping center where the new income is the new income, and that's what it will
be for 10 years. That's something like Darien with a big residential component, too, you should say, "You
darn tootin' we'll do Darien at 6%" because of the incremental rent increases we expect to get, not only
on the residential side but in terms of lifestyle part of the center as it gains traction. So you've got a big
mix component in that, but also, as I said, construction costs are up.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then in terms of re-leasing space, like A.C. Moore or Pier 1, can any of that occur before the
end of 2020? Or is that all a 2021 event?

Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital.

Robert Jeremy Metz
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Don, Dan, I just wanted to go back to the growth topic again. You guys mentioned growth this year,
growth next year. And obviously, appreciating you are in this for the long game. Also, you specifically
detailed the number of projects in your opening remarks, which is clearly helpful. But it sounds like income
will be a little more phased and possibly back-end loaded through 2021. So just broadly thinking about a
bridge, is it fair for us to be thinking we should have some tempered expectations at this point for any sort
of big reacceleration? Or any reacceleration of growth next year? Obviously, recognizing there's a number
of the moving pieces in the pipelines and the repositioning as guys have talked about.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Jeremy, you understand it well, and you've kind of laid it out really well there. There's a lot of --
there's clearly uncertainty in our business. I love what we're doing in terms of what we're -- what the
capital that we're putting to work. Its contribution, as you said, will be later in 2021. The big question and
answer to your question is how many holes are there on the bottom -- at the bottom of the bucket. And
that's what is -- for anybody in this space, in retail space, the big unknown. And so it does make us -- it
does make it harder to predict. It does make it harder to say, "Okay, growth will go back to this number
on May 6, 2022, or something like that." But all we think we should be able -- should be doing is looking
towards making sure this stuff, all of this portfolio, is extremely relevant and as good as it's ever been
and better as we go through the '20s. And so balancing it to keep that growth -- to keep growth in place,
but not knowing when we're able to really accelerate to another level is just the facts today. And I would
tell you, it's the facts with everybody no matter what they tell you. The difference is, we got $1 billion of
incremental capital that will create that incremental growth going forward. But what's the negative coming
out of the bottom of the bucket, that's the unknown.

Robert Jeremy Metz
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes, that's fair. Dan, just a quick one. You mentioned the 100 basis points of credit reserve. You also
mentioned the A.C. Moore, Fairway, Pier 1. Just wondering, are those baked into that 100 basis points that
you're giving yourself, are those on top of the 100 and that's separate?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Our guidance reflects a projection of what lost revenue we should achieve or what we'll be hit with
in 2020. So that's reflected in our guidance. If we deviate and it gets more negative than that's covered
in the reserve. But kind of an expectation of how things will play out with regards to those recently
announced retail failures is reflected in the guidance, and then a reserve on top of that if it's worse than
we project.

Is that fair?

Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just 2 questions from me. First, Don, you've spoken before that you guys are a retail company, you do
office, you do apartments, but at your core, you're a retail company. That said, office has definitely been
a bright spot this cycle. So as you guys think about where you're going to spend on development pipeline
or the assets that you're looking at, are you having your team focus more on assets or opportunities that
could involve more office? Or your view is, "Look, we're a retail company focused on retail. If it has office,
if it has residential, great; but retail is our core."

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

I guess, Alex, the best way for me to say it is, we are real estate people. And the best thing that we can
do with real estate is use retail to be able to get people to come to that piece of property that we have. So
there is always a how do we get people to come to our real estate as the primary driver. Now, what can
we do with it? Absolutely, involves other real estate uses. I think we've proven that. I think what you've
seen in the past number of years from us is actually just the natural evolution of mixed-use properties
where you create that retail environment and then add residential or office or hotel or incremental uses
that play off that retail. That will continue. And so when you -- it doesn't mean, we won't do a pure retail
play, like in answer to the previous question, we did in Brooklyn when we have our bread and butter and
we know how to create value from increasing rents in a net dense environment. But when you have other
uses that include Hoboken, which has a large residential component to it or as you see what it is that
we're doing, obviously, at Santana or Darien or CocoWalk, we're going to take -- we're going to look at it
with a broader view, I think, than other folks in the shopping center will. And we don't do that for just 1 or
2 projects, we do that with every possible piece of real estate that we own or are looking at, but it's been
like that for a very long time with us.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes. I realize that. It's just it's funny this cycle, office seems to be the golden child. So you have the
positive yield revision at 1 Santana. So I didn't know if that was leading you to try and push your team
more to office. The second question is...

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Let me say one thing to you there, Alex. It's important that we don't do this for cycles. We don't invest
to time cycles. This is -- there will be a time when office is no good and retail is back better and we are
building long-term sustainable real estate destinations. And so no, we don't move along with -- you're
not going to see us buying industrial properties because it's hot right now, for example. And I just always
want to make sure you know, we are a long-term focused company, and we act that way.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then the second question is, with all the retailer closings that are announced summer,
obviously, full liquidations, but some are retailers paring stores. In general, as you guys look at your
portfolio in troubled retailers, are you generally pretty good about calling which of your tenants is going
to close? Or do you feel like some of these retailer closings are sort of haphazard or wouldn't necessarily
follow productivity logic that you would otherwise dictate? Meaning, are you caught offsides by some of
these closing announcements or all the ones that have happened, you're pretty much -- apart from a full
liquidation, you're pretty much, like, "Yes, we had a feeling they were going to close this one or that one."

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Well, that's a good question. And I would -- I'm putting a percentage on this, not for exactness but to be
illustrative. I would say, 75% or 80% of the deals, we kind of have a real good idea as to what's going on
and why logically a tenant would close a store or renegotiate a store or do whatever, obviously. But there
is, to your point here, 8 percentage, 20%, some percentage, if you will, of decisions that are being made
today that are not as obvious as they used to be. And some of that is because there are broader market
decisions that are being made. So good performing stores can be closing too because they don't fit in a
business plan of a company going forward. There are other reasons that, sure, they do take us by surprise
occasionally. You'll see it certainly in some of the categories like restaurants, for example, where you can
have a decent-performing restaurant, but because of that ownership structure, we get surprised with a
closed door. But overall, the point here is really to make sure whether a surprise or not, we got backfills
and we've got alternatives to be able to fill that. And I don't know how you better mitigate that risk more
than with bringing real estate.

Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Just wanted to go back to the kind of bigger picture and the growth rate that we can expect from Federal.
So maybe you can -- is there any way you can give just some color on how much NOI you expect from
redevelopment, development from the -- just on the known projects that you have on the ground today
that we should expect in 2020 and how that looks like in 2021?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Well, I mean, let's do it this way. When you go to Page 17 and 18 of our 8-K that does a pretty good job,
I think, of laying out capital and laying out the returns. You can get a pretty good idea of what ultimately
those projects and new ones coming up are going to contribute. Now on the timing, there is no doubt
that much of the big numbers on those 2 pages will not be producing income until starting later in 21 and
then forward. They are big projects. And by the way, that construction does have, certainly, in the case of
Pike & Rose or an Assembly, it does have an impact slight, but it's got an impact on the rest of the project
because there's more stuff happening with dump trucks and that kind of stuff. So you should assume later
in '21 is when you're going to -- is when the big stuff on Pages 17 and 18 starts producing. And as Dan
went through, you'll get some of that in '20, including, by the way, a big one in 700 Santana Row and in
Splunk, but there's a lot more coming. So you'll have to back weight that. But we're still growing, Ki Bin,
we're still growing.

Ki Bin Kim
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I mean, the reason I asked that is that we've had a couple of years of low growth and I know you're
investing for the future and follow the right decisions, but at least in the near or medium term, the market
is trying to figure out when we get back to that 4% or 5% FFO growth trajectory. That's why I asked those
questions. And just...

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Absolutely, absolutely, yes. In fact, if you could read our goals and objectives for the company, it is the
single biggest thing not from the first leasing person's discussion with a tenant to the first dollar of rent
that gets recorded in the P&L, all along that process, major initiative to reduce that time. And it includes
some things that you would assume like a simpler lease. It assumes some things you might not assume,
like how tenant coordination happens and who does the work and how it gets priced out and things like
that. It assumes some changes in terms of the marketing materials that leasing agents' use and how they
use them. And all the way through, it is a primary focus of this, and I would suspect most companies in

Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Two things. First one, I was wondering can you talk about the timing and the magnitude of the recently --
the recent unanticipated bankruptcies that you've been talking about?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think we've taken a kind of analytic and rearview of what this uncertainty and these restructuring
processes. And we've taken an estimate of how we anticipate getting potential stores back, what stores
will stay in place and so forth, and we've made that estimate. I don't think that there's a kind of, a good
answer for you in terms of helping you with your -- with kind of a specificity. Like Pier 1, I mean, I think
we're in pretty good shape with Pier 1 where we're basically re-leased on one of them. Another one is
going to stay because it's one of their top-performing stores in the region. And the remaining 2 out of 3,
we're trading paper and should have them leased up probably by end of the year. But it's tough to kind
of go through each one of them, and the bankruptcy process is an unpredictable one. So we'll see how it
plays out.

Yes. Over the course of the year, what's reflected in our guidance is about $125 million of incremental
equity, consistent with what we have done over the years in that range. And it would be kind of played
out over the year in terms of your models. But we've got the balance sheet that we don't have to use
that. We've got other sources that will fill the gap, whether it be incremental leverage, leverage-neutral
leverage asset sales, cash on hand, free cash flow. We've got a lot of tools in the toolbox in addition to
kind of the opportunistic equity issuance that we've been fortunate to be able to issue over the years.

Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors.

Vince Tibone
Green Street Advisors, Inc.

I'm just curious when you lose a grocer, such as Fairway, how does it impact the adjacent small shop
tenants? Are there other typically co-tenancy clauses that allow them to immediately pay lower rent once
the grocer closes?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, there are not, Vince, particularly in a strong located place like that, it wouldn't be -- it wouldn't --
certainly wouldn't be in our lease, and while we didn't write that lease, that was before that. There is no
such impact there. So it's just the grocer, just that box. But on the other side of that, can you imagine
putting a better grocer in that box and what the impact that would have in terms of traffic to the balance
of the space, something that we're counting on.

Vince Tibone
Green Street Advisors, Inc.

Right. Makes sense. And then just kind of on that, just how surprised were you by the Fairway
bankruptcy? And just in general, like, how worried are you about some of the smaller regional grocers
out there? Are you expecting more bankruptcies to occur over the next 5 years, let's say, as the grocery
industry is kind of evolving here?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Well, let me answer that question 2 ways. One, not surprised at all with respect to the Fairway bankruptcy.
Frankly, it was one of the most important parts of our due diligence on buying the asset. And if you knew
what we did for due diligence, much of our time was spent figuring out how much demand there was
for that space and at what rent they would pay. So no, no surprise there at all. In terms of the bigger
question, TBD, Vince, I mean, I don't view groceries very different than any other category. And this
kind of goes back to the beginning part of what we were talking about here. We're not just about filling
boxes up. We really are about bringing these retail products to places, shopping centers and mixed-use
properties to places that will be the best 5 years from now. And so to the extent more grocers go out,
smaller grocers, less well capitalized grocers, which if they don't have a particular niche, sure. They're
under margin pressure all the way through, completely agree with that. But again, so what, to the extent
you've got backfill opportunities that are more sustainable to what that shopping center should be in
any particular neighborhood or community. And our stuff, as you know, is a lot bigger on average and
a lot more regional on average than a traditional grocery-anchored shopping center in a lot of markets.
It's more than double the size on average, in GLA, for example, and [ land ]. So it's all about, from a
landlord's perspective: options, alternatives. And it's hard to imagine there isn't more disruption in the
grocery business; of course, it will be, just as there will be in every other sector as we move forward. But I
think we're well prepared to use that to create better retail destinations.

effectively losing any tenant in that space is somebody's got to pay those bills, and it's us. So there's no
doubt that hurts earnings, too. I think the point that's really important to understand here, though, is with

A quick question. The 1% credit reserve that you have baked in, how does that compare to your 5-year
historical, your realized credit losses?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

It's actually very much in line with our 5-year history and actually where we come out in terms of actual is
not a material difference. That 100 basis points has been pretty consistent, at least, since I've been here.
And the actual results are kind of in line roughly with those reserves.

Okay. And then maybe a quick question on the residential rents. What has your experience been on the
rental increases after the first year's rents on newly developed departments? What kind of increases have
you seen at Assembly or at Santana? And how should we think about Pike & Rose in terms of increases
for residential? Or do you think that market is different than you think it's going to be a little softer than
Boston and San Jose?

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Floris, it's a great question. I mean, obviously, our best population from which to get that information
is Santana because we've been open as long as we have. And I can tell you that the annual CAGR for
those residential rents have been about 3.8%, almost 4% over that period of time, not every year doing
it, but it's strong. Now come over to Assembly, Assembly is real interesting because if you remember, we
started out with AvalonBay doing the first phase of the residential. We then added Montage, which is a big,
good 500 unit building. And now we are adding more supply. And even with all that happening, we've seen
rental growth that's -- again, it's only a couple of years in excess of 4%. So that's real strong. In terms
of Montgomery County, it's clearly been weaker. Montgomery County, and therefore, for Pike & Rose on
the residential rent side over the past 3 or 4 -- the first 3 or 4 years was essentially flat. We are now in
the last 12 to 15 months seeing the first signs of real strength from that perspective. And by the way, not
surprisingly, that is very much in line with the strength that we're seeing on traffic counts and sales on the
retail piece. So as these communities become more mature, there is no doubt that, that [indiscernible]
to the residential up top. So very hopeful to see sustainable, call it, 3% at these properties over the long
term.

Operator
