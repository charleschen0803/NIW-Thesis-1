WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Third Quarter 2020 Results. This
call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]

Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than
historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to
change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are
made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements,
factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.

During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless
otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions] In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial
information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the
conclusion of this call.

And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Live from the heartland. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our
results for the third quarter of 2020. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team
who are on the call with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief
Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate
Communications and Investor Relations.

As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2020 earnings of $0.84 a
share. Our solid results were driven by a rebound in economic activity in the region, warmer summer
temperatures and efficiency gains throughout our operations. Scott and Xia will provide you with more
details on the quarter in just a few minutes, and Kevin will cover our operational progress. But first, I'd
like to discuss our new 5-year capital plan, our road map for the next 5 years of capital investment.

So for the period 2021 through 2025, we expect to invest $16.1 billion. It's the largest 5-year capital
plan in our history, an increase of $1.1 billion or 7.3% above our previous 5-year plan. We're calling this
road map our ESG progress plan because we're investing the $16.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability
and growth. As you would expect, our ESG progress plan includes a significant investment in renewables.
We're allocating nearly $2 billion to regulated renewables that will serve our Wisconsin utility customers.

In addition to the projects we have underway, we plan to bring 800 megawatts of solar, 100 megawatts
of wind and 600 megawatts of battery storage into our fleet. The data show that battery storage has now
become a cost-effective option for us.

Our plan also calls for modernizing our gas generation fleet. To improve efficiency, we expect to retire
400 megawatts of older natural gas fueled capacity. In addition, we plan to purchase 200 megawatts of
capacity in the West Riverside Energy Center. That's a new combined cycle natural gas plant recently
completed by Alliant Energy here in Wisconsin.

And finally, on the natural gas generation front, we plan to build an additional 100 megawatts of capacity
using reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. As we've already seen in
the upper peninsula of Michigan, RICE generation is flexible, reliable and scalable. Now all of these efforts
should allow us to retire 1,400 megawatts of our coal generation by 2025.

The benefits of our ESG progress plan are very clear. We'll cut CO2 emissions, maintain superior reliability,
lower our operating costs and grow our investment in the future of energy. Now as you may recall, we've

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

already set aggressive targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70% below 2005 levels by the year
2030. We're also working to make our generation fleet net carbon neutral by 2050.

With the plan, ladies and gentlemen, that we just described to you, we're able to announce today a
new near-term CO2 reduction target. We're aiming to lower emissions by 55% below 2005 levels in just
the next 5 years by the end of 2025. In addition, for the longer term, this generation plan will deliver
significant economic benefits for our customers. Compared to the status quo, we expect customer savings
of approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years.

There are a number of other important elements in our ESG progress plan, and we'll be happy to share
all the details with you at the upcoming EEI conference. But in summary, our updated capital plan should
grow our asset base by 7% annually over the 5-year period with no need for additional equity. And the
plan fully supports our projection of long-term earnings growth at a rate of 5% to 7% a year.

Now let's turn for a moment to the economy and a quick look at conditions here in Wisconsin. As you
know, we provide energy to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers. Many of them
produce and deliver essential services. During the pandemic, we've seen particular strength in paper, food
processing, packaging, plastics manufacturing and electronic controls. And there's clearly been a strong
rebound in the labor market over the past few months.

The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate down to 5.4%, and of course, that's well
below the national average. I would add that new developments are creating even more opportunity,
particularly in the southeastern corridor of the state. For example, Komatsu recently broke ground on a
state-of-the-art manufacturing and global mining campus serving as its Milwaukee area headquarters. Our
company sold 43 acres of land to Komatsu for this development, which is taking place in what's known as
Milwaukee's harbor district. Komatsu expects to invest approximately $285 million in the project. When
complete, it will include engineering and robotics labs, a large office complex, a customer center, a modern
manufacturing facility and more, with the potential to employ more than 1,000 people. Construction of the
campus is expected to be complete in 2022.

And literally just a few days ago, Amazon opened a 2.5 million square-foot distribution center in Oak
Creek, that's just south of Milwaukee. This 4-story center is equipped with the latest in robotics for
packing and shipping. And at full strength, Amazon expects to employ 1,500 full-time workers at its
facility.

And of course, I know all of you are interested in the Foxconn development in Racine County. As we
speak, construction work continues on a smart manufacturing facility and a network operations center
that will support high-performance computing. Groundbreaking on the high-tech campus took place just a
little more than 2 years ago. Since that time, Foxconn's plans have clearly evolved. The company is now
assessing a much more diverse product line than originally envisioned. Now because of these changes, the
State of Wisconsin is asking to revise its tax incentive contract with Foxconn. And the head of the state's
economic development agency has said the door is wide open to support Foxconn's business expansion in
the state.

So all things considered, with a resilient economy and major developments in the pipeline, we remain
optimistic about our long-term sales growth.

And with that, we'll turn it over to Scott, and he will chat about our sales for this -- third quarter of this
year. Scott, all yours.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

Thank you, Gale.

We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of the third quarter, our utilities were
serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 32,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year
ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volume are shown on a conservative basis on Page 17 and 18 of
the earnings packet.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

As you recall, we adjusted our forecast at the start of the pandemic. The results in the third quarter were
better than our adjusted forecast across all customer classes. For example, residential sales of electricity
were up 7.1% from the third quarter of 2019, and on a weather-normal basis, were up 4.2%, that's a
1.6% better than our forecast. Small commercial and industrial electric sales were down 2.5% since the
last year's third quarter. And on a weather-normal basis, were down 3.3%. This was 0.6% better than
our forecast. Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were down
5.4% from the third quarter of 2019 on both an actual and weather-normal basis. This reflects a rebound
in economic activity in Wisconsin and was 4.3% better than our forecast.

Overall, retail deliveries of electricity were down by 0.3% from the third quarter of 2019. And on a
weather-normal basis, were down 1.5%, tracking well ahead of our forecast. And looking at the sales
trend on Page 17 of the packet, we continue to see favorable progression towards normal demand in the
third quarter. In fact, we're very pleased with the preliminary sales results we've seen for October.

Of course, we're watching economic indicators, as always, and we are prepared to respond if the level of
recovery drops back to what we saw earlier this year.

I also have a few updates on the wind projects in our Infrastructure segment. Construction on the
Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge projects is on schedule. Blooming Grove should be completed by the
end of this year. For Tatanka Ridge, we expect commercial operation in the first quarter of 2021.

And turning to another of our projects, construction on the Thunderhead Wind Energy Center in Nebraska
is nearly complete. However, as we reported last quarter, there will be a delay in the in-service date. This
delay has been caused by a permit issue related to a substation being built by Nebraska Public Power
District. We are working with all parties to complete the work and bring Thunderhead to commercial
operations in the latter half of 2021. I would point out that we have a number of upsides in the plan, so
this delay should not change the trajectory of our earnings growth for 2021.

And now I'll turn things over to Kevin to give an update on Utility Operations.

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Scott.

I'll start with the fact that we have maintained our focus on safety and customer service. In fact, our
customer satisfaction scores remain at an all-time record high. Meanwhile, we have streamlined our
operations and maintenance costs through a number of efficiency measures, and I'm confident that the
momentum we've seen this year will continue.

Now I'll review where we stand in our state jurisdictions. In Wisconsin, I'm pleased to report that just
yesterday, our Two Creeks Solar farm began commercial operation, providing 100 megawatts of renewable
capacity for the customers of Wisconsin Public Service, ahead of schedule and on budget. This is our
first utility-scale solar project with an investment of $130 million. And we continue to develop plans for 2
liquefied natural gas facilities. We are working with regulators and local officials and pending all necessary
approvals, we expect construction to start in the fall of 2021. These facilities will provide customer savings
and enhanced reliability during Wisconsin's cold winters.

In Illinois, we're seeking a rate review for one of our smaller subsidiaries, North Shore Gas, which serves
approximately 160,000 customers in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Rates for North Shore Gas were last
set more than 5 years ago before we acquired the company. Since then, we have consistently invested
capital to serve our customers while reducing operating costs. We expect a constructive dialogue with the
Illinois Commerce Commission as we seek rates that will support system safety and reliability.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Xia.

Xia Liu
Senior EVP & CFO

Thank you, Kevin.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

As Gale noted earlier, our 2020 third quarter earnings grew to $0.84 per share compared to $0.74 per
share in 2019. To reiterate Scott's comments, COVID-19 had a much milder impact on electric sales.
Overall, we estimate that the pandemic caused a $0.01 decrease in margin for the quarter. This decrease
was more than offset by favorable third quarter results, largely driven by our continued focus on operating
efficiency, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin utility and the execution of our capital plan. Our electric
utilities also benefited from warmer-than-normal weather.

The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter results on
Page 21. I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share.

Starting with our Utility Operations, this quarter, we outperformed third quarter last year by $0.11.
Our focus on operating efficiency drove a $0.04 decrease in day-to-day O&M expenses. We benefited
by an estimated $0.03 per share from warmer weather. And all other factors had a positive variance of
$0.07, primarily driven by rate adjustments, continued recovery from capital investment and fuel. These
favorable factors were offset by $0.03 of higher depreciation and amortization expense.

Our Energy Infrastructure segment also was accretive to the quarter. The Coyote Ridge Wind Farm, which
was placed in service in late December 2019, added $0.01 per share, primarily from production tax
credits.

Finally, the $0.02 drag in Corporate and Other was driven by some tax and other items, partially offset
by lower interest expense and improved rabbi trust performance. Remember, rabbi trust performance is
mostly offset in utility O&M. In summary, we improved on our third quarter 2019 performance by $0.10.

Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income
tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers,
we project our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a
modest taxpayer in 2020. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position
with our current capital plan.

Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by
operating activities increased $109 million. This increase was driven by higher cash earnings, partially
offset by higher working capital requirements, including COVID-related impacts. Total capital expenditures
were $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of 2020, a $107 million increase from 2019. This reflects our
investment focus in our regulated utilities. Last month, we refinanced $950 million of our holding company
debt, reducing the average coupon of these notes from 3.3% to 1.6%. We will recognize the $0.06 make-
whole premium in the fourth quarter, which we have already factored into our 2020 annual guidance.

In closing, I'd like to provide our updated guidance. We're narrowing and raising our earnings guidance for
2020 to a range of $3.74 to $3.76 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This
assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. Our previous guidance was in the range of $3.71
to $3.75 per share.

With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Xia, thank you very much.

We're on track for a solid year. Again, in light of our strong performance, our guidance range, as Xia
indicated, now stands at $3.74 to $3.76 per share, with a clear expectation of reaching the top end of
the range. We're also reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth in the range of 5% to 7%
a year. And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend. As usual, I expect our Board will assess our
dividend plans for next year at our scheduled meeting in early December. We continue to target a payout
ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend
growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.
And operator, we're now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So a couple of questions here. First, obviously, another healthy CapEx increases were heading into EEI.
The generation spend could be a little bit more lumpy versus traditional renewables. So how do we sort of
think about the cadence of that spend through '25? Is it ratable? Is the 7% rate base growth linear? Just
remind us, what drives sort of that delta between rate base growth and earnings growth, especially since
you aren't issuing equity, right? That was clear. Or are you simply, Gale, implying that unless something is
unforeseen, earnings growth should be closer to the top end bearing 7% rate base growth? So how do we
start to think about that?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Okay. Terrific. Let me handle the second part of your question first, and then we'll let Scott and Xia talk
about the generation portion of the capital spend and how it shakes out in our projections over the 5-year
period. But in terms of your basic question about how does 7% asset base growth translate into earnings
growth, particularly since we don't need to issue equity. And that, I think, as you know, is a differentiating
factor for us.

But obviously, I mean, to be accurate, as you know, you have to take into account the fact that we will be
issuing some debt to help finance the capital program. So in essence, when you look at 7% asset-based
growth and you throw in some assumptions on financing costs for debt. And remember, we're basically
trying to finance our growth at 50% debt, 50% equity, roughly. In essence, that takes the 7% down a bit.
And I would say that, conservatively, this plan should put us in -- certainly in the low 6s. But certainly, on
the top half of that -- well into the top half of that 5% to 7% growth projection.

I hope that responds to your question, Shar.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

It does. It does. And I appreciate that.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

All right. And Scott and Xia, on the generation spending over the 5 years.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

And look, there will be more color in the deck that we provide this Friday and for EEI. But as you look at
the 5-year plan, it's spread probably over -- more over the first 4 years with probably '23 and -- '22 and
'23 being the larger years on capital spending. But once again, we're early -- we have to go through the
regulatory approvals, and it will affect the timing of this. But the typical 5-year plan that you've seen --
that you'll see later, the first 3, 4 years or 2 or 3 years are much more analyzed, a little more detail to it
with the 4 and 5 years that usually tail off a little bit because we're quite -- not quite that far in laying out
all those projects. So 2023 and '22 are probably the bigger years.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

And Shar, just to add one other piece of color to that. We are expecting -- and in our plan, we're expecting
some unit retirements in 2023 and 2024. And in order to prepare for those unit retirements, we'd have to
be spending capital on replacement capacity upfront. So I think Scott and Xia are right. You would expect
to see the lion's share, I would think, of our generation capital spend, '22, '23, '24 and perhaps a bit over
into 2025.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Right. Right. That's helpful. And then like -- and then Gale, just as you kind of look at the generation
transition, look at what you're proposing today, it's like 1.8 gigawatts of fossil fuel assets that are retiring,
focusing on solar batteries and wind. I mean, obviously, this is going to afford some additional O&M and
cost savings, maybe some of the best we've seen in the industry. How do we sort of think about the size of
the O&M profile and the trajectory as we think about '21 and sort of beyond there, as we're looking to sort
of model the rate inflation or even the O&M profile that you guys have? Because it just seems like this is
going to lead to additional bill headroom for additional capital opportunities.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, Shar, I don't think there's any question about that. Because, yes, as we retire some of these older,
less-efficient units, there is significant O&M involved in maintaining those units. There's also avoided
capital. There's a significant amount of avoided capital here that would have to be spent on the older,
efficient units if we kept the -- or inefficient units if we kept them running.

To give you an example. And then -- and we've all talked a good bit about this, as you can imagine, in
terms of what we really think is real in terms of the continuing decline in operation and maintenance costs
while maintaining greatly superior customer service. But say, for example, a 4-unit, coal-fired plant that is
an older plant, we're seeing probably net $50 million of O&M savings on the retirement of a plant like that,
for example. So -- and clearly, there are coal retirements, as I mentioned during the script, involved here,
but it's multimillion dollars of O&M savings, not to mention additional fuel cost savings. So yes, there's
going to be headroom here, and we don't see this plan driving rate increases at all above the inflation
rate. And in the longer term, as I mentioned, compared to the status quo, I would expect at least $1
billion of savings compared to the status quo over about a 20-year period.

But in the near term, there will be some little uptick that we'll have to ask for to take care of the recovery
of the capital. But there will be huge O&M offsets and fuel cost saving offsets for customers. So very little
bit of pressure. And then in terms of just where we are at this stage of the game, Kevin and I, we really
think like as we look at and finish our budgets for 2021, that the O&M savings trajectory we're on will
continue.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

That's exactly right, Gale. As I mentioned in my -- the momentum that we've seen so far, we have full
expectations that will continue going forward.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Perfect. And then just lastly for me, Gale, on -- obviously, we saw with Foxconn's move last week to
challenge WEDC's determination on its tax credits and the scope change. How do you sort of see this
process kind of playing out? And how should we, like sort of as observers on the sidelines, kind of
think about it? Is it just part of the process given the design has changed a little? Do you still envision
incremental opportunities with the project? Like how do we sort of put all this sort of stuff together sitting
on the sidelines?

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Yes, great question, Shar. And I would give you a 3-part answer. The first is, you've heard me say this
before. Forget about what you read in the headlines, look at what's happening on the campus, look at the
construction activity going on, on the high-tech campus that they're now 2 years into developing. Foxconn
has invested over $0.5 billion already in this campus.

As I mentioned, construction continues. They've already become the largest single property taxpayer in
the county, in Racine County. And I do think what will happen here, because the contract with the state
was so specific about building a Gen 10.5 fabrication plant for LCD panels, I do think there will have to be
some changes to the contract, which there are ongoing discussions about. But I'm -- again, I would say to
you, look at what's happening on the campus. And I would add that because their plans have changed and
their original plan did not have high capacity computing, we're still seeing significant projection of demand
for electricity. So our demand projections have not changed dramatically at all because as they've changed
and evolved their plans, they've added things like high-capacity computing.

And then the last thing I would say to you is one of the products that they're looking at developing
and producing out of that campus are server parts and server racks. And they're already deploying a
combination of technologies that I just really got a briefing on yesterday from them, which is just really
amazing. They're already deploying, on a test basis there at that campus, artificial intelligence, 5G and
robotics to be the most efficient producer of server and server racks in the world out of that campus. So
they're still very active in terms of determining what they want to do there. I do think it will probably
require some modifications to the wording of the contract. But again, I would say, keep your eye on what's
happening on the campus, and we'll be happy to keep you updated.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Gale, congrats on your extension as Chairman. Now you're stuck with us until '24.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Thank you, Shar. Happy to be stuck.

Operator

Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And let me reemphasize Shar's comment. We're pleased to be able to continue to report to you what we're
doing over the next few years, too. So looking forward to that.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Thank you.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So if I can pick it up where you left it off as well, let's talk about the timing on the Energy Infrastructure
just more broadly as well. And I know you guys talked to the generation piece here, but you all were so
successful in this first year and pulling forward that CapEx as you identified opportunities, et cetera. And
what's the potential we do that again, especially as it seems like the Energy Infrastructure opportunities
before you -- are probably larger now than they were before? So I don't want to get too far ahead of
myself here, but curious how you respond to that.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Yes. Well, first of all, I think your observation is correct. When you look at the pipeline of high-quality
opportunities that we are seeing, that pipeline, even though we have been very successful in pulling
forward, as you say, a significant amount of investment in the Infrastructure segment, that pipeline of
opportunity is definitely broader and greater and deeper today than it was before the pandemic. So we
are -- as you know, we're being very selective here because we're in a very strong, competitive position
with our tax appetite and with the fact that we can bring these to closure without having to issue equity,
without having to go through a lot of hoops. So we're being very selective, and we're focusing right now
on 3 or 4 near-term projects. I wouldn't expect any announcement -- new announcement before the end
of the year. But I would just say, watch this space for 2021.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Excellent. And then if I can turn back to '21 in the context of earnings and earnings latitude, not
necessarily on the longer-term 5% to 7%, but just as you think about the O&M that you were able to
pull. The latitude in your numbers, perhaps, I'll frame it that way. How do you think about the ability
to accelerate, especially in the 4Q here, some of the costs from next year and add confidence to your
numbers going into next year? I'll put it that way. Especially given some of the refinancing opportunities
you all have as well.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, great question, Julien. Let me say this, we have a significant number of maintenance projects
underway now in the fourth quarter. We had identified, as you may recall -- in addition to our original plan,
which had about a 2% to 3% reduction in O&M for this year, in addition to that, we had identified up to
about $80 million of additional cost reductions, if needed.

The good news is with what you've heard in terms of a number of the positive developments, we will not
need that deep a cost reduction. And in addition to that, Xia and the finance team did a great job, as you
mentioned, on the refinancing. So that's another plus. So there's a lot of work going on right now in terms
of the kinds of outage maintenance projects and other O&M projects that I think will be helpful in derisking
2021.

Xia, anything to add to that?

Xia Liu
Senior EVP & CFO

No. I think you covered it, Gale.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Considering that you're going to be a taxpayer in 2020 or a modest taxpayer in 2020, yes, should --
depending on the outcome of the election, there's talk of possible higher tax rates going forward. If there
were higher tax rates, would that increase your ability to grow the Infrastructure business faster, deeper?
Have it be a higher percentage of overall earnings than your original plan? Just curious how that might
affect things.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Good question. Let me try to frame the answer, and we're going to ask Xia and Scott to add whatever they
would like on that question.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

For starters, we are always modest, as you know. So we'll be a modest taxpayer in 2020. But with the way
the current tax rules work on production -- on investment tax credits and production tax credits, we're
always going to be -- no matter what the effective tax rate is, we're always going to be, in our projections,
a modest taxpayer simply because you can't take -- under the rules, you really can't take it to 0. So that's
one point. And then if tax rates go up, there's actually a couple of benefits to us overall.

Xia?

Xia Liu
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. I think, one, to your point, Michael, that if tax rates went up, then we would potentially have a higher
tax appetite. So therefore, we could potentially speed up the Infrastructure investment. And on top of
that, you all knew that there's interest tax shield at the holding company. So with a higher tax rate, that
would basically provide some benefits at the holding company. And obviously, we would need to work with
the regulators in each jurisdiction on the recovery front. But if we're able to recover the higher tax rate,
then we would have better cash flow and credit metrics. And we have pass-through mechanisms in all of
the jurisdictions. So I think, overall, we are prepared in case of a different tax situation.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

And Michael, just out of curiosity, how are you going to avoid higher taxes? I don't think that works for
you, does it?

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Modesty is the best policy.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

I would reiterate all of it. Regardless of the tax rates, we are going to look at the Infrastructure segment
long term, not being more than 10% of our total earnings. So I just want to reiterate that with you.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just one more question, and I'll let you go. The -- there's talk also of extending or giving new tax credits
to batteries going forward. And is that an area that you think you might be able to invest in going
forward? If the -- presumably, it's an ITC rather than a PTC. Just curious of how that might affect your
thought process.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes. I would guess it would almost have to be an ITC as opposed to a PTC. But yes -- and you probably
heard me say that for the first time in this new 5-year capital plan that we're rolling out today, for the
first time, we're adding battery storage for our regulated business. The economics are such now that with
the amount of battery storage that we think we need, it will fill a very economic function for us, with or
without additional tax credits.

But long story short, regardless who wins the presidency, it wouldn't surprise me if there were some
modification to all of the tax credits associated with renewables. And you can see a big push for tax credits
for batteries. We have not counted on that in our 5-year capital plan. But just the economics and the niche
need that we have for batteries, particularly at peak times, it's beginning to make -- and for the first time,
it's making significant economic sense for our customers.

Do you think there would be a role for batteries with the wind projects in the Infrastructure business,
though?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Oh, potentially, yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. And we have room at the number of our -- the wind farms
in our Infrastructure projects, we have room for battery storage. So yes, that potentially could be an
enhancement down the road. No question.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wondering if you might be able to update us a bit on the local and economic sales trends across your
service territory that you said were kind of underpinning favorable October trends, as you mentioned
there. And also curious on expectations for the winter's heating season under ongoing kind of COVID-19
impacts here. And how do you think the impacts differ on the electric versus the gas operations there?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, that's a great question in terms of how the impacts differ between the electric and natural gas
distribution business. And we have actually had a lot of internal discussion about that. First of all, let me
say this, the -- just to give you kind of a framing answer related to the electric side and the trends we're
seeing. As I mentioned to you, residential consumption of electricity has exceeded what we thought during
the pandemic. Now some of that was weather-driven. We had a warm summer compared to normal. But
some of it also is just the fact that working from home and schooling from home in many cases is just
driving more energy consumption from residential customers. So the residential demand for electricity
during the last few months, weather or not, has actually exceeded our expectations. That's been on the
plus side.

We've done better than we thought we would in terms of industrial demand for electricity, still down, but
we've done better than we thought we would. As I mentioned during the script, we have a number of
industrial customers that produce essential products and certainly, paper, food packaging, food processing,
electronic controls, plastics manufacturing. We've all seen strength among our customers in those
segments.

Where we continue to see a drag, and it won't surprise you, is in small commercial and industrial. Many
restaurants are still at 25% capacity, just to give you an example. Hair salons are having to operate at
much lower levels. There's -- some university campuses are not back in terms of full complement of
students, so the dorms are not full. So on the commercial side, particularly for small business, there's still
a struggle going on. So that would be kind of my answer. And Scott and Xia can add whatever they would
like, and Kevin as well.

In terms of the difference between electric and gas, it's going to be interesting to see, but we had a
relatively cold October, for October temperatures in Wisconsin, and for that matter, in the upper Midwest.
And actually, even weather normalized, natural gas demand was better than we thought it would be,
exceeded our projections.

The other thing I can tell you that is, I think, significant, and Scott can add to this, we're seeing very, very
good customer growth on the natural gas distribution side of the business. Scott?

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Yes, that's correct, Gale. Especially, when you look at Wisconsin and the growth we're talking about on
the industrial side and the economic development you're talking. We're seeing good natural gas growth
and electric growth. Gas growth, it's nearly 5% on new -- 5% more new customer hookups this year than
we had over last year. So good customer growth, and that number is like 3% or 4% on the electric side.
So really positive as we're seeing new connections come along. And you're right, going into the winter
months on October, our preliminary view looks reasonable and very happy with what we're seeing.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Does that respond to your question at all, Jeremy?

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, that was very helpful. And then just want to go back to the O&M side, I guess, and how has O&M
savings trended versus expectations and what you see extending into 2021 here? And really just want
to see, are these savings meaningful enough to potentially defer your next Wisconsin rate case? And any
sense on commission appetite there?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, Jeremy, let me say, first, on the rate case front, way too early to have any meaningful discussions
about a potential filing in 2021 in Wisconsin. And I would just say -- simply say this, every option is on
the table right now. We'll have a whole lot better feel as we move into the first part of next year, but every
option is on the table right now.

And then in terms of the O&M reductions, essentially, I'm guessing that we end up, Xia, about 3% to 4%
O&M lower for this calendar year than last calendar year. Xia is shaking her head up and down, yes.

Now we had identified potentially more O&M savings than that. But as we've had a number of positive
developments, bottom line is we simply don't need to cut that deep. But Kevin, everything I'm seeing
-- I know you're closer to it than I am on the operational side, but everything I'm seeing is that our
momentum on O&M reduction will continue into next year, and a big chunk of the savings that we're
seeing are sustainable.

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

That's exactly right, Gale. If you look at things that we've learned during the COVID pandemic that we're
all dealing with is we've been more effective in our field operation and scheduling. We're also completing
the -- our customer service platform that will be for We Energies here in the 1st of January. And that we'll
have a consistent platform available for all of our companies, and that will also give us some sustainability
in our cost savings as well.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

And then, of course, we have, in the future plan, as you know, we've got retirements of older, less-efficient
generating units, which also will deliver O&M savings. So we're very bullish and optimistic on our ability to
continue to drive efficiency and best practice across our 7 operating companies.

Your next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

So a question for you, guys. On batteries, you mentioned that batteries are becoming a cost-effective
solution for you. Could you maybe put it in relative terms, cost-effective relative to what? And I'm
assuming they're replacing peakers or some sort? Maybe if you could give us a little bit more color on how
you're deploying those assets and what you're comparing them to.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

I'll be happy to. And the answer is really very straightforward. It's cost-effective compared to other
peaking solutions, if you will, compared to other capacity that we would need to help meet peak demand.
Or as someone said during one of our meetings the other day, the battery solution basically is going to
give us sunshine after sunset, which I thought was an interesting comparison. But yes, for -- when you
compare it to other peaking technology, other peaking capacity, a certain amount of battery storage has
become cost-effective for our customers.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

So that is before any potential tax incentives are attached to it?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

That would be before any additional tax incentives. That is correct. We're not counting on any additional
tax incentives at all.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & COO

But if they're available, we will definitely take advantage of them.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Oh, absolutely. Yes. Scott's right.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. And the storage solutions, are you looking beyond battery storage? Are you looking at any other, I
guess, stationary power -- stationary solutions, maybe other types of chemistries, other technologies that
are not batteries? Or is it primarily just lithium-ion batteries at this point, too?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

At this point, it remains lithium-ion batteries. Now that doesn't mean we're blind to something else.
But the plan, because it's proven, and we understand the cost and the effectiveness of the technology,
the plan right now calls for lithium-ion batteries. If 2 years from now -- 2 years into our 5-year plan, if
something else emerges that we know is cost-effective and reliable, then we would certainly be open to it.
But right now, it's lithium-ion.

And let me add to that, just a philosophical comment. A company like ours, I mean -- I don't believe,
and our home management team feels the same way, I mean we're not in the business of being on the
bleeding edge of technology. I mean this -- to deliver customer value and shareholder value, this is
all about cost-effectiveness and reliability. And that's our job. Cost-effectiveness, reliability, customer
satisfaction, all of that leads to shareholder returns. So we are a very close follower. And Kevin is on
the Board of the Electric Power Research Institute. I was years ago. We participate in a number of
the experimental projects. We stay abreast of technology developments, but we're not -- but for our
customers and for what we believe is the core of how we do business, we're not into the bleeding edge of
technology.

Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

I just had a question on the coal and gas that you're shutting down, the 1,400 and 400 megawatts. Are
you able to quantify the rate base, the remaining rate base value of that and how that's planning to be
recouped?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Absolutely. So if you think about -- and again, those retirements will occur probably, most of them, 2023,
2024. So if you look at our projected rate base for 2025, it's roughly -- across our entire operation, our
entire system, it will be roughly about $32 billion. If you look at essentially what we will be retiring, the
remaining rate base is probably roughly -- Xia, $600 million net of deferred taxes? So a way to look at
that is it's about 2% of our total asset base or will be about 2% of our total asset base. And for Wisconsin,
under 5% of our rate base.

So that's really kind of the basic numbers as we see them today. And in terms of future recovery, we -- I
think we've done very well in terms of coming to an agreed-upon solution with the commission, with the
environmental advocates, with the industrial customer groups. We've got a good track record of coming to
an amiable and constructive solution in terms of recovery, also potentially in terms of some securitization,
particularly of environmental control costs. So there will be a lot of discussions over the next 4 years. But
in direct answer to your question, less than 5% of the Wisconsin rate base by 2025 and roughly about 2%
of our total asset base.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. That's super helpful. And then my second question was just you mentioned in the remarks about
filing a North Shore Gas case in Illinois. Any near-term plans to do the same for Peoples Gas?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Short answer, no.

Operator

Your last question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So just sort of -- I know it's a little far off. But when COVID is over, are you seeing any -- I mean, what is
-- what are your thoughts about what you think demand growth or the -- so the economic activity that's
occurring that you're seeing, are you seeing any potential changes in usage patterns happening after
COVID? More telecommuting, changes in peak, anything like that, that you're potentially thinking are
going to be more long-lasting than -- once the pandemic is kind of over?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, that's a good question, Paul. And everybody's crystal ball is a bit fuzzy after what we've all been
through in 2020. However, a couple of thoughts, for what they're worth. I think we've all seen how
telecommuting, working from home, working remotely can lead to positive results. And I think most all
major corporations, ours included, are going to need less office space. I think some amount of remote

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

working will be a permanent part of the American landscape -- the corporate landscape for many, many
years to come.

So the question then becomes, well, how much remote working will remain after COVID is finally
conquered? And what does that mean in terms of commercial energy usage and also in terms of
continuing growth in residential energy usage? And those questions are still to be answered. But I think,
to me, manufacturing, particularly with this hot an area as we have manufacturing and distribution in
the southeastern corner of Wisconsin, some of these projects may move a few months here or there.
But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this is a hot area for industrial and commercial growth right
now. We don't see that diminishing. So then the question becomes, do things shift around a bit between
commercial and residential, depending upon how much work-at-home activity there continues to be post
the vaccine.

Kevin, any other thoughts?

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Gale, that's certainly true for the broader group of -- look at our economy. But if you just look again at
what we've seen as a result of -- you mentioned about facilities, we're seeing that because of the positive
results and meeting the needs of our customers, we don't need as much in the way of facilities as we've
had in our major markets. So as you pointed out, I think looking broadly, other industries will be like us in
that perspective. But I would also agree, it's really too early to tell to see how we bounce back and how
quickly we bounce back.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. Great. So on that note, the -- you guys have a large amount of industrial activity that you guys
have gone over. And you've got -- also, things have changed over the years. You've got a large amount
of geographical diversity and what have you. And you mentioned Foxconn, and they're, as you know, in
the media sort of saga about this. And I know you're very supportive of Foxconn, you see that as a big
win and what have you. But let's just, for argument's sake, say that for whatever reason, Foxconn and the
state can't come to an agreement. Given everything that you got going for you, with the dynamic growth
in -- right around you, but also just your geographic diversity, the size of the company now, what kind of
impact would that have if it actually just didn't happen? Do you follow what I'm saying?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes. Well, let me say, first of all, I mean, Foxconn is a huge corporation. I think from a revenue standpoint,
they're the fourth largest tech company in the world. But even a company that size, I mean, they've
already invested $0.5 billion, more than $500 million in beginning to build out the campus that we've
talked about in Racine County. So even a company that size, I don't think would just walk away from a
$0.5 billion investment that they just made in very modern, state-of-the-art production equipment.

So -- and to take that a step further, if they did nothing more, they would still have $0.5 billion of
investment. They would still have significant electric demand because they've added high-capacity
computing to their plants. In fact, that's already being built right now. And we've already seen $1.3
billion of additional private investment that has nothing to do with Foxconn directly, but $1.3 billion of
additional private investment, 2/3 of which is either complete or underway in the 10-mile radius around
the Foxconn campus. So there's already been -- from a textbook economic development standpoint, Paul,
there's already been tremendous ripple effect, and the state has benefited from that. And to put that
in perspective, if there was no more investment from Foxconn at $500 billion -- or $500 million, which
they've already done, would still be the largest economic development project in the history of the State
of Wisconsin.

Then we have HARIBO, which we talked about a lot, the gummy bear people. They are breaking ground
next month. And their investment is going to be, gosh, probably 30% to 35% more than they originally
envisioned. It's going to be a much bigger campus.

So we're seeing such tremendous opportunity and tremendous pipeline of growth that I'm not overly
concerned about what might happen. And also, I mean, there's good faith on both sides here. So -- I
mean I just don't see -- despite all the political rhetoric that you see, again, my advice is, forget the
headlines, look at what's going on, on the ground.
