detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. The
release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the
presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking
statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC
public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information.

Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless
otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's
earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will
be available later this afternoon on our website.

With that, I will hand the call over to Tim.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Tina, and welcome, everyone. The global pandemic, volatility in the macro-economy, ongoing
U.S.-China tensions, we are operating this year amid tremendous uncertainty and unprecedented
challenges impacting people all over the world. We see technology playing a critical role keeping people
connected, enabling businesses to remain productive and accelerating solutions to the myriad of problems
the world is confronting. I am very pleased with how Lam's employees have demonstrated care for each
other and our communities and have responded with great effort to support our customers' success. As a
result of their outstanding execution, today, we are reporting strong performance for the June period and
guiding to another quarter of solid growth.

Specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, our teams have demonstrated agility and resolve in establishing safe
and effective protocols to perform essential work in our facilities, while also enabling the majority of our
employees to remain productive while they continue working remotely. We have ramped and stabilized our
supply and production capability after an initial period of disruption to support revenues greater than $3
billion per quarter. As you have seen from our guidance, we will be nearing record output levels for the
company in the September quarter, highlighting the effectiveness of our business continuity plans, our
global manufacturing network and our trusted supply chain partners. We will continue to capture learnings
to further improve business resilience and better serve our customers in the future. But overall, I am
proud of what our employees and partners have accomplished during this challenging period.

Before discussing our results for the quarter, I wanted to comment briefly on our review of the new rules
regarding sales of semiconductor equipment into China. China remains an important part of the global
semiconductor ecosystem, and Lam has a solid track record of business in this market. We are closely
monitoring and complying with all regulatory directives. And based on our assessment, we currently see
no material financial or business impact from the new rules.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Turning now to the June quarter. Revenue and EPS came in above our expectations. Operating margins
improved sequentially and we generated over $800 million in cash from operations. As the September
quarter guidance indicates, we see continued positive momentum as we move into the second half of
the year. The results also represent sustained progress towards our long-term objectives. As mentioned
earlier, our guidance indicates we are nearing prior record levels of revenue, but we believe that our
opportunity for growth remains robust. Key points supporting our view include: one, memory investments
must continue to grow to meet secular demand drivers. Lam's memory mix year-to-date at slightly below
60% of system revenues is well below historic highs. We expect our strong memory position to drive
outperformance in share of WFE spend as NAND and DRAM investment levels increase.

Two, our actions to improve our foundry/logic SAM and share are yielding results. With our revenue
growth in this segment, outpacing foundry/logic WFE growth cycle to cycle. And three, our customer
support business group at 34% of total revenues year-to-date is an increasingly greater contributor to our
top line than in the past.

Looking at the broader WFE environment. Our outlook remain strong. While COVID-19 has created
volatility for the semiconductor industry, in a larger sense, it has underscored the rapidly growing reliance
of individuals and businesses on semiconductors and the products and technologies they enable. For
example, we are seeing accelerated growth in Internet video traffic, as video becomes embedded in a
broad range of business and consumer activities. This is manifesting currently in work-from-home, e-
learning, telehealth, online gaming and, of course, video streaming. Nearly 2/3 of global consumers cite
video as their preferred medium for obtaining information. The demand that this places on data transport,
analysis and storage will continue to rise. Mobile networks are migrating to 5G. Video quality is doubling
from 4K to 8K and cloud and enterprise data centers are expanding to support the enhanced data traffic.

A 2x resolution improvement in mobile video drives roughly a 70% increase in NAND storage content
and newer server architectures are expected to have over 30% more memory channels versus prior
generations. Despite the recent downtick in smartphone units, our own assessment of NAND content in
smartphones in calendar year 2020 has trended higher versus our prior baseline due to a greater mix
shift towards 5G devices. We are also seeing increased NAND demand related to new product cycles
in the game console segment, with some of the new platforms adding up to a terabyte of SSD-based
storage. Launches of the new game consoles are expected to add low- to mid-single-digit percent growth
to overall NAND bit demand in 2020. These demand drivers, in combination with increasing semiconductor
manufacturing complexity, create a compelling setup for sustained strength in WFE spending.

In 2020, we estimate WFE to be in the mid- to high $50 billion, driven by growth in both memory
and foundry/logic investment. Although we have seen underlying demand drivers fluctuate due to the
challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, our current WFE forecast in total is very close to what
we expected at the beginning of the year. From a mix perspective, we see memory share of WFE growing
in 2020 of a low 2019 level. This trend should continue into 2021, particularly in DRAM, where we believe
inventory levels will be lower as we get to the end of 2020.

In both NAND and DRAM, we see bit supply growth lower than long-term demand this year and NAND
recovery progressing ahead of DRAM. By geography, domestic China customers continue to be a strong
source of WFE demand, with expected calendar year 2020 WFE spend in the $10 billion range. Year-on-
year growth in China investment is predominantly driven by NAND and Foundry segments.

Looking more broadly at longer-term global WFE spend, we are increasingly confident that the accelerating
digitization of the economy, along with the rising complexity of semiconductor manufacturing at each
technology migration, is establishing a higher base of WFE spending at the $60 billion level. With this
outlook, we are focused on delivering on our objectives to drive greater than 50% growth in revenue and
more than a doubling of EPS by 2023, 2024 compared to our 2019 results. Key to achieving these goals is
to execute on the SAM expansion, market share growth and installed base revenue opportunities we laid
out at our Investor Day in March.

On the system side, we continue to see positive momentum across our businesses. The June quarter
marked a record for net penetration and defense wins in our Etch business, as measured by 3-year
forward revenue, which is a metric we began tracking internally a few years ago. We achieved key wins

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

in high aspect ratio Mask Open and Contact Etch applications in both DRAM and NAND and leveraging
unique hardware capabilities for RF control and edge yield enhancement that we introduced last year, we
have further extended our technical leadership in high aspect ratio processes across both conductor and
dielectric etch. We also combined these technologies with our Hydra patterning system, which is enabled
by Lam's equipment intelligence and uses fab data inputs to improve customer yield. With this system, we
were able to secure new positions in quad and EUV patterning for DRAM.

In the June quarter, we also made good progress in our effort to disrupt older equipment segments with
more innovative extendable Lam solutions. With our enhanced ALD family of products, we achieved 2
new wins for 3D NAND gap fill applications and a multilayer application win in foundry/logic. Superior film
quality, integration and architecturally enabled productivity were instrumental to our success. In DRAM
and Foundry, we are also seeing accelerated adoption of our ALD solutions for critical spacer applications,
which have traditionally been done using furnaces. Overall, we believe our enhanced ALD solutions are
helping to enable the performance and cost roadmaps our customers need. At the same time, we continue
to help customers extract more value from their installed base of Lam equipment. In the June quarter, our
customer support revenues grew approximately 8% from the March period and our revenue growth has
exceeded installed base unit growth year-to-date.

Our Reliance Systems business posted its eighth straight quarter of record revenues, driven primarily by
shipments to analog, mixed signal, CIS and microcontroller segments. The challenges of the COVID-19
pandemic have also accelerated the deployment of important new technologies for remote equipment
support. By enabling real time in-fab access to Lam service experts located worldwide, we have reduced
installation and troubleshooting time without the need for extensive travel. In addition, increasing
adoption of our machine learning-based analytics, leveraging big data at customer sites is enabling faster
detection and resolution of issues. These advances are the result of investments that, as we shared at our
Investor Day, are targeted at delivering services innovation that creates value for our customers and also
increases our revenue opportunity per chamber.

So to wrap up, Lam delivered a very strong June quarter, and we see continued strength ahead. We are
seeing positive momentum in our efforts to grow our installed base revenue, expand our served markets
and increase our market share. And as a result, we believe we are increasingly well positioned to benefit
from the long-term secular growth drivers in the semiconductor industry.

Thank you all for joining and for your support, and I'll now turn it over to Doug.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Awesome. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope all of
you and your families have been safe and healthy. Our operations steadily improved throughout the June
quarter as we executed well in this COVID-19 environment. We've become increasingly more efficient and
effective in our operations, which I think are well reflected in the results from the June quarter.

Our revenues came in at $2.8 billion, driven by broad-based demand. Our customers are investing in
leading-edge technologies to service the growth they're seeing in 5G, data centers and product cycle
driven demand in the gaming console market. Lam's solid execution is reflected in our revenue result, our
gross margin performance as well as our earnings per share that came in at $4.78. I'd also just point out
that our deferred revenue balance is back to a more normal range as compared to the end of the March
quarter. From a system segment perspective, the total memory segment in the June quarter increased
to 61% of system revenues from the March quarter level, which was at 56%. We saw increases in NAND
spending, which contributed 45% of our system revenue, which was up from 40% in the March quarter.
Net investments are broad-based focused on 64, 96 and initial 128-layer devices. DRAM spending was
consistent across the June and March quarters at 16% and continues to be focused on node transition,
primarily versions to 1y and 1z. The combined memory market remains in a healthy place due to proactive
inventory management as well as a prudent investment cadence.

In foundry, demand across diverse end market applications continues to drive the investment profile.
While foundry as a percentage of our system revenue slightly declined from the March quarter percentage

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

of 31% to the June quarter at 29%, revenue actually increased in dollar terms coming in at the second
highest system revenue level for foundry in Lam's 40-year history. We continue to be pleased with our
trajectory here.

And finally, the Logic and Other segment contributed the remaining 10% of systems revenue in the June
quarter as compared to 13% in March. China investments continued to be strong in the June quarter, with
34% of our total revenue coming from that region. We're seeing investments from customers in all market
segments within China. The majority of the revenue again came from domestic Chinese customers. We
continue to expect solid investment levels in this region throughout the calendar year. China is obviously
an important market for Lam, and we remain confident in the strength of our business there.

The June quarter revenue for our customer support business group was a record at $927 million,
representing an increase of 8% from the March quarter level and an increase of over 17% from the same
quarter a year ago. We're delivering sustainable growth across the components of our customer support
group in spare parts, service, upgrades and our refurbished Reliant tool business. Within the June quarter,
we executed 2 significant longer-term spares contracts, further improving the recurring nature of the
revenue streams in this business and demonstrating further evidence of the trust our customers have in
us to continuously deliver value. Gross margin for the June quarter was 46.1%. At the start of the June
quarter, driven by uncertainties related to the COVID-19 situation, we saw potential capacity limitations,
both from our supply chain partners as well as our own internal production capability. However, as the
June quarter progressed, we were able to increase our production efficiency. The resulting expansion in
production volumes yielded better factory performance that enhanced gross margin from our original
expectations.

In addition, gross margins fluctuate, as you know, based on customer and product mix. And in the June
quarter, we ended up with a slightly more favorable mix than we anticipated at the start of the quarter.
We are seeing higher costs due to COVID in several areas, most notably freight and logistics. We're doing
our best to mitigate that headwind by managing other expenses in the factories and in the field. June
quarter operating expense came in at $493 million, slightly higher than the March quarter. We focused our
spending in the research and development area as we address our customers' most critical needs. Roughly
2/3 of our spending remains focused towards R&D. Our incentive compensation expense increased from
the prior quarter, which is tied to our improved profitability levels. At the same time, we've managed
expenses elsewhere, most notably travel, and they came down throughout the June quarter.

Operating income in the June quarter was $795 million, and operating margin was 28.5%, which was
an increase of 160 basis points from the prior quarter. Our tax rate this quarter was 7.6%. Our rate was
low in the June quarter, primarily due to a more favorable mix of geographic income and maybe more
importantly a onetime year-end adjustments we recorded as we closed our fiscal year. We will have
fluctuations in the rate from quarter-to-quarter. You should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be
in the low teens level for your models. Other income and expense increased slightly in the June quarter,
coming in at approximately $33 million of expense. Within the June quarter, we were opportunistic with
our capital structure. At the end of April, we completed an offering of $2 billion of investment-grade
bonds with maturities of 10, 30 and 40 years. I was pleased with the demand for our paper as well as the
pricing, which came in with coupons of 1.9%, 2.875% and 3.125%, respectively. We used $1.25 billion of
the debt proceeds to pay down the revolving credit facility that was then outstanding. That facility is now
completely paid down.

As we discussed in last quarter's call, the cost of our employee deferred compensation plan and the
offsetting hedging balances remain mismatched in the GAAP P&L. You can see these results in the GAAP
reconciliation table of our earnings release. Given the volatility in the market in the June quarter, there
were large fluctuations between our GAAP expenses and the OI&E lines that hedge essentially offsets at
the net income level. And you should note, the other income and expense balance includes the interest
expense of our outstanding debt amounts, obviously, offset by the interest income from our cash and
investment balances. You should expect that other income and expense will vary quarter-to-quarter based
on several market-related items, should think about things like foreign exchange.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

On the capital return side, we noted in our March quarter earnings call that we would be pausing our
buyback activity during the June quarter until we had a better line of sight in the business environment. As
a result, we had only a small amount of share repurchases in the latter part of the June quarter. And that,
together with dividends, ended up having us deploy approximately $200 million towards capital return.
Long-term capital return of 75% to 100% of free cash flow remains our plan. Diluted earnings per share,
as I said, was $4.78. I'll mention that the onetime benefit from the tax items I referenced was roughly
$0.14. Our diluted share balance for the June quarter rounded down to 147 million shares, only a very
slight decrease due to the minimal share repurchase activity. The share count includes a dilutive impact of
approximately 1 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. The dilution schedule for the remaining
2041 convertible note is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.

Let me now move on to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted
cash increased in the June quarter to $7 billion from $5.6 billion in the March quarter. Cash flows from
operations in the quarter were strong at $813 million due to healthy profitability and solid collections
during the quarter. The remainder of the increase quarter-to-quarter was related to the debt issuance,
offset by the pay down of the revolving credit facility. DSO decreased in the June quarter to 68 days
from 80 days in the March quarter, demonstrating strong collection performance and the resulting timing
of customer payments. Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter at 3.2x. We have consciously
increased our inventory balance to support the higher revenue level that we see in the September quarter.

Noncash expenses included approximately $50 million for equity compensation, $54 million for
depreciation and $17 million for amortization. June quarter capital expenditures were consistent with
the prior quarter amount coming in at $51 million. Ending headcount as of the June quarter was
approximately 11,300 regular full-time employees. This headcount reflects added resources in our factory
and field operations, supporting increased volume as well as additions in research and development to
support ongoing critical deliverables like the new Sense.i Etch platform and the dry resist program that we
announced at our Investor Day in March.

So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2020 quarter. We're
expecting revenue of $3.1 billion, plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin increasing to 46.5%, plus or
minus 1 percentage point. Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally,
earnings per share of $5.15, plus or minus $0.40 based on a share count of approximately 147 million
shares. These ranges remain wider than normal due to the continuing uncertainty from COVID-19. We are
well positioned for the second half of calendar 2020 as we expect continued healthy WFE investments. We
see continued strength from memory, and foundry for that matter, driven by demand and more strategic
technology-oriented investments. The customer support business group is also expected to provide
continued momentum for the company.
Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Doug, I guess the first question, you're talking about now WFE being mid- to high 50s this year. If I look
at Q3 and I look at your guidance and you're, sort of, probably going to gain some WFE share this year.
It would sort of assume that we're running maybe in the low 60s in Q3. So I guess, if I assume your full
year forecast, and I assume maybe you gain 100 basis points of WFE share this year, something like that,
it would sort of imply that December revenue is sort of flattish. And I'm not asking you to guide December,
but I'm just kind of wondering whether you think if that math holds together where you should gain like a
little bit of WFE share this year?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Tim, you're absolutely right. We're only guiding 1 quarter at a time, but -- and I'm not going to give
you a specific answer on December. But I will qualitatively say, I think, December will continue to be a
strong quarter for us. Your math -- I don't look at WFE on a quarterly basis. I'm sure you're doing the
math right, but you're also right about the observation on share spend and where memory is trending and
all of those things. We're setting up, I think, for a pretty good second half, Tim.

Operator

The next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess, a question on the memory side of things and where are we in the cycle? I know we're 30% above
the recent trough, but still 40% below the prior peak. And investors clearly have been focused on this
aspect and would love to hear your view, particularly, as it relates to the positive trends you highlighted
into calendar '21?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I'll start, C.J., and then let Doug add something if he wants to. Obviously, what we've been saying
for quite some time is that memory is a story of one kind of coming off what was a very strong 2018,
and a couple of years of then digesting that. But at the same time, there are underlying growth drivers
that I think you're seeing everywhere for both NAND and DRAM that give us greater confidence in what
we've stated as long-term bit demand growth in the high 30s for NAND and in the high teens for DRAM.
If those are correct and like, I said, I gave you a few of the examples of where there are big consumers
of NAND and DRAM from an application perspective on the horizon, we think that memory investment
has to continue to grow for years to come. Obviously, at our Investor Day, we laid out a model of a more
normalized memory spending level in the context of total $60 billion WFE. And in that environment, we
grow the company quite significantly.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. And C.J., maybe I'd just add. I mean, more near-term tactically relative to what's going on this year, I
think, NAND is a little bit ahead of DRAM relative to pace of recovery. When I look at the market, both are
kind of managing inventory, investing, what I described as or tried to with a prudent cadence. That's got
manned up this year. And DRAM may be up a little bit, but not too much. I really do think DRAM will be

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

more a 2021 story. So think about that near term. And then on top of that, as it relates to Lam, I mean,
we're doing extremely well in foundry as well. So factor that in when you think about what's going on with
our company.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Very helpful. And if I could follow-up on the service side, you grew that business stellar 17% year-on-
year. Was there any catch-up there on the deferred side? And I guess, thinking through that, how should
we think about the potential for sequential growth into September, December? How do tools coming off
warranty and upgrades look at least based on your bill plan today? Whatever you can share.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. C.J., in this part of the business, the deferred stuff we had at the end of March really wasn't impacting
things. The deferred, if you remember, what we described at the end of March, had to do with back order
shipment. That was really all about new equipment. So I don't think there's anything terribly unique going
on in CSBG. Tim, unless there's something...

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

No, I think it's -- again, it's just the efforts, as we've said, to continue to provide services to grow
our revenue opportunity per chamber and also just our business as you pointed out. As our company
continues to grow faster, the installed base grows faster and generates more opportunity. I don't think
there's anything else.

Tina Correia
Corporate Vice President of ?Investor Relations? & Corporate?Finance

Operator, can we go back to Tim Arcuri for an additional question, please?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I thought it was, finally, Tim, only had 1 question.

Operator

Yes, ma'am. One moment. Tim?

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So second question, I guess, can you go through a little bit about the -- how the whole military end-use
thing has transpired? It seems like China WFE is a little higher, the domestic stuff is maybe $1 billion to $1
billion higher than you thought it would be. And it seems like now all these customers know that there's
restrictions looming at some point. So they're going to keep on pulling stuff in. So can you just talk about
how the export controls have transpired? Is commerce happy just as long as you do the due diligence with
the customer on military end-use? Can you just kind of talk about all that?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I think, Tim, in my comments, I talked about our assessment. It was quite an extensive diligence
process that we went through, which consisted both of our own conversations and questioning of the
customers and their certification as well as the use of third-party research and also validation by outside
counsel. And we arrived at our conclusions. As I stated, no material financial business impact as a result
of all of that work. Now that is an ongoing activity for us, meaning that continually assessing and doing
that kind of research and so that's something that we have committed to. But at this point, that is our

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

conclusion. If -- by your question about -- in connection to domestic China WFE, I don't think that's a
connection that we're making. And basically, we are saying that China has plans to invest and I indicated
that a lot of the investment is coming from NAND as well as foundry. And at least in our view, right now,
we have not made that connection that somehow domestic China WFE is, in any way, really affected by
these rules one way or the other.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Tim, maybe a quick comment from me. My sense is, it's not -- there's nothing pulled in. Honestly,
now, we maybe wouldn't know if it was or wasn't a little bit. But given we've concluded the rules are not
impacting our ability to ship, I don't know why anybody would think they should be pulling things in, right?

The next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great job on the business execution and strong results. One of the large logic manufacturers recently
talked about the potential of moving to a more outsourced business model. Maybe just a continuation of
the industry trend towards a fabless business model. At a high level, it would appear to be a zero-sum
game, but wanted to get your views on the potential ramifications of your business in a structural move in
the industry towards a more fab-light or fabless business model?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Okay. Let me take try to take that, Harlan. To start, obviously, we don't want to comment about the
specific plans of any one customer. But to your point of the industry moving to outsourced model, I mean,
obviously, that's a more than 20-year story. And I think that anything that allows wafers ultimately to be
produced with better technology at lower costs, however, that's done in-house or outsourced, is what's
good for the industry, and that's good for Lam. I'm quite certain that as a result of the advances that have
happened on the foundry side, Lam's business has benefited tremendously in the last 20 years. And that
just comes back to a statement that I've made a number of times, which is the best thing for Lam is that
technology nodes continue to migrate. We have greater SAM at every technology node migration across
NAND, DRAM and foundry/logic. And so every company has to decide for themselves, what's sort of the
best answer to advancing technology at the best cost. And that can be in house, it can be outsourced.
What we care about is whether that technology advances and more wafers get produced. And so I think
we obviously watch it and we look at the impact on our business. But ultimately, foundry hasn't been bad
for the industry or for Lam.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And Harlan, maybe just one additional comment from me. The way I think about it is what matters to Lam
is the number of leading-edge wafers in the entire industry that are put in place, whether it's in-sourced,
outsourced, largely doesn't matter too much. Either way it needs equipment, right, independent of where
it goes. We're selling largely the same things to the industry.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. That's great insights there. Good to see the recovery of the business and the improvement in the
supply chain and logistical bottleneck. Just wondering, Doug, if the team is still, even with the strong
September quarter guide playing catch up on the delinquent backlog as a result of the earlier bottlenecks?
And if so, how much of that has yet to be worked down?

The next question will come from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulation on results. Doug, just maybe a follow-on to Harlan's question. It sounds like COVID was
still a cost headwind in the June quarter, I'm wondering if you can help us quantify that? And as you look
out into September with the guide, how much sort of COVID logistical expense is still in there? And when
do you think you might be able to take that out of the model?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. John, the biggest individual item when I look at it is freight and logistics. I mean freight lanes
are more restricted than they were obviously pre-COVID, things are more expensive. Really tough to
mitigate that. I mean, to a certain extent, you take the price, you do your best to negotiate it, but you're
somewhat of a price taker there. That doesn't mean we're not -- as I tried to describe, working to drive
efficiency effectiveness elsewhere in the operation. That's what Lam is extremely good at doing, and we're
doing that. But that is where the challenges are right now. I'm not going to quantify it, John, but it is
impacting gross margin to a certain extent. I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

No. The only thing I'd add is, obviously, Doug pointed out some near-term headwinds on the cost side
fully. We would expect those to eventually roll back as things normalize post-COVID. But I mentioned this
point of the acceleration of remote support technologies and I think that's -- while we have fully quantified
kind of what the benefit could be, clearly some of the benefits of less travel and more productivity of kind
of worldwide engineers who can now connect into fabs and provide expertise via some new technologies.
That actually will be likely a cost and kind of personnel benefit for us down in the future and so we're
investing in that, and I think it's a positive headwind just further -- positive tailwind just further down the
road.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then, Tim, you guys covered a lot of ground at the Analyst Day earlier this year, but
you couldn't cover everything. I'm kind of curious if you can kind of spend a few minutes talking about
your positioning in advanced packaging? Because clearly, there's not a lot of volume and sort of chiplets
today, but as you look at Intel moving to their second-generation 10-nanometer part sometime in the
second half of next year, it seems like the tile/chiplet strategy is really poised to accelerate starting in the
back half of next year and going forward. And I know you guys have some good leverage there, but I'm
just trying to get a sense of quantifying and how big you think that market opportunity is?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I don't know if we're prepared quite to quantify it for you on this call, but what I can tell you is,
it kind of follows on from my earlier comment about customers and just the industry, in general, looks
for the best way to achieve the performance that's required at the lowest cost. And sometimes that's
by looking at total system performance and see if advanced packaging, 3D chiplets, these sorts of
technologies actually are one way to deliver system performance without having to necessarily utilize
the most advanced node chips for every application. And our position has been very strong. We've been

-- we were an early investor there. We have leading positions on both the etch and dep side in TSV
applications and we think that we're extremely well positioned when that comes. And so every time we
hear about acceleration, we're actually quite encouraged. But it's something that our high aspect ratio,
etching processes and our ability, I think, most people recognize our leadership for 20-plus years in copper
electroplating fill. Those are critical technologies for these 3D packaged in heterogeneous integration
applications.

The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Tim, I have a question on memory. Clearly, memory, WFE, they're underspending right now and your
revenue has a lot of potential upside. If I look at the last cyclical peak, which was in March 2018, if you
were to get back to those kind of WFE levels for memory, how will Lam's revenue profile look like in
memory, given that you're gaining some share? Is there a way to quantify it to see how much higher you
could be versus the last cyclical peak? And then I have a follow-up.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

I think Doug's signaling, I can't quantify that. We, of course, have quantified it, and that's why my
comment was we believe our opportunity. We knew there'd be this peak question, but my comment was,
regardless of the fact that our revenues are approaching the last time and, therefore, the peak question
starts to come up. The setup is quite different and, in fact, that's why we pointed out, our memory mix
today is much lower. WFE is not back there. And so I guess probably you can do it just as easily as we
can, but there is still significant upside as memory growth continues not only to return to prior levels, but
also to continue to grow to meet all of these new application drivers that we've talked about.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Chris, obviously, when we put a financial model out, not all that long ago, in March, we
comprehended some aspect of memory being at a higher investment level, CSBG growing, our strength in
foundry continuing to grow. So you have the data points.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

It's kind of all in there.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. It's all in there.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. No worries. And then I just have a question on your ALD traction. I'm just curious, like when
you look at the ALD like, clearly, that market is going to continue growing. You guys are like a #2 player in
that, I would probably say. How much of the growth in ALD is actually driven by technology versus the fact
that productivity for ALD tools is still pretty low? Which is driving the bigger upside in ALD?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Well, all of these new adoptions that I keep talking about, these are Lam's efforts to expand the
application base for ALD and -- which means it's a technology-driven decision. But usually, what has

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

-- I mean, in the past, what has held back ALD from adoption in many of these cases was -- it's great
technology, but the productivity wasn't affordable to put in at a certain node, so people pushed it
out. What we've done is, we've married both an expanding film set, more applications with, as I said,
architecturally enabled productivity and we're getting a lot of traction across a number of different
applications. I talked about 3D NAND gap fill, talked about a multilayer application in foundry logic, that's
a different material. Talked about critical spaces. And so it's just -- we've broadened, I think, the target
market for ALD, and we're seeing good traction.

The next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. Doug, you mentioned that for 2020, domestic China, you guys are
expecting about $10 billion in spend. Curious, what's the rough split between memory versus logic and
foundry? And on the memory side, I feel like both you and the broader industry is currently in a sweet
spot where your customers are spending, but they're not really contributing to supply. At what point would
you expect them to start to really move the needle on supply and as a result, capital intensity come down
in local China? And then I have a follow-up.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. We haven't quantified what is in which segment in China, but I forget if Tim said or if I said it in the
script, it kind of blurs in my mind sometimes. We said it's broad-based in China, in all segments. So it
isn't just one. It's a broad set of customers that are investing. So think of it that way. It's not one or the
other. And you're right. And I wouldn't characterize China is inefficient in the investment. It's just -- when
customers are investing for the first time or are relatively new to investing, in capacity, you got to buy
it, then you have to ramp it. And it takes time for that to happen. It's not unique to any 1 geography or
any 1 customer. That is really what's going on. And over time, customers get more efficient as they ramp
things. That's how I think about it. Tim, I don't know...

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

As you suggested in the earlier question, I think, thinking about the model we put out just back at
Investor Day, I think by the time you get to the 2023, 2024 time frame, we've comprehended that those
additions in China are effectively the same as additions elsewhere in the world. So we don't think there's
some extra inefficient spending in that case that's driving numbers higher for Lam. So I think if you just
look back at that model, that's a relatively efficient spend across all segments in 2023, 2024.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then as a quick follow-up. Doug, in your prepared remarks, you talked about winning 2 service
contracts in the quarter, I believe. I wasn't sure if you meant to highlight it as a meaningful dynamic here.
But do those contracts at all drive incremental growth going forward? Or does it change how we should
be thinking about quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year volatility in your installed base business or profitability
going forward?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

No. Not really, Toshiya. I mean I just mentioned it because, one, they were a little bit longer term; and
two, they were bigger than perhaps typical. And to me, it's very much part of how we run this business.
It's -- the customer has faith and confidence in your ability to deliver and provide value. It is consistent
with what we expect that business to do, and it has done in the past. I just mentioned it because it was
notable when we were looking at the results this quarter.

Great results. I'm just kind of curious from a high level, the Web Front End, you're keeping the same
amount you're catching up to. Just kind of curious as you look at the way that you're shaking out, I
think, there's a lot of doubts whether you hit that number. Is it the same contribution? And then just any
comments on the strength in the second half by geography would be helpful.

Douglas R. Bettinger

Blayne, are you asking about WFE? Was that your question? Just so I understand.

Blayne Peter Curtis
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I'm curious, as you -- you're still seeing the same WFE forecast for the year. I'm kind of curious is it same
contribution as we thought of starting the year? And then any comments on geography, particularly into
the back of the calendar year?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think, Tim, specifically mentioned in his script, there's puts and takes in here, right? It's ended
up at the same level. I would suggest to you that more consumer-oriented stuff is a little bit weaker.
Smartphones, as an example. Smartphone units aren't the same as we thought at the beginning of the
year, that is creating a little bit of a downtick, but that's offset by other things going on in hyperscale
cloud, consumption of silicon, work-from-home type things. And net-net, one's up a little bit, one is down
a little bit. We're in the same place that we began the year at.

Blayne Peter Curtis

Okay. And then just -- I was just curious about, from a geographic perspective, if you had any color into
the growth into September?

I'm curious about WFE growth outside of China. Because when I look at your first half, ex China sales are
down in the last fiscal year. So when do we see -- why are we seeing these trends, I understand. This is

Vivek, I mean, obviously, the majority of WFE spending is outside of China, 2/3 of it is outside of China,
right? And so you're seeing the contribution of WFE across every geography, right? It's more about what's
going on in the end markets. That's how you should be thinking about it, right? Foundry is strong this
year. NAND, up from last year. DRAM, maybe up a little bit. But to a large extent, that's geographically
independent.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

No, I guess my question is that when I look at last year, WFE was, I think, 50, 51. This year, you're
guiding it up $5 billion to $7 billion, but a big part of that growth is coming from China, right? The
incremental growth is coming from China. So I'm just curious why we are not seeing WFE spending
outside of China at that same pace? Or is that just something we will see next year, perhaps?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. No, you are. I mean, there's 3 to 4 probably incremental in China. And the rest of it is outside of
China, Vivek.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. As a follow-up, CSBG, thanks for providing that info. So it grew, I think, about 7% or so last fiscal
year. I'm curious what it -- how much it grew the prior fiscal year? And what part of that should we think
of that as kind of recurring? And this is such an important part of your business that I'm always very
curious about how to correlate this to your growth in chambers, right? Is this correlated to your chamber
growth from 2 years ago or 3 years ago? Just how should we take this 7% number? And I don't know how
to forecast your CSBG business? I guess that's really what I'm trying to ask.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

If you're thinking about forecasting, we gave you data points at the Investor Day, which was Pat Lord, who
manages this business for us, suggested that by 2023, '24, we'll have grown 40%. So there's your data
point for how to forecast it. Chamber count is critically important, but Pat and Tim talked about, it's not
just chambers. It's dollar per chamber growing from, I think, we -- I forget what year we indexed it back
to, 2013, maybe.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

2013.

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

It was -- yes, it was 1 point till then. It had gone to 1.5, and we had objectives to continue growing it to
1.7, which was what was baked in the model, so that's how you should think about it. Chamber count
is important. We're also driving some of the innovative service offerings, like Tim talked, with remote
diagnostic kind of equipment and things to try to add more value for the customers and get paid for it.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2020

Yes. Just as a follow-up to the prior question, how should we model the customer support over the next
few quarters? Should we just track the memory investment that you highlighted as doing better than
foundry? Or would it be more in line with the overall revenue trend line that you described earlier?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think that -- again, it's -- the beauty of the CSBG business is, it probably doesn't -- it doesn't
change on the timescale that you're talking about here relative to any particular quarter's change in
shipments. I don't think you're going to see that. Remember, we have an installed base in excess of
60,000 chambers. And we're driving revenue in our CSBG business off of tools that were shipped 20-
plus years ago. And there's upgrade cycles and there's service contracts that Doug talked about. There's
consumable parts. And so I don't think you're going to see that. But as I said, that's the beauty of this.
This is the -- it's a stabilizing function for the company's revenue and that's why we're investing heavily in
this and it delivers value for the customers in reuse of and extension of installed tools.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Yes. I believe this is the first quarter that you're actually breaking this out and I was just trying to
better understand whether the customer support business group would grow faster with memory or with
foundry? Or would it be the same for different end markets?

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I can -- okay. Okay. Well, I think it's the second quarter that we've actually put out the data. But I
think the couple of pieces of information to think about. One is, we've said that the business will grow
every year and that's simply because, again, the installed base is growing every year. And again, we're
investing to try to create more services -- value-added services and products for that installed base. We
haven't really made a comment about, does it grow every quarter? I mean because it's -- again, it can
be influenced by certain service contracts, certain upgrade decisions that customers make in any given
quarter. But year-to-year, you can think about it growing every year. It's maybe a little bit less about
segments. I've talked in the past about critical applications and Lam's focus on critical applications and
the importance of that. I mean, one, they're sticky; but two, they actually tend to drive more parts and
service requirements because the customers have to keep those systems at absolute top performance
because they're performing the most difficult applications in the customer's fab. And so you tend to see
a little bit more pull-through on the CSBG business for the critical applications where Lam is extremely
strong. And so maybe that's -- maybe it's a little less by device type, but more by the application
requirements. And also critical applications tend to drive a more frequent upgrade cycle as the customers
need to keep the installed base kind of performing for that latest technology node.

I know you guys said you had -- you were working your way through the supply challenges. But I wonder
if you could help us kind of with what the quarterly revenue progression might have looked like, if you
hadn't had those? You had said in March, you get about $300 million of revenue deferred by the supply
challenges. Should we view June as kind of having caught up to that? And then there's -- the surge in
September is more shipping direct to demand or just what would that have looked like if you hadn't had
the supply challenges that you had?

Congrats on the results, from me, as well. I think you mentioned that your capacity from a manufacturing

over the next few quarters where you see potentially demand outstripping what you can deliver?

Timothy M. Archer

Well, we have a global manufacturing factory network that we're highly confident in. I think it's unlikely
that that's the scenario. I didn't want -- I did not give you a maximum output for our factory network. I
was only wanting to indicate that, clearly, we were supply constrained in the last quarter. It was one of
the reasons why we were unable to provide our normal guidance. Now with capability beyond $3 billion,
we're confident in our September quarter. And we're confident that, over time, we'll continue to ramp that
higher and higher. So it was -- we're not going to divulge our exact manufacturing capacity, but I'm quite
certain we can continue to meet higher demand.

maybe some more -- or maybe a reacceleration of some of the share repo in the current quarter and to
the end the year?

I just wanted to dig into the operating cost a little bit. Just understanding that people aren't really
traveling right now, you're probably saving some money. You mentioned some tailwinds around remote
servicing. But should we expect operating costs to ramp up meaningfully in 2021, assuming there's some
sort of post-pandemic return to kind of a normal level of business and travel and marketing? And I kind
of noticed that you added some headcount as well, so I would assume that, that would roll in, and I
don't know if that continues through next year. But just kind of wondering how next year looks from an
operating cost standpoint?

Douglas R. Bettinger
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Weston, I'm not going to give you a forecast for next year yet. I think there'll be plus or minuses
assuming we get back to normal, we get a vaccine, a therapeutic regimen, what have you. I think we're
going to learn from how we're operating right now and be better over time. I mean that's what Lam is
really very good at, looking at an opportunity, getting better and systematically doing it that way. I think
we will do that. And yes, if we get back to normal, travel will come back a little bit. I don't think it comes
back to where it was. But again, we'll keep managing the P&L in the right way.

Timothy M. Archer
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think the only thing I'd add is, at the same time, we've -- obviously, I think we have a great track
record of managing OpEx. And you can kind of look at the results to support that, but we are investing in
our 2023, 2024 plans. I mean, you've seen some of our announcements recently, the construction of a
technology center in Korea. Obviously, there's expenses associated with that. It's a strategic investment
to expand our R&D capabilities, putting closer to some of our largest customers. We're building a new
manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which, again, is going to expand our global manufacturing network,
provide additional business resilience, help take some cost out of manufacturing structure. So there are
some near-term investments that we're confident in our long-term plan and so we are pushing those
through even right now. We're probably seeing some of that reflected in our expenses as well, so maybe
that's offsetting a little bit some of the savings that Doug talked about. But I won't even get into the
product and R&D, we continue to push more into R&D because we think it's the long-term growth engine
of the company. And we're really confident in our product pipeline and new products coming out.
