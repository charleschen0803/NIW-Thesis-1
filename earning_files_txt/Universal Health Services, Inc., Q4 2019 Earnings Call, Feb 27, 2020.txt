Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being
recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead,
sir.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We both welcome you to this review of
the Universal Health Services' results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019.

During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates
and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not
familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a
careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up
to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable
to UHS per diluted share of $9.13 for the full year of 2019 and $2.79 for the fourth quarter. As reflected
on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, there were no significant
adjustments made to our reported net income attributable to UHS during the fourth quarter of 2019. After
adjusting the 12-month period ended December 31, 2019, as indicated on the supplemental schedule,
adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $891.8 million or $9.99 per diluted share as
compared to $894.4 million or $9.53 per diluted share during the full year of 2018.

Included in our reported and our adjusted net income attributable to UHS during the fourth quarter of
2019 is a pretax unrealized gain of $16.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share, resulting from an increase
in the market share (sic) [ value ] of shares of certain marketable securities held for investment and
classified as available for sale. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019, included
a pretax unrealized gain of $4.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share recorded in connection with these
marketable securities.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, as reflected on the supplemental schedule, our adjusted net
income attributable to UHS excluded an unfavorable after-tax impact of $14.6 million resulting from an
increase in the DOJ Reserve and related income taxes; the unfavorable impact of an after-tax $74.6
million provision for asset impairment, which reduced the carrying value of a tradename intangible asset
and certain real property assets recorded in connection with Foundations Recovery Network; and a
favorable after-tax impact of $12.2 million, resulting from our adoption of ASU 2016-09.

On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, net revenues increased 7.9% during the fourth quarter
of 2019. Excluding our health plan, same-store revenues increased 7.5% as compared to the fourth
quarter of 2018. The increased revenues resulted primarily from a 2.1% increase in adjusted admissions
and a 5.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission.

On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 4.5% during the
fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a
year increased 0.8%, while adjusted patient days increased 0.9% during the fourth quarter of 2019 as
compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.9% during the fourth
quarter of 2019 over the comparable prior year quarter. Included in our behavioral health division's
operating results during the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately $8 million of pretax insurance

proceeds recorded in connection with business interruption losses incurred and property damages
sustained at one of our facilities located in Florida. This facility, which sustained substantial damage during
the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with Hurricane Michael, has been repaired and reopened.

Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.438 billion during the full year of 2019 as compared
to $1.275 billion during 2018. We spent $634 million on capital expenditures during the full year of 2019
as compared to $665 million during 2018. Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined to 50 days
during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 51 days during 2018. At December 31, 2019,
our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 42.0% as compared to 42.6% at December 31, 2018.

During 2019, we completed and opened approximately 250 new beds in our existing acute and behavioral
hospitals. We also developed 4 new freestanding emergency departments and acquired 2 more in 2019 to
bring our total number of FEDs to 14. There are 3 more FEDs under construction, which are expected to
open in 2020. We also continue to grow our behavioral health joint venture portfolio with 3 new facilities
already operational; 7 under construction or announced, which are expected to open in 2020 and 2021;
and over 40 opportunities in the pipeline. During 2020, we expect to spend approximately $775 million to
$825 million on capital expenditures, which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovation, new
projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.

In conjunction with our share repurchase program, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we purchased
approximately 1.29 million shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $181 million or $141 per share.
During the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, we have repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares
at an aggregate cost of approximately $706 million or $131 per share. We believe share repurchase is
a prudent use of our financial capital, and we plan to continue to return value to our shareholders in
2020. Consequently, our 2020 operating results forecast assumes approximately $800 million of share
repurchases.

Last night's press release included our 2020 operating results forecast. For the year ended December 31,
2020, our estimated range of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
net of controlling interest, is $1.823 billion to $1.902 billion. Our estimated range of adjusted net
income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2020, and is $10.30 to $11 per diluted
share. This adjusted EPS guidance range represents an increase of approximately 3% to 10%, over the
adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $9.99 per diluted share for the year ended December 31,
2019, as calculated on the supplemental schedule. During 2020, our net revenues are estimated to be
approximately $11.96 billion to $12.12 billion, representing an increase of 5.1% to 6.5% over our 2019
net revenues.
We are pleased to answer questions at this time.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette with Barclays.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. So first question on 2020 guidance. At the midpoint, revenue guide
is up almost 6%, and EBITDA growth is closer to 3.5%. Can you provide some color on the underlying
components embedded in the guide between the segments? Is there any meaningful change in the
behavioral volume outlook for 2020 that you would highlight?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Andrew, I think that elements that underlie the 2020 guidance are not terribly different than those that
underlie the 2019 guidance as well as, quite frankly, our 2019 results. And that is, in the acute division, I
think revenue growth in the mid- to upper single-digit range and commensurate to EBITDA growth and on
the behavioral side, revenue growth in the sort of 3% to 4% range with EBITDA growth in sort of a 1% to
2% range. And then, obviously, we make some adjustments to that based on nonrecurring reimbursement
items, et cetera, that we expect in 2019 -- 2020, rather.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's helpful. On the quarter, your acute volumes decelerated from the exceptionally high volumes in 3Q.
Is there anything you would call out driving that volume number lower? Can you speak to the challenges
in managing labor expenses, both temporary labor and physician volume commitments, in this type of
choppy volume environment?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Sure. And then we should move on to our next question. The -- not only did our acute results decelerate
in Q3, but we've really had industry-leading, and what I would describe as historically extraordinary, acute
care volume growth for several years now. And I think we've been preparing ourselves and investors as
well for the notion that at some point, our volumes would moderate to sort of more historically normative
levels. And I think you saw some of that in the fourth quarter of 2019. The only sort of specific market or
hospital that I would point to is Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas. We've talked any number of times over
the last few years about the explosive growth and the extraordinarily fast ramp-up at Henderson. That
hospital is now operating at pretty much full capacity around the clock. So growth there has slowed. And
on an overall basis, that has muted the overall growth of the acute care division a little bit. Otherwise, I
think we just saw kind of a normative step down in the quarter.

As far as the labor pressures, I think, again, nothing new there. We continue to see labor pressure in both
of our business segments. I don't think it's a surprising development, and it's not a new development,
given the extremely robust and low unemployment rates in the country. The challenges have seemingly
sort of reflected themselves differently in the 2 divisions. In the acute division, it continues to press
on both our salary and benefit expense and our other operating expense where we record some of our
contract physician labor as we replace or fill the vacancies with temporary hours of overtime or premium
pay or locums physicians, et cetera. And on the behavioral side, we're challenged because a lot of the
labor vacancies result in our having to cap beds or turn away patients. Again, nothing new in either of
those instances, but it continues to be a challenge that our operators are very much focused on.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I was hoping maybe you could just talk a little bit about the near-term outlook for the first quarter given,
obviously, I don't need to tell you there's a calendar -- to be a little bit of a calendar weight to utilization.
And the backdrop, maybe it's unimportant to the flu season. It's been a little bit strange, and it's plodding.
And then finally, if there's anything you can say or want to say on coronavirus.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Sure, Matt. I think 2019 was a year in which we experienced a fair amount, particularly in the acute
business, of quarter-to-quarter volatility. That was I think somewhat unexpected, in some cases, difficult
to explain and different than sort of traditional seasonal patterns. Now I think at the end of the year and
for the full year, the results of division played out not terribly differently than our overall expectations.
But I think as we go into 2020 and even though we don't give quarterly guidance and don't intend to, I
think our expectation would be, absent any information to the contrary, that the annual progression, the
cadence of the quarters is sort of more traditional. Last year, we had a very soft first quarter in acute and
then a much stronger second. I think this year, we'd expect a cadence that's a bit more ratable. But hard
to predict and, quite frankly, it's part of the reason we don't give quarterly guidance.

As far as the coronavirus, like everybody else, I think any commentary that I would give at this point
would be purely speculative. It's impossible to know what the impact will be, specifically in the first
quarter, but we're certainly prepared. Our hospitals are prepared as best as they can be if the coronavirus
becomes more widespread, but I think virtually impossible to predict a financial impact.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Do you -- sorry, let me just follow up quick on that which is -- I realize it's speculative, but in a certain
scenario where there is a lot of travel disruption, disruption in general because people are afraid of the
spread versus necessarily having lots and lots of patients that are being hospitalized, do you think that,
that actually could be a retarding effect on volumes as you get cancellation of elective procedures and so
forth?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

I mean again, I would repeat, Matt, that it would be speculative on my part. I think the only thing we can
sort of fall back on is respiratory ailments that we've experienced before, either very busy flu seasons or
SARS or whatever it was. And I think generally, we have found that our elective procedures have really
not been impacted by a busy respiratory ailment season, et cetera. Now again, and this is extraordinary, I
think all bets are off the table. But that has not been the historic experience.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.

Eugene Kim
Wolfe Research, LLC

This is Eugene on for Justin. So just a follow-up to Andrew's earlier question. It appears temp staffing
costs remain high in Q4 despite a moderate volume. How should we think about these costs in 2020 if
volumes remain more normal? And also, can you comment on meaningful improvement in behavioral
pricing in the quarter?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

7

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

Sure. So I think in terms of temp staffing in the acute business, one of the reasons why I think it was
more of a drag even than it has been in the fourth quarter is that as our volumes, as I alluded to before,
have been so strong for such a long period of time, I think that our hospitals and our hospital operators
have been making longer-term commitments for temporary staffing both for nurses and for physicians,
so not just for a day or a couple of days in advance, but sometimes for weeks and months in advance.
And as a consequence of that, when the volume softened a little bit in the fourth quarter, it was a little
more difficult to adjust as quickly as we'd like to those sort of lower volumes. I do believe that if the lower
volumes persist into 2020, and I'm not certain that they will, but I believe that we'll be able to respond
and you'll see those labor expenses, which get recorded in the case of nurses, mostly on our salary line;
in the case of doctors, in many cases, on that other operating expense line. I think you'll see us get better
control over those.

As far as the pricing on the behavioral business, obviously, it's helped by the insurance proceed recovery
that I mentioned in my remarks. But also, I think -- and I think pricing has not really been a terribly
challenging element for the behavioral division, but the improvement, I think, in Q4 is reflective of a little
bit better payer mix, better control over our denials from payers, et cetera. So I think some incremental
improvement on those fronts helped a stronger net revenue in the quarter.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. I wanted to see what you were thinking about. It looks like length of stay in the behavioral side has
been kind of firming up, I guess, versus some of the pressures that we've seen in the last few years. So
I wanted to get your outlook for what was driving that and how you're thinking about that into next year.
And then maybe just a follow-up on that last point about pricing being relatively solid. You are looking for
next year's growth to be below Q4. So I don't know if there's anything in there that you would highlight
besides the insurance recovery.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So I think your comments about length of stay, Kevin, are certainly accurate. Length of stay in the
behavioral division has been pretty flat in 2019, after a couple of years of fairly consistent decline. We've
identified the reason for that decline many times as almost primarily a shift from traditional Medicaid
patients to managed Medicaid patients where the managed Medicaid payers are more aggressive in
managing length of stay. I think the reason -- the main reason for the stabilization in 2019 was we just
saw a slowing of that shift. We still believe there's a chunk of patients in some states that will ultimately
move from traditional Medicaid programs to managed Medicaid programs. It's difficult for us to predict the
timing, but we have an expectation that, that will occur at some point.

In terms of how our 2020 behavioral guidance, particularly from a revenue per admission or from a pricing
perspective, relates to the fourth quarter performance, I think that we were basing our 2020 guidance
more on the full year performance of pricing. And when I talked about sort of 3% to 4% revenue growth in
behavioral, it was really based on something like 1% volume and 2% to 3% pricing, which I think is more
in line with what we ran for the full year, and that was the basis of our 2020 guidance.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Maybe just to go back to behavioral, a lot of the focus obviously, and just the last question drives that
home, has been on stabilizing length of stay and volumes overall in the behavioral side. But I know you've
got a new president of that division coming in and looking at some different initiatives. Can you just sort

8

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

of update us on where the focus is? It doesn't look like any of that -- any change in trend is really in your
2020 forecast at this point, but when could some of those initiatives really have an impact?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So I think there's a bunch of different sort of questions wrapped up in what you're asking, A.J. I
mean what I would say, in as brief a way as possible in terms of impact and the approach that our new
Behavioral President, Matt Peterson, is taking is -- I think as most people know, Matt comes from a strong
managed care background, spending the last decade or so with United, Optum. And I think that he, as
a consequence, has a perspective that there are real opportunities for us to partner with some of our
managed care payers and create arrangements that are mutually beneficial to both the payer and the
provider, in other words, help the payer control their utilization but create a structure whereby when
there is utilization, we are the beneficiary of that in a primary way. So those conversations, I think, are
underway. They are not necessarily ones that can be effected immediately. But I think, over time, we'll
yield kind of a more collaborative sort of relationship with payers that should again be mutually beneficial
and a win-win for both.

I think the other thing that Matt brings to the table is a rigor and a discipline around process based on his
experience, both in the managed care world as well as in the military. He's had a lifelong career in the Air
Force reserves. And that said, I don't think he's identified terribly new issues or different issues, a lot of
things that we've talked about before, things like denial management, the process of how we intake and
evaluate patients, et cetera. But I think Matt is bringing some, again, level of rigor and discipline to those
processes that we haven't necessarily had before. And I think, ultimately, that will certainly be helpful.

In terms of how that translates to the guidance, I think we took the position a couple of years ago that it
was difficult for us to predict when the behavioral business would inflect or when it would turn. We have
firmly believed for some time that it will. We continue to believe that. We continue to believe that the
underlying demand will support an increase in our same-store admission growth at some point. But I think
we're -- we've been committed over the last, certainly, year or 2 to the idea that we're not going to try
and get out in front and predict when that's going to happen. When it does, we'll alter our projections and
our guidance at that time.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Maybe just one follow-up then. There's a lot of focus on the re-contract, and that's going on in your
biggest acute market, Las Vegas. You had a view that as that contract with the biggest payer opens up,
then you get better pricing, it might be offset with volume. Can you maybe flesh out a little bit what -- has
that played out as you expected so far in the first quarter? And what have you assumed in guidance sort
of there in terms of the year-to-year impact on that?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

So the assumption that we've made in guidance -- well, first of all, the way this has played out is that
we're talking about the commercial Sierra-United contract in Las Vegas in which HCA has been out-of-
network for over a decade. Beginning and effective with January 1, 2020, they are back in network.
The nature of our contract is such that we have an opportunity once that occur to renegotiate our rates
with Sierra, which we have done and have -- we've now signed a new contract with Sierra, which is also
effective January 1 of this year. Our expectation is that there will be obviously a decline in volume as
some of the Sierra patients that have historically come to our Las Vegas hospitals will now go to HCA
hospitals. But we believe that, over the course of a longer term, that negative impact will largely be offset
by increased pricing that's effective both January 1, and there are other scheduled increases that we
already get over the next 1.5 years or so.

As far as the very early signs of it, not surprisingly, A.J., the shift of patients at the very outset of 2020
has been relatively slow, which is a good thing obviously from our perspective. But we certainly are not
naive, and we understand that there's a real effort on HCA to promote the change in the contract and their

new in network status, their billboards and commercials in the market. So over time, we assume that, that
shift of patients will accelerate. But again, I think over an extended period of time and over the year, we
assume the result will largely be a push.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

On the acute guidance for 2020, it's been relatively consistent over the past couple of years. But you
mentioned that there's some headwinds in the fourth quarter due to the slowing impact from Henderson.
So I guess how much does Henderson affect 2020 revenue growth? And what are you doing to -- in Vegas
to expand the market to build towers, new hospitals? Kind of what's your plan for Vegas at this point?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Sure. So again, as I think I noted when I made the Henderson commentary earlier that that's certainly
not the single driver of the slowdown in volumes. It's probably got about 40, 50 basis point impact on the
volume slowdown. But I think the remaining components of it are spread pretty evenly throughout the
rest of the portfolio. Look, the Vegas problem of facilities running at capacity is a good problem to have
and one which we've been addressing. We've I think commented on any number of occasions in 2019 that
we have had expansion projects at virtually all of our 6 major Las Vegas facilities, new towers, new beds,
ER expansions, the surgical expansions, et cetera. We've got at Henderson, specifically, a whole brand-
new tower that's being developed and that project is underway, but it will be some time before that new
capacity is open.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then on the acute margins, what percent of your SMB cost come from temp labor?
Maybe I missed that. And can you break that out by nurses versus physicians? And how should we beating
that sort of that labor pressure in 2020 versus 2019?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

So I'm not sure I have all that sort of precise information, Pito. I will say this, I mean I think what we
would sort of strive for, if you will, is something around 2% of our nursing hours to be premium pay.
I think if you have 0% of your nursing hours as premium pay, you probably would argue that you're
somewhat overstaffed. But 2% is sort of probably kind of close to maximum efficiency. I think over the
last several years, we've been running more in kind of the mid-single digits given the labor shortages,
et cetera. From a physician perspective, I think our general target is not to really have any temporary
physician costs. It's much more efficient to have permanent physicians in both contract and specialty
services, et cetera. So I don't exactly know what the numbers are. But clearly, the contract labor, both in
nursing and in physicians, is probably the single biggest operating challenge that the acute division has
faced.

And I just want to go back and add one thing onto my comments about Las Vegas and really just to add
on, one other major expansion that we have is we are building a new hospital in Reno that should open in
2021. And obviously, it will enhance our statewide presence in Nevada significantly. So I think that's very
much related to the expansions that we have in the southern part of Nevada as well.

I was hoping that you could update us on any talks on expanding your JV with Baylor-Memorial Hermann
and then, just more broadly, how discussions are going on behavioral JVs?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Sure, Sarah. So as I noted in my comments, we have a number of projects that are under development.
One of them is with Baylor in Temple, Texas. That's a facility that will open -- or scheduled to open at
least in late 2020. As far as any of the other projects that are in our pipeline, I'm not going to comment
on any of those conversations specifically. Again, as I commented in my opening remarks, we've got, I
think, up to 8 projects underway that will open either in 2020 or 2021. Those are obviously completed
negotiations, et cetera, and then another 40 in the pipeline. Obviously, I think it reflects a very active
pipeline. It reflects real interest on the part of a large number of geographically disperse not-for-profit
acute care hospitals who are interested in these joint ventures. But we're really not going to comment on
any of those discussions until they are executed.

Sarah Elizabeth James
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And acute supply cost came down this quarter as a percent of revenue. Can you talk about any
efforts that are going on there for negotiating pricing and how you think about that trending forward?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. I mean I think that that's -- so the answer, first of all is the effort to manage our supply costs, find
the most effective suppliers from both a quality and pricing standpoint is ongoing. There are initiatives
all the time. There's none that I would highlight specifically, but I can assure you, it's a main focus of our
operators. I think part of the reason for the supply cost coming down is just some of the strong revenue.
Revenue's up because the surgical mix is up, because denials are down, because uncompensated care is
down some. And I think the supply cost, particularly in relation to our other labor costs on which I think
there is greater pressure, appear to be controlled better, and I think they are. So that's I think what's
happening.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

Steve, just a question on sort of outpatient development and maybe tying into Capex. I know you guys
have been pretty active on the freestanding ED side. But any other facilities or types, whether that's
urgent care all the way to surgery centers, anything else that you see more and more investment going
into -- as part of that $700 million-ish of Capex?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. I mean I think it's sort of really, Josh, the full continuum. I think we are committed to the idea as
an acute care provider that successful acute care providers really need to be -- kind of have a presence
across the full continuum. And I think -- so up on the front end, that includes, as you described, urgent
care centers, which we have a few; the FEDs, which we have several; and I highlighted in my comments,
primary care physician offices, which we have a great many of, et cetera. And then I think on the -- and
obviously, then, in the hospital, we've got extensive outpatient facilities, both in and out of the hospital.
We do own ASCs in our markets as well. And then on the back end, things like home health and long-term
care and rehab, et cetera.

So in all of our markets, we sort of take a different approach to these things, and we are either buying
or building or partnering those capacities and those services. But we could talk about any single one of
our markets, and I think that we would be able to describe a narrative to you that reflects a much greater
presence along the full continuum. And some of that obviously is reflected in our CapEx as well, some of
it's reflected in joint venture arrangements, et cetera. But in some form or fashion, we are building that
presence along the continuum in all of our markets.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

Got you. And then just a quick clarification on Vegas with the HCA contract change. Did I read into it right
that you're assuming Vegas as a market in totality from a 2020 guidance perspective? Does it sound like
it's kind of a nonevent in terms of the pluses and the minuses?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Well, I would say, a nonevent in terms of the bottom line impact. I think cosmetically, what you would
expect or what we would expect in Vegas was -- is to see our admissions go down some, but our revenue
per admission to go up, but I think our EBITDA as a result of this change in the Sierra network to be
relatively unchanged.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Baird.

Matthew Dale Gillmor
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to ask a bit more specifically on the acute pricing. Steve, I think you mentioned that the surgical
mix was better this quarter, and that helped. What did you see from a payer mix perspective or an acuity
perspective?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So one of the things I think that we have really experienced all year is sort of an inverse -- on the
acute side, an inverse relationship between volumes and pricing. So earlier in the year when volumes
were extremely high, and in particular, ER volumes were particularly high, that generally suggests that our
medical-surgical mix was a little bit more skewed to medical, that our uncompensated burden was a little
bit higher because of the ER volumes, et cetera. In the fourth quarter, as volumes came down a little bit,
I think we saw the opposite of that phenomenon. We saw a little better surgical to medical mix. We saw a
slightly lower uncompensated care burden, and that helped to drive the extremely stronger revenue per
admission or pricing in the quarter, whereas volumes were a little bit lower than they've been.

Matthew Dale Gillmor
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. And then one follow-up on coronavirus. I know it's really hard for you to predict any volume
impact. I was curious if you're seeing any supply issue, especially with respect to surgical masks that
could impact your other operations.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. I mean I think that -- and this has been broadly reported, and I don't think it had anything
specifically to do with UHS, I think that in the early phases of this process, the issues have been it's been
a little bit difficult to get testing done on patients who are suspected to have the virus. I think originally,
the testing was only being done by the CDC. Now there are more places. But I think testing, at least so
far, has been a little bit cumbersome. My presumption is that as the country gears up for this, that will

become a more effective process. And then I think, as has been widely reported, things like gloves and
masks are in short supply. We're doing everything we can to make sure that we have an adequate supply
of those things as well as an adequate pipeline. But as you might imagine, I suspect most hospitals in the
country are doing similar things. So that's something, I think, to be seen. But certainly, we are making
every effort to be as prepared as we can.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Steve, a 2-part question. The first one, I apologize, I just heard the tail end of Sarah's question, so
just stop me if I'm overlapping here. But on the JV behavioral facilities that you've got underway, the
7 projects or 8 projects, do you have a total ballpark bed count that you think that adds over the next
couple of years? And have you -- can you just refresh us on UHS sort of typical ownership position is what,
like an 80%, or help us think about that?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So I mean I don't have the precise data in front of me, Gary, but generally, all of these new hospitals
are in the 100- to 120-bed range size. And then in terms of structure, I think most of them are probably
in that 80-20 range. There certainly are a couple that are a little closer to 50-50. We would not enter into
-- or I think it would be highly unlikely that we would enter into a joint venture in which we had less than
a 51% share and, basically, the management control of the facility. But each deal is negotiated separately.
But I think the 80-20 model is probably normative.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got you. And then just my one follow-up on the headwind you're contemplating next year on the Medicaid
DSH, if Congress doesn't do anything and another sort of 10 to 15 of supplemental payments. Even
those supplemental payments, that would all be impacting your acute EBITDA projection, I think. Is there
anything material at all with respect to that on the behavioral side?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So the ACA DSH that Congress has deferred those cuts through May, in our guidance, we presumed
that Congress will not defer them after May, and that's about a $10 million headwind in 2020. I think what
you're otherwise referring to is our broader supplemental payments that includes DSH and uncompensated
care and provider taxes, et cetera. And frankly, it does cross both divisions. We get that reimbursement
in both our divisions. We're expecting a $10 million or $15 million decline next year. And I don't have the
specific breakout in front of me, but I think that's actually split between the 2 divisions.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with UBS.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Steve, we're seeing there's a number of states that are pursuing 1115 waivers to provide behavioral
treatment for adult fee-for-service patients with substance-use disorders. I think probably 30 states
since last fall have looked at these state plan options. Just wondering, do you have any thoughts on
this? Presumably this opens up some market for you, but who really knows? Just curious if you have any
insight.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 27, 2020

Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. I mean I think it's hard to predict. And obviously, it's not exactly analogous, but the IMD exclusion
being lifted was something that we thought would have a more immediate impact. And when I say we,
I really am making a sort of an overall industry comment. I think the freestanding industry felt like we
would see more of those adult Medicaid patients just shifting relatively quickly from the acute care setting
to the freestanding setting. I think you might expect sort of something similar from the 1115 waiver.
But what we saw, I think, from the IMD exclusion is that the acute hospitals were not necessarily all that
anxious to part with those patients. And as a consequence, I think we see those JV conversations being
much more active and much more robust but the actual shift of patients, not as quick. And so I would
wait and see to how these 1115 waivers really result -- or what the result is in terms of potentially more
patients.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Is there any chance that you could see this develop as a headwind? I guess I'm trying to think, is there
any negative consequence as a result of this?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

We haven't seen it yet. So I think it's a little too early to tell.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. Okay. And I haven't looked at your 10-K yet, but maybe if you could just comment on your
malpractice experience in 2019 and any comments around professional fees, any pressure building on
contract management subsidies as you think about 2020.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So our malpractice experience has not really changed much over the last several years, it's been
pretty stable. As far as contract fees, I would say, pretty much the same thing. Again, I think the
bigger pressure for us has been on vacancies in some of our contract physician services as well as other
specialties where we're having to either pay a vendor for some of those vacancies or we're having to pay
locums costs, et cetera. But in terms of our kind of regular contract service arrangements for things like
ER doctors and hospitalists, et cetera, I think those costs have remained fairly stable.

Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.

Anton Hie
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

It's Anton Hie on for Frank. I know we had the recovery -- insurance recovery there, but I'm not sure I
heard an actual update on kind of how Panama City is trending back. I believe that's been reopened. Can
you just refresh us on that?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So Emerald Coast, which is the name of the facility in Panama City, has reopened, I believe, in
September and has ramped back up to I think pretty sort of normal pre-hurricane levels. So I think for
2020, the operating recovery in that facility should provide a bit of a tailwind maybe in the neighborhood
of $5 million to $10 million for the behavioral division in 2020.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

No, I don't think there's a real significant change. I mean we've seen some incremental improvement
in that stand-alone addiction treatment business. But it remains one where we're trying any number of
initiatives to improve the results there and making some progress, but it's incremental.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Just want to go back to labor quickly. Certainly, I understand the temp staffing and contract labor
pressures in the context of what's been obviously a really strong volume backdrop. What about underlying
wage growth in your market, Steve? What's that running? Is there sort of incremental competitiveness
or rate pressure there for both nursing? And we are starting to hear a little bit more around sort of
nonclinical staff. So any help in frame in that?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Look, I think that wage inflation has certainly ticked up over the last several years, and we've probably
gone from 2.5% to 3.5% annual wage increases a few years ago. I think a little lower in the behavioral
division, a little higher in acute to probably 3.5 to 4.5 or at least 3.5 to 4 in today's environment. But
again, I still think that the biggest pressure really has come on the 2 businesses, not so much on the
hourly wage pressure itself but on the premium pay in the acute division and in our inability to serve all
the patients that we'd like to on the behavioral side.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then just to -- just one quick sort of follow-up. And I apologize if I missed this. I
know you noted better acuity and I think payer mix. I was just hoping you can give us a little more of a
sense of the CMI increase and maybe commercial versus Medicare versus Medicaid, just the volume trends
there.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So I mean I think that the acuity really manifested itself in surgical volumes. I think inpatient surgical
volumes were up 2% or 3% in the quarter, which is probably the -- one of the better increases we've had
in the last several years. And I don't have the exact uncompensated care numbers in front of me, but I
know that the number of uncompensated patients as a percentage ticked down somewhat in Q4.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then payer mix?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. I mean that to me was the uncompensated care. I mean I think most of our other payer percentages
remain similar.
