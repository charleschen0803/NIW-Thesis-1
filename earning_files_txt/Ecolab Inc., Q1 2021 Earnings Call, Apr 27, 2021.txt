Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to Ecolab's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations.
Thank you, Mr. Monahan. You may now begin.

Michael J. Monahan
Senior Vice President of External Relations

Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today are
Christophe Beck, Ecolab's CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with
our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results, are available on Ecolab's website at
ecolab.com/investor.

Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials which state that this
teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These
are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors
that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our most recent
Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share
information in the release.

Starting with a brief overview. The first quarter showed continued sequential business improvement
that was offset by the Texas freeze. Adjusted EPS were $0.81. That EPS included the impact of short-
term supply chain and customer disruption from the freeze that were estimated to be $0.10 per share.
Healthcare and Life Sciences segment showed further strong sales growth. The Industrial segment
experienced a modest sales decline as its growth was offset by the freeze impact. The Other segment
significantly narrowed its sales decline from the fourth quarter and Institutional & Specialty segment sales
decline narrowed slightly from the fourth quarter as sales trends within our U.S. Institutional business
improved through the end of the first quarter.

Our markets are broadly improving and increasing rate of vaccination, along with the easing of
social restrictions, provides further support for the global economic recovery. We expect that broad
improvement, leveraged by our investments and the work we have done to further our critical innovation,
service and digital business drivers, as well as our cost efficiency measures, will help drive strong
comparisons against 2020 results over the balance of the year and result in 2021 adjusted earnings per
share that exceed 2019 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the estimated
$0.15 per share impact from the Texas freeze.

Over the past year, we've seen the value of Ecolab's premium product and service expertise once again
underscored through continued strong new business growth as well as our strengthened customer
relationships despite the difficult market conditions. Our position as leader in food safety, clean water and
healthy environments has become even more important. We believe this position, along with our strong
long-term growth opportunities, remain robust, driven by our huge remaining market opportunity, our
leading global market position, our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results
while lowering their water, energy and other operating costs, and through that, our ability to help them
meet their growing ESG ambitions. We believe these sustainable long-term business drivers will continue
to yield superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors.

And now, here's Christophe Beck with his comments.

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Thank you so much, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our first quarter, which
was right in line with our expectations. Excluding the Texas freeze, which we discussed earlier, our
business continued to show solid fundamental improvement that gives us confidence in our full year
outlook. Our underlying business momentum as well as margin development kept improving across
the board, leading to strong results in the first quarter. Excluding the short-term impact of the Texas
freeze, our Q1 adjusted EPS showed a significantly narrowing decline versus the prior year, continuing our
improving quarterly trends. It's also ahead of what we delivered in Q1 2019, which is a good indication for
our expected full year delivery. We did all this while continuing to invest in our major growth initiatives and
in our global team capabilities to leverage our position as the markets reopen.

Excluding the freeze, all segments stayed strong or showed continued sequential improvement. Our
fundamental business trends kept gaining momentum, especially in our Institutional division, which saw
a definite pick up as we exited March. Our Industrial segment, which was most impacted by the Texas
freeze, delivered improved underlying growth trends versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and continue to
further strengthen its margin. Healthcare and Life Sciences maintained a strong double-digit growth and
solid margin improvement. This good start strengthens our confidence for the full year and beyond. Our
general market outlook remains largely unchanged versus what we said in previous calls. North America
and China are moving ahead of our previous expectations, while Europe and several emerging markets
remain behind as they recover from extended lockdowns and are still impacted by a rather slow pace of
vaccination.

So while the exact timing of the global reopenings might shift a few months, which might also shift some
of the recovery into Q3, we expect strong growth in the second quarter, driven by improving end markets
and accelerated underlying growth momentum. We expect these trends to continue in the second half
of the year. Our objective has been to start the year in a position of strength. And Q1 shows we clearly
achieved this. Our net new business pipeline increased to record highs, and our global market shares are
strengthening. Our differentiated innovations are continuing to help our customers protect their consumers
and our world-class programs help them preserve vital natural resources while generating very attractive
financial returns.

And with our new Ecolab Science Certified assurance program, we have become the brand that reissues
customers and consumers in times they need it the most. All this underscores our confidence that we
are on a path to deliver full year '21 adjusted EPS ahead of 2019 EPS, excluding the estimated $0.15
impact of the Texas freeze. Looking beyond the pandemic, our longer-term position is better than ever. In
a world where hygiene standards are rising, where food safety and infection risk awareness has reached
new levels, where the expected gap between water supply and water demand is wider than ever, our
differentiated value proposition as the global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention services
and technologies positions us uniquely to capture this accelerating growth trends.

The combination of this unmatched value proposition and the breadth of our comprehensive offering
makes us the obvious partner for global companies to help them deliver on their most ambitious
sustainability commitment. Our ability to serve customers at 3 million locations in 172 countries with
25,000 dedicated underground experts in 40 industries allows us to deliver the same standards of quality
and performance anywhere around the world. And our new business pipeline, breakthrough innovation,
unmatched digital footprint, world-class scientific expertise and passion for exceptional execution will
continue to lead to sustained growth momentum and continued double-digit earnings growth for the years
to come. I look forward to your question.

So Mike, back to you.

Michael J. Monahan
Senior Vice President of External Relations

Thank you. That concludes our formal remarks. As a final note, before we begin Q&A, we plan to hold our
2021 Investor Day on Thursday, September 16 in St. Paul.
Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I know everyone is expecting a strong recovery in the Institutional segment in the second quarter and
particularly given the easy comparison that you have with last year. But I'm curious if you could maybe
talk about how the recovery in that segment is unfolding on a global basis. How is U.S. Institutional
performing recently relative to some of your other major global markets? And how do you see that playing
out through the second quarter?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Tim. So on Institutional, net-net, it's happening as expected. We had the U.S. and China
that are ahead of our expectations as we can read as well in the news. And on the other hand, so we
have Europe and a few emerging markets that are behind, as we can see restrictions with lockdowns,
with a slow pace of vaccinations, especially in Europe as well. So that's the balance that we are trying to
manage. When I think about how Institutional did during the first quarter, we saw a nice pickup in March.
It's been confirmed in April right now in the second quarter. So net-net, Q2 should be more or less as
expected. If there is 1 caveat might be so the timing of reopening in Europe and some of the emerging
markets that might shift some of that growth in Q3, but for the full year I confirm the outlook the way we
described it in the previous call.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. That's great. And as my follow-up, can you just talk about within the Institutional segment, how
your customers that are open, how they're spending? I know this has been a common theme that folks
have asked on the conference call but curious on your updated thoughts. Are customers spending more
than they were relative to pre-COVID levels on things like hard and soft surface cleaners, where I know
that there's maybe some elevated demand? And do you think eventually that demand returns to pre-
COVID levels? Or do you think that it settles somewhere above pre-COVID levels given the emphasis on
virus protection and the like?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Good question, Tim. So our focus, as you know, is on our corporate account. So those are chain
customers, regional or global customers. Those are the ones who have weathered the pandemic better
than others as well. Most of them are investing in new units or in the refreshing of current units as well,
so which bodes very well so for our business for today and for tomorrow. To your question on the hygiene
products basically, the way we think about it is that it's going to be a bit less than during the pandemic,
where the measures, obviously, are going to be a little bit less strong than what we've experienced over
the past 15 months. But it's going to be higher than what we've experienced so pre-pandemic as well. So
net-net, we think that our position in Institutional has strengthened and the customers that we serve are
going to be in a better position as well.

Our next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

I just wanted to touch on the -- on your comments around Europe. If you could just elaborate a bit more
in terms of -- I know pre-pandemic, it was structurally, I guess, just a little growth area, and there was
some competitive dynamics. So I was just curious if you see any of that changing once we do get this
rebound or reopening?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So to your question on Europe. So Europe had a good year last year. So in 2020, we had flat sales
overall. We had saw our profit margins that went up as well. So overall, I was very pleased with the
business development that we saw in that critical region so for us. And if I look at '21, it's kind of an on-
off approach that they are having. So first, I'd like to put on the sites of the U.K., which are partly reopen,
as we know, so way ahead in terms of vaccinations versus Continental Europe. So U.K., we saw a good
development over there. Continental Europe, so most of the countries are in complete lockdown. So most
of the large countries have curfews even as well.

That's true for Germany and for France, for instance, as well. So most, if not all, of the restaurants and
hotels are, for the most part, closed, which is something that's going to change, hopefully, before the
summer. They're all talking about reopening in order to protect the summer season. I hope that, that's
going to be true. It's going to be a bit later than what I had expected ultimately here, but then it's going
to drive a rebound, which is going to be positive in Q3. So as mentioned before, we might have some of
the growth we were expecting in Q2 shifting to Q3. But all in all, so for the full year, it's going to be similar
than what we had thought.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then the other question I just had, Christophe, was on water. I know it was 3% growth
backing out the Texas freeze. But just given just the water scarcity issues out there, I was just curious
what -- can water grow just like Life Sciences and Healthcare is growing just given the need out there? Or
are there any limitations to get to that kind of growth rate?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes, for water. So you mentioned it's a 3% ex the Texas freeze. It's important as well to keep in mind that
within water, you have light industries, heavy industries. Both are growing, ex Texas, are in mid-single
plus, which is very good in Q1. And you have mining, which is still in the negative territory since we exited
some of our coal business. But even mining is going to come back in a nice way, I think, in the next few
quarters and years, for sure. And to your point on water scarcity, we see always more customers coming
to us and asking us how to help them reach their net 0 objective that they have for 2030 or for 2050,
which is right in line with our ESG promise as a company and offerings of our customers. And that's going
to feed as well, I think, the momentum for water in the years to come.

Operator

Next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Christophe, can you discuss the pressure from ROS you're seeing and the pricing you need right now to
offset that and when that might equalize prices versus ROS?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes. David, on the ROS, it was pretty benign in Q1 as we've shared. But if we look at the full year, if we
look at the indices that you reach to it's obviously much more than what we had expected initially. But
when I step back and look at the overall picture, it's roughly kind of mid-single growth in terms of cost for

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

our overall ROS spend, which is more than what we had expected, but something that we had experienced
in the past as well. We know and we have the capability, so, to price for that in a good way. You know that
we price to our customers based on value that we create as well. So for them, which means that we do
that as well over time. It's not a rapid shift over a month. It take us some time. And just as a reminder,
we tried to get the dollar value, so within 12 months back and the margin in percent -- in 24 months, so
the second year. So the way we look at it today for '21 might be a slight negative, but I'm not even sure
about that. Our teams are good in doing it. And what we're seeing right now is nothing exceptional versus
what we've experienced in the past.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

No, very good. And can you just discuss the competitive intensity of the marketplace? You have a -- one of
your competitors is now public. Talk about your share gains you saw in Q1 and what you expect as you go
through the year versus perhaps do a more public profile of the competitor?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So I'm really happy with the share gains that we're having in most, if not all businesses, actually, where
we're tracking the number of units that we are serving, the number of solutions that we're serving to
existing units as well, and we've talked about that over the past few quarters. That was an objective for
the whole team during the pandemic to gain share. That when it reopens, we can leverage, obviously, that
pick up, and that's happening as we expected, which is really good.

And you're right. So one of our competitors has become public over the past few weeks. We're very
familiar with them. We've been competing with them for many, many years. We respect them a lot as well.
And I would say they make us better because we need to be better than them. And when you think about
it, we overlap in less than 1/3 of our end markets. We're 5x larger. We invest 10x more in R&D and digital
than they do as well. So I feel really good about what we can do for our customers and how we're gaining
share versus them on the marketplace.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research.

Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli
G. Research, LLC

So Christophe, if -- what would be the likelihood that you could be close to the 2019 level of $5.12,
including the hit from the freeze and outside of Europe recovering? Or do you need Europe to open its
doors to all Americans vaccinated, and we are all going there in order to help you guys? What do you need
in order to do better than what you are looking at currently?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So right now, I feel very good about delivering this 2019 adjusted EPS, excluding the Texas freeze. As you
mentioned, the Q1 delivery has increased our confidence to deliver that. As mentioned before, there might
be some shift between Q2 and Q3 because of the timing of reopening in Europe, as you mentioned. But
overall, with everything I know right now, I think that the delivery, as we described it, is the right target.
If things improve in Europe better than the old thing, well, we will definitely try to gain more momentum.
But for now, I think that the 2019 EPS delivery would be a good target, excluding Texas.

Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli
G. Research, LLC

Okay. And then looking at F&B, could you talk a little bit in more details of the different segments or areas
in that particular segment?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So F&B had a good year last year. It's one of our best businesses, as you know, so good growth, good
margin, good margin improvement. The whole Industrial end segment obviously did as well. F&B had a
strong start in 2020 when the pantry loading was happening in the first quarter and a little bit beyond as
well. So we have some comparisons challenges right now. But underlying, I feel good about where F&B is
going. It's a little bit different by end markets. So we had the milk products that were impacted for a while
because of schools being closed. That's improving progressively, which is good.

We see beverage and brews, beers improving in some places, especially in the U.S., but we're very strong
in Latin America, where everything is closed. So that's going to be good for the future. That's a little
bit less good right now. And in the food segment, that's where we have strong comparisons versus the
previous year, where it pressures a little bit the year-on-year comparison. But net-net, Q1 so feels a bit
softer because of the comparison. But underlying and especially when I look at the new business being
generated in F&B, the next few quarters are going to show some good delivery as it is to be as well in the
past.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee of Bank of America.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess the first question can you just give us an update on where we are with the cost savings program?
Sort of what have you achieved to date? What's likely to be achieved in 2021? And then how much savings
are left from those big programs for -- beyond 2021?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Gary. I'll pass it to Dan, who has the details. But generally, I like so the progress that we've
made in our cost savings program, which are all meant to strengthen our performance post pandemic
as well. So if anything, things have progressed better than we had expected. But with that, Dan, maybe
some more detail.

Daniel J. Schmechel
Chief Financial Officer

Sure, Gary. Thank you. Just for common reference maybe, it's probably helpful, again, to build up the
pieces of our cost savings program, which you'll recall was originally announced clear back in 2018 as
Accelerate 2020. This was the initiative to capture the investments in our digital offering with a $200
million cost savings target. We expanded it at the time we announced the ChampionX and covered things
like stranded costs and anticipated costs related to ChampionX. We expanded it again to cover some
aspects of supply chain industrial business and most recently to cover some restructuring or really some
reshaping maybe of our institutional business to improve principally steel delivery.

So you add all that up and we have a targeted cost savings of about $365 million. Some of that is in gross
margin. The big bulk of it is in SG&A. Year-on-year, the incremental piece that we expect to capture in
2021 is in the neighborhood, if you look just at the SG&A piece, $120 million-ish range. So it's a big help
in 2021. Mind you there's a lot of -- $91 million, I'm sorry. There's a big piece that is captured. But the net
of it is that we think that this entire program will essentially be delivered by the end of 2021. And there
will be pieces of the institutional program that spill to 2022, but the bulk of it will be fully accrued and fully
delivered by the end of 2021.

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Okay. Great. And then the follow-up question, just how are you thinking about multiyear growth beyond
2021 as we get more normal performance for the business post pandemic? Historically, you'd laid out a
number of long-term aspirational targets. Should we think back to those as appropriate? Or just can you
give us a sense how you're thinking about the multiyear outlook?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Gary, just to make sure I understand your question. So you mean in terms of sales growth and earnings
growth, right?

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's right. Yes. Yes. I know this year's got easy comps, and there's a lot of moving parts. But over the
next 2, 3, 4 years, are those historical targets still reasonable?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Our ambition, Gary, has not changed. It's really -- so the 6% to 8% organic. It's 13% to 15% EPS.
That has been true for many, many years, and it's not going to change in the future. If anything, our
position has strengthened out there when you think about sort of the rise of hygiene standards, the search
for most companies to improve their profile in terms of ESG delivery, net 0 in water consumption being
one of them, the need for digital solutions as well. So those are all things that are improving our position.
So going forward, no change in terms of growth expectations for the future. If anything, our position has
improved.

The next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

In the Institutional business specifically, can you speak to the number of accounts that you served this
quarter versus the prior quarter? And how that may have changed? And then, I guess, to that, are you
starting to see any early signs of new account or, I guess, potential customer launches at this point? Or is
it a little bit early given where we are in the pandemic kind of stages at this point?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Good question, John, except that we don't share, obviously, the exact number of accounts or solutions per
accounts that we're tracking on a monthly basis for a long time, actually, for competitive reasons for the
most part. But what I can say is that the number of accounts keep going up, which is good months after
months, which is giving us confidence, obviously, for the growth of our business going forward because it's
hard to grow without having more customers buying programs from us.

So more accounts, buying more solutions. And 1 thing I'd like to add as well is the Ecolab Science
Certified program that we've launched a year plus ago in Institutional requires customers to buy most of
our solutions in order to qualify for the certification. And this is driving as well penetration of solutions
in a good way, and it's helping as well with the retention as well going forward. So not only are we
gaining number of accounts and solutions, but we're keeping them as well longer because customers are
interested in keeping the certification at the same time.

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Got it. And is there a way to think about on the Ecolab Science Certified program the difference in total
value that you're getting from a specific customer versus one that's not tied into the program, if there's --
looking at like a like-for-like customer, obviously?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So it depends, obviously, where they're starting from. If they just bought 1 solution, the gap is way bigger
and the opportunity is much bigger. In some cases, with some of our long-term customers, well, they're
buying everything from us everywhere around the world. In that case, the opportunity is much smaller.
But when I think about it, Ecolab Science Certified was a program we did not plan to launch pre-pandemic.
That came as an outcome of the pandemic, where we really recognize that our customers needed some
help in order to make sure they could protect their guests and at the same time guests coming in a hotel
or in a restaurant are looking for more reassurance. And that's going to be true for the quarters to come.

So we're measuring as well so the number of locations that are certified by -- Ecolab Science Certified. It's
pretty large. Actually, we're not disclosing that number, but it's by far the #1 program in the U.S. Right
now, it's generating incremental sales, which is pretty significant. As well at the same time and as you
know, we're supporting that as well as the brand in the media, which gets always more recognized by
consumers or guests, as we call them in that industry. So all in all, this is really good to grow our market
share in Institutional.

Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Does it matter that COVID isn't significantly transmitted on surfaces? Or it doesn't matter because
cleaning of theater is more important?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Infections can be transmitted, John, in so many different ways. As we know, it can be the air, can be what
you eat, can be what you touch, can be what you drink, the hands that you're shaking, obviously. So it's
true that COVID is mostly transferred through the air. But many other illnesses are transmitted through
surfaces or human contact as such. And when I think about infection prevention, well, short term, we all
think COVID-19, but mid to longer term we think about any infection that could happen out there and
surfaces like human contact are a big vector, as we know. One example is that in hospitals, the #1 vector
of infection is through the hands as well, not for COVID, but for many other infections as well. So overall,
making sure that you reduce the number of infection in a public setting, John, well, you need to have
surfaces that's infected, as you can.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Good answer. And Healthcare was 5% excluding onetime sales and 12% including. Could you talk
about that difference?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

The main difference -- first of all, I'd like to say so, Healthcare used to have underlying sales of 3%, 4%
pre-pandemic. Getting towards this underlying 5% plus is a good step up, and you've seen the margins
went up as well in a good way, which is all very encouraging for this business. Now the difference between
the 5% and the 12% is solely driven by significant deals that we've made with some governments around
the world during the pandemic to address, obviously, the infection risks in the U.K., in Germany, in
Australia, in New Zealand, in many countries around the world. This is COVID-19 related. So it's tapering

off right now. So you start to compare as well against very high growth last year, and that business is
going to be reduced, we knew that, and then we will get back to the underlying growth of this 5%, as you
can.

Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Dan, can I just ask you about the working capital and how you're thinking about free cash flow this year?
Just noticing inventory was up about $100 million, $120 million in the quarter versus last year, even
though sales were down. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're building inventory
ahead of the recovery. But just how should we expect working capital to trend overall and then, ultimately,
when that's going to translate into free cash?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Vincent. I'll pass it to Dan just in a second. You've mentioned it right. So on one hand, so very
happy with the cash flow delivery in the first quarter. And on the working capital piece, it's really -- so for
us, we want to make sure that we can produce enough product for the reopening that's happening in the
various states and markets around the world. And that has an impact of basically on working capital. But
with that, Dan, would you add some comments on that?

Daniel J. Schmechel
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thank you, Christophe. And that might be the answer to the core of your question. And so inventory,
look, internally, we've been very clear that the mistake that we are not going to make is not going to
have product -- the right product in the right place to serve our customers as their path to reopening
Accelerate, okay? So you're right. We built significant inventory versus the same time last year, also
versus year-end 2020. And my guess is that we will continue to because we'll have the right stuff where
we and our customers both need it.

If you think about the recovery of the business generally, rebuilding the balance sheet means that there
will be some pull on inventory, accounts receivables, too, which are in very good shape from a payment
perspective, but as people buy more stuff, we'll have more on the balance sheet and accounts receivable.
We'll continue to manage our vendors in what we purchase with appropriate discipline. But look, there'll
be an investment in working capital as the business rebuilds, which is to be expected and completely
appropriate. The net, though, of our cash flow delivery for the full year, even including the higher level
of CapEx that we will continue to invest in the business in 2021, our cash flow will continue to be bigger.
And also, it will be -- if you think about the metric that matters most to me in terms of conversion, it will
continue to be in the mid-90% range, which I think is a very good number for the company and for the
model, okay?

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And maybe, Christophe, any comments on where you are with sort of the bolt-on M&A pipeline?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

For the M&A pipeline, that's always a difficult question. Obviously, we have a very rich pipeline. We've
been working quite a bit during COVID. We've done less transactions for the obvious reasons, but we've
done a lot of strategic work. We've built a lot of relationships with targets we have out there. So I feel
good about the pipeline we have. I want to absolutely invest in places that are driving higher growth

shareholders. So I feel good with what's to come.

The next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.

Scott Andrew Schneeberger
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Just with regard to the Texas freeze, it looks like the -- that lost revenue came at a high decremental
margin, if my numbers are correct. Could you please elaborate on just how that impacted? And now that
we're near the end of April, have you seen the full $0.15 impact? Or is this going to drag on through the
fall on through the second quarter, possibly third? Just curious what type of lag there is occurring.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Scott. So the Texas freeze, we expected this $0.15, which seems to be the right number as we speak.
$0.10 have impacted Q1 as we communicated, and we expect the remaining $0.05 to impact Q2. We see
things really so moving behind us. It's not a perfect science. As you can imagine, what was closed, when
it reopened, this is something that we can't control as such. But what I like is that things are really sort of
back in operations. That's true for our customers. It's true for us and our suppliers as well. The only issue
we had was impacting mostly March and April, which was obviously across 2 quarters, but $0.15 is the
total number, $0.10 in Q1, $0.05 in Q2, and it's happening as expected.

Scott Andrew Schneeberger
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

And it appears largely in the Industrial segment, where if I back that out, the weather impact, very
elevated margins. Just curious what incremental upside do you see in the segment going forward? It looks
very strong since the onset of the pandemic and strengthening.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

You're right that the margin work in Industrial has been remarkable. Over the past few years, it was over
300 basis points in 2020, while sales were slightly declining as you know. So in Q1, ex Texas, that was
also a double-digit operating increase, which was good as well. And going forward, I believe that, that's a
winning business. There will be times with raw materials and pricing, where quarter-over-quarter things
might lag a little bit. But generally, margins will continue to improve in Industrial, especially because the
value that we provide to our customers is unmatched.

As mentioned before, most of the customers are coming to us, especially in our water business, is to help
them reach the ESG commitments that they've made for 2030 or 2050. Well, there's no one else that can
truly help them as we can. This is something that is driving growth, and it's driving margins as well for us
because they need better technology, which is where we invest most in research as well. That's where we
have the highest margin. So it's good growth driven by good natural impact, which is driving as well our
margin. So the short answer to your question, margins in Industrial are going to keep improving.

The next question is coming from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.

Just following up on the margin discussion and the price versus ROS. As you look at 2022, 2023, should
margins be for the entire firm -- be hitting a new high?

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

President, CEO & Director

It's a great question. So it's hard for us to know exactly how it's going to be in '21. So knowing '22 and
'23 will be even harder. The way we drive pricing is really sort of driven by the value that we create for
our customers. In other words, how much savings we help them deliver on a year. They invest 10% in our
services, and they get 20% or plus back as a return. This is the way we price. It's basically so sharing how
much value we create for our customers.

Obviously, when there are raw material increases, like we are and will be experiencing in the next quarters
and probably years to come, well, we add that to the equation. We've been quite successful over the past
few years in doing that. That's been one of the reasons why margins have improved so well over the past
few years and especially as well last year. So I don't know how ROS are going to be in '22 and '23. But
I know that our pricing is going to keep being in the 1% to 2% plus range depending on how the raw
materials market are, but it's never going to go down. So all, it's going to be up in price, and it's going to
be driving margins up as well over the long term.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then are there any end markets where you have been surprised at the elasticity of demand and where
you're seeing a clear trade-off between pricing and organic growth?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

You mean in a negative manner?

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just -- I mean, has anything changed in your framework over the course of the COVID-related
disruptions? Have you learned anything new about kind of the end market behavior, where you're like,
okay, that was not expected?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

No. If anything, it's more interest on one hand, so driven by this increased trend of ESG, of sustainability
commitments. So what we do for customers becomes even more critical and customers are ready to invest
more in order to get more return from a financial perspective, but also from an image perspective because
they make commitments as well out there. But on the other hand, it's also in times where performance
-- cost performance becomes more important. Think about some of the end markets are economically
challenged right now.

Well, our solutions usually are very healthy for those customers because it helps them improve their cost
competitiveness because you can do the same work -- the same outcome or better outcome with much
less labor or creating less waste or using less natural resources as well. So it's a good financial deal. So
on both sides for customers in most segments, well, they need more of what we do in order to reduce
the impact on the environment. And while they do so, they reduce their cost as well, which is even more
important in difficult economic times in some of the specific end markets. In both cases, this is a good
story for us.

Our next question is from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.

Andrew John Wittmann
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

You had a couple of questions on margins. I wanted to do another one. You had the one on the Industrial
segment. You had the consolidated margin question. But I had a kind of a 2-part question here. On the

14

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Healthcare segment, to start out with. Obviously, you talked about some of the large governmental orders
and other things that probably helped your fixed cost leverage in that segment over the past 12 months.
I was just wondering, as those comparisons are now stiffer and the business starts to normalize above
historical levels, but starts to normalize from last year at least, if you think that some of the fixed cost
leverage goes away, if that's the appropriate way of thinking about that segment's margins in the 12
months ahead?

And then, secondarily, just maybe a little bit more detail on the Institutional segment margins. Obviously,
the volume declines were significant and it all makes sense, what happened to the margins so far. But on
the way back up with the cost reductions and programs that you've put in place, do you think that when
the revenue level gets back to 2019 levels, is there any reason to think that the margins would be any
different in that business than they were pre-COVID just recognizing that the customer base is probably
going to be somewhat changed, maybe not yours so much given national accounts, but there are a lot
of changes to hospitality and foodservice. So I wanted to get your thoughts on that. Sorry for the long
question.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

No, that's good. Thank you, Andy. Maybe starting with Healthcare, very different dynamic, obviously,
than in Institutional. So in Healthcare, first of all, very pleased with the underlying growth performance
moving towards this 5%, which was an objective for a long time. It's taken us so many years to get there.
And COVID has helped because the infection prevention, awareness of customers and patients, in that
case, well, has gone up very clearly during COVID-19, so which is good. So underlying growth, solid in
Healthcare, and that's here to stay.

Second, on margins, very good improvement last year. In some cases, helped partly with the one-offs,
those government deals that we talked about earlier. But I feel really good that margins is going to keep
improving in '21 and in the future as well. So this is here to stay. So good story in Healthcare. And for
me, that's not the end of the story. It's clearly so up to us to improve it further. That's on Healthcare.
Institutional is a very different story, especially coming out of 2020, which is a business that's been
impacted the most in our company. 90% plus of the COVID impact at Ecolab was on Institutional division,
as we all know, which is 20% of our overall company as such.

So when I think about the margins, I'd say 2 things, Andy. The first one is every quarter, it's going to
improve, and we're going to get a lot back from what we lost in 2020, and we'll get close to where we
were in 2019 pre-pandemic. So probably not at the end of this year, but early in 2022. And the second
part of your question, so post-pandemic, if I can call it that way, well, we've invested in our organizational
development/restructure. We've invested as well in field technology that's going to help us well the
performance. So if anything, the margins of Institutional over the midterm should improve versus what we
have seen pre-pandemic.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Christophe, maybe you could talk a little bit about the discussion it used to be before the pandemic, a lot
more about the investments that were being made in digital solutions. I know the company didn't want to
pull back on investments through the pandemic. Can you talk about what has happened over the last year,
where there have been areas of adoption that have been accelerated because of the pandemic and where
might be areas of lag?

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Great question. Thank you, Shlomo. Digital has been an important priority for us for many, many years.
It started 30 years ago. Actually, it was called differently obviously back then. That was true when we
did remote monitoring of pools and spa in Institutional and that was especially true with 3D TRASAR in
industrial water business as well. And if I fast forward, ultimately, so for 2020 things have accelerated
because, in many instances, we could not go to customer locations for obvious reasons related to COVID.
So customers and our teams have embraced digital solutions even more than before.

Keep in mind as well that we've invested over the past 5 years over $150 million a year in digital. So we
were ready for that moment during the pandemic. That was more luck than genius, obviously, as such, but
it came very handy as well as such. So when I think about the 3 main drivers for us in digital at Ecolab,
the first one is to drive customer value. So it's subscriptions. It's a Legionella prevention programs, for
instance, as well. They're all driven by digital technology. We sell that technology. This is growing very
nicely. The second one is our field solutions in order to improve the productivity and the value created by
our 25,000 people around the world.

Institutional has rolled out everywhere around the world the new platform during COVID, and that's going
to help us as well. So for post-pandemic, that's what I just answered as well before, which is one of the
reasons why our performance in institutional will improve. And the last pillar is the customer experience,
e-commerce, for instance, that has gained traction in 2020 also because of the remote nature of the
customer relationship that we had during the pandemic. So on all 3 fronts, good progress in 2020. And
when I look at the progress we're making in digital in 2021, our digital-enabled sales are roughly $1.5
billion and growing double-digit as we speak. So a very good story all in all.

Shlomo H. Rosenbaum
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. If I could follow-up, is there any progress to note in -- when the new verticals was going to
be kind of the data center area? Is there anything to report on that over the last year or quarters?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's been a great story because we've all ended up working remotely on whatever is your system of
preference, Webex, Teams, Zoom and so on, remote monitoring of applications as well or plants. It's an
industry that has been booming, as you can see as well from the numbers from the tech industry that we
serve. Early last year, which was also pre-pandemic, we created our global data centers as a dedicated
business, which came luckily enough very handy for the pandemic. And since then, this business has been
growing strong double-digit, operating income improvement, very strong as well.

And interestingly enough, so the customers that we serve, which are the tech companies, the ones are
owning those data centers operations, at the same time, have made big commitments in terms of water
and carbon savings. Well, this is the work we do for them because that's ultimately where they use the
water or emit CO2 because of the energy that they need to use for the computers as such, which has
brought them back to us. You've heard from Microsoft as well. They've shared it openly publicly, so it's not
a secret that they've committed for the net 0 water by 2030, and that's a plan that we've developed with
them. That's all driving the growth in that new vertical, which is very promising.

When you think about the restaurant and hotel business going forward, is the restaurant of the future
going to be different than the restaurant of the past or the hotel of the future? That is there may be

ECOLAB INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

President, CEO & Director

This is a great question and a fundamental question, and it's not going to go back to where it was in 2019.
I think it's going to be better. If I think about our end markets, it's not going to be true for everyone. For
the independents, it's being difficult, obviously, for individual restaurants during the pandemic financially
so to survive. Those ones have more hardship than the chain customers, which is the vast majority of our
business. So corporate account customers, as we call them, or the chains, are the ones who have well
survived, the ones who have invested in the operations and the one who are expanding as well in terms of
units. This is who we serve first and foremost. So that's a good situation to be in for us.

Then to your question on the restaurant or the hotel of the future. To know exactly how it's going to be is
hard to tell. But a few things we know. On one hand, so the hygiene standards expected by the guests will
be up versus 2019. It's going to be a little bit lower than during the pandemic, thank God, but it's going
to be higher than 2019, that's pretty sure. And we are asking guests or consumers all the time in order to
understand so what's happening in their mind, and they're clearly telling us that they're expecting higher
hygiene standards, more clean. They want to see cleaning action in order to feel safe, which is good.

Second, the labor shortage is going to become a bigger issue. It was an issue pre-pandemic. It's going
to be even more. So going forward, as we read in the newspaper. Well, our solutions are helping them
deliver more with less labor, which is good as well as such. And the last thing, which is harder to grasp
completely, is how much the takeout, the delivery is going to grow. It's going to keep growing for sure.
And those are new opportunities for us because those are new businesses as well. We haven't figured it
out completely, but I see that as upside. So net-net, for our customers, the chain customers, it's going to
be different than '19, but it's going to be better for us as a company going forward.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And what percentage of cost of goods sold are raw materials for you?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

It's roughly 45%, but obviously, it depends a lot by business. Pest elimination is much lower, as you can
imagine. And in some industrial businesses, it might be higher, but in average, it's 45% for the company.

Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harris with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Harris

Just a quick follow-up for Christophe. Earlier, you mentioned that the first quarter results gave you
confidence that you could surpass the 2019 earnings level. I was just curious -- I mean, what happened
in the quarter that was, I guess, a positive surprise to your internal expectations that kind of boosted your
confidence?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you, Mike. The bigger question so for us for Q1 was to know when, especially in the U.S., the
stage would reopen. And as you remember, in Q4, the lockdown so went backwards in Q4 versus Q3.
Well, that was not exactly a great news. And still, we improved our performance in Q4 versus Q3. So the
question was, how is it going to continue in Q1. And that we didn't know, obviously, as we started our
year '21. So we were hoping that things would be improving. And ultimately, they did. But they did not in
January or February. They did in March. So we were thinking, so Q1 would be a difficult quarter compared
-- versus Q4, so modest improvement.

Ultimately, ex Texas, it was better than what we felt in Q1. So if I look at that, the reopening in the U.S.
states is a good news. Obviously, so for us going forward, China has been good since the beginning of

the year. So those 2 markets are really on the positive side of the ledger. On the other hand, so you have
Europe and some emerging markets like Brazil or India that are in a more difficult situation. So net-
net, it's basically as expected. And the last thing that I would say is that because of the timing of the
reopenings in Europe, that's going to happen, so towards the end of Q2, some of the growth that we had
expected in Q2 might shift in Q3. But all in all, so I feel that net-net, the trends are as expected. Our cost
structure is as expected. The timing might be a little bit different than what we had in mind initially, but at
the end of the year so it ends up sort of this full year delivery that's ahead of the EPS '19, excluding this
Texas impact.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Eric Petrie with Citi.

Eric B Petrie
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

How much of your overall sales are to infection prevention? And if you could give a breakdown between
Institutional and Healthcare?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

So it's roughly 10% for the company, what we call sanitizing products. As such, it had very good
growth. Last year that was especially true in Healthcare, which has a higher percentage. As you would
expect, obviously, this infection is a bigger part of what we do in hospitals than what we do in hotels
or restaurants as you can imagine. But in both end segments, it grew double digit. And we expect the
growth that we delivered in 2021 overall -- to maintain the overall number that we got in '21, which is a
combination of more customers buying more of the sanitation products, but at the same time with a little
bit lower consumption. So much higher than what we had pre-pandemic, close to what we had in 2020
and close to the 10% for the overall sales.

Eric B Petrie
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Helpful. And then as a follow-on, how much of your infection prevention chemistries or sanitizing products
are based on chlorine, alcohol or peroxide? And have you seen any attrition to accelerated hydrogen
peroxide?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's one of the applications that we have. So we don't disclose too much, obviously, the formula that
we are using as such. If you think about the 15 seconds of COVID kill that we launched on the market
as well last year, this is an absolutely unique differentiated application. No one kills COVID-19 in 15
seconds or less than us. So that's been very unique and patented, obviously, on the market. But what you
mentioned, so with the accelerated hydrogen peroxide, that's one of the solutions. We like it as well. We
use it as well. But for us, we're going beyond that as well.
