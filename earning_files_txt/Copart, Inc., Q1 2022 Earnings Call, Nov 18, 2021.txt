Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. As a
reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart,
Inc. Please go ahead, sir.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Good morning. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to
reverse payroll tax benefits related to accounting for stock option exercises. We provided a reconciliation
of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor
Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures,
together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our
business trends and performance.

In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal
securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and
uncertainties in our markets, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you
to the section titled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2021, and
each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of
today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

And with that, I'll turn it over to our President and CEO, North America, Jeff Liaw.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Excellent. Thanks, John. Good morning and thanks for joining us for the first quarter. We're pleased to
report a strong first quarter for fiscal 2022 against the backdrop of various extremes, a persistent and
evolving pandemic, changing global traffic patterns, supply chain disruptions, a strong used car price
environment and an active storm season, to name a few. We continue to serve our customers successfully
to enhance auction liquidity and to continue our long-term trend of profitable growth.

I'll elaborate on a handful of key themes for the quarter, and John will provide additional perspective.
My comments will center around Hurricane Ida, a brief commentary there; secondly, the health of
our auctions; third, the implications of the used car price environment; and fourth, our institutional
commitment to sustainability.

First, on Hurricane Ida. Hurricane Ida struck the Gulf states on August 29 and the Northeast region on
September 1 and 2. This represents our most substantial storm since Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and
our largest storm in the Northeast region since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Having learned from those
experiences and a litany of catastrophic events between then and now, we were better prepared for this
event than any in our history due to our very substantial investment over the years in land, in technology,
in company-owned trucks, company-employed drivers, heavy equipment, and most importantly, our
dedicated CAT team we deployed at a moment's notice.

Hundreds of us from around the country spent our Labor Day weekend on the ground and many weeks
thereafter, managing the retrieval of vehicles, receiving and imaging them and navigating the vehicles
through the titling process to their eventual sale. As is often the case with major storms, we experienced
an operating loss from the event in the quarter of a few million dollars. We view our pre-storm prep and
our robust response to catastrophic events as investments in the strong and durable partnerships we have
with our insurance sellers.

COPART, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2021

Our storm-related costs, as you know, from prior experiences include lease expense for temporary storage
facilities, premiums for towing, labor costs and overtime for our people, travel expenses and lodging,
among others. These expenses are, of course, offset by revenue from incremental unit volume. Financially
speaking, the impact of the storm in the quarter was approximately 100 to 150 basis points of gross and
operating margin rate compression.

You'll know we haven't provided further specifics in our press release or included adjustments in our non-
GAAP earnings schedule for the catastrophe. We believe that providing excellent service in difficult times
is an intrinsic aspect of our value proposition to our customers and that these storms will become -- will
increase in frequency and severity over time.

The second thing I wanted to tackle is our unit volume growth and our auction liquidity. We experienced
global unit sales increase of 21% year-over-year, of which approximately 2 points was explained by the
hurricane itself; a U.S. increase of almost 24%, and again, 2 or 3 points of that growth explained by
Hurricane Ida. We grew our international unit sales by just shy of 8%. The COVID responses in countries
outside the U.S., as a general matter, continues to be more aggressive and more pronounced than what
we've experienced here stateside.

Our insurance business grew relative to the first quarter of last year at 23%. We are observing certainly
continued increases in total loss frequency. I'll comment more about that in a moment, and benefit from
share gain as well. Driving activity itself continues to rebound relative to last year very significantly, but
still just shy on measures such as gasoline consumption of what we experienced in the year prior.

Total loss frequency has increased steadily, including during the pandemic. Though all else equal, as many
folks on the phone already know, the strong used car price environment almost certainly is an inhibitor to
assignment volume, all else equal, to Copart auctions.

Turning to our noninsurance volume. When we exclude lower-value cars, such as wholesalers and
charities, our noninsurance business grew 7.5% year-over-year with our dealer unit volume up slightly,
approximately 1% versus last year and strong growth in our Copart Direct business.

I'll note, and you'll note, that this represents solid absolute performance, but arguably the strongest
relative performance in our history to other vehicle marketplaces given what is the pronounced shortage
of available supply in the industry. We think this is a testament to the power of Copart's marketplace. And
we've said it before, but it's worth reiterating: the cars we earn the right to sell on behalf of insurance
companies, along with rising total loss frequency, enable us to achieve superior returns for progressively
more noninsurance cars as well. And it's also true in reverse. The dealer rental car fleet, bank and
consumer cars we earn the right to sell drive still more insurance volume and higher total loss frequency
as the years go by.

The next theme I wanted to address is prices themselves. So we are experiencing, of course, high used
vehicle prices across the world and certainly strong ASP at Copart auctions as well. Our ASPs worldwide
grew 11% for the year -- year-over-year for the quarter with U.S. ASPs up 10% year-over-year as well.
The Manheim Index as one industry proxy is at all-time highs with a November mid-month reading of
234.8.

The durability-based fees is, of course, a natural question. There certainly are longer-term trends in favor
of higher ASPs, including our auction liquidity, total loss frequency and the like as well as growing demand
from emerging economies for wrecked vehicles from our origin countries. We also continue to invest
significant resources in member registration -- member recruitment registration, retention and the like.

But of course, we should acknowledge the technical forces as well. There remains a chip shortage, which
is affecting the production of new vehicles and driving higher prices for used vehicles around the world.
Our perspective doesn't diverge from the industry consensus, which indicates that this chip shortage will
persist well into 2022 and likely into 2023 as well.

The important note here is that if and when used car prices do fall, we expect a corresponding increase in
assignment volumes as total loss frequency is negatively correlated with used car prices, the more a car is
worth before the accident, the more prone it is to being repaired.

COPART, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2021

The last theme I wanted to tackle before handing it to John is the notion of sustainability. As a long-
standing cultural matter, we at Copart have always asked to be judged on our actions and results, not
our words or our PowerPoint presentations. But we recognize that we're at a moment in history in which
companies are being challenge to articulate their ESG position more clearly, and I'll spend a few minutes
on that theme.

Copart plays a critical role in the automotive circular economy, enabling the reuse, recycling and
responsible disposal of vehicles around the world. We sell well over 3 million vehicles per year. And by
matching those vehicles with their optimal owners, we enable the return to service of automobiles that
would otherwise have been scrapped, the reuse of parts that otherwise would have ended up in landfills.

As a result, the reuse and recycling that Copart enables displaces what otherwise would have been de
novo resource extraction and energy-consuming manufacturing as well. As climate events themselves
increase in frequency and severity, Copart will play a growing role in assisting communities and recovering
from them, as we have in our past, by removing vehicles from roadways, storage facilities and repair
shops, enabling the free flow of people and goods and services in the economies in which we do business.

And finally, because so many of our vehicles are ultimately purchased by buyers outside the U.S.,
our auctions contribute to the physical and economic mobility of residents and countries of emerging
economies, including in Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe.

If you haven't read it already, please do see our annual shareholder letter on our Investor Relations
website, where we expound further on these themes, among others, including diversity and inclusion.
We'll offer more substance in the coming days in the form of a sustainability report as well.

And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to talk about the fourth quarter's financial -- the
first quarter's financial results.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Jeff. Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to begin by also acknowledging our team's effort
relative to Hurricane Ida and thank them for their dedication and sacrifice. Being relatively new to the
Copart family, this is my first opportunity to see us in action and to observe firsthand the tremendous
sense of ownership we take to ensure a positive outcome in the face of both disaster and tragedy. Our
people and our culture have always been and will continue to be the key to our success.

Now I'll make a few comments on our operational results, and then we'll open it up for questions. For the
first quarter, global revenue increased $217 million or 37%, including a nearly $4 million benefit due to
currency. Global service revenue increased $152 million or 30%, primarily due to higher average selling
prices and increased volume. U.S. service revenue was up 31%, and international experienced an increase
of 18%.

Purchased vehicle sales increased $65 million or 84% due to higher ASPs and increased volume. U.S.
purchased vehicle revenue was up 87% over the prior year, and international grew 79%. As a result,
purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $2.7 million
overall. As Jeff mentioned, we had significant relative growth in our purchased vehicle volume, resulting in
gross and operating margin rate contraction of approximately 150 to 200 basis points.

Global gross profit in the first quarter increased by $88 million or 30%, and our gross margin percentage
decreased by approximately 250 basis points to 47.5%. U.S. margins declined from 52.6% to 50.3%,
and international margins decreased from 37% to $33.1% due to a higher purchased vehicle mix at lower
margins, partially offset by higher ASPs globally.

I'll now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures excluding stock compensation and depreciation
expense. G&A spend increased $5.9 million from $35.2 million a year ago to $41.1 million in 2022, yet is
lower from 5.9% of revenue to 5.1% of revenue this year. We anticipate G&A to continue to improve as
a percentage of revenue as we grow our business. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by
33% from $248.6 million to $330.1 million.

COPART, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2021

First quarter income tax expense was $65.5 million at a 20.1% effective tax rate, which reflected a $3
million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options. Adjusting those to a non-GAAP measure
included in our earnings release changed our effective tax rate to 21%. First quarter GAAP net income
increased from 30% from $200 million last year to $260 million this year. Adjusted to remove the tax
benefit on the exercise of stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 37% from $188.5 million last
year to $257.4 million in the first quarter of 2022.

Our global inventory at the end of October increased 12% from last year. This is comprised of a year-
over-year increase of 14% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 3% for international inventory. This
increase in inventory is largely a function of U.S. accident frequency and miles driven returning to normal,
supplemented with the effects of Ida and share gains, partially offset by a decline in international, driven
by countries with longer-duration lockdowns as a response to COVID.

Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.3 billion of
liquidity comprised of $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility
with capacity of over $1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $54 million year-over-
year to $312.5 million, driven by stronger earnings. We invested $65 million in capital expenditures in the
quarter. Approximately 70% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion.

We are continuing to prioritize investments in physical infrastructure above other choices and believe this
continued investment is helping to create durable advantage in our ability to handle increasing numbers
of total loss vehicles and adjacent opportunity in the whole car marketplace. We're continuing to focus on
investing for the future in both capacity and technology while maintaining a conservative capital structure
that allows operational flexibility regardless of economic changes or transitory market dynamics.
And with that, we're happy to open up the call for some questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephanie Moore with Truist.

Stephanie Lynn Moore
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to touch a bit on the overall inflationary and cost environment that you're currently experiencing
and if you are, in fact, taking the impact of the hurricane out of the equation -- and thanks for quantifying
the impact that you saw from that event. But just looking at, one, the dynamic that you called about on
the last quarter was just operating deleverage as inventory levels increase as well as somewhat newer
dynamics that we've heard, whether it's higher towing costs, higher driving costs, you name it. So just
kind of want to walk through, if you could, what you're seeing from an inflationary standpoint on higher
costs and then some levers that you might have in place to offset some of those costs would be helpful.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Sure. And the cost category, as you noted, Stephanie, certainly, I think all participants in all economies
worldwide are experiencing inflation to some extent in the form of wages, towing expense, fuel, capital
equipment and the like. And certainly, we aren't immune to that either. It's our job to manage that, to
absorb it where necessary, to manage with productivity as we can and to deliver the results. So it's -- we
are seeing and experiencing those things.

I would note that inflation, though certainly more pronounced today, it's not a brand-new phenomenon.
For years, we've experienced very meaningful inflation in health care costs, for example. Land has
continued to grow in value. Capital equipment, the loaders we buy, for example, are more expensive
than they were 5 and 10 years ago as well. So inflation is more pronounced today, but it's not a radically
new phenomenon. So we do have experience in managing through that, with productivity being the most
important long-term lever.

Stephanie Lynn Moore
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then, I guess, maybe just talk a little bit about from an inventory standpoint. Do you find that
given where inventory levels are, particularly in the U.S., that you're seeing just as inventory builds just
some operating leverage in the near term as well as maybe some seasonality? So just trying to think
through the dynamic that impacted the fourth quarter and if that continued into the first.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

It's a fair question. And as you know, Stephanie, we tend -- we run the business to deliver service and
aren't per se trying to optimize any individual quarter, month or unit in our inventory.

I think your observation about inventory growth and unit volume growth helping to absorb fixed or
semi-fixed cost is real. There's also other noise in the system, as you know, from the inflation you just
mentioned a moment ago, Hurricane Ida, among other things. But yes, all else equal, certainly unit
volume growth on its own is near, medium term accretive to margins.

Stephanie Lynn Moore
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Absolutely. And then lastly for me, kind of big picture. You put out a release in early November about a
partnership with, I believe, Commerce Bank that just talked about some of the digital efforts that you
have in place, kind of where -- because I feel like most of the time, you don't advertise some of the
investments and initiatives you have in place. But maybe if you could talk about incremental investments

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

COPART, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2021

that you're looking, going forward. Is it focused on improving cycle times? Or what are areas where you
find or have the largest opportunities for improvement here from -- just for continued investments?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Fair point. And Stephanie, I'll talk perhaps in broader frameworks here. It's our job to serve our clients
and there are, as you know, multiple types of clients, starting with insurance companies, which still
represent the strong majority of the units we sell. For them, they care a lot about speed and execution.
They care about auction returns. They care about policyholder experience. And on all dimensions, we are
investing.

There are different nuances to each, I think what you mentioned a moment ago about cycle times and
the public notice you mentioned a moment ago about our partnership with Commerce Bank, for example,
those are investments to address cycle times, in particular, for cars with outstanding liens on them, which
also have derivative effects on the policyholder settlement time lines in some cases. So we certainly are
investing there. Lienholder cars are, in particular, some of the most challenging vehicles in terms of cycle
times, and we invest all the time in initiatives like that. But anyway, the point of all that was there are
many dimensions to that, and we invest across those dimensions as well.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

I wanted to start and dig a little further on the total loss frequency commentary you offered us in the
prepared remarks and as it relates to used car prices and insurance carriers, formulas to total a car. If you
had said 2 years ago, used car prices would rise 40%, now 60% or 70% over a 2-year period, I would
have incorrectly said total loss frequency would crater unless repair costs went up equally to offset it.

So I guess my question is, are repair costs up as much in terms of dollars as used car prices? I can't
imagine that's true. Or are insurers adjusting their total loss calculation kind of real time to the current
salvage your recovery rates that you're getting? Or is it something else? Because if it's dynamic insurance
calculations, if they're changing it with used car prices much faster than they have in the past, would that
potentially suggest that as used car prices fall, then total loss frequency wouldn't rise fast as anticipated?
If that question makes sense.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. It's a very perceptive question, Bob, as usual. I think your statement is accurate. And the total loss
frequency, I think, has been impaired, all else equal, because of high used car prices. And your question
as to then what tips the balance in the other direction. I think it is a combination of repair costs as well
as rental car costs. The repair path, so to speak, for an insurance carrier is also onerous and -- is onerous
and expensive today relative to what it was 2 years ago.

I think there's also just the long-term secular trends in this direction. Anyway, Bob, as you know, which is
the accident section and avoidance systems and the vehicle complexity substrate mix change from steel
to aluminum and carbon and the like, electric vehicles, et cetera. So I think those are all contributing to
the net effect, the total loss frequency is rising when this one variable in isolation would suggest that it
shouldn't.

Now the other variable, which is worth mentioning, Bob, is it's the mix between -- it's the tension between
the two as well in terms of what the used car prices are, but also our auction returns. Our auction returns
are up I think more than pre-accident vehicle prices have been over that same period. So we have also
helped to close that gap with the auction results as well.

COPART, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2021

CJS Securities, Inc.

Got it. Okay. That's great. Very helpful. And just kind of going back to cycle times. So I think in general,
that's obviously a benefit in barrier to entry, but you're always trying to improve cycle times. And
obviously, they probably have over the last 5, 10 years as well. And as cycle times do improve a little bit,
they open up yard capacity. So just curious as to like when thinking about your overcapitalized balance
sheet and the liquidity that you have, what are the primary uses of that liquidity as you run out of more
land to buy or if cycle times pick up enough you need less land at the same time? So just trying to balance
those two and ask, I guess, other uses of capital beyond land because eventually, you want to always buy
land.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Many puts and takes on the question of land. So the business is growing and has been growing for years.
That by itself would necessitate more land, not less. Cycle times have improved, but there's plenty of
complexity in the ecosystem as well. So there are many examples, case studies, in which cycle times are
increasing. And today, arguably, the very strong used car prices are making lean settlements faster than
they otherwise would be relative to an environment in which you had a bunch of underwater loans, for
example, Bob, as you know.

So I think in practice, we will continue to invest in land for years to come, and probably very substantially.
So that said, as you noted, overcapitalized, Bob, is more editorializing perhaps than I offer. But
nonetheless, I think to the point that we are -- have a very robust balance sheet today. But the answer
over the next 10 years is for sure that we'll buy stock back, as we always have. You know from our share
count ex the split that we have contracted the open market share part, the shares outstanding over the
years, and we'll continue to do so. That's a matter of timing in comparison to our relative investment
options in land and otherwise. So we'll be good stewards of capital and return that via share buyback at
some point.

Robert James Labick
CJS Securities, Inc.

Okay. Super. And I meant to say well capitalized, but it slipped out as overcapitalized. I apologize.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Thank you, Bob. Thank you. Thanks, Bob.

Operator

Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Some have already been asked, but I thought I'd shift to Europe. I think you mentioned 8% volume
growth, which was slower than what you saw in the U.S. and I think you identified COVID and the
response there as a factor. But it's also a smaller business with potentially a lot of momentum to it. Could
you just comment on maybe the secular shift in that business and whether you still feel like you have
momentum with insurance carriers in shifting their priorities to -- shifting their practices to your platform?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Sure. And one technical clarification, when we said the growth rate, that was for our international
business, which includes Canada, Brazil, the U.K., Finland, Spain, Germany and the Middle East. So it's not
just Europe alone.

COPART, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2021

So I think underlying your question, Craig, is what's happening in Spain and Germany and our growth
markets in Europe, for example. And there, we continue to experience very significant year-over-year
growth. We continue to prove the economic model. If anything, the gap between the auction returns we
generate at Copart auctions relative to the listing services we've talked about in the past, that gap is
expanding still. So the economic proposition, I think, is becoming more compelling, not less. But what
you're seeing in terms of the overall growth rate is for sure that the U.K. and Canada, for that matter, and
Brazil in certain areas, have been more aggressive about COVID-19 countermeasures than the U.S. has.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then you've had good success in the U.S. with your noninsurance business. Is there a point when your
international businesses mature, such that you feel comfortable rolling out a service like that as well?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Which service now, Craig?

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I'm talking about noninsurance volumes, especially dealers selling cars on your platform?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. And to some extent, we have. So where we do have liquid auction in the marketplace, as we do, we
have pursued other sources of that volume, including dealers and otherwise. So in Canada, in Brazil and
the U.K. and for that matter, the Middle East. So in most places we do business, the liquidity is -- comes in
a hurry, and the cars that we can sell that extend beyond total loss units from insurance carriers happens
pretty quickly as well.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then lastly, I appreciate your commentary on sustainability. Clearly, your story fits that narrative quite
well, and it's nice to hear you articulate it. I'm wondering if the Board or you have done any analysis on
whether you are under-owned by that group of investors that put ESG as their #1 priority.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

A judgment call, tough to make from where we sit, right? I'm not sitting in their rooms and understand
their criteria. But certainly, from our understanding of what constitutes true sustainability, I think our
businesses should be at the very top of that list. So I think that's a reasonable conclusion, Craig. But we
don't spend a lot of energy with target lists and trying to figure out who should own us and not. We trust
this. We deliver the results long term economically and sustainability-wise, and those questions will take
care of themselves.

Operator

Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Jeff, I want to start on the noninsurance side of the business. You noted some pretty stark outperformance
versus peers. And as you're growing into those diverse synergies back to the business, I guess a few
questions. One, right now, are you selling all of those dealer cars internationally? Or are you actually
transacting some maybe U.S. dealer-sourced cars to other dealers in the U.S.?

COPART, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2021

And then the second question would be given the reverse synergies and obviously, the attractive just unit
economics. What are the limiting factors on maybe growing into that faster as you think about the next 3
to 5 years outlook on unit?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Got it. Daniel, to your first question, the latter. So the U.S. dealer cars are being sold both to U.S. buyers
and international buyers. Both are meaningful portions of the U.S. dealer buyer base.

On your second question about the limit, that's a -- there are dynamic circumstances. So as total loss
frequency rises, as we win more dealer cars, we then can win more dealer cars. So the logic is a little bit
circular. But are we the absolute sweet spot for a perfectly intact $75,000 Audi today when it comes to
liquidity? Perhaps not yet. I'd argue we can achieve a very strong result there, too. But there are certainly
many cars and an increasing number of cars for which we are the obvious answer. I don't think we are yet
the obvious answer for $75,000 Audis.

But there's no ceiling per se. Probably the same conceptually, Daniel, when people -- folks ask what is the
ceiling for total loss frequency? Can it get to 25%? Can you get to 30%? I think this is a dynamic picture,
and we'll see that evolution over time. But there's no reason there's a hard asymptote.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

That makes sense. And then I guess tied to Bob's question earlier, as you think about land capacity,
though, you're not feeling right now given the trade-off you don't have enough land for continued growth
in either dealer or insurance cars? Your land gives you flexibility to pursue both?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Correct. The combination of our land and our logistics and our planning is such that we are in position to
serve our customers.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Perfect. And then last question, I just wanted to touch on the percentage of vehicles. I think in the 10-K
last that was filed, they're getting sold overseas. I think we're still kind of in the mid-30s. That's pretty
flat from the year before. I guess where are we -- it's a hard question to answer. But in terms of innings,
where are we at in terms of opening up new countries to sell into? Are there still larger emerging markets,
thinking like India, that you guys aren't selling into today? And maybe can you talk about just what the
steps look like as you enter into these new countries to really start scaling those buyer bases where you're
not maybe fully matured today?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think it's not anywhere close to mature. I think if you compare -- and we do this exercise internally some
years ago. But if you compare long-term GDP growth rates and have that on one axis, on the other axis
have vehicles per capita, the very fastest-growing economies in the world tend to be the ones with the
fewest cars and vice versa. The ones with the slowest-growing economies have the most cars, let's say,
U.S., Western Europe, Japan, for example.

And so there will be a 50-year trend of more of our used, wrecked, damaged vehicles moving overseas,
where they are meaningful contributors to economic and physical mobility there. So that theme isn't going
away anytime soon.

As for tactically how we pursue individual countries, we do both. So we are responsive when we see
activity from countries that previously didn't buy. And we'll invest in online and physical marketing. In

some cases, we'll invest in physical resources on the ground there as well to cultivate that new buyer
base. And in some cases, we are simply proactively identifying countries that fit the parameters that --
obviously, country X looks a whole lot like countries Y and Z that already buy a lot. Let's go dip our toe
there proactively even before we see actual buyer activity. So we do, do both.

Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Just one quick clerical one to start off with. With the revenue impact on the cat, was that roughly like 2%
as well in terms of the contribution to revenue that you gave volumes?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. Directionally, yes.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Got you. And then so I wanted to ask about what you're seeing in terms of like telling availability, to what
extent that's become a constraint as more brick-and-mortar dealers are going digital and online retailers,
and that's putting pressure on the system.

And then like relatedly, you have like a small but growing fleet in the U.S. that's dedicated for cat events.
But what do you do with those towing vehicles when you're not in a cat, right, the other 365 short days of
the year? How do you use those towing trucks in other parts of the year? And is there any opportunity to
expand that to vertically integrate? Or is it just not enough scale? How do you think about that trade-off?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. When not deployed, they support our business in markets in which we are facing the most pressure in
terms of towing vehicles. So you're right that even when there are not active storms, we make good use
of those assets.

Medium, long term, I think there is -- there may well be an opportunity to invest further still here.
Historically, we have done very well with a third-party contractor model. They tend to be very resourceful
and productive, and it's a good alignment of interest as they want to grow and support their own
businesses and to work productively for us. But that's always -- it's an evolving mix and one we continue
to evaluate over time.

During the catastrophic event, and certainly even -- and afterwards as well, we are certainly happy that
we have those trucks and those drivers employed in-house. They have been very productive members of
our team.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

On the Ida cars -- and I think you called out the 14% U.S. inventory growth. Have most of Ida cars been
processed? Or are there any that flow into the second quarter that might come with margins but fewer
expenses associated with them?

COPART, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 18, 2021

Many of those cars are -- we have not yet sold the majority of the cars. So they're coming in -- many of
them in the second quarter and some, no doubt, will -- there will be a tail that takes longer still than that.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then you did comment that insurance growth of 23% included both a higher total loss rate as
well as share. Could you maybe give us some -- what was share versus total loss in that growth?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

No, we don't break that out. And Bret, the share commentary, I think, as you know, is a long -- that
comment you can probably find in literally every earnings call. It's been true for a long time. The industry
tends to move more slowly in terms of switching providers. But over the very long haul, we have,
generally speaking, grown our share, both in the insurance realm and certainly in noninsurance as well.
And that was true in this quarter as it was in the past 30 quarters as well.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess a question sort of a longer term. As you think about the purchased vehicle
trend and purchased vehicles up 85%, if you were to think out 3 to 5 years, do you see this becoming a
business where you are doing a greater percentage of your unit volume on purchased versus service?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

No, I think the long-term winds of history would suggest we move the other way, that we migrate
eventually from principal to a consignment basis. The principal business -- for example, in the U.K., when
we entered in 2007, it was largely principal-oriented. And today, we shifted the strong majority over to a
consignment basis instead, which we think is a better long-term alignment of our incentives with those of
our sellers, right? As opposed to being principals who trade against them, we are on the same side rooting
for the highest possible sale price for those cars.

Now the realms in which we do have more principal activities tend to be places where we are less
established as a known brand and a known quantity. So today, we are not yet a prominent consumer
brand. So it's tough to ask Bret Jordan to consign his car through us and assume that we'll get a good
return for you. Instead, we can offer you a compelling price. You sell the car to us, and we sell it in turn as
a principal.

And ditto in U.K. in the early days. Today, that's no longer necessary because we certainly are a well-
established brand among the insurance industry and otherwise in the U.K. So the point being, all long
term as liquidity grows as our recognition grows in those subsections of the marketplace, so to speak, will
migrate to a consignment model.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And I guess one final question, just a percentage. As you think about the run and drive, at
what percentage of the cars that you are processing could be put back on the road in these emerging
markets. I mean, obviously, some are beyond repair. But when you think about the mix of -- is it 30% or
40% of cars that you see, in theory, could be roadworthy again?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Of the cars that are exported, I don't know off hand, Bret, so I don't want to speculate. But it's high. That
number doesn't sound unreasonable to me, in part because there's a natural filter. As you might imagine,
for the kinds of cars that's even worth putting on a boat to get to Eastern Europe period, you will filter out

the cars that are pure metal content or a couple of recycled parts and then otherwise disposed of. They
tend to, by their nature, be the more drivable/repairable cars that they would ever leave the country in
the first place.

Operator

Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to ask on what you think are the biggest drivers of your noninsurance volume, in particular,
the dealer cars, which we know from following KAR Global and ACV are under significant pressure as the
chip shortage has weighed on new vehicle inventories, and therefore, new vehicle sales and used vehicle
trade-ins. Given your significant outperformance of the trend in dealer cars, I'm curious if you're doing
anything differently or have changed your go-to-market strategy with regard to dealer cars? Or maybe it's
a function of your greater capacity after the land purchases? Or just what have been the drivers there?
And what do you think the longer-term potential for dealer cars might be?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Sure. Nothing radical in terms of our approach. We have a very capable sales team who approaches those
dealers and communicates our value proposition to them, being our global auction liquidity. Subjecting
your car to a global buyer base and finding the best home for that car, whether it's in Ohio, Florida, Poland
or Honduras, I think there's a compelling value proposition there. But there's nothing radical that we had
changed in the last quarter or 2 or 3. This is the byproduct of the auction liquidity we've talked about a
moment ago as well as our own proactive sales efforts.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And I'm not sure what percent of the noninsurance cars you auction are whole cars as opposed to
like noninsurance salvage cars. Maybe you can help us with that. And then of the whole cars, what percent
are dealer cars versus from other sources, such as off lease, off rental and repossession? Because I think
these other non-dealer whole car categories are down even more than the dealer cars. So just curious
what you're seeing there, too. And if those other categories are also a potential source of share gain going
forward beyond the opportunity in dealer cars?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

The answer to your latter question is yes. Those are also relevant and addressable for us. And all cars, as
you well know, are on the spectrum. So even what you define as a salvaged versus a whole car is a more
nuanced matter than simply -- than a binary distinction between the two.

But we have grown our business. Very naturally, of course, the rental car company with a car that's
slightly damaged or meaningfully damaged, we are absolute obvious home for it. Older car, we're a
good and obvious home for it as well. The newer rental cars, those, of course, are very meaningfully
compressed in terms of industry -- available industry volume because of the shortage of new cars, the
fleets are hanging on to the cars they've got. But yes, long term, those are addressable for us as well --
addressable targets for us as well.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And just lastly, I want to follow up on your comment about higher used car prices being a global
phenomenon. I found that quite interesting. Curious if you could identify any sort of trends that you're
seeing in terms of used vehicle inflation by market. I think it is more severe in the U.S. I don't know if
you have any ideas as to why that might be or if that's not what you're seeing. And also if used vehicle

prices are inflating more in the U.S. and internationally and the U.S. dollar has somehow outperformed all
expectations, hanging in there very strong, rallying recently, what -- how does that impact affordability
overseas for these cars?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I would say that the -- I think of vehicles with some notable exceptions. The automotive industry has
been a reasonably liquid global market, right? So I don't think you could see 50% inflation for 2-year-
old Toyota Corollas in one market and 8% inflation in other currency-adjusted. So I do think we have
observed increases in used car values around the world in most countries in which we do business.

There are sources of friction and distortion, of course, in comparing those trends, whether it's tariffs or
shipping or otherwise, that can introduce discontinuities in that comparison. But by and large, I think of a
vehicle business as being a global one in nature.

In terms of the long-term trends -- short-term trends, I think we certainly can't be affected by currency
in any given auction, any given week, any given quarter, maybe any given year. But I think the long-term
trends of our cars being in higher demand in other countries still than they are in the U.S., that's not going
away. That's over a multiple year horizon will dwarf any currency effects.

Our last question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Just had a follow-up to Bret's question. Just want to make sure I heard you correctly. You said the vast
majority of the cat cars hadn't been sold yet? So should we expect the...

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

We sold a bunch, but the majority have not yet been sold.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Got you. So I mean I'll be thinking like it was 1- to 2-point impact this quarter. Is it like 2 to 3? Or is it just
much more than that? Any sense -- and the margin rate should be a similar headwind? Like how do we
think about all that?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. As you know, we don't provide any kind of forward guidance. Those cars will sell. They will generate
revenue. They do have costs associated with them. They'll have some implications. We'll talk about it next
quarter.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jeff Liaw for any
closing comments.

President & CEO of North America
