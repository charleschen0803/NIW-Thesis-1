Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Allegion Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Vice President, Investor Relations and
Treasurer. Please go ahead.

Tom Martineau
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for Allegion's second
quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings
release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to in today's
call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our
website.

Please go to Slides #2 and 3. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered
forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities
law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual
results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these
forward-looking statements.

Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the
reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.

Dave and Patrick will now discuss our second quarter 2020 results, which will be followed by a Q&A
session. We have a very tight meeting today. [Operator Instructions] We would like to give everyone an
opportunity, given the time allotted.

Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2020 will go down as a year of dramatic
change. The health and economic impact of COVID-19 will take the headline, alongside the social concerns
related to inclusion and diversity. With these challenges comes needed reflection. Before I turn the
business results, I would like to address these events and Allegion's response to them.

The tragedy of George Floyd's death has been on my mind as well as the deaths of many who have
preceded him. Black lives matter. Black lives matter, and we must level the playing field, understand bias
and work for equality. Prejudice and racism are intolerable, and we can and must do better. My executive
leadership team has joined me in a journey of listening, learning and reflection, and we'll continue building
the right road map for Allegion.

With our employees, we must also help build a better world with our voices, our minds, our hands and our
hearts. I expect the people of Allegion in our businesses to be involved to create positive change in our
community and our company, and you can expect the same of me.

This is the spirit and culture of Allegion. And determining how we respond to social concerns, our value
and code of conduct has been our lighthouse since the creation of Allegion. And they will help us to
improve inclusion and diversity at the company. In a similar way, our values and corporate business
strategy has provided the foundation to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will be with us for
some time to come.

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Please go to Slide 5. Equipped with a culture of safety, a resilient supply chain and operational discipline,
Allegion was in a position of strength facing the pandemic. Keeping our employees safe and healthy
continues to be top of mind, and we're effectively leveraging safety and health as our true north
throughout these uncertain times. My leadership team led the COVID-19 effort to ensure our company
was responding in real time to considerable global complexity and to meet the needs of our employees,
customers, communities and other stakeholders as well as requests from public health officials.

Cross-functional teams guided our health and safety efforts, production and operational decisions,
work-from-home infrastructure and best practices. We also created an Allegion safety net program,
giving production workers an extra day of pay per month to cover unexpected illnesses or family needs.
I'm proud of the collaboration and communication between functions, which has been key to working
productively and safely wherever we are.

At the same time, Allegion has turned its attention to giving back to communities across the world. While
ensuring our employees had masks, we've also been able to donate thousands of masks to health care
workers across the U.S., Mexico and Italy. Knowing that people have a safe place to live is perhaps more
important than ever, we've also continued our substantial commitment to habitat for humanity in 2020.

There is no doubt our team members across the world are dedicated to serving others and doing the right
thing. And taking care of our team members means they can, in turn, take care of their communities.

Please go to Slide 6. Our enterprise excellence and disciplined capital allocation strategies have served us
well to weather the COVID-19 storm. We are delivering new value in access and safety as people deal with
the realities of daily life in a pandemic. Our vision of seamless access and a safer world has never been
more important. As an expert in security, Allegion customers look for us for specific guidance when faced
with new challenges.

In the age of COVID-19, for example, new attention was brought to their need for a healthy environment
in a variety of ways. First, proper cleaning and disinfecting procedures for door hardware. Second, surface
technologies like silver ion antimicrobial, coatings and new technologies with antibacterial and antiviral
properties. Third, our touchless solutions are at the forefront of helping prevent the spread of viruses and
reducing common physical touch points. From automatic door-opening solutions and contactless readers
to innovative door poles, our products can help avoid hand-to-surface content. Further, by integrating our
way to open and other innovations with identity management partners, we are able to enable seamless
access through our partners of choice strategy. Fourth, our keyless solutions around the world are offering
mobile and remote capabilities for access control and workforce management.

In brief, customers around the world are looking for new, practical and convenient solutions that help
promote healthy environments and provide peace of mind. Our leading brands like Schlage, LCN, Von
Duprin, Interflex and SimonsVoss, paired with the strength of our supply chain and integrated partners
-- integration partners, are meeting those needs. As we continue to navigate COVID-19 and other
challenges, we will focus on our customers, our strategy and the health and safety of our people. Our
business has strong fundamentals and has proven the ability to execute. We will continue to monitor,
evaluate and adapt to market dynamics.

Please go to Slide 7, and I'll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. Revenues for the
second quarter were $589.5 million, a decrease of 19.4% or 18.5% organically. The organic revenue
decrease was driven by the economic challenges that arose as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
currency headwinds and the impact of divestitures of our businesses in Colombia and Turkey also
contributed to the total revenue weakening. All regions experienced substantial revenue declines. Patrick
will share more detail on the regions in a moment.

Adjusted operating margins decreased by 260 basis points in the second quarter. The significant
volume declines drove the margin reduction. We did see positive price, productivity, inflation dynamic,
which helped -- which was helped by reductions in variable and share-based compensation, non-U.S.
government incentives, plus the impact of cost actions, including reductions in discretionary spending, a
freeze on nonessential investments and hiring, restructuring and reprioritization of capital expenditures.
Due to these actions, we saw sequential improvement during the quarter.

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 decreased $0.34 or 27% versus the prior year. The decrease was
driven primarily by lowering operating income as a result of reduced revenue. Favorable share count and
other income offset some of the operational decline.

Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $103.6 million, an increase of approximately $26 million
versus the prior year. Improvement in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures more than
offset the lower net earnings.

Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back later to discuss our 2020 outlook
and a wrap-up.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call.

If you would, please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second
quarter. For the second quarter 2019, reported earnings per share was $1.16. Adjusting $0.10 for prior
year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2019 adjusted earnings per
share was $1.26.

Operational results decreased earnings per share by $0.42 driven by volume deleverage that was offset
slightly by favorable price and productivity, exceeding inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. The
impact of decreased investments in the quarter was a $0.01 increase, and an increase in other income
drove another positive $0.05 per share impact. Favorable year-over-year share count increased adjusted
earnings per share by $0.02. This results in adjusted second quarter 2020 earnings per share of $0.92, a
decrease of $0.34 or approximately 27% compared to the prior year.

Lastly, we have $0.12 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring costs. After giving effect to
these items, you arrive at second quarter 2020 reported earnings per share of $0.80.

Please go to Slide #9. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the second
quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As
indicated, we experienced an 18.5% organic revenue decline in the second quarter. All 3 regions saw
substantial revenue declines. The COVID-19 pandemic drove the decreases across the globe as there
were many government-mandated shutdowns across all industries where our products are sold. We did
see modest price realization, which slightly offset some of the precipitous volume declines. The impact of
the divestiture of our businesses in Colombia and Turkey, along with continued currency pressure, were
headwinds of total growth.

Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $444.3 million, down
18.5% on a reported basis and down 18.1% organically. The decline was driven by volume challenges
posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the nonresidential and residential businesses were down
significantly.

Early in the quarter, our factories in the Baja region of Mexico were shut down by a broad government
decree related to COVID-19, which had a significant impact on shipments. The Americas electronics
revenue declined more than 20% in the quarter as that segment was adversely affected due to its
discretionary nature. We see electronics continuing to be a long-term growth driver and expect growth
to resume when market conditions normalize. On the positive side, the region generated modest price
realization and experienced sequential month-over-month improvements in revenue as COVID restrictions
began to ease.

Due to the Mexico plant closures early in the quarter and improving residential markets, we entered the
third quarter with a healthy backlog for our residential business. Although the nonresidential business
orders are below the prior year, activity has begun to stabilize.

Americas adjusted operating income of $124.1 million decreased 23.6% versus the prior year period,
and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 190 basis points. Volume deleverage drove the

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

decline and was offset slightly by price and productivity exceeding inflation. The region has implemented
necessary cost control measures in the quarter, including headcount reductions, investment delays and
cancellations and reductions in discretionary spending. In addition, manufacturing expenses have been
adjusted to reduce impacts of lower volumes.

Please go to Slide #11. Second quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $111 million, down 21.9%
and down 20.4% on an organic basis. The lower volume was driven by COVID-19 and the widespread
government-mandated closures throughout the continent. The impact of the divestiture of the business in
Turkey and currency headwinds also contributed to the reported revenue decline and were partially offset
by modest price realization.

EMEA adjusted operating income of $1.5 million decreased 87% versus the prior year period. Adjusted
operating margin for the quarter decreased by 660 basis points. The margin degradation was driven by
the significant volume declines associated with government-mandated closures in several countries where
the company operates.

Price and productivity exceeding inflation helped mitigate some of the margin decline. Similar to the
Americas, reductions in variable compensation and other discretionary spending helped the productivity
performance as did assistance received through government incentives. As previously announced in Q1,
restructuring programs are underway in the region, and we expect benefits to accelerate in the second
half of the year.

Please go to Slide #12. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $34.2 million, down
22.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 18%. The decline was driven by COVID-19
related impacts and continued weakness in China residential and Australian end markets. Total revenue
continued to be affected by currency headwinds.

Asia Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $1.2 million, a decrease of $3 million, with
adjusted operating margins down 760 basis points versus the prior year period. The operating loss
includes a $1.8 million charge related to a specific product quality dispute in China. Significant volume
declines and unfavorable mix also had a large impact on the reduced income and margin.

As with the other regions, the price, productivity, inflation dynamic was positive and was aided by
reductions in variable compensation and other discretionary spending. As with EMEA, Asia Pacific
also benefited from government incentives related to COVID-19. And as previously announced in Q1,
restructuring programs are underway in the region, and we expect benefits to accelerate in the second
half of the year.

Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2020 came in at $103.6
million, which is an increase of approximately $26 million compared to the prior year period. The increase
was driven by improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures, which more
than offset lower adjusted net earnings. Our ability for cash flow generation has been a strength of the
company that was evident in the second quarter and will continue to serve us well during the current
market environment.

Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on
a 4-point quarter average. This was driven by reduced working capital needs from lower volume as well
as better turnover on accounts receivable. The business continues to generate strong cash flow, and
we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate
opportunities and optimize working capital to continue driving substantial cash flow conversion.

Our financial and liquidity position remains extremely solid. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8
based on the last 12 months' performance, and we have close to $500 million available under our
revolving credit facility. We also remain committed to a flexible and balanced capital allocation strategy.
Although we've communicated a pause in share buybacks in order to focus on liquidity during this time
of market volatility, we intend to put excess cash to use as we continue to see market improvement and
stabilization.

I will now hand it back over to Dave for a review on our full year 2020 outlook.

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 14. As you know, we previously withdrew our outlook for 2020.
This morning, we reissued an outlook. The numbers we provided assume there is no additional COVID-19
impacts, including government decrees, supply chain disruptions and safety and health issues. The
pandemic has already driven much change in the market dynamic across the world for 2020. With that
said, Allegion's sound fundamental business strength provides some resiliency in times of economic
downturn, and our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged.

In the Americas, we expect to see continued year-over-year organic revenue declines in the second
half. Residential markets are expected to rebound more quickly than the nonresidential. We have seen
sequential increases in homebuilder demand, and point-of-sale metrics have improved in the big box and
e-commerce channels. We expect commercial markets to be tough as the pandemic had forced many to
work from home. In the institutional markets, projects already started will continue and finish. With these
expectations, we project organic revenue in the Americas to be down 7.5% to 8.5% for the full year. We
are projecting Americas total revenue decline to be 8% to 9% with a slight impact from the divestiture of
the business in Colombia.

In Europe, markets have softened prior to the COVID-19 outbreak and revenue declines are expected to
continue in the second half. However, we are projecting sequential improvement as we go through the
back half. For the region, we project organic growth to be down 9% to 10%. Total revenue includes the
impact of currency pressure in the first half as well as the divestiture of the business in Turkey and is
projected to be down 10% to 11% for the full year.

In Asia Pacific, markets were weak before COVID-19 and we expect that to continue, especially in the
China residential and Australian markets. With that backdrop, we expect an organic revenue decline in
2020 of 10.5% to 12.5%, and total revenue will be down 14% to 16% as currency pressures continue.

We are projecting total organic revenues for the company to be down 8% to 9% and total revenues to
decline 9% to 10%.

Please go to Slide 15. Our new 2020 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.15 to $4.30. As
indicated, the earnings decline is driven by lower volumes related to COVID-19.

We have made significant cost reduction in the business, and our work will continue to streamline our
structure as needed while prioritizing critical investments as we remain focused on driving our strategy of
seamless access. The combination of interest and other expense is expected to be a positive to earnings
per share.

Our outlook assumes a full adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 13.5% to 14.5% as well as
outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 93 million. The outlook additionally includes
approximately $1.35 to $1.45 per share impact from impairment and restructuring charges during the
year, most of which has already occurred. As a result, reported EPS is estimated to be at $2.70 to $2.95.
Our revised available cash flow outlook for 2020 is now projected to be in the $350 million to $370 million
range.

Please go to Slide 16. Allegion has strong fundamentals and has proven the ability to execute and adjust
to market dynamics as demonstrated during the first half of 2020. We have strong -- we had strong
momentum in the first quarter, particularly in the Americas. While the pandemic was unforeseen and its
effects were immediate, we managed the business extremely well to restructure and manage costs. We
also moved quickly to address new customer needs for touchless solutions and remote management.

As we go into the second half of the year, we start from our core strengths in health and safety, supply
chain and financial discipline. We will take the necessary and often difficult actions needed to adjust
quickly to evolving market dynamics. The strategy of adding value through seamless access and a safer
world drives the right focus for the long term, and it puts us on solid footing for the post-pandemic world.
Thank you. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

So 2 questions. First off, in Americas, the year-over-year decline in electronics was a little more than I
thought. Just looking forward, do you expect electronics mix to continue to mix down? And then second
question, are you seeing more interest in touchless access and mobile keys in this environment?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would say we do not expect a mix down. I think our key growth has been stronger in the residential.
And I think last-mile delivery, the growth of e-commerce, people's connectivity, that trend will continue.
We've got one of the best locks on the market with our Encode lock. The favorability ratings, I looked this
morning, 37,000 comments on Amazon, at about a 4.8. So I feel extremely good about that. I think the
weakness in the quarter, really driven by the overall lockdowns, but in terms of integrator's ability to enter
college campuses, none of us wanted people coming on-site and that work to see. So we like the long-
term trends, and I believe it's a key factor going forward.

I think too when you think about some of the capabilities that we're putting together, the ability to
seamlessly travel without touch whether it's the wave of hand, your edge device, these things will continue
to be drivers. Add things like our investment in VergeSense, the need to be able to understand how many
people are in a room, in an area, in a building, these are things that will continue to expand as we go
forward.

Operator

The next question comes from John Walsh of Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Wondered if we could just touch a little bit on investments and tax. I guess maybe first on the
investments. Obviously, you put a hard number around it. Not surprising, it's lower than the initial
expectations given the way demands played out. Tax, this is kind of the second year in a row we'll have
this lower rate. How should we think about the investment spending going forward and the sustainability
of the tax rate from here?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

So as we indicated in our full year guide, we're looking at some incremental investments, although
it's lower than what we'd originally anticipated but, nonetheless, higher than last year. And that's
predominantly around this whole movement in electronics and trying to drive that market for faster
adoption, some specific initiatives around the IoT platform and those type of things that help us and
particularly as we begin to kind of come out of this pandemic. So we feel good about those investments
and the ability to be able to drive incremental revenue.

And as we've indicated historically, those investments have enabled us to drive revenue faster than the
overall market. And I think we get good return on those in terms of invested capital. So going forward,
we'll kind of continue to monitor the markets and the needs in our business, and we'll continue to invest
for the long-term future in our business.

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

As it relates to the tax rates, we are anticipating a lower rate, again, than what was originally provided at
the beginning of the year. Some of that is due to some favorable items that kind of came through, FIN 48
reserves, those type of things. Some of it is, quite frankly, we've been able to implement some new tax
planning strategies that will take effect, and we feel good about the work that the team has implemented
there.

As we go forward beyond 2020, we had historically given some guidance that the tax rate would migrate
upwards to kind of like the high-teens area. More guidance to come when we come out with the '21
information, but I feel fairly confident it will be better than that, maybe mid-teens type of thing, at least in
the near term, and that's all because of where we find ourselves today and some of the great tax planning
strategy work that's been going on.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just a follow-up here. You talked about, in the Americas, exiting with some
strength in resi and stabilization in nonresi. Can you put any numbers around that, either what the exit
rate was in June or what you're seeing here in July?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So first, I'd look at the backlog. We've got effectively record backlogs between commercial, institutional
and res. The res demand, extremely strong as we look at point-of-sale. If you look May, June and July,
a 12% increase in dollars, 7% in units, really like that trend. This morning's Wall Street Journal is about
strength in housing.

I think the other thing, as you think about our res performance, especially in the first half, there was a
mandate in the country of Mexico to shut down. That's about 25% of our workforce and a big supplier of
our res supply chain. We deleted inventories in a situation where demand was accelerating, that point-of-
sale that I referred to, record backlogs in residential. I think we've got a great set of product capabilities.
And I think our supply chain is stronger than the people that we're competing against. So I like our
opportunities as we go through the next -- or the second half and early into next year.

Operator

The next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Two from me also. David, I'd be interested in just your kind of forward opinion here now on the nonres
cycle overall. You introduced on the Q1 call the very logical possibility that 2021 could be down given
the later-cycle nature of some of these end markets. Based on what you're seeing in the channels now
and just pipeline work and other folks on the ground, what's your thought around that large question on
everyone's mind?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I think when you think about the institution of commercial verticals, everybody, caution lens. I think,
clearly, there are shifts going on there. I think we saw the ABI come out. It doesn't drive optimism. I think
as I look at Allegion, healthy backlogs, our commercial institutional backlogs as we exited June, high. But
I think the other thing that we look at, specs written, we saw some disruption in spec writing and demand
from architectural firms. That's to be expected.

I think we'll have a better call on specs written, which is in early demand level as we exit Q3. It's -- if I
looked at spec written today, it's improved every week as we've gone through the crisis, but this is more
of a long-term trend. But if I would look at educational, health care, total commercial, we anticipate softer

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

markets. We will put our foot on to drive seamless access, and we believe we can outperform in a weaker
position because of our installed base, the strength of our spec writing and the capability of Allegion.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And then second question, perhaps for Patrick just around kind of the cost reduction actions. Patrick, could
you just provide a little bit more granularity on kind of what's kind of been done structurally from a cost
savings standpoint and what perhaps is temporary? And I'm sure you, like a lot of companies, also some
of these temporary actions are feeling like maybe they're at least semi-permanent as folks think about
travel budgets and the like. But if you could kind of frame that up for us, it would be helpful.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, sure. So good question. Let me try to provide a framework around that. First of all, we've identified
and we are executing on a plan of about $80 million of cost reduction, year-over-year reduction. And
I would bucket that into 3 categories, the first of which would be the structural, more fixed costs,
predominantly headcount reduction. That for this year is about 30% of the $80 million. Then you've got
another bucket, what I call the discretionary type of expenditures, i.e., T&E, contractor spend, consulting,
those type of things, the things that you control in a down market, that's another probably 30% of the
$80 million for this year. And then the variable type of items, the things that are compensation related
that a large portion of which will probably boomerang back next year is the balance of the $80 million or
40% of the total.

I think the key point here is that offsetting the variable stuff, i.e., the things that are expected to come
back next year, we do have and will have carryforward benefit associated with some of the permanent
cost reductions that will carry into next year. We won't be in a full year run rate level on some of those
identified costs until Q4. So we have that. As Dave mentioned in his script, we will continue to work on
further cost reductions to help mitigate that as well. So TBD on further actions that will be identified for
the second half of the year.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'd just add a little color to that as well. I think we got after this early even before COVID-19, you could
see that in our in-flight restructuring plans. And I think it's important that we continue to accelerate
investments around electronics and seamless access while transforming the company into a leaner
structure.

The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.

Colton W. West
Longbow Research LLC

It's Colton West on for David MacGregor. I guess you pointed out sequential improvement on a month-to-
month basis in the Americas in the quarter. Are you seeing those trends continuing to July now?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Absolutely. I -- as you can feel the pulse of the economy coming back, and I put cautions around that
because, in some cases, they've gone too fast, but we feel it. I think if you're in the wholesale-retail
channel, on-shelf inventories are down, and we're seeing that in terms of specs, quotes, point-of-sale and
our own shipments.

Okay. And then I guess as a follow-up, nonres came in better than res, it sounds like, for the quarter. How
much of that was volumes versus price/mix? If I recall correctly, you guys implemented 3% pricing on
commercial hardware back in April.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, majority volume related. But as we kind of saw in Q1, pricing relative to nonres better than the
residential performance, we will continue to push that dynamic to the extent we can and so far, year-to-
date, have been fairly successful in getting solid price realization in the nonresidential segment.

Operator

Next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So Dave, my first question, maybe just trying to unpack the impact that you had from the Mexico decree.
I know last quarter you guys had talked about having inventory on hand, but it sounds like you kind of
depleted that inventory fairly quickly as the quarter went on. I'm just trying to understand, one, kind of
like the impact that you had in the first quarter from maybe running out of inventory; and then secondly,
like, how should we be potentially thinking about a restock as you get back online in Mexico?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So we deep dive this. In terms of the performance second quarter, there was a decree from Mexico that
mandated a 30-day shutdown. We're open well ahead of that, and it was our ability to point out that we
were essential but, more importantly, our ability to keep our people safe. If you dig into it, the governor of
the Baja highlighted Allegion in a press conference, in our safe practices and the confidence that we could
do that. So that was important. I think if you look at the whole region, we got restarted quicker.

Second, the government mandated that anybody over the age of 55, immune compromised, pregnant
could not work. For us, that was about 300 to 400 employees. We had this -- in some of our most
experienced, we have reloaded on that and are producing at a higher -- we're producing out of the Baja
today at the highest level since I've been at Allegion or we created the company. So if you think about
that, we've got 42 discrete manufacturing line in Ensenada, if you have ever visited there. The ability
to bring on that number of employees, pull that lever and replenish the supply chain is, I think, a few
companies in the world could do it. So extremely proud of the team, our ability to rebound.

I think a second thing that's important here, you don't see the point-of-sale data, but our teams did an
extremely good job to drive our -- use our inventory to keep customers and products as well as other
partners in the supply chain. When you think about -- and it's a situation where you're trying to maximize
inventory, we reached out in our partners' supply chains to be able to optimize that. Again, I thought they
did a better job of it. And I believe, the last point in your question, we will be well into the first quarter of
next year getting the supply chain in terms of finished inventories normalized with the increasing demand.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. That's helpful color, Dave. I guess my one follow-up question here, in just thinking about
what's happening from a commodity perspective and how your business mix is perhaps expected to
change over the next 12 months, copper prices right now are surging and noticed that while pricing was
still positive this quarter, I think it's 70 bps in the Americas, it was still -- you saw a tick down versus Q1.
So I'm just trying to understand, I guess, as we kind of move forward in this environment where volumes
really aren't at normal levels, like, how are you guys feeling about your ability to offset inflation and your
ability to get price in this environment also in the context of kind of the mix shifts that you're seeing in
your business?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'm always confident on price. I would say the market is disciplined. Our first cautionary is always steel.
We purchase a lot of steel more and then I think brass. But we'll continue to be aggressive on price
realization, try to offset the effects of inflation, but I'm net positive, and I'm that way every day. Patrick
will bring some real addition to it.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Well, Joe, you're right. I mean the commodity prices have continued to rise here over the last 90 days or
so. So I'd say for the balance of the year, as we kind of look at the margin profile, think about sequential
improvement as we progress throughout the course of the year just through more efficiency and some of
the cost measures we're taking will help us navigate for the balance of the year.

Next year, the other question, we'll kind of monitor and see how it progresses during the course of this
year. But as Dave mentioned, we'll continue to push price to the extent we can. And if we're unable to
offset the inflationary impacts, we'll drive productivity, we'll make the appropriate investments to do
whatever we can to mitigate the inflationary impacts.

Operator

The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Question, can you just comment on regional trends in the U.S.? How is California trending versus Texas
versus Florida versus Northeast? I mean, frankly, just trying to figure out how COVID and second wave
has just impact -- has been impacting demand and if there is a close correlation between what we've seen
with hospitalizations and demand trends by region?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would say the stoppage in New York, the Northeast, you have some pretty strong government mandates
and decrees, especially Boston, no public construction. We do very well in those big metro markets. And
so we're seeing that recovery as the Northeast gets better. Again, you look to California construction, and
Allegion was able to operate during the first shutdown. We'll see how it drives if -- as they move, I guess,
towards a second shutdown. I think you really dig into the data of the COVID, Andrew, you're seeing
growing pockets in construction workers of infection. And how government will mandate around it, we've
got to keep an eye on it. But construction has been considered essential in most areas of the country, and
I think it will continue.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And just a follow-up. You sort of talked about seamless access. But how do you think -- how are you
rethinking access business post-COVID? Do you expect any structural changes in what the customers will
demand in terms of being able to sort of get in and out of the building without touching things?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I absolutely believe it. The number of inquiries on our antimicrobial products would be a clear example.
But Andrew, I really believe that your edge device is how we'll navigate through society. The long-term
trend is, I think, positive. We've got -- the ability exists today to be able to, through your edge device,
monitor your temperature. As you approach the door, if you're out of an accepted range, are you going to

result of COVID-19 and trying to keep people healthy.

Operator

The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Just maybe going back to Americas and just some of the cadence through the quarter, is there any way to
just think about how June kind of finished up relative to the quarter in both resi and nonresi?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I -- Tim, I would say, again, during the course of the quarter, sequential improvement as the quarter
progressed. June much stronger than May, May stronger than April. Feel pretty good relative to the
visibility and the strengths relative to the backlog and the order intake. Resi, as Dave indicated, POS really
strong, demand improving significantly. On nonres, I'd say it's more stabilized, kind of going into Q2 and
exiting out of Q2, now much better. And so relative -- commensurate with kind of the guidance we gave,
that's kind of how we're seeing things right now. Maybe a little conservatism there, but okay.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'd also say we look at a variety of indicators on nonres bookings, frame sales, hardware quotes, specs
written, wholesale sell-through. Every week, as we exited April, got better. You could see things coming
back through.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then, I guess, bigger picture. If the end markets, maybe over the next 12 to 18
months, are choppy, I just wanted to gauge your appetite on just M&A. And does, I guess, your appetite
changed at all? I mean is this a time where maybe you'd purposely get more aggressive and just add good
assets in maybe a time of more stress?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

We'll certainly be watching the stress movements on a set of selected assets that we always keep an
eye on. I don't expect a lot of change in those things that we would aspire to. The jewels that could help
redefine Allegion, I don't expect that to change. But look for us to increase our activity around tools that
will help us expand seamless access, both internally and externally.

The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just before my question, Dave, thanks for your leadership on employee safety, health, societal awareness,
all that. I think it's very clear, those aren't just talking points, so really, really appreciate that. Just a
couple of questions on the nonresi business. First, on backlog visibility, how far does that stretch out?
Does that get you through year-end? Does that get into '21? And then any comments that you would
make on some of the retrofit side of the business versus new as you see activity or quotes in the market
today? Because I think, maybe relative to some other products that's out there, security retrofit is either
completely nondiscretionary because you're locked out or it's broken or a lot more discretionary around
aesthetics or upgrades. So just maybe some comments on how that retrofit side looks.

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'd say in terms of the backlog of commercial institutional, I'd say you look at that with a 6 months' lens.
But there's a couple of filters: what we have in the actual backlog, then you start looking at quotes, specs,
job awards. Like, let's just take -- if we looked at the city of Washington, D.C., job awards that could go
out 18, 24 months, do we have the contractor, the architect, the wholesaler. There's things that go beyond
just our book of business. And generally, we're going to get more than our fair share there. So I think
good indicators, then you got to go to the broader macro. So I feel pretty good sitting here. I feel very
good on 2020. It's -- as you look out, I put those caution lens.

Second question on the discretionary, I would -- I believe in terms of break fix, the discretionary side of
the market, especially the day that money gets spent, especially with rising crime rates -- I live in the
downtown areas of Indianapolis, you're going to get your doors locked. And I think you also got to think
about shutdowns. Are places secure? So the discretionary break fix part of this market tends to roll in up
and down economies. And generally, if you've got LCN, Von Duprin and Schlage installed, you're going
like-for-like.

The next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

The -- in terms of timing on the regions, it seems that the U.S., and particularly in the southern tier, is
going to have some -- is going to continue to have some problems, although the Northeast has obviously
done a lot better. Europe seems to have rolled over its COVID problems much more quickly than we have.
Are you seeing any impact on your business in Europe because of perhaps them coming out of pandemic a
little bit earlier than the U.S.?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

We see -- let me say this. We've got our electronics, our SimonsVoss and Interflex business and our
mechanical business in Europe. The electronics business has performed well during the COVID-19 and
lockdowns, and it's -- you've got to look at that as a key strength. Maybe better geographical position,
but it's that continued trend of electronic conversion, software capabilities that is leading the way there.
So we like that. We're going to continue to invest in that. And we're driving some restructuring before
COVID-19 was even mentioned. The world has got a challenge in terms of overall GDP, but we -- the dark
regions, the Nordic regions, are going to be better than the southern, and the electronic trends, we think,
will continue to operate nicely anywhere we're at in the world.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

All right. A follow-up is you've talked a good amount of that seamless and touchless electronics. Are you
seeing any move within the subsectors when you -- you got some Bluetooth connectivity, but obviously,
NFC has been on the tip of your tongue now for -- since you guys was -- before the company was even
spun out of Ingersoll Rand. And now that Apple has bought into NFC wholly at this point, the entire NFC
world seems to be growing. The question is, looking at other companies, some smaller companies who are
moving very quickly into NFC access, are you seeing the same type of -- are you seeing more competition
there? Are you seeing your own business improving in that area? And if so, what are the areas that you're
going to be focusing on with regard to some of these technologies that have been around but have been
suppressed for one reason or another?

So I look backward to try and understand what our strength is. I think 18 of the last 22 quarters, we
have grown double digits in electronics. So we like that trend. Two is, I think, it's all about your edge
device. And that is the tool that will allow the free flow of people. I think the problems to be solved
are outstanding. Remember, we were the first company in the world, "Hey, Siri open the door." Our
relationships with Apple are outstanding. And I think these technologies are going to continue to drive and
shape the marketplace, and I like the position of Allegion.

The next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

A question for me. For Americas fiscal year 2020 revenues, it doesn't look like the revenue outlook
assumes Q4 exits with positive growth, but it definitely looks like you're planning for continued sequential
improvement throughout the second half. Now if we continue to extrapolate that trend, it appears spring
could be the likely bottom. I mean -- and by next construction season, we could be talking positive nonres
in Americas. Now is that a reasonable way to think about a trend if economy stabilizes here? Or is the air
pocket in quotation activities that you're currently seeing push the time line out materially?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Great question, not easy answers. I went back and looked at contraction in the architectural indexes. And
these tend to snap back quickly. Now is this -- this pandemic will follow that. I think it's a function of how
long the pandemic drags on, the real damage that's been done to institutional budgets. But as we move
into the construction season, there is naturally an improvement, and spring could be given a slight tier, but
I think we'll have a better view of that in 90 days.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Can you talk about inventory in the system? And if you can split that between resi and
nonresidential inventory commentary, that will be helpful.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Inventory in the residential channel has been depleted. I'm looking for some numbers here. But think
about it, 16 days of no replenishment, we tend to try and optimize those inventories. So the shelves aren't
bare. We're in a replenishment cycle, but it will take well into first quarter at the significant demand levels
to get that back to normal. If there's any weakness in competitive supply chain, and if you think about
some of our competitors, the supply chains get pretty complex, we could have more opportunity and could
take longer. We'll take on that challenge. In terms of the nonres commercial institutional supply chains,
those are responding back quickly. I think some of the leverage that we had was, we built backlog in some
of our institutional products, we're able to fill that, but that's normalizing much quicker.

Operator

And we'll take our last question from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just a first question around -- circling back to residential. Just trying to understand, when you put
everything together around the Mexico impact and inventories and so forth and the point-of-sale data,
how likely is it, do you think, that the residential revenues in the Americas can grow in the second half?
It's certainly something that we're seeing at other resi-related products. And any color you could give on
the differing outlooks you have within resi of new construction versus the replacement side?

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

I would characterize it this way, Julian. As we look at the residential business and you kind of look at all
the factors you mentioned, clearly, in the second half, sequential improvement as we progress throughout
the year. Growth year-over-year will be dependent upon our ability to get the labor in place to produce
the product and get it through the channel to the end customer. And so a little bit constrained there from
a capacity perspective is kind of going to be the driver whether we can show year-over-year growth.
But nonetheless, we'll kind of continue to drive that. Like the overall trend in electronics, that's going to
rebound as well to provide some additional growth as well.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I'd be maybe a little bit more aggressive in that I believe Allegion has a better supply chain than our
competitors, and I believe that is going to allow us to take some advantages here in the marketplace.
And you think about that, these products come from Southeast Asia, the complexity can get pretty hard.
Where ours tend to be is more North American centric. Even though we had to take a pause to keep
our people healthy, I think I've got a better supply chain. I'd say, second, the point-of-sale orders are
reflecting that we're creating opportunities. Our electronics are some of the highest regarded and highest
quality in the marketplace.

And then some of the builder activity, that part of the market is growing today in the Wall Street Journal.
And if you've got a question, are my suppliers going to be able to support me as that market expands, if
you're any of the big builders, who are you going to look to? And I like our opportunities to have those
discussions. When you've got to depend on products coming halfway around the world to support your
homebuilding effort in an environment of uncertainty, this pandemic, I like our opportunities.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And any color on replacement trends, in particular? I think, as you said, new home building very strong.
Are you seeing replacements perhaps growing at an equal pace in the second half or similar revenue
trajectory as OE?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Amazing, as I work from home, the amount of activity in the do-it-yourself centers, then think about the
more frequent deliveries of point-of-sale and then people just investing back in their home. Schlage is the
#1 replacement brand. It's a nice spot in the market. So I like our opportunity.
