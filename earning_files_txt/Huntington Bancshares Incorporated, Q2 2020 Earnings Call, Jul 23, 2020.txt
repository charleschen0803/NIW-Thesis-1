HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Huntington Bancshares Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your
host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.

Mark A. Muth
Senior VP & Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Michelle. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies
of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website,
www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about 1
hour from the close of the call.

Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial
Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer.

As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements.
Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to
changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no
obligation to update such statements.

For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the
SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.

Let me now turn it over to Steve for opening remarks.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We're pleased with our second quarter
results, which reflect solid execution across the bank despite an incredibly dynamic and challenging
operating environment. Revenue was essentially level with the year ago quarter as record mortgage
income offset pandemic related headwinds. The actions we've taken to reduce our deposit costs, along
with the hedging strategy we implemented in 2019, are helping to offset the impact from lower rates.
Expenses were down year-over-year as a result of the proactive expense actions we took in the fourth
quarter of '19 as well as the new program we are implementing in 2020. Our business model, balance
between commercial and consumer provides diversification of revenue, where good performance is
offsetting challenges.

Our increased PPNR year-over-year reflects consistent execution of our strategies. Our purpose of looking
out for people has guided interactions during these difficult times. I'm extremely proud of my colleagues
and their continued efforts to communicate with and support our customers and as well as each other.

Over the past months, the bank funded more than 37,000 loans with a total volume of more than $6
billion to the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, a small and medium-sized businesses across
our footprint. Huntington is well positioned with robust capital and liquidity to remain supportive of our
customers and communities going forward.

Huntington received the highest score of the J.D. Power Mobile -- 2020 Mobile App Satisfaction Study
for regional banks. Now this is the second year in a row we've been recognized by J.D. Power, providing
evidence that our focused technology investments are being well received by our customers. As we
assess the outlook for the economy, we are guardedly optimistic for a gradual economic recovery. The
unprecedented level of government stimulus has supported both individuals and many companies. Fed
support has brought financial stability in markets. Recent economic headlines generally appear more

positive with homebuilder, Auto and RV and Marine sales and sentiment exceeding prepandemic levels.
U.S. consumer retail sales rose 7.5% in June as businesses have resumed operations.

In our businesses, we saw record consumer mortgage origination activity in the second quarter. Our
commercial pipelines have improved over the past few weeks, and our customers are becoming more
optimistic for the future with many manufacturing customers expected to be back to prepandemic activity
levels during the second half of the year.

Our outlook reflects consensus to the economists that the recovery is taking hold, but progress will be
uneven. While we do see signs for optimism, we remain vigilant to possible risks and our visibility is
generally limited to the next few months. The range of potential outcomes on key metrics remains wide.

We are monitoring economic and customer data closely and tightly managing our businesses. As a result
of lower interest rate levels, we are taking actions to manage expenses this year, which Zach will further
describe.

We remain disciplined on expense growth while making further investments in technology and other
strategic business initiatives as the economy recovers. And as we've discussed previously, over the past
decade, we have fundamentally changed Huntington's enterprise risk management. It's now the strength
of the company as compared to a weakness during the prior cycle. The most recent DFAST results
demonstrate superior credit performance for our fifth consecutive DFAST filing. Our modeled cumulative
loan losses in the Fed's severely adverse scenario remain among the best in the peer group, while our
stress capital buffer established at the minimum level of 2.5%.

Our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low-risk profile is illustrated through the DFAST results.

Our second quarter credit metrics remain sound as we address the issues in our oil and gas portfolio.

With our second quarter provision, we believe we have the loss exposure in the oil and gas portfolio fully
reserved.

Our underlying portfolio metrics continue to reflect our expectation for outperformance through the cycle.
We restrained our commercial lending in 2019 with a fourth quarter average year-over-year growth rate of
1.8%, which gives us a more seasoned portfolio of commercial loans at this point in the cycle.

This morning, we announced that the Board declared a third quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per common
share unchanged from the prior quarter. And based on what we know today, management expects to
maintain the quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter, subject to the Board's normal quarterly approval
process, and you'll hear more about the dividend from Zach as well.

So Zach, I'll ask you now to provide an overview of the financial performance and carry forward.

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 3 provides the highlights of the 2020 second quarter.
We reported earnings per common share of $0.13, return on average assets was 51 basis points, return
are on average common equity was 5% and return on average tangible common equity was 6.7%.

Clearly, results were significantly impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense as we added
$218 million to the reserve during the quarter.

Now let's turn to Slide 4 to review our results in more detail. Year-over-year, pretax, pre-provision
earnings growth was 4%. We believe this is a solid performance in light of the challenges of the interest
rate environment and the rapid decline in short-term rates year-to-date. Total revenue was relatively flat
versus the year ago quarter, as pressure on spread revenues was nearly offset by growth in fee income.
Specifically, record mortgage banking income of $96 million was partially offset by waivers to assist our
customers' reduced customer activity and the higher levels of consumer deposit account balances that
reduced the deposit service charges and cards and payment fee line items.

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Total expenses were lower by $25 million or 4% from the year ago quarter. This expense discipline
reflects the actions we took in the 2019 4th quarter to reduce our overhead expense run rate, including a
reduction of 200 positions and the closure of 31 in-store branches as well as the actions we have taken to
adapt to the current environment, balanced against the impact of continued investment in our technology
capabilities.

Finally, I would like to note that the normal slides containing comparisons for our net interest income, fee
income and noninterest expense can be found in the appendix.

Turning to Slide 5. Net interest margin was 2.94% for the quarter, down 20 basis points linked quarter,
in line with the guidance we provided at the Morgan Stanley conference in June. The second quarter NIM
was negatively impacted by a few unusual items that I would like to highlight. Elevated deposits held at
the Fed during the quarter reduced NIM by 7 basis points versus the first quarter. This impact would have
been larger, but for our active management to move several billion dollars of nonprimary bank relationship
account balances off the sheet during the quarter.

Reduced loan late fees, primarily in our auto portfolio, compressed NIM by 3 basis points.

Additionally, in Q2, NIM was negatively impacted by 3 basis point derivative ineffectiveness mark. While in
Q1, the mark was positive 4 basis points. Thus, 7 basis points of the 20 basis points of quarter-to-quarter
NIM compression was driven by this item.

Our underlying NIM performed quite well despite the challenging interest rate environment. Given our
strong liquidity position, we continue to actively manage down our cost of funds. Our average cost
of interest-bearing deposits was 25 basis points in the month of June, and we see some continued
opportunity for modest further reduction.

Our hedging actions continue to reduce the unfavorable impact of interest rate volatility and the lower
interest rate environment. In the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion of forward starting asset hedges
become active, providing NIM benefit going forward.

Moving forward to Slide 6. Average earning assets increased $9.9 billion or 10% compared to the year
ago quarter. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 15% from the year ago quarter and 14%
linked quarter, reflecting the addition of $4.1 billion in average PPP loans. As of quarter end, the total PPP
loan balance was just over $6 billion.

Outside of PPP lending, we saw solid growth in health care and asset finance in the quarter. Offsetting this
growth, auto floorplan line utilization was suppressed due to lack of new inventory from OEMs, and we
continue to actively manage the noncore exposure in our oil and gas portfolio down, including $170 million
of loans sold or under contract to be sold in the second quarter.

Consumer loan growth remained focused on -- in the residential mortgage portfolio, reflecting robust
originations over the past 4 quarters.

Also, as a result of the elevated deposit levels in the quarter, we saw a material increase in interest-
bearing deposits being held at the Fed.

Turning to Slide 7, we will review the deposit growth. Average core deposits increased 13% year-over-
year and 12% versus the first quarter, primarily driven by commercial loan growth related to the PPP
loans and commercial line draws, consumer growth related to government stimulus and reduced account
attrition. During the quarter, we saw dramatic shifts in the retail deposit acquisition trends as consumer
and business banking customers adapted to the COVID environment. We saw utilization of online account
opening channels increase 13% quarter-over-quarter and 61% year-over-year. We are now seeing
traditional -- we are now seeing traditional branch-based acquisition approaching pre-COVID levels.

Slide 8 highlights the trends in commercial loans, total deposits, salable mortgage originations and debit
card spend, which is consistent with what we disclosed at last month's Morgan Stanley conference.

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Slide 9 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The common equity Tier 1 ratio,
or CET1, ended the quarter at 9.84%, down 4 basis points year-over-year. The tangible common equity
ratio, or TCE, ended the quarter at 7.28%, down 52 basis points from a year ago.

Let me turn it over now to Rich to cover credit. Rich?

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

Thanks, Zach. Before I get into the second quarter credit results, I want to turn your attention to Slide
10, which illustrates the relevant rankings of modeled cumulative loan losses for Huntington and our
peers in the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenarios of the 2020 DFAST exercise. As Steve has
mentioned over time, this is the only true comparison of credit risk across the sector that we know of,
and it provides us independent validation of the credit risk management discipline and practices we have
been implementing for over a decade now to achieve an aggregate moderate to low-risk profile. Our 2020
DFAST result puts us at the top of our peer group, and we've been a top quartile peer performer in each
DFAST exercise since 2015.

Our portfolio composition, evenly split between consumer and commercial businesses, gives us
diversification in periods of economic stress and our DFAST numbers reflect as much.

Turning now to the credit metrics and results. Slide 11 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses,
or ACL, from year-end 2019 to the second quarter.

You can see our ACLs more than doubled during this period, increasing by just under $1 billion to 2.27%
of loans. Excluding the PPP loan balances, our ACL would be 2.45% as of June 30. The second quarter
allowance represents a $218 million reserve build from the first quarter.

Like the first quarter, there were multiple data points used to size the provision expense for Q2. The
primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the May Moody's baseline forecast. This
scenario assumes peak unemployment in Q2 2020 of 15%, followed by a rebound to 9% by the end of
2020 and a slow recovery to 8.5% by the fourth quarter of 2021. GDP recovers from a 33% decline in 2Q
2020 to end the full year down almost 6%, and demonstrates 1.5% growth in 2021, with most occurring
in the second half of the year.

The Q2 ACL now includes a 30% reserve against our oil and gas portfolio. We believe we have the loss
content in this portfolio fully reserved. We have bifurcated this portfolio into core and noncore segments,
with the noncore portion representing just under 60% of oil and gas borrowings. Our 30% coverage
includes a 44% coverage ratio against the noncore portfolio and a 9% reserve against the core portfolio.
Recall that our oil and gas portfolio represents about 1% of total loans.

Slide 12 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the impact that our oil and gas portfolio has had on
our overall level of NPAs. We have discussed for several quarters the challenges we see with this portfolio.
Commodity prices continue to range below economical levels for this industry. Oil and gas NPAs represent
40% of our overall NPAs and are also a significant contributor to our Q2 NPA build.

Notably, over 95% of our oil and gas NPAs were current pay with respect to principal interest as of quarter
end.

Slide 13 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we provided to our commercial
customers. The commercial deferrals are now graduating to amendments and waivers. And outside of the
hospitality and other travel-related businesses, we do not see a widespread need for additional payment
relief.

Our auto dealers and franchise restaurant customers, 2 of our larger deferral users are both exiting those
deferral periods in strong shape, and we expect nearly all those deferrals to run their course in Q3.

To date, request for additional deferral periods have been limited in the other commercial portfolios as
well.

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Slide 14 shows our consumer deferrals and the early news here is good as well. Our Auto, RV, Marine and
HELOC portfolios are performing as we would have expected with modest post deferral delinquencies. Our
focus on high FICO customers have shielded us somewhat from job losses we have seen. The mortgage
accommodations are a 2-step process as the new forbearance agreement is necessary upon the expiration
of the first. As a result, we have limited visibility into the resolution here.

Slide 15 provides an update to the industry's hardest hit by COVID-19 to date. We have thoroughly
reviewed these portfolios as well as 75% of our total commercial loan portfolio since April. And believe we
have the existing risks identified and appropriately managed. Our hotel exposure is centered on 5 primary
sponsors. Most of them are long-term relationships, including through the last downturn. We believe these
sponsors have the liquidity and financial flexibility to see their way through the longer-term recovery
period we forecast for this industry.

Our restaurant exposure is primarily in the national quick service brands that have maintained drive
up operations and our sandwich and pizza customers have been open for takeout service to offset the
declines in in-house seating. We believe this book to be in good shape overall, but we'll continue to closely
monitor the heightened risk in the single location and other nonfranchise names in the portfolio.

As a leading SBA lender in the country, we also have guarantees on over $400 million of the restaurant,
childcare, physician practices and other sectors, which provides us additional opportunities for recoveries.

In the second quarter, as part of our active portfolio management process, we evaluated the COVID-
related impacts across all portfolios and took appropriate actions as required by regulatory guidance to
downgrade those severely impacted credits to criticized status. This review resulted in an increase to our
criticized asset level of $1.1 billion in the quarter. As you would expect, they were setted on the industries
referenced in the chart: hospitality, retail, airport parking and auto suppliers.

The customers in these affected industries, except for auto, would have longer path back to a full
recovery, and we felt it prudent to move those credits to criticized status. We will take a patient approach
to working with these customers and currently do not see a significant loss content.

Of the 30% of the downgrades we did not attribute to COVID, most of that was in our oil and gas portfolio.

Slide 16 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance on the
whole was strong. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 54 basis points of average loans and leases.
The commercial charge-offs were centered in the oil and gas portfolio, which made up approximately 75%
of the total commercial net charge-offs. I would also point out that nearly all these oil and gas charge-
offs resulted from loan sales closed or contracted for sale during the quarter as we prudently reduced our
exposure to this industry. Annualized total net charge-offs, excluding the oil and gas-related losses, were
24 basis points, demonstrating that the balance of our portfolio continued to perform well in Q2.

Consumer charge-offs were down to 30 basis points in Q2, demonstrating our continued strong consumer
portfolio. As always, we have provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package in the
slides. The nonperforming asset ratio increased 14 basis points linked quarter and 28 basis points year-
over-year to 89 basis points due to the oil and gas impact I described earlier.

Let me turn it back over to Zach.

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Thank you, Rich. Turning to Slide 17, I will provide our expectations for the third quarter. As was the
case last quarter, we feel it's prudent to limit our guidance to the current quarter due to the ongoing
uncertainty around the economic outlook. As Steve alluded to earlier, we have confidence in our
businesses and are pleased with our second quarter results given the headwinds in the quarter, our
sentiment has improved from 90 days ago due to the recent trends we're seeing and the actions we've
taken to better position the bank for success going forward.

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Looking at the average balance sheet for the third quarter, we expect average loans to be approximately
flat on a linked-quarter basis. Consumer loans are expected to increase approximately 2%, driven
by continued growth in the residential mortgage and RV and Marine lending. Commercial loans are
expected to decrease approximately 1% as the full quarter impact of PPP is more than offset by continued
reductions in dealer floorplan and commercial loan utilization rates. Our current projections assume the
majority of the PPP balances will remain on the balance sheet through the end of the year.

Our early-stage commercial pipelines have been building over the past several weeks, supporting the
expectation of accelerating growth in the latter part of the year. We balance this customer optimism with
an acknowledgment of the fluidity of the current economy and some concern that the recent upward trend
in the infection could dampen the pace of the economic recovery. We expect average total deposits to
decrease approximately 1% linked quarter. Commercial deposits are expected to decrease approximately
3%, assuming gradual usage of deposit inflows from the government stimulus. We expect total revenue
to increase approximately 2% linked quarter, with the net interest income increasing 2% to 4%. And
we expect GAAP NIM to expand approximately 7 to 10 basis points versus the second quarter NIM of
2.94%, as a result of the hedging strategy and the elimination of notable items which negatively impacted
the second quarter. Namely 3 basis points of reduced loan rate fees and 3 basis points of derivative
ineffectiveness market.

Our NIM expectation does not include material benefit from the acceleration of PPP fees from the
repayment or forgiveness of those loans in the third quarter.

We expect fee income to be approximately flat as mortgage banking activity remains robust and pandemic
impacted revenue lines rebound.

Based on the debit card trends, we would expect a slight pickup in card-related fees in the third quarter.
Deposit account activity volumes are increasing. Yet given the elevated level of consumer deposits, we do
not expect a full recovery in deposit service charges. These increases are expected to be offset by reduced
other income as the second quarter contained gains of $18 million related to the annuitization of a retiree
health plan and the retirement plan services record-keeping business sale.

As I mentioned earlier, we are benefiting from the expense actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In addition, given both the significant economic challenges of 2020 and the desire to self-fund some of
the compelling initiatives being identified in our ongoing strategic planning process, we are now executing
the expense management program we have previewed for you on prior calls. As I mentioned previously,
our outlook to this plan is focused on 4 categories of expenses, the size and compensation level of the
organization, structural expenses, including our branch and corporate facilities, investments, primarily the
optimization of the level of marketing and lastly, other discretionary expenses.

This program is sized to generate approximately $75 million of annual savings in 2020 and 2021. In
2020, this cost rationalization will allow the bank to prudently manage expenses given the economic
and business uncertainty that exists this year. We've modeled numerous scenarios for the 2020 financial
outlook, with the majority of these forecasts achieving positive operating leverage for 2020, inclusive
of the expected approximately $25 million of restructuring costs related to the expense management
program.

Importantly, we've been positioning the company for some time to be ready to capitalize on opportunities
to drive accelerated revenue and market share growth at will arise when the economy -- economic
recovery begins to solidify. While our longer-term planning for 2021 is still a work in process, our current
expectation is that we continue to see positive signs of economic stabilization and regrowth, we will
accelerate investments in digital technology capabilities, product differentiation and other strategic
initiatives in the latter part of 2020 and into next year, potentially utilizing up to the full amount of these
savings for this purpose in calendar year 2020.

Thus, this program provides the opportunity to fund these initiatives while generally maintaining a strong
expense efficiency level in 2020.

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Focusing on the expense outlook for the third quarter, we expect noninterest expenses to increase
approximately 5% on a linked-quarter basis. Approximately 2% of this growth is driven by the $15 million
of the total approximately $25 million restructuring costs associated with the expense management
actions that we would recognized in the third quarter. The remaining, approximately 3%, is driven by
investments in technology and marketing as well as the return of customer and sales activity closer to pre-
pandemic levels.

Finally, we expect net charge-offs in the third quarter to be near 65 basis points.

This is reflective of the potential charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio as well as broader economic
considerations. Fundamentally, our credit remains sound. However, the economic outlook remains
uncertain, and we are likely to see elevated provision expense through the remainder of 2020.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Nice job. There's a lot of places to go, but let's just talk oil and gas to get that out of the way. Longer
term, what's the plan there? Is it just to get down to $500 million or $600 million, what you call your core
portfolio? And if you could maybe project, is it -- are you done in Q3 or are you done in Q4? When does
the noise start to go away from this portfolio?

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

Jon, it's Rich. With respect to the oil and gas piece of it, we've got to bifurcate it into a core and noncore
sector. And the focus is really on getting that noncore piece of the portfolio down. And through whatever
methods we have, and you saw in Q2 that we sold about $170 million to the extent that we've got
opportunities where we think the sale price is better than what a recovery might be. If the credit got into
trouble, we would certainly do that.

As it relates to the ongoing strategy, we're not originating any new loans in that space. We haven't for
over a year now. I think we're really just focused on the portfolio we have now in managing the risk there.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Jon, this is probably the last quarter we're going to distinguish ourselves reporting out the oil of gas like
this. Because we believe we've got a box now, fully reserved. And while you'll see metrics around that, we
don't feel a need to call it out like we had this quarter and is picking up in the normal course. And we'll
look to maximize the portfolio, particularly noncore over time.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. All right. And then just a follow-up. The rest of it looks so clean from a credit perspective. And Zach,
you talked about the third quarter, fourth quarter provisions remaining elevated. I see it at 2.45% ACL and
relatively tame credit metrics. I guess the question is, how much of a reserve build do you think you still
need? And how do you want us to think through that third quarter, fourth quarter provisioning level?

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

John, it's Rich, I'll take that. We haven't really thought about what a build in the third quarter would look
like. As you work through the CECL methodology, it is a point in time process. And so similar to what we
did in Q2, we will do the same process in Q3. We will look at what the change in the economic outlook
might be toward the end of September. We're certainly not going to race into anything earlier in the
quarter. We're going to take every available day we have look at the economic condition and the forecast
that we see. We'll also have another quarter of portfolio activity to see how the portfolio is behaving
relative to our expectations.

And based on those 2 factors, we'll look at where we think the provision ought to be. So it's really hard
for us to sit here and really CECL wouldn't hand you the forecast additional build. It's really a quarter-by-
quarter, kind of, step-by-step process.

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

But Jon, we do like generally how the portfolio has performed thus far and feel good having looked at
a very substantial amount of the commercial portfolio in-depth during the quarter. And try to have a
realistic, if not conservative lens on it, which is reflected in some of the metrics like the criticized loan
increase.

But it -- the performance for the quarter was frankly better than we would have expected it to be at the
core. And we're -- but we're -- we've got a recurrence of the vibrance, it looks like, coming. And we don't
know when the fourth round is going to happen. There's a lot of unknowns here. So it's very, very difficult
to project where this is not felt yet.

Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

On your comment, right, that you just mentioned to Jon about looking at the reserve each quarter. You
just mentioned you look at the behavior of your credits versus your expectations. Isn't that a dynamic that
under CECL should have already been factored into the reserve in terms of how the credits are actually
behaving versus what you model? Because now you're providing at a lifetime loss expectation.

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

That's right. And I thought my comment was meant to mean that we will look at how the portfolio, if there
are changes in the portfolio from the end of Q2 to the end of the Q3.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. So we worry about the growth then versus the underlying credit?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

It could be growth, it could also be changes in underlying credit. I mean to the extent that there is further
deterioration or improvement either way in the portfolio that gets reflected in the modeled outputs for
what would go into Q3.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then I guess, so if the 2.45% reserve right now, excluding PPP loans, does represent
your best expectation of the lifetime loss content of your loan portfolio. What -- how do you attribute the
difference between that ratio and your company run most recent DFAST estimate that you did. Is it --
does it all come down to the macro assumptions and the amount of stimulus that you're factoring in?

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

Yes. I mean we haven't disclosed the company run DFAST scenarios. But certainly, there's going to be a
number of factors that will go into what we've provided in our forecast versus what we're just running
through the models.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. I got it. And then lastly, I just wanted to ask about the cadence of the cost saves of the $75 million.
Can you just talk about how -- I know you mentioned a portion in 2020 and then the rest in 2021. Could
you just talk about how we can expect the timing of that to play out?

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Sure. This is Zach, John. Thanks for the question. So as I mentioned, it's about the $75 million save in
both years. And over time, the -- like we've said many times in the past, we want to manage the expense
base based on the revenue outlook. And so a very substantial chunk of that, $75 million, we would expect
to flow to the bottom line in 2020 and not be reinvested, to the extent that we see the economy improving
as we go forward and the pace and level of that recovery becomes more certain. We would expect to
start to ramp up the investments, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and therefore, have less or
potentially even neutral net benefit from that at '21 as we go forward.

But for 2020, just to kind of come back to your question specifically, around 1/3 of that save accrued to
the second quarter, and it was around $50 million left on a gross basis before any modest acceleration of
investments in the back half of the year and before the $25 million of restructuring costs in Q3 and Q4.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I was just wondering if you could help us walk through the impact of PPP in terms of the yield you're
seeing on that portfolio, what it added to NII. And Zach, I know you said that forgiveness is not built into
the forecast, but how are you generally anticipating it to go going forward?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes, thanks for the question. Let me try to put some math behind this for you. Just starting first with yield.
It was accretive to yield in the second quarter by, as we noted, about 2 basis points of net interest margin.
Really what drives that is the portfolio rate that we were seeing in June was 3.43% on an accrual basis for
those loans in June, which was made up of 1% of the underlying yield.

And then the amortization of what, for us, based on the size, mix of our loan of PPP -- our PPP loans was
around 3% placement fee over the life of the loan. So the combination of those 2 things for June was
3.43%, and hence, additive to the overall NIM by around 2 basis points.

It was around $35 million of revenue in Q2 as well. As we go forward into Q3, from a NIM perspective,
I think it's accretive by around 1 basis point is our current estimate. So it's a tiny drag on a quarter-to-
quarter basis of 1 basis point down, but pretty neutral in that respect into the third quarter.

In terms of the forgiveness, I think it was the other part of your question, this continues to be a function
of estimates, as you might imagine. But our planning estimate at this point is that roughly 85% of the
loans outstanding will be forgiven. The process around that is the thing that's driving the most uncertainty
around the timing. And so right now, we're assuming that the loan is less than $150,000 each, which
is around $1 billion of the $6 billion loans, will be on a -- likely on a fast track forgiveness process, and
hence, will likely be forgiven in the fourth quarter. So that's our planning assumption for that. And then,
let's say, around 10% of the remaining greater than $150,000 loans are forgiven in Q4.

So which would make about 1/4 of the total $6 billion for dividend in Q4, with the remainder of 75%
forgiven -- what's going to be forgiven in Q1.

So I think by the end of the year, we expect, on an average basis in Q4, we still expect to see around $4.7
billion of PPP in the fourth quarter, coming down to around $700 million by Q1 of next year. Does that...

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Yes. And just a follow-up. That $35 million you recognized in 2Q, when you get a full quarter of it in
3Q, what are you ballparking that to turn into?

CFO & Senior EVP

Yes, that's a good question. $50 million roughly, Q3.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.

Sun Young Lee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Janet Lee on for Steve. I have a follow-up question on energy. So your energy levels are at 30% of
total exposure and this being fully reserved for the lost content. Can you just share with some of the key
underlying assumptions baked into this reserve level, such as a trajectory of energy charge-offs, NPLs and
criticized going from here as well as some of the macro factors like where you think the oil price is trying
to head up?

Richard A. Pohle
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer

Yes. We took a note -- this is Rich, Janet. We took a number of factors as we kind of sized the reserve
build there. When we looked at the core and noncore portfolios, there are a number of factors that went
into that designation, whether it's liquidity. But a big piece of that is borrowing-based coverage. And that
lasts as long as the hedges last. And so our challenge with the book in general is just our view on where
commodity prices are going to go. And as the hedges roll off, there's just more exposure to what we think
is a pretty uneconomical level of price to support drilling and more important to support capital.

So the seasonality of the oil and gas business will drive some of the charge-off decisions, as you would
expect, the spring and fall borrowing base redeterminations are a big driver, kind of a fresh look at where
the loans are relative to the collateral, and that's part of what we saw in the second quarter was the spring
redetermination results kind of flowing through. And then we felt we're very proactive in terms of getting
out of credits. There were 4 structural over advances in deals in our book. In the second quarter, we sold 2
of them and moved the other 2 to NPAs.

So I think -- as it relates to further NPA growth, that will be really based more around borrowing base
redetermination areas. The charge-offs will be a function largely of if there are sale opportunities and also
around borrowing base redetermination.

Sun Young Lee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. That's helpful. And I think last quarter, you disclosed $3 billion exposure in leverage lending,
comprised of a number of different industries. Some of your peers experienced some charge-offs in the
leverage lending portfolio. I just want to see like how this portfolio is performing, anything, at normal,
you're seeing on the credit front?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. As it relates to the leverage lending, the portfolio did go up modestly in the second quarter, it went up
by about 5% to 6%, really due to falling angel activity more than anything as it relates to the originations.
As you might recall, we've got a fairly modest leverage threshold for leveraged loans, it's 2.5x senior as
opposed to most people who do 3x. So to the extent that these credits with the first quarter results kind of
fell into that criteria, we designated on falling angels in the longer lending bucket.

We did not have any leverage lending originated charge-offs in Q2. We are keeping an eye on them from
a prep class standpoint. There were some downgrades within that book, as you might expect, but nothing
significant.

Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens Inc.

Terence James McEvoy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I just was wondering if you could discuss the health of the auto dealer portfolio. I know it was an area of
focus last quarter. You mentioned earlier on the call that inventory levels are lower, and there was some
incremental reserve build here in the second quarter.

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. The auto floorplan business is actually bouncing back in very good shape. We had about $0.5 million
-- $0.5 billion of deferrals, deferred P&I in that book. And that is all going to roll out in the third quarter.
There's very -- the demand, notwithstanding the fact that new car inventories are down, June results were
very strong across our dealer book. And so we expect that barring any further shutdowns or things like
that to bounce back pretty quickly. The challenge for that sector is just getting inventory, and they don't
think that they'll be back to full inventory levels on their lots before the end of the year. So there was not
much in the way at all of reserve build as it relates to the fourth component.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

And the indirect. Do you want to tell them what that is?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Sure. The indirect is performing very well. You can see the deferral piece of that was fairly modest to start
with about 8% -- I'm sorry, about 3% of the book. And coming out of the deferral, the payment rates are
very strong. We've got you 92% paying as agreed coming out of the deferral.

So we are watching that, like we're watching all of the consumer portfolios, just given the impact of the
deferrals on the overall book. But that is a high FICO book. We have a custom scorecard, and that book
has performed very well through the DFAST exercises, and we expect it to continue to perform well.

Terence James McEvoy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And then just as a follow-up. Thanks for -- Page 8, the bottom right, the volume. Thanks for updating that
exhibit. Just the decline in the last couple of weeks or maybe the last month and volume and transactions.
Is that just a short term blip? Or are you seeing just the increase in number of COVID cases beginning to
impact volume overall?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

You're talking about the debit card volume, Terry?

Terence James McEvoy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Correct, correct. Bottom right.

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes, this is Zach. So we've seen -- it's like a roughly 2% year-over-year reduction in the last week versus
the prior 10 days. So I think in the first 10 days of July, debit volumes were up about 20% year-on-year.
In the last week, they were up 18.7%. So not even 2%, I guess, as I talk to you about the numbers. And

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

I think as we look across industries, we are seeing a little bit of a blip down. I was studying the numbers
this morning and 1 of the industries where we're seeing the most substantial blips, not surprisingly, is in
restaurant and bars.

So likely, that is, to some degree, impacted by what we're seeing in terms of some of the economic
reopening guidance changing and things of that nature, but we're still seeing pretty robust snapping back
in year-over-year growth overall.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS.

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Most of the high point has been covered. I was wondering if you could just talk about mortgage and what
your expectations are for the remainder of the year. It seems a bit like COVID has kind of pushed out the
spring selling season. Obviously, we've got a massive change in rates. Can you sustain your performance
year longer than you would in a normal year, I guess?

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & CEO

Rob, what we're seeing in the market here is that it's a lack of inventory. We've had very good, very
strong sales. So the construction is not keeping pace with demand. And you're seeing that flow through in
terms of a number of levels of inventory in a number of markets, I should say.

So we've had a very strong performance on the housing front, and we think that will continue as a
consequence of the virus. And it's somewhat labor constrained on the build or supply side.

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. And the primary secondary mortgage spreads have been kind of juiced up with all the damage in
the fixed income markets. Do you see that rapidly coming in here in the third quarter? Or is that more
sustainable, which would support the mortgage banking reps?

Zachary J. Wasserman
CFO & Senior EVP

Yes. This is Zach. I'll just tack on to some of Steve's comments and trying to address that specific
question. Generally, I think the outlook for Q3 is pretty similar to Q2 in terms of volumes and a modest
tightening of spread. It was sort of around 15 basis points, 10 to 15 basis points lower spread as that
trend continues that we've been seeing for a while. I think the outlook for Q4 is harder to ascertain at this
point, just based on the timing of pipelines and things of this nature. Clearly, the pipeline for Q2 or for Q3
looks pretty similar to what it did for Q2.

With that being said, our planning assumption is that the spreads will continue to come down in Q4 and
that volumes, which are typically seasonally a fair amount lower in Q4, will also see that downdraft as
well.

So I think the trends you noted are, in fact, happening. The velocity with which they haven't is still a
question mark.

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Great. And on the deposit fees due to some of those waivers, fees were kind of lighter, how quickly
can that come back?

HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. It's -- we're assuming that some of them come back in the third quarter. I think really, it's going to
be a function of how quickly the deposits on the sheet start to get used. I think this is a phenomenon
that we've noted across the entire industry, the deposit gathering activity in the second quarter was just
extremely robust.

And what we've seen in our own portfolio is around 70% we estimate on the consumer side of the
government stimulus, and to some degree, some of the unemployment benefits are being saved in
accounts and that's only ticking down single-digit percentage points per month as we go forward. So
it's hard to say because that's going to be the key drivers is what happens with overall deposits, and
therefore, sort of overdraft activity. With that being said, we are expecting a modest increase as we go
into the third quarter. And then I sort of indicated in our comments, Q4 is harder to ascertain at this point.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the

Stephen D. Steinour

So thank you all for your questions and interest in Huntington. Obviously, we're pleased with second
quarter performance, particularly given the challenges we faced. And while incredibly optimistic today,
we acknowledge volatility and the uncertainty in the economy. With the expense actions we announced
today, we are positioned invest in growth initiatives and opportunities while continuing to deliver solid
performance. Our disciplined enterprise risk management provides a strong fundamental position. And
during these past several months, we've positioned the bank to continue to execute on our strategies to
further invest in our businesses and technology and to capitalize on opportunities that present themselves.

I'm confident about our ability to manage the challenges we face, and I'm excited about our prospects
going forward.

Finally, we always like to end with a reminder to our shareholders that there's a high level of alignment
between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are
collectively among the 10 largest shareholders of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on
driving sustained long-term performance. Thank you again. Have a great day.
