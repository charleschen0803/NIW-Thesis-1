INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to today's International Paper Second Quarter 2021
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn today's conference over to
Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations. And Guillermo, you may begin.

Guillermo Gutierrez
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Shelly. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's Second Quarter 2021
Earnings Call. Our speakers for this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and
Tim Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal
disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to
risks and uncertainties. We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation
of those figures to U.S. GAAP financial measures is also available on our website.

Our website contains copies of our second quarter 2021 earnings press release and today's presentation
slides. Lastly, relative to the Ilim joint venture, Slide 2 provides context around the joint venture's
financial information and statistical measures. I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We will begin our discussion on Slide 3.

International Paper delivered solid earnings growth and strong cash generation in the second quarter.
We continue to see very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard and solid demand
for fluff pulp. And in our papers business, demand recovery accelerated in the second quarter across our
key geographies. We grew revenue by 15% as compared to the second quarter of last year with price
realization accelerating in all of our business segments.

Our mills and converting system performed well. However, we operated with extremely low containerboard
inventory across our packaging network due to two facts: the lingering effects of the winter storm in the
first quarter and then our planned maintenance outages in the second quarter. These operating conditions
severely stressed -- along with severely stressed transportation environments, adversely affected volume
and operating costs in the second quarter.

Input costs and freight were a significant headwind in just about every category. I would call out the
sharp rise in recovered fiber cost in North America and Europe. Although it certainly had a significant
cost impact, it is another indication of the strong demand environment. Our Ilim joint venture delivered
outstanding performance with equity earnings of $101 million in the second quarter and a strong outlook
as we move into the third quarter.

On capital allocation, we're making significant progress strengthening our balance sheet. In the second
quarter, we reduced debt by $796 million. We also returned $258 million to our shareowners, including
$57 million of share repurchases. During the second quarter, we monetized our remaining stake in Graphic
Packaging. I'm really pleased with the return on our investment. We structured the transaction in 2018,
maximized the value of the Consumer Packaging business for our shareholders.

Looking ahead, we're making excellent progress on the spinoff of our Printing Papers business, which we
expect to complete on October 1. Across IP, the team is doing an outstanding job managing complexity.
We remain diligent in applying COVID-19 layers of protection for our employees and contractors. And I
really appreciate our team's commitment to execute well, take care of each other and take care of our
customers as we work together to build a better IP for our shareholders and really all of our stakeholders.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

I'm going to turn to Slide 4 now, which shows our second quarter results. We delivered EBITDA of $793
million and free cash flow of $633 million, which brings our free cash flow generation to more than $1
billion for the first half of 2021. Revenue increased by $750 million or 15% as compared to last year,
driven by higher average prices in our three businesses as well as volume growth in our packaging and
paper businesses.

Margins improved sequentially with price realization outpacing higher input and transportation costs. We
expect margins to expand meaningfully in the second half of the year as price realization outpaces rising
input and transportation costs and importantly as we step down from our highest maintenance quarter of
the year.

Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance as well as our third quarter outlook.
Tim?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Mark. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5. Second quarter operating
earnings per share were $1.06 as compared to $0.76 in the first quarter. Price and mix improved by nearly
$0.50 per share sequentially, driven by very strong price realizations across all of our business segments.

Volume was essentially flat versus last quarter. Demand for corrugated packaging is very strong and
demand for fluff pulp is solid while demand for papers continues to recover in all key regions. Second
quarter volume in our North American packaging business was constrained by severely low containerboard
inventory and fluff pulp shipments were hampered by significant forward congestion.

Our mills and converting system performed well. Operating costs were adversely impacted by a highly
stressed supply chain environment for both our inbound materials and outbound shipments as well
as the exceptionally low containerboard inventory conditions in our North America packaging system.
Maintenance outage costs increased by $0.18 sequentially as we completed our highest maintenance
outage quarter of the year. On an absolute level, maintenance costs were $250 million in the second
quarter.

Input costs were a significant headwind for most materials, and energy costs remained elevated, providing
little relief following the winter storm. OCC represented about half of the sequential increase in input
costs. Although some of the pressure in input costs could be transitory, such as the impact of heavy
rainfall on our wood cost in the Gulf region, the extremely tight transportation environment will continue
to put pressure on all inbound materials. Every mode of transportation is tight, and we expect them to
remain tight as we move to the second half of the year.

Corporate expenses benefited from favorable reserve adjustments. Our tax rate of 24% in the second
quarter was sequentially lower, primarily due to discrete period tax benefit. And equity earnings improved
substantially on very strong performance from Ilim.

Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. We continue to see strong
demand across all channels, including boxes, sheets and containerboard. As Mark indicated, we operated
with extremely low containerboard inventory in the U.S. system. These conditions impacted volume and
operating costs in the quarter. We are working to replenish inventories following the winter storm and
maintenance salvages as we manage through a tight transportation environment.

Taking a look at our second quarter performance, volume was sequentially flat. Strong demand in our
North American box and containerboard channels offset lower seasonal demand in our EMEA business.
Volume across our U.S. channels grew by 10% as compared to last year, which includes our U.S. box
system, open market containerboard customers as well as our recent equity partnerships with strategic
sheet feeders. Price and mix increased by about $110 million in the quarter. We're making excellent
progress on the realization of our barge increase.

Our mills and converting systems performed well. However, operating costs were impacted by severely
low containerboard inventories and stressed transportation environment with congestion across all modes.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Maintenance outage costs increased sequentially as we completed the highest maintenance outage quarter
of the year. In our Industrial Packaging business, we've completed about 75% of our planned maintenance
outages in the first half of the year. Income costs were a significant headwind in the quarter, primarily
driven by higher costs for OCC, chemicals and distribution. About $10 million of the sequential increase in
input costs occurred in our EMEA Packaging business, primarily for OCC and energy.

Taking a closer look at OCC. We consume about 5 million tons annually across our U.S. mill system
and Spain. We see the rise in OCC cost as a reflection of the underlying strength in global demand
for corrugated packaging. We expect OCC costs to rise further in the third quarter even as seasonal
generation improves. We expect continued U.S. and export demand, especially from India and Southeast
Asia, which were largely offsetting pre-restriction OCC exports to China.

Turning to Slide 7. We're well positioned for strong earnings growth and margin expansion in our
packaging business in the third and fourth quarter. Demand is strong across all of our channels. We expect
continued robust volume growth across our U.S. channels. And we are making excellent progress on the
price realization of our margin increase. Our mills and box clients are positioned for strong second half
performance following the impact of the winter storms and the significant maintenance outages in the
second quarter.

Replenishing our containerboard inventories will enable operational and supply chain efficiencies as we
move through the second half of the year. We do expect further input cost inflation in the third quarter
with the substantial pressure on OCC and transportation costs. Our teams are doing an admirable job
managing costs in a tough environment. We expect further opportunities to be more efficient as inventory
[indiscernible]. In addition, our commercial initiatives are outpacing cost pressure and position us for
strong margin expansion in the second half of the year.

Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. Demand for fluff pulp is solid and the end-use demand signal
for absorbent hygiene products is healthy. Looking at our sequential earnings, price and mix improved
by $104 million in the second quarter with price realization accelerating across all regions and segments
as expected. Volume was moderately lower due to significant U.S. port congestion and frequent vessel
schedule changes, which delayed our shipments.

Mill performance was strong. However, operating costs were impacted by the tight supply chain
environment. We expect these conditions to continue in the third quarter. Maintenance outage costs
decreased as expected and input costs were moderately higher with lower wood cost in the Mid-Atlantic
region offset by higher chemical and energy costs.

Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 9. Our papers business delivered earnings of $76 million in the second
quarter with continued strong cash generation. Our Printing Papers business carries strong momentum as
we approach the spinoff on October 1 and then continues to recover in all of our key regions. Additionally,
our volume recovery is outpacing the industry through the strength of our global brands and commercial
excellence.

Looking at the second quarter performance. Price and mix improved by nearly $30 million with price
realization across all regions. Fixed cost absorption improved with no economic downtime in our North
American mill system. However, operating costs were impacted by the tight transportation environment.
We executed the heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year as well. And on input costs, we
experienced pressure on wood, chemicals and freight.

As I said earlier, we're on track to spin off the papers business on October 1. Separation planning is
progressing well and we expect to file the Form 10 with details of the spinoff in the first half of August. As
you would expect, there is significant complexity. Our teams are doing an outstanding job managing the
business as we prepare for a successful separation.

Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 10. The joint venture delivered equity earnings of $101 million
in the second quarter with an EBITDA margin of 47%, driven by strong price realization for pulp and
containerboard. Volume improved sequentially on strong demand for pulp and containerboard as well
as more shipping days in the second quarter following the impact of the Chinese New Year in the prior

quarter. Underlying demand is stable following inventory restructuring during the first half of 2021.
Shipping capacity is tight and supply chains to China are stretched. Third quarter volume is expected to
decrease moderately as Ilim executes the majority of its annual maintenance program.

So now we'll turn to the outlook for the third quarter on Slide 12. As Mark said earlier, we expect
meaningful earnings and margin expansion as we move through the third quarter. Looking at Industrial
Packaging, we expect price and mix to improve by $110 million on the continued realization of our March
2021 price increase. Volume in North America is expected to improve by $10 million while volume in
Europe is expected to decrease by $10 million.

Operations and costs are expected to improve by $5 million with the North American system benefiting
from a gradual recovery and containerboard inventory levels. Staying with Industrial Packaging,
maintenance outage expenses are expected to be down by $122 million. Input costs are expected to
increase by $85 million with OCC representing about 60% of the expected increase.

In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $60 million on realization of prior price
movements. Volume is expected to increase by $10 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease
earnings by $5 million on continued supply chain stress due to port congestion. Maintenance salaries
expense is expected to decrease by $15 million. And input costs are expected to increase by $10 million
on higher wood and chemical costs.

In Printing Papers, we expect price and mix to increase by $25 million. Volume is expected to increase by
$5 million. Operations and costs are expected to be unchanged. Maintenance outage expense is expected
to decrease by $23 million and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million primarily due to higher
wood cost. And under the equity earnings, you'll see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture.

I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the quarter. We're committed to
maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're comfortable taking our leverage below the target range of 2.5
to 2.8x debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's basis. In the first quarter, we -- in the second quarter, we reduced
debt by $796 million, bringing our debt reduction to $904 million in the first half of 2021.

Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the second
quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Share
repurchases were $57 million, which represented 1 million shares at an average price of $60.80. We have
about $1.5 billion available under the company's share repurchase optimization at the end of the second
quarter.

Lastly, in the second quarter, we monetized our remaining stake in Graphic Packaging for about $400
million. This brings our total cash proceeds on the investment to $1.3 billion before expected cash taxes
of about $300 million in the second half of 2021. As a reminder, we also have a tax receivable agreement
with Graphic Packaging, under which we expect to receive about $100 million in cash proceeds during the
second half of 2021.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Tim, thank you very much for all the detail. As we look forward, we're positioned for strong earnings and
margin expansion in the second half of 2021. My confidence in making a statement stays on the following:
our commercial initiatives are driving revenue growth and our mill and converting systems will be gaining
meaningful operational and supply chain efficiency as we replenish inventories.

Although rising input costs will likely linger, I'm certain we can successfully navigate the environment
given the strong demand backdrop. Our papers business carries strong momentum as we approach the
October 1 spinoff. Our team is doing an outstanding job managing the business and taking care of our
customers. And I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tireless efforts as we plan
for a successful separation.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

As we move through 2021, we had significant operating and nonoperating cash catalyst. And we are laser-
focused on the capital allocation framework that Tim just described. All of our cash will flow through our
framework with one objective: maximizing value creation for our shareowners. I'm excited about the
actions we're taking to build a better IP. We're accelerating earnings growth and building a foundation for
long-term success. And we're looking forward to sharing more about that with you in the months ahead.
With that, we're ready to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess, my first question, Mark, you and Tim have talked about this in the past about running the cash
flow generation that the company has, both from an operating standpoint and nonoperating since you
have so many transactions that have been occurring this year and will continue to occur this year through
your framework.

What should we take away from that in terms of what tools that you have in your quiver may be more
applicable now versus what might have been the case 3 and 6 months ago? And Tim, what gives you
comfort and why you think it's appropriate, in your view, for leverage to drop below your target range?
What are the things that you think make that a prudent strategy? You can give us a couple of thoughts
there and then I had a follow-on.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. The way we're thinking about it is we are trying to maximize value. We have a lot of cash coming
in, in a moment. We do -- everything looks positive as we go forward. But we recognize this is a cyclical
business to some extent. And so in relation to the balance sheet, where we are trying to build strength,
reduce risk but also flexibility and optionality -- and so taking it down below the target range, which is
really a target range through a cycle, sometimes we'll be below it and sometimes we'll not able to be a
little bit above.

But we just view that, coupled with our pension performance, is derisking the company. Share repurchases
and dividend is very important. And so that is over time, as we -- not necessarily quarter-by-quarter
but over year-by-year, we look to be returning substantial amounts of cash to shareholders. And then
everything else gets tested, whether it's organic or small bolt-on types of acquisitions gets tested against
that.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

As a follow-on, would the accelerating performance that you are seeing into the second half be any way
a guide or a compass point for you in terms of how you may further allocate capital, especially to value
return over the rest of the year into '22? Or is it really not so much because you look at this on a longer-
term basis? And what are the whys and why not on that? And then my related question, and I'll turn it
over for everyone, do you have any kind of view that you could share with how much cash Sylvamo will
need to operate on an ongoing basis?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Just on the last, we do. And that will be -- the Form 10 is going to be coming out here in short order
and I think that will answer a lot of questions. To your first part of your question, I think we try to look at
both. We try to look at circumstances in the moment, but we definitely have a long-term view. And we're
thinking about how all to create value and what our value is over time. So I hope we try to take both into
account over time.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

And Tim, if I could -- and George, just wrap up, there was a lot of ground covered in the capital allocation
questions that you asked. And we do take a long-term view. And as I said last quarter, one of the things
we're really excited about is that we've got IP positioned for the first time in really almost forever or
definitely recent memory, where our entire capital allocation lever set, strong balance sheet, ability to pay
a strong dividend, share repurchases at the right times and very importantly, smart investments in our
business, as Tim said, organic or inorganic, we have all of those levers available at the same time.

In our past history, as all of you know, is we've had 2 or 3 or maybe 2 out of 4, sometimes only 1 out of
4. And that's what we really are excited about as we're going forward. As we separate into two companies,
the new IP is going to have a capital allocation posture that we haven't had in a long time. And that's
very exciting for our shareholders. It's very exciting for the company. Because we have options to grow
the businesses that are growing, to manage our return of cash, all generating hopefully outstanding
shareholder return.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo Securities.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess, not to belabor the point here, but -- and I appreciate that there is somewhat of a wall of worry
out there. But I think one of your peers kind of talked about potentially a structurally higher level
of demand for corrugated for various reasons, whether it's e-commerce or potential onshoring and
manufacturing activity.

So I guess, ask the question a little bit differently. Your balance sheet and pension probably have not been
in as good a shape for 2 or 3 decades. Is there something that you see around the corner that gives you
pause in terms of any of your businesses? And it sounds like again you're pretty constructive near term
outlook. I'll stop there.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

No, Gabe, I think we also view the corrugated packaging market as potentially having a bit of a reset
through this last 1.5 years. We listened to our customers on that. I'm not sure it's 8% every quarter,
quarter in, quarter out, like it was in the last quarter but definitely a step-up from the low single-digit
growth rates. And that's what we want to be positioned for. When we talk about growing at a minimum
with the market, we mean over time and a reasonable assumption of growth on the U.S. market. And
that's a number that I think is leaning towards the higher end just because of a couple of things.

The adoption of e-commerce through the pandemic, which is, I think, proven to be very sticky, and
valuable proposition that fiber-based packaging presents to people in terms of its circularity, renewable
natural resources, making energy in a carbon-neutral biomass way and a high recycling rate is finally --
with all the talk about sustainability and climate and a number of other issues, finally getting attention all
the way down to the consumer level. So we're very excited about the corrugated packaging outlook. And
we want to make sure we're there with the right asset base, the right customer list, the right technical
capabilities to grow with -- to share in that growth.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

All right. And I guess, switching gears, are you guys prepared at all, it's been, call it, 8 months or so since
you've announced the $350 million to $400 million of cost reduction, to provide maybe a little bit more
detail either cadence of that of how we might expect it to flow through? I'm assuming maybe we've seen
a little bit here in the first half, but -- and then maybe by segment, what you expect to see. Or is that
something you maybe prefer to wait to talk about?

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. Gabe, we plan on starting that as we head towards the third quarter release and then for the end of
the year to get an expectation about 2022 performance.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

On Industrial Packaging, the FBA and AF&PA data would suggest that sort of industry inventories are kind
of closer back to a normal or more of a normally historic level for July. I'm just wondering if it's possible
to quantify or put a finer point on how far below you are sort of normal or comfortable levels of inventory
and sort of where that was exiting the quarter and maybe as we're here at the end of July.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's -- I mean, through the second quarter, we saw the lowest inventory levels in our system that
we've probably ever experienced. Coming out of the second quarter into July, we're able to start covering
a little bit of that. But look, we're -- I mean, the winter storm impact hit us hard, 145,000 tons, followed
by an abnormally high outage quarter in the second quarter. So it's going to take a little bit of time for us
to recover that as we go through third quarter and probably into the fourth quarter to some extent. So
yes, we were at our lowest levels we've ever seen in the second quarter.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Anthony, I think the other perspective on inventories -- and I've seen a lot written by analysts on normal
inventories. And one just thing to remember, the way we look at it, normal inventories, averages from
the past tend to correlate with more normal supply chain environment, so normal transportation velocity,
so forth and so on. We are nowhere near any kind of normal supply chain performance by third-party
partners in the transportation world.

So our inventory view in IP for the next quarter and the quarter after that is also influenced and adjusted
by what's happening in the transportation and supply chain network. So I would expect that normal
right now should be higher levels of inventory to perform the same with customers as we had when
transportation velocity was much higher.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful and point well taken. And then just maybe following up on capital allocation,
in terms of -- you talked about the willingness to potentially go under the 2.5 to 2.8 range at what is, I
think, a pretty positive part of the cycle. As you look to the spin, would you look at revisiting that 2.5 to
2.8 target range either up or down?

I mean, you're going to have a more durable, higher-quality business with Industrial Packaging and pulp.
At the same time, you have a publicly traded competitor in containerboard that's been operating closer
to 1 turn or certainly below 2 turns. So just wondering if you could talk about that range and maybe your
willingness to revisit it over the long term.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's a great question, Anthony. And certainly, we -- none of this is static, right? So we want it to be
understood and we want to be consistent and true to the framework as we talk about it. But that doesn't
bar us from reevaluating based on portfolio and other specifics on potential changes that we think are
beneficial to our investors and stakeholders. So nothing now, but something that we will definitely look at
over time.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Anthony, I think the way you should probably think about how we make that decision together, Tim
and his team and me, is we try to look at the company at its optimal weighted average cost of capital,
along -- a portion of that is what credit rating we need to have that delivers and supports that. So you're
absolutely right, we're going to be a different company going forward.

That analysis is something that we do continuously. We've aligned at the credit rating target we have
based on the company. We will continue to look at that and try to make sure that our ROIC is constructed
in the most effective way to get the best, solid, high-quality return we can for shareholders. And definitely,
debt ratios and credit ratings are a part of that.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

Wanted first just to get maybe more color on the corrugated volumes. I get solid, up 3.9%, industry
though was up 8.2%. You mentioned supply chain and other challenges you had. Did that actually
suppress where your volumes otherwise would have been? And if that was the case, is that business
that when your system is operating easily comes back? Or can you kind of give us some color on how to
understand the volume situation?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, Mark, I think the way to think about the -- I was looking at what we sort of put in our outlook in
the first quarter call. And we actually had stronger performance than we felt we were going to have. But
we didn't know, like a lot of people didn't know, the market was going to grow 8%. We had the inability
during the quarter, in some cases, to pick up incremental business. We didn't lose any business with our
core customer list that was coming into the quarter as business.

There may be some business that we didn't bid. Most of it is shorter-term business. So the answer is yes.
We have people still calling us today, "Can you supply? We need more boxes." In some cases, we can.
We just couldn't do it in the second quarter. So I'm not concerned about losing anything permanently. We
basically had a classic mismatch between the available capacity in our system and the demand in a 90-day
period.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

And the -- when you say the available capacity, is that because your capacity during these 90 days were
constrained by unusual factors? Or basically, you're just pretty much running full to your system?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

The two factors I mentioned, Mark, in my opening comments, we have more than 1 quarter of recovery
from the winter storm, 140,000 tons that just evaporated from our containerboard supply chain. And on
top of that, we had our highest maintenance quarter in IPG in the last 10 years. So if you just normalize
what was above normal maintenance plus that winter storm, that's a chunk of containerboard capacity
that could not be converted into a box.

And that's coming back. It's just going to take a little while to get it back. So what we had available, we
had wide open. But we had capacity offline for maintenance and we had the lingering effect of the 140,000
tons from the first quarter. None of those are permanent. All of those will be significantly improved as we
navigate through the second half.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Research Partners

Got it. And then just on pulp, obviously great price/mix showing in the quarter. And you pointed to
another, I think it was $60 million or so for the third quarter. Does that pretty much reflect all of the
benefit from the pricing that's already happened, forgetting about what happens from here? Or the
way your contracts set up, is there meaningful additional lag that might come through based on what's
happened previously with posted prices?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

So that's a complicated question because of the nature of some of these contracts by customer type,
by region. But let me just kind of state -- restate what we talked about the last 2 quarters that, a, you
could expect quarter -- quarter-over-quarter improvement in this business, steady improvement in this
business and we're seeing that. But our strategy is to have the kind of margins in this business that reflect
the value that fluff pulp provides for the end-use customers. So we're taking a very structured, very
measured approach to each market segment and to the agreements we currently have in those segments
with individual customers. And so as we implement this approach, we would expect that there'll be some
volume shifts and movement between segments.

And our goal is to have mix improvement, better agreements with better economics that reflect the value
of fluff pulp. And that is a kind of customer-by-customer, region of the world by region of the world. And I
would expect, and we're making progress, good progress on that, that given the length of some of these
agreements and the way they're structured, we should expect to continue to see margins improve over
the next several quarters. So that's a long, complicated answer to would we have any more price flow-
through. It's not just about price flow-through, it's about restructuring these commercial agreements and
getting the proper value for this product.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I wondered, Mark or Tim, if you can just help us a little bit with kind of cadencing the pass-through of the
spring containerboard hike? And then I don't think you said anything about this prospective early August
hike. So maybe if you could just give us some color around that as well, just as we think about the next
couple of quarters and into 2022?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Mark, it's Tim. So I think the increase from the fall, as we talked about last quarter, went through a record
amount of time. It was the fastest I've ever seen. The pace on the second one, we were kind of expecting
a normal historical ramp on it. It seems to be going faster, not as fast as the first but still faster than what
we've seen over time. We'll see, as August comes, we'll see how that will play out. But right now, we
see our fundamentals looking very strong. We see strong demand. And as Mark talked about, all of the
complications with supply chain are really stretching inventory tighter than they would normally be. So far,
through the first two price increase implementations, we feel really good.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Well, so can you give us a sense, Tim, of how much benefit from that spring hike you've had in the second
quarter and just order of magnitude, what we might expect in the third and fourth quarters?

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. I think if you look at the two of them combined, we'd be about 80% complete on implementation at
this point.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. All right. And then any thoughts on sort of how August would roll in?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I don't want to -- I mean, that's forward-looking, and we feel very confident at the moment. But I
don't want to speak to forecasting price at this point.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. All right. That's fair. Mark, I just want to, as a follow-up, turn to the containerboard business from
just a kind of a supply and demand standpoint. Does this continued strength in global containerboard
demand, is it all from your thinking at all about investing in either debottlenecking projects with existing
mills or potentially the timing on that second conversion at Riverdale? And are you also doing anything to
kind of gear up capacity on the converting side as e-commerce continues to grow as a bigger and bigger
percentage of the market?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

That's a great question, Mark. And the answer is coming in just maybe in the middle of 2020, we were
saying and I was saying that we feel really good about our containerboard capacity. We have what
we need, the amount, the type of grades. When everything is running, we have enough capacity. But
everything isn't run it every day with outages and, of course, events that you don't predict, like that
winter storm issue. But yes, we are looking continuously at debottlenecking. We've done a bunch of that in
the last several years, thankfully because we need that containerboard now.

We are looking at different options for adding containerboard into our system if it looks like this kind of
demand level is going to be consistent. Remember, we are structured maybe a little bit uniquely in the
sense that we bring containerboard to market through three distinct channels, our own box network, open
market in North America to companies that provide a certain service in the box market and have been
long-term partners of ours, but we don't make the box and then our export. So what you have seen and
will continue to see is movement of containerboard within those three channels.

And obviously, we have favored the U.S. box market as much as we can but trying to continue over time,
not just in the second quarter of 2021, but over time, get the highest possible margins in our business by
participating in all three of those channels. Containerboard, you're right, is a high-demand product all over
the world, both recycled and virgin. We have obviously only export the virgin, we sell the virgin version of
it. Box capacity, we've been actively investing. Luckily with the acquisitions we did with that in the early
part of the past period, we had a lot of opportunities to fill out existing plants by adding single or double
lines of box-making equipment. We've built a few plants and we've acquired a couple of partnerships, but
there's definitely opportunity for us to continue to invest in our converting network.

The other option with converting, as you well know, Mark, is when you know demand looks like it's going
to be solid, you can bring on more employees and actually fill out an extra shift in many plants and you've
got latent capacity turned into productive capacity. You obviously want to do that when you're pretty
sure and you first do it with overtime and then you do it with permanent employees. That's a challenge
right now, given the labor market dynamics. But we've got several levers to pull to continue to invest in
not only box capacity but the kinds of capability we have. E-commerce-specific assets, for example, is
something that we're also bringing to market.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Tim mentioned that white paper price makes maybe about $30 million. But when I look at overall revenue
per ton in this segment, we've got only a couple of bucks, which implies that maybe overseas price/mix
was flat or even down. Can you talk about price/mix across your system, particularly outside the U.S. on
the white paper side?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

On white papers, Mark?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's just a little bit muffled coming through. So were you talking about looking forward, Mark?

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

No, I'm curious what's happening in the system right now. It looks like you got some gains in the U.S., but
you didn't really get much across the entire white paper business.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Well, I mean, all the regions, we're seeing price increases or realization of price increases in some
degree. Some of this in other regions started earlier in the year. So Russia was kind of on the forefront
earlier in the year, implementing a price increase, Brazil as well domestically. So those are -- they're
running their course and playing out. Where we still see traction is in North America and in some of the
export markets as well.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And Mark, just to switch gears completely, I'm curious what your position is on
this packaging stewardship legislation that we're starting to see as states try to create incentives to reduce
waste. You pointed to the growth in e-commerce, which some of these states are pointing to as part of
the problem. But how do you -- we know AF&PA is against containerboards being included. So how do you
think about containerboard industry responsibility? What should it be if the legislation should not apply to
you?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think if you look at the legislation in detail, there's a federal view that's kind of in its nascent
stage and there's a state-by-state view. And we are actively working in the state-by-state legislatures.
The big issue and the big goal of this extended producer responsibility-type legislation, it was really
targeted nonrecyclable or hard to recycle, in many cases, plastics. In some cases, that has led people to
believe all of packaging should be included. So the first thing is separating the facts of what corrugated
packaging can do. And actually, corrugated packaging could be a solution to the problem because of the
high recycling rates.

But that message has to get to policymakers, and we work very hard on that. I spend a fair amount of
my personal time talking to people about that. And in many cases, it's a new learning mark for people
at the local level that there is a completely different story on fiber-based packaging that's made from
the renewable resource and a high recycling rate in the 90% range versus many of the other substrate
choices. So I think that's the case we're making, that is actually part of the solution, not part of the

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

problem but as usual, in legislation sometimes it starts with a blanket, all packaging needs to be managed
in a different way and people need to be responsible for their packaging that they put out there when we
have a system.

So for example, we spend a lot of time, and it's in there right now, on the infrastructure work that
commerce is working on. In that bipartisan agreement they made yesterday, a significant amount of
investment in recycling networks in the country is part of that. We'll see if it stays in there. But that's the
answer is in improving recycling rates for easy-to-recycle and reuse materials. That's the value proposition
for corrugated packaging, not being included in the intent of some of that legislation.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Appreciating the winter storms was a big hit for you guys. But Tim or Mark, do you expect inventory
getting back to a more manageable level for containerboard in 3Q, where you'll be able to better capitalize
on the growth we're seeing and get operating costs back to a more normalized level? I think in the past,
you've always kind of targeted to grow faster than the market. But any color on kind of getting back on
track on that goal?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Philip, we think it will be steady progress. It won't be all solved in the third quarter. We think we'll make
steady progress through the second half of the year. We have targeted to grow at or slightly above the
market over time. We were really hampered in our ability to do that in the last couple of quarters because
of the issues you just mentioned. But we will definitely have more options available for incremental growth
as we go forward just based on the fact that we won't have so much of our system down for maintenance.
But it will take a slow, steady progress month-after-month through the second half.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So we should still expect you to lag the market a little bit in 3Q and obviously continue...

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Not necessarily. Part of what happens in 90 days, that's a pretty short period of time. Part of what
happens in the 90-day period is your segment exposure and what happens in the seasonality if you've
got more of this versus that. And so I think you shouldn't -- I wouldn't automatically assume we'll lag
the market. But I think it will take us the next second half of the year to get to the point where we feel
comfortable that our inventories are more sustainable. I think the first thing we'll see is we won't miss any
sales. The second thing we'll see is our costs will come down.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Super helpful. And then pulp prices, appreciating its volatile nature, it's commodity. Both softwood and
fluff pulp prices really surged this year. But the market appears to have softened up a bit. What's your
crystal ball saying in terms of pricing for fluff and softwood pulp globally? And do you have a view in terms
of how much inventory levels are in the channel? It's tougher to gauge, just given some of the logistical
omens you guys are seeing in the market.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. I mean, I wouldn't want to forecast price looking forward. I talked about how we think about it at the
moment, what we believe we're seeing. We're seeing a bit of a pullback in some of the markets. But our
view at the moment is that things are more stable and there's no -- and you have to look at not only the
underlying demand levels but at the transportation difficulties which are really, in effect, extending supply
chains at this point. So you're right, full commodity product, but our view at the moment is this is a bit of
a correction, not a complete turn.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Mark, one more on pulp and then I have a containerboard question. Just I appreciate your comments that
you expect segment margins to improve over the next several quarters. But when I look at the last 10
quarters, it's been a pretty tough slog for the business. And as Phil just said, prices in China have been
coming down of late. So I guess, what gives you confidence, just given what's happened over the past 2
to 3 years, that this is a business in which you have a meaningful competitive advantage?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, if you think about the remarks I made a couple of questions ago about what we're changing in the
business versus the last 10 months or the last 10 quarters, that's what gives me confidence that this is a
very value-creating material for our end-use customers, and we just haven't always extracted that proper
value that gives us a value-creating return. And that's what we're working on. I think the growth rate will
stay solid as economies around the world improves, so there's a growth component.

But we're going to run the business in a different way than it's been run before. When we made the
decision to invest in the business, it changes the profile of this being a legitimate first-rate business for
our company versus, in many cases, a smaller sideline type of business. And some of that's reflected in
some of the way the commercial agreements have been made, and we're working on changing that for the
better.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I appreciate that, Mark. And just one on box, and I think you mentioned earlier in the call that long term,
you think the market could be at the high end of that 1% to 2% range that you were talking about. I just
want to make sure I understand it. So let's say the market is up another 4% this year after 3.5% last
year. You're talking about kind of an 8% step change upward post pandemic in a market that had been
growing at 1% per annum. Are you thinking that we're going to keep -- stay at these higher levels and
grow on top of that? Or that there could be some correction as retail sales normalize and then we'll get
back to some kind of growth trend?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, it's hard to predict that with certainty, obviously. But we believe that part of what's
happening is the role that fiber-based packaging is playing in general commerce, driven by a few
segments, has taken a step change up. And so we think the base will be stronger. It depends on a lot of
things. And number one, the structure of the U.S. economy. And so if there is really action on some of the
things that are being learned now around supply chains and global issues with supply chains, and we do
have more manufacturing that actually occurs in the U.S. for certain components, I think that will bode
well for the business, and how strong the consumer is going forward coming out of this.

I think you're looking at maybe what's going to be close to 2 years of pent-up demand by consumers
because of the things that happened during the pandemic and how that plays out in consumption will play
a big role in what that growth rate is going to be. I think the data -- we have this model we use, I know

others have models, there's third parties that have models. A correlation around GDP has been slightly
less has been what's happened in the box market. And we think that will still stand. And it looks like we're
poised to have a stronger consumption-oriented GDP for at least as far as you can see right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn from RBC Capital.

Paul C. Quinn
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just a question on pulp. I understand you guys are making some operational improvements. And I'm just
trying to balance that with the Q3 guide here, where you've got ops and cost up $5 million. So is there
something on the cost side that's more than offsetting the operational improvement that you're seeing?
And then if you could give us sort of a scope as to what the big bogey is out there for 3 to 5 years out in
terms of the things that you guys can control, i.e., how much improvement do you expect that segment to
have over that period of time?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

On the longer-term part -- I'll ask Tim to look for that cost offset part of your question. But on the longer
term, we believe that the combination of how we operate, so in the manufacturing sector and the kind the
cost structure of our mill system, and I've said this before, especially the part that was the legacy IP mill
system, which is mostly converted mills from other products versus what we acquired with Weyerhaeuser,
which is mostly all built for purpose. So they tend to have a better efficiency and lower cost.

We've got opportunities to lower the cost, primarily in the legacy IP manufacturing system, coupled that
with the commercial arrangements, improvements that we're talking about and what we're doing now. You
put those two together, we should hit the margin structure and have a solidly -- a solid business above the
cost of capital with a slight growth potential. So that's what we are working on and we see a path to that.
It will be a steady path quarter-by-quarter and that's where we're headed. And the question on the cost
offset, Tim?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

It's modest, but it's really transportation. I mean, we're continuing to battle the transportation challenge.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

A big part of the transportation issue in this business, Paul, is the export port congestion much more
exposed to international [indiscernible] than the other businesses in the company.

Your next question comes from Neel Kumar from Morgan Stanley.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

You mentioned wood costs being higher sequentially partly because of the wet weather. Can you just give
us a sense of the magnitude of inflation you're seeing there? Has it started to be more of a 3Q issue? Or
could it carry over to the fourth quarter as well?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's -- I mean, it's really due to having access to the fiber and being able to get it out of the wood
based on the rainfall that we've had. So we look at a very long lead time in terms of how we manage with
inventories at mills and across basins. And it's really been the Gulf states that have been more heavily

impacted but some of the Southeastern mills as well. So it will depend on the weather as we go through
the rest of this quarter into the fourth. But our inventories are in decent shape, but they're a little on the
low side and it's just going to cost more to get the wood out and get into the mills. Transportation is not
helping either. I mean, we've referenced inbound materials and whatnot. And that's seemingly impacting
everything.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

All right. That's helpful. And then in terms of your maintenance outage expenses, you're now forecasting
$642 million for the full year. I know it's early, but I'm just curious how you're thinking about 2022
maintenance. Do you expect it to step down year-over-year or generally remain near 2021 levels?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Well, we're still working through that. I mean, I think a good way to look at it and the way I looked at it,
last year was an abnormally low year. This year is a little bit of out of range high year. When you put the
two of them together, it looks roughly in line. I mean, our outages can be anywhere from 500 -- to $500
million to a little bit less or maybe some years a little bit more, pushing $550 million. Last year, given
all the uncertainty we pulled back and curtailed, this year, we're catching up on some of those outages
from last year. So we put the two together, that's more normal. Next year, we'll -- we have to finish our
planning. We always provide that as we near the end of the year and look into the coming year.

Operator

Our last question for today comes from the line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank.

Kyle White
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I just wanted to talk about some of your end markets in corrugated packaging. How is e-commerce
performing relative to your initial expectations at the start of the quarter? Any slowdowns there that you
see? How is the recovery in foodservice going? Just any details on the end markets that you can provide.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

I think on e-commerce, no disappointment, still very, very strong. And then we're getting into the period
of the year where you start to build for the year-end demand increases as you move toward holiday
season, so still a very strong story. We're continuing to invest in that segment. Foodservice continuing
to improve. I guess, there's a question mark about what happens with the delta variant and COVID and
whether everything continues to open. I think a big question or a big potential upside is as schools and
events start to open, foodservice related to those, which obviously hasn't been opened during the summer,
is another potential upside. If that, in any way, shape or form, gets delayed, then foodservice growth
could slow a little bit.

The only segment that I think, and it's kind of predictable, that maybe saw some flattening was processed
foods. And I think it's directly related to the general opening of the economy and a little less stocking up of
kind of the center of the grocery store, if you will. So good strong performance across the key segments.
And we believe listening to our customers and looking at order patterns, that's continuing as we go into
the third quarter.

Kyle White
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then focusing on transportation, I know it's early, but when you look to next year, do
you see any relief or kind of stabilization in transportation costs? Or do you anticipate kind of continued
inflation headwinds? And is there anything internally maybe that you can do to provide some relief against
these costs?

19

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, internally, the best thing we can do on the cost side is to have our system optimized with the right
inventories. And what that means is make a product in the right factory so that the transportation cost
to the customer, or in the case of our Industrial Packaging business, our containerboard mill makes
containerboard for box plants that are nearby, not box plants that are all the way across the country. So
that's the #1 thing on cost that we can do internally. We don't have our own trucking company or anything
like that. It's about really optimizing our supply chain and any dramatic improvements we can make on
cost.

To your first part of your question, I don't know this for sure, but looking at what the analysts that follow
the transportation industry talk about is that there is a belief that labor and some of the impediments to
truck capacity and the training that's required to bring on more employees and more assets in the rail
industry will get better, that people will want to return to those industries. Many of those companies laid
off a lot of people. You can't just bring people back in rail.

There's required training and other things. Same thing for truck. And the belief is that, that will get better.
So capacity should get better. If the economy stays kind of red hot, it's a good problem to have, but then
I think capacity will get absorbed pretty quickly. So the jury now is that we think it's really disruptive right
now. Velocity is really slow for a lot of reasons. We think part of that, at least on the human labor side, will
get better.

Let me go ahead and wrap up. Just a couple of takeaways I would like to leave with investors. First, you
heard today that we are really positive on the strong momentum we're building for the second half in
both earnings and margin expansion. We're absolutely laser-focused on capital allocation and a balanced
approach to that. And we are in very good shape on all elements of our capital allocation framework. And
we're very excited about the prospects we have in front of us as we separate IP into two companies and
we work on building a better IP going forward.

So thank you for your interest in International Paper. We look forward to talking with all of you next
quarter.
