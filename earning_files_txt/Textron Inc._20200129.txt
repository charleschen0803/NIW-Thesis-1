Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Textron Earnings Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.

I will now turn the call over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Eric Salander. Please go
ahead, sir.

Eric Salander
Vice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call
today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC
filings and also in today's press release.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief
Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our
website.

Textron's revenues in the quarter were $4 billion, up $285 million from last year. During this year's fourth
quarter, we recorded $72 million in pretax special charges, largely related to Industrial and Textron
Aviation, or $0.24 per share after tax. Excluding these special charges, adjusted net income was $1.11
per share compared to $1.15 in last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension
contributions was $650 million, up $366 million from last year's fourth quarter.

For the full year, revenues were $13.6 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Adjusted net income was $3.74
per share compared to $3.34 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $642
million, down from $784 million last year.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were higher in the fourth quarter, primarily driven
by double-digit growth at Textron Aviation, Bell and Textron Systems. At Bell, revenues were up, largely
due to higher commercial deliveries of our 407, 429 and 505 models. We delivered 76 commercial
helicopters, up from 46 in last year's fourth quarter.

On the military side, the V-22 tiltrotor recently surpassed the milestone of 500,000 flight hours. With
more than 375 V-22 aircraft in operation across the U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force and Navy as well as
internationally with Japan, this increasingly large installed base continues to drive significant aftermarket
opportunities to support this highly utilized fleet.

In the fourth quarter, the Bell Boeing Program Office was awarded contracts totaling over $800 million
across multiple support activities, including $375 million to provide maintenance, repair and consumable
materials support to the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps operations; $218 million for logistics and
engineering support for aircraft across the U.S. Military fleet; $146 million as part of the Marine Corps
CCRAM modernization program; and $68 million for logistics and engineering support to Japan. They'll also
receive an $815 million, 5-year performance-based logistics contract for the U.S. Navy for upgrades to
their H-1 Yankee and Zulu aircraft.

On the new product front, Bell marked the second anniversary of V-280's first flight in December. In 2
years of its successful flight demonstrations, the aircraft has flown more than 160 hours to collect data
and inform requirements for the U.S. Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program. In December,

TEXTRON INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

the V-280 flew autonomously for the first time, meeting all of Bell's demonstration flight goals, including
automated takeoff and landing, conversion to cruise mode and precision navigation.

At Systems, revenues were up on higher volume, largely within our unmanned systems product line.
In the quarter, Textron Marine & Land Systems announced that its Ship-to-Shore Connector Craft 100
successfully completed acceptance trials with the U.S. Navy. Also in the quarter, Textron Systems ATAC
was selected as an authorized provider of contracted air adversary services for the U.S. Air Force Combat
Air Forces Contracted Air Support program. ATAC has also started flying its Mirage F1 fighters in support of
their current U.S. Navy contract.

Early in January, the U.S. Army announced its intention to award Textron Systems a contract for 4 Ripsaw
M5 vehicles as part of its robotic combat vehicle medium program.

Moving to Industrial, we recently completed our previously announced review of strategic alternatives for
our Kautex business unit. The review considered a range of options for the business. And after careful
consideration, we determined that the interest of our shareholders are best served with Kautex remaining
as part of Textron. At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we added additional independent dealers to our new
tracker distribution channel and saw continued retail volume growth in the quarter.

Moving to Textron Aviation, in the quarter, revenues were $1.7 billion, up 11%. We delivered 71 jets,
up from 63 last year, and 59 commercial turboprops, down from 67 last year's fourth quarter. We also
initiated deliveries of the new Citation Longitude with 13 aircraft in the quarter, including the first aircraft
delivered to NetJets.

I would now like to update you on the December 27 accident at our Wichita Plant 3 facility. First and
foremost, our #1 priority is the health and safety of our employees, and we're fortunate that all 12 engine
employees have been released from the hospital and are recovering.

From an operational standpoint, Cessna SkyCourier, located also in Plant 3, has been unaffected by the
accident, and that program is continuing on schedule. Just last month, we accomplished the successful
wingmate of the SkyCourier, a key milestone in the development of this new twin-utility turboprop.

The plant did incur significant damage, affecting our composite manufacturing operations, and we are
working to recover the entire facility. We do expect some disruptions to our production that will impact our
ability to complete and deliver aircraft in the first half of 2020, but we fully expect to recover by year-end
with no impact to our annual plan.

In December, we announced a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve overall operating efficiencies
through head count reductions and other actions. At Aviation, these actions largely included head count
reductions, reflecting the completion of a long period of new product development, resulting in the
entry into service of the Citation Latitude and, most recently, the Citation Longitude. These actions were
necessary to align our cost structure within the current operating environment as we ramp up production
of Longitude, anticipate lower legacy aircraft demand and reduce requirements for ongoing development
programs.

We also acquired Premier Aviation with its 3 locations in Australia, which has expanded our reach of
aftermarket services in the Asia Pacific region, reflecting our continued investment to support our
customers internationally. Within the Aviation aftermarket, increased volumes drove higher aftermarket
revenues, which were up over 13% from the prior year.

In summary, we have many items to highlight in 2019 across our segments. At Bell, we continue the
successful flight testing of the V-280 Valor, achieving a cruise speed of over 300 knots, improve the
aircraft maneuverability and pitch, roll and yaw to the Army's highest standards for aircraft agility. We
also unveiled the Bell 360 Invictus, our offering for the U.S. Army's future attack reconnaissance aircraft
competition.

On Bell's commercial business, we saw higher deliveries from increased order demand we've seen over the
last 1.5 years.

TEXTRON INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

At Textron Systems, we had wins on several key development programs, including Ripsaw M5 selected
for the Army's Robotic Combat Vehicle program; Aerosonde HQ selected for Phase 1 of the Army's Future
Tactical UAS program; ATAC selected to participate in the Air Force CAPCAS program; and we were down-
selected to continue in the Army's Next-Generation Squad Weapons Program.

Within TSV, we launched a new distribution channel through our partnership with Bass Pro Shops and
Cabela's and independent TRACKER Marine dealers. We also implemented a new business model to better
align production with demand in our snow business, and we expect both actions to drive both growth and
improve performance in the outdoor powersports business.

Textron Aviation, we certified and began deliveries of our new Citation Longitude and advanced
development of 2 new turboprop programs, the Cessna SkyCourier and Denali. With this backdrop, we're
projecting revenues of about $14 billion for Textron's 2020 financial guidance. At Bell, we're expecting
continued strong execution in 2020 with lower military production, offset by higher military aftermarket
and higher commercial volumes.

At Systems, we're expecting modest revenue growth, partially driven by the 2019 new program wins
highlighted earlier. At Industrial, we'll maintain our focus on our vehicle business in 2020 as we continue
to improve execution and drive improved profitability.

At Aviation, we are projecting growth from the increased deliveries of our new Citation Longitude aircraft,
partially offset by lower legacy demand. We are projecting EPS in the range of $3.50 to $3.70 per share.
Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $700 million to
$800 million.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $340 million, down $57
million from the fourth quarter of 2018 on a $285 million increase in revenues.

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron
Aviation of $1.7 billion were up 11%, primarily due to higher volume and mix, largely reflecting the
Longitude's entry into service. Segment profit was $134 million in the fourth quarter, down from $170
million a year ago, primarily due to the mix of products sold and an unfavorable impact from inflation, net
of pricing.

The resulting margin dilution in the quarter from the mix of aircraft sold was largely due to the initial
Longitude deliveries and the associated higher cost basis that included rework for modifications required
by the final type certification and lower legacy deliveries. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at
$1.7 billion.

Moving to Bell. Revenues were $961 million, up 16% from $827 million last year, primarily on higher
commercial volume. Segment profit of $118 million was up $10 million, largely on the higher commercial
volume. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $6.9 billion.

At Textron Systems, revenues were $399 million, up 16% from $345 million a year ago, primarily due
to higher volume. Segment profit of $33 million was down $4 million, primarily due to unfavorable
performance, partially offset by the higher volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at
$1.2 billion.

Industrial revenues of $927 million decreased $81 million, largely related to lower volume and mix at
Textron Specialized Vehicles, principally due to the shift in the timing of snow sales to the third quarter of
2019, reflecting the new business model that was implemented earlier this year. Segment profit was $44
million compared to $73 million a year ago, largely due to volume at Kautex -- lower volume at Kautex
and the shift in volume at TSV, partially offset by favorable performance in price at TSV.

TEXTRON INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Finance segment revenues increased $1 million and profit increased $2 million. Moving below segment
profit, corporate expenses were $22 million, and interest expense was $36 million.

With respect to our restructuring plan, we recorded pretax special charges of $72 million in the
quarter. We ended the year with manufacturing debt of $3.1 billion. For the full year, we repurchased
approximately 10 million shares at an overall cost of $503 million.

Turning now to our 2020 outlook. I'll begin with our segments on Slide 9 of the earnings call presentation.
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $5.4 billion, reflecting higher Longitude
deliveries, partially offset by lower legacy deliveries. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8%,
reflecting the dilution related to higher inventory costs and learning curve associated with the increased
Longitude deliveries and lower legacy volume.

Looking to Bell, we expect overall revenues of about $3.3 billion. We're forecasting a margin of about
12.5%, largely reflecting a change in mix of military volume. At Systems, we're estimating higher 2020
revenues of about $1.5 billion. Segment margin is expected to be about 10.5%.

At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.8 billion and a margin of about 6.5%. At
Finance, we are forecasting segment profit of about $20 million.

Turning to Slide 10. We're estimating 2020 pension cost to be about $33 million versus pension income of
$11 million last year.

Turning to Slide 11. R&D is expected to be about $550 million, down from $647 million in 2019. We're
estimating CapEx will be about $360 million, up from $339 million last year.

Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $135 million of corporate
expense, $135 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18.5%.
Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the
majority of our free cash flow towards share repurchases in 2020.
That concludes our prepared remarks. So Kevin, we can open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question in queue is from the line of Peter Arment of Baird.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Scott, I guess, I'll just start high level, I guess, on Aviation. Just talking about the outlook, it feels like
with the Longitude ramping and finally getting across the goal line, that's a big step forward, but just kind
of I see the legacy rates coming down. What's kind of -- is there an expectation on kind of unit volume
you expect for 2020?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

I think, overall, unit volume will be fairly flat, Peter. So it's -- from a -- on a unit number, we'll have clearly
more -- a lot more Longitudes. So the revenue guide is obviously up. But as I said, the unit volumes will
be kind of flattish. We'll just have higher unit revenues driven by the fact that we'll have a significant mix
of Longitudes.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then just on the Longitude itself, there was expectation that this was going to help a lot on
the factory absorption side. Is there just a point in time or an inflection where we get through kind of the
learning curves? What's your expectations around that?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Clearly. Look, we have the first quarter, first -- in the -- really most of the first half, we'll be selling
a lot of the aircraft that we were fabricating late last year. Obviously, a number of those have a lot of the
rework that was basically inventoried and we'll deliver here, particularly in the first quarter. The learning
curve is going well. But for sure, we'll expect to see a more normalized margin rate on Longitude as we
get into the back half of the year.

So that's -- the challenge in terms of the mix side is -- are going through sort of moving the aircraft that
have incurred a fair bit of rework associated with the certification process and then get the learning curve
under our belt, which we feel good about in terms of the early fabs and all the feeder lines that are coming
into final. But we'll really start to see those aircraft that we're going to deliver in the second half of the
year hitting the final assembly line here as we get into the first half.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And just lastly, on just overall demand in biz jets, just what's your current take? And we've been --
obviously, you've been -- had some fits and starts with the trade and kind of the stresses last year. Can
you maybe give us your overall environment?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, I think it's pretty consistent with what we've talked about going into the third quarter. The Longitude,
obviously, being a brand-new product and very well received in the market, we feel good about how that's
going. And clearly, a new product like that will drive some demand activity, which is great.

TEXTRON INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

On the legacy side, things continue to be sort of flat to down. As we've talked about in the third quarter,
our approach here is that we would lower our volumes, bring back some of our production capacity and
make sure that we don't have to get in a situation where we've got a bunch of excess aircraft and start to
drive pricing activity.

So I think we're -- we made those adjustments going into the fourth quarter, and I think we'll hold those
-- from our perspective at this point, we'll hold that through 2020. If something starts to change or we see
things strengthen, there's certainly a lot of conversation, Peter, it's not like the market is not out there.
But getting people to commit has been a little bit softer, and we saw that through the whole back half of
2019. So I think the market is -- has been pretty stable here for the last 3 to 6 months.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Sheila K of Jefferies.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Dropping my last name. So I just -- I wanted to follow up quickly on Peter's question. You had 7.8%
margins in the fourth quarter, 13 Longitudes out the door. So when we think about the quarterly Aviation
margin cadence, does it dip below that in the first half and also putting the incident in Plant 3 into the
picture, too? So is this the kind of -- do we expect a steeper drop in the first half?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So look, I mean we don't normally go into a quarterly kind of progression. But considering,
particularly with the impact of Plant 3, I think that we will probably be somewhere in the 10 to 15
aircraft light in Q1 and Q2. We're still in the process of finalizing and understanding all the tooling, which
everything appears to be repairable, but it will take some time to get the composite operation back up and
running.

So given that and the progression we just talked about with Peter on the margin kind of going from a
tougher margin on Longitudes and becoming more normalized as we get -- sort of exiting 2020, I think
the progression of Aviation is going to start the year sort of low-single digit in Q1. It's going to move to a
mid-single digit in Q2 and then high-single digit Q3 and double-digit Q4. And that's -- again, that's really
normal. We don't kind of go into that level of detail, but I think we have to make sure people understand
that we are going to have lighter deliveries in Q1, Q2, driven by this composite factory issue. And that,
compounded with the change of margin rate of Longitudes through the course of the year, will give us that
sort of progression.

So it's, again, a full year sort of impact and I think consistent with the guide that we've given you, but we
clearly expect that Q3, Q4 are going to be at the more normalized margin rates that we expect out of this
business. But it will be light in Q1, Q2, given the Longitude mix and the light deliveries, frankly, of a lot of
the legacy aircraft impacted by the Plant 3 situation.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's pretty clear, and sorry for all that detail on the quarter. But bigger-picture question, you
decided to keep Kautex. I guess what was the rationale behind deciding to keep it? And you've also
announced some restructuring for 2 years in a row now. Where is that business today? And what brings
the profitability levels back up to that 6.5% range that you're guiding to?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, look, Kautex, as we've always talked about, is a good business. It's been a good cash generator for
us. It generates a very good ROIC, solid returns. And what we were asked and sort of heard from a lot
of investors that maybe this is something that within the portfolio holds back our P/E and our ability to

9

TEXTRON INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

generate a better stock price. So we said, look, we're going to go look at this. We went into the process
knowing that considering the profitability of that business and sort of where things were in the automotive
sector, that we would probably see some dilution, but some dilution versus a potential re-rate on the
multiple could result in something good for our shareholders.

As we went through the process, the reality was that what was the pricing in terms of what anyone would
be willing to pay for that business right now would have created a level of dilution that there's no way, in
our view, would have created enough of a re-rate on the multiple that would be good for our shareholders.
So we went through the process. It was very rigorous. We looked at a lot of different alternatives and
options. And in the end, there was no way for us to get our head around this being something that would
be accretive for our shareholders.

And again, it's a good business. It generates good cash, it generates good earnings. Look, we're also
sitting at kind of a low part of an automotive cycle, but that team has done a really nice job of managing
through that, and it has stayed a solid business. Obviously, we did some restructuring because we think
that there's -- you're probably towards the bottom of the auto cycle, but it's not going to come snapping
back. So we wanted to make sure that we made sure we adjusted the right costs so that as we go through
a period of, relatively speaking, lower volumes, we maintain good margins in the business. And I think
we'll do that.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research.

Eric Salander
Vice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Carter, are you there?

Operator

Okay. Mr. Copeland, your line is open.

Eric Salander
Vice President of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Why don't we go to the next one, Kevin?

Operator

Next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski.

Peter John Skibitski
Alembic Global Advisors

Scott, sorry to beat on this, but -- so the Plant 3 issue, that's more of a revenue issue in the first half than
a margin issue? Am I understanding that right? And so the margin pressure in 2020 is almost wholly due
to the Longitude? Is that accurate?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

No, Pete. I think that the lower volume, obviously, in Q1, Q2, considering that we period expensed all
of our R&D and our SG&A, I mean our costs are going to be more evenly spread over the course of the
year. So when you pull 10 or 15 aircraft out, that's a big chunk of revenue. And particularly, it's a lot of
our legacy good margin business. So I think that it's a combination of both the progression of Longitude
profitability through the course of the year. But the Q1, Q2 impact of missing that revenue is not trivial.
And that's why I thought it would help to try to guide what we expect that margin rate to look like through
the course of the year.

TEXTRON INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Alembic Global Advisors

Yes. No, no, that's helpful. And so if things stay on track, I know you said in the past you want this
business to be a double-digit business, is there any reason to think that can't be true in 2021, assuming
these -- obviously, you've got a blurring curve on Longitude, but -- and assuming Plant 3 doesn't happen
again?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Look, I want to be careful, Pete. We're not quite ready to guide 2021 just yet. But yes, well, look, as
you get into the third and fourth quarter, I would expect to see margin rates in Aviation that are indicative
of how that business should perform in a normal place. And as I said, that should be in that high single-
digit to low double-digit range.

Operator

Next question is from the line -- one moment, please. That is David Strauss of Barclays.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

You noted in Q4 at Aviation, inflation net of pricing was a headwind. Could you maybe break the pieces out
there, inflation versus pricing? And then also how you're thinking or what you've got baked in for inflation
versus pricing in the 2020 guide for Aviation?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

So the -- I mean the dynamic in Q4 was price was pretty flattish, and so that's why we have a negative
because clearly, there was some inflation in Q4 and we didn't have price to offset that. So it was fairly
flat. Again, part of our dynamic and rationale for pulling back on the volume, particularly on those legacy
aircraft, is to make sure that we can maintain the price levels that we have in the industry. So I don't think
we'll probably get into breaking out sort of the components of the guide around the price inflation number.
But clearly, we would like to drive to get that back in balance.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And following up on a question on a couple of quarters I -- ago I asked was on the potential upside
from MAX simulators. Obviously, now it looks like there's going to be mandatory simulator training. Could
you just talk about what you see maybe in terms of order interest there and potential upside from this?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we have certainly continued to see order interest. And I think particularly now with what you've seen
out there publicly around the need for MAX sim training in some capacity associated with their return to
service, that's picking up. So we've largely been following the lead of Boeing, who is our biggest customer
in this space. And we are going to increase the number of MAX simulators that we have in production. So I
think that's good. But look, for our total company, it's not going to be a material impact, but it is -- we will
certainly see a little bit of an upside on the number of MAX sims.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of, one moment, please, Jon Raviv of Citi.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Just to, apologies, here jump back to the Aviation margin, I mean, I appreciate that high single digit,
low double digit in the second half is normative. But really just still thinking about the overall underlying

earnings power of this business, I mean, at some point, we were always thinking that this could be a
pretty strong incremental margin business. Clearly, with the rates down, you'd need some of that this
year. But as you kind of reemerge, I don't know, what could be a tough year this year, given the -- some
of the dynamics, is it still fair to think about this as a double-digit type business going forward, given some
of the changes you've made?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, absolutely. That's our expectation. And I think that, look, we're -- we've -- we obviously had a fair
bit of dilution here in Q4 and expect that in the first half of next year. I mean if you set the Plant 3 thing
aside, which is an unusual circumstance obviously, Longitude, we fully expect to be a strong margin
product. It's an outstanding product. We've got a bunch of them in the field now. It's been well received
by customers. It's flying beautifully. Feedback on those who've taken delivery, several customers who are
flying this thing hard, is outstanding.

So I think this thing is going to be a great part of the business. But clearly, there was a lot more cost in
2019 in getting through the certification process and all that was entailed there. And we still have costs
as we go into 2020 in pursuit of certifications around the world and the entry into service. There's always
some costs associated with these things as you roll them out into the marketplace. But this thing is going
to be an outstanding product. It's going to be a product that has the kind of margin rates that we expect
across our jet line. And this is a transient problem. I think we end up in a very good place, and we have
very good expectation for this business to be a double-digit margin business.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then you talked about how some of the restructuring is based on lower development plans going
forward. Something I think has helped you guys recently is investing in new products and the ability to
drive some growth in what could be a flattish market. And how do you think about that going forward?
And there's still parts of your portfolio. Some would suggest, it could use some upgrades here and there.
So how are you thinking about the skyline beyond SkyCourier and Denali?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Look, I think if you look at the product portfolio right now in Aviation, obviously, the last 5 years of driving
Latitude and Longitude have completely transformed our jet product line and position us in a very good
place. When you think about the SkyCourier, which is a fabulous product in a new market segment for us,
really, it's going to be a great growth driver. We've not been in the high-performance single. That's our
rationale for Denali's great market, which I think will get very good [ participation ].

Beyond that, we obviously always have some things that we're looking at. I think there's clearly
opportunities to do some upgrades and refreshes across some of the core of the rest of our product line
in both the jet and the turboprop side of things. And so we'll pursue those. They just won't be of the
magnitude of a clean-sheet, brand-new airplane like a Latitude or a Longitude. So when we talk about
pulling back on some of the R&D, I think that's just reflecting that you don't have 2 major Part 25 aircraft
that are in process. So I think we'll continue to have a robust product lineup, both in the SkyCourier,
Denali and other upgrades. So I'm not at all concerned that we're going to underwhelm the R&D side. We
know you have to do and refresh products to continue to drive growth here.

The same is true across the rest of our portfolio. I mean we've obviously made massive investments in
things like the V-280 program, the 525 program, put a lot of money into the FARA program. You'll actually
see some R&D come down in that business as we go into next year, but that's really driven because you
have things like FLRAA and FARA that have been virtually all funded under IR&D that will now start to
move into a larger cost share on the -- on a couple of government programs. And clearly, 525 is winding
down in terms of the level of R&D to support its certification. So those are -- those 2 businesses drive the
bulk of our R&D.

Obviously, Systems, it's just a smaller number but still, if you look at things that are the new programs,
that are happening and starting to drive growth, which we're seeing in 2020, it's as a result of the
investments that we've been making in some of those product lines around everything from the next
generation of unmanned air vehicles like FTUAS. I mean, obviously, Ship to Shore was a huge investment.
As that turns to production, that's going to help to drive some growth and much improved profitability. The
M5, this RCV is -- again, this is a lot of R&D that we've been putting into these businesses and, in some
cases, small acquisitions over the last few years that are starting to turn around and drive growth in these
businesses.

Our next question is from the line, one moment, please, of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.

Seth Michael Seifman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Scott, when you talked about the outlook being for flattish overall delivery volumes, with Longitude adding
and the legacy portfolio coming down, I mean there's generally not a ton of visibility. Is that expected
decline in the legacy portfolio kind of a view of what you're seeing in the spot market? Or is it the majority
of Latitude deliveries go to one customer and that customer is changing its mix of deliveries from Cessna?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

I'm not sure I understand entirely, Seth. I mean the...

Seth Michael Seifman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Basically, if legacy deliveries are coming down, a lot of the legacy deliveries are Latitudes to NetJets. Is
NetJets coming down significantly and making a transformation from Latitude to Longitude, and that's
why legacy deliveries are down? Or is it your sense of the spot market being weaker and that's why legacy
deliveries are down?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think in general, as we talked about in Q3, we expect legacy deliveries just to be down given the
outlook of the overall market. You're right, when you look at the Latitude, yes, we do expect lower levels
of deliveries in NetJets on Latitudes next year versus this year. And you're right, I mean I'm not -- I don't
think it's a necessary trade. Just where the market is right now. With Longitude coming as a brand-new
product, you see a lot more deliveries to NetJets of the Longitude-class aircraft in 2020. So yes -- I mean,
you're right, there's a -- there are certainly -- we certainly expect to deliver fewer Latitudes next year to
NetJets than we have previously, but the dynamic of the legacy is a just a somewhat softer market, not
inconsistent with how we saw it back in Q3.

Seth Michael Seifman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, understood. Understood. And then on the -- at Bell, you've kind of traditionally talked about Bell as
a 10% to 12% margin business, starting the guide this year at 12.5%. I mean the business has executed
very well for probably like 5 years or so now. Is the baseline margin for Bell kind of maybe higher than
you thought?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Look, I would still say we're in that 10% to 12% range, right? So I think at 12.5%, obviously, it's a very
strong performance for that business. We feel very good about it, particularly we still have a very high
level of R&D. Again, we will benefit a little bit from having higher levels of cost share as we move some

of the military programs into -- initiate real military acquisition programs as opposed to straight IRAD-
funded. But yes, look, I think the position that Bell is in right now is quite strong.

If you had a large EMD program, which tends to be a lower margin, that's going to mix it down a little
bit. But I think you're going to stay in that 12 -- 10% to 12% margin rate even in that circumstance,
which obviously would be a terrific news story, right, that you're driving a -- what will be a very large EMD
program with a lot of future growth in the production phase. So I would kind of leave that 10%, 12% out
there.

And next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn of Crédit Suisse.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wanted to, Scott, to go to a -- back to the higher-level view here. And you touched on valuation and
your desire to improve it when you were answering Sheila's question on Kautex and disposition. And I
wanted to go to the valuation and think about cash flows. You've got sales growth in 2020, but we've gone
through a period here, let's say, from '18 to '20, where earnings and cash flows have been somewhat
flattish, and that's the case in the forecast. Again, you've talked about a number of the reasons. What
needs to happen to get the cash flow return on sales above this kind of 5% level? Other than learning
curve on Longitude and some of the other puts and takes you've talked about, what is the potential for
this business?

And then separately for Frank, just regarding the extra week, I guess, in the fourth quarter and in the
year, how does that play out in 2020? Are we back to where we were?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, let me take it from a high level, okay? The -- we've had Bell that has gone over the last few years
from a $4.5 billion business in the peak of the V-22 world down to $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion business, at the
same time that it's been investing heavily in things like 525 and things like V-280. And obviously, V-22 has
done a significant ramp down from the 40 a year to 20 a year to low double digit a year.

So I think our focus in that business has been making sure that we're investing for the future while still
maintaining strong execution and strong margin rates. And I think we've been able to do that. And I
certainly think we're at a point here. As we go forward into 2020, there's some really important milestones
around where the acquisition process goes on things like the V-280 program finally going through and
completing certs on 525. So things that have been costs with no revenue or margin over the last few
years have certainly been pressure points, right? So the margin has stayed good, but the absolute number
has certainly come down owing to the reduced revenue. But I think we're in a really, really good place to
see that turn here as we go through the next few years. Systems is a smaller part of this...

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

You see, the revenue -- the -- you get the revenue turn a little bit here. You've got decent revenue growth
in 2020. Are you saying you catch up on the other end, '21, '22?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Absolutely. Look, I think, as we said, part of what we see here in the interim on Bell is this transition from
unit deliveries to a very large and growing installed base, which starts to drive more aftermarket. And
that's what we're seeing. What's driving the growth in 2020 is that you're starting to see this significant
growth in the aftermarket side of the business, largely military, but also some on the commercial side,
owing to the fact that we have a very large installed base now out there on the V-22 and the H-1

programs. What really then will drive that next tranche of growth is driven around some of these new
platforms in which we've been investing, like the V-280s and the 525s. So that is the dynamic in Bell.

Systems is a similar story, right? We had some great platforms, the platforms that were sort of on the
downside of their program of record as they phased out. But you'll start to see the new program wins.
Again, the investments that we've been making that are now positioned and are awarding and winning
some of these contracts, that will get that thing back to where we see revenue growth in the business.

Look, I think Systems this year delivering 10-plus percent margins, forecasting 10-plus percent margins,
that's a good business. The issue for us has been to get the overall business to start to drive positive
revenue, and we're going to see that in 2020, as we've guided and talked about. So I think that one is
already making that turn.

Aviation, again, we've gone through a very heavy period of investment that has resulted in the Latitudes,
the Longitudes. It's been frustrating to see that sort of, in many cases, to sort of replace legacy platforms.
But without having that portfolio with the Latitude and Longitude, you'd be in a really tough spot. So I feel
great about where that business is positioned. The team has historically executed very well. As we have
just withdrawn production, obviously, we have a challenge around Longitude of just getting those margins
where they need to be, but we clearly have a line of sight to get there as we work our way through 2020.

Obviously, that business is much more dependent on what does the end market do beyond 2020 to
2021, and we have no idea how to make that call yet. But I think we have a really good product lineup
and a couple of other things in the pipeline, obviously, that will help that. So our earnings have been
growing, but we've had too much pressure on not enough revenue growth. And I think we're seeing where
the opportunities are here in 2020, as we saw at the end of 2019, that we can get the top line to start
growing.

Next question is from the line of Noah Poponak, Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Scott, any new revelations into why the business jet market deteriorated over the last 3 to 6 months? And
specifically, why used inventory keeps going back up every month? You just typically don't see this in the
middle of an economic cycle. Is it just PMIs have been weak and global growth just hasn't broken out, and
it's as simple as that? Or anything new you've learned there?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Look, I don't think we've seen as much growth over the last 6 months. I think there's certainly been
plenty of reasons for small to midsized business guys, which is the bulk of our customer base in the jet
market, to have some pause and, look, you've seen this in CapEx spending, right? They've been holding
back a little bit. So I think as some of the trade things are starting to get a little bit -- that noise is sort
of settling down, the Brexit noise, which again I don't -- it shouldn't have a huge direct impact on it, but
it does create uncertainty in the market, that seems like it's on a path to at least becoming resolved and
certain.

And look, we're in the middle of a very political cycle right now. So I think as we work our way through
the year and politics and where things are going to land become more clearer, then I'd be optimistic that
businesses would get back to a more aggressive move in terms of willingness to spend CapEx and invest
in their businesses, not just in aircraft, but in general, which is certainly what drove a lot of the growth if
you went back into the late '17 or early part of '18. So we're hopeful that, that happens, but we need to
see that happen.

Do your customers specify to you that an election is particularly concerning to them and kind of puts them
on pause or not necessarily?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

I'd rather not get into the politics of it, Noah. But I mean, certainly, there's differing views about what the
business climate looks like depending on the outcome of the election. So it's kind of natural that there'd be
some reflection on that with people that are business people.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Yes. And then, Frank, on the cash flow outlook for 2020, can you help us out with the net Longitude-
related working capital assumption you're making in there? Because I think you had a decent amount to
unwind, but you're also still ramping the production rate. So I would just like to understand that piece and
then, therefore, the underlying total company piece outside of that.

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean kind of overall, the guide, at least at the upper end, reflects one-to-one cash conversion
on net income. So we're generally expecting good working capital performance. There isn't anything
extraordinary in there, kind of relative to Longitude. They kind of continue to expect maybe some ramp in
the Longitude, but there's nothing significant from a working capital standpoint kind of embedded in that
guide.

It's to say that, kind of certainly '19, we did work our way through all the headwind associated with
Multiyear II transitioning to Multiyear III. So as it relates to 2019 cash performance, we absorbed
hundreds of millions of dollars of that reversal in 2019 that did kind of reflect on that '19 performance
and kind of we put that behind us as we move into '20. So we're expecting that we'll see good cash flow
performance in '20.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I thought you had been saying '19 was pretty substantially impacted by Longitude buildup and that, that
would release beyond '19?

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Well, there's some of that. But kind of there's -- you can see some inventory build. There's kind of
payables from an overall working capital standpoint that also go to offset some of that build. The biggest
drag on '19 was this -- at Bell with the kind of government payments timing, where we were kind of ahead
on Multiyear II and then we -- Multiyear III structure has us kind of incurring cost before we received
cash. And so that was a big reversal that impacted '19 that we will not see in '20.

And next question is from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Scott, first of all, on the business jet pricing environment, I was wondering if you're seeing any of your
competitors acting in an even more irrational manner in response to the demand environment? Or perhaps
you're seeing any change in response to the Longitude and its entry into service?

TEXTRON INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Well, in general, I guess I don't know that we've seen a huge change, Robert. This is -- again, I think
we probably all want to be cautious about making sure that we're not running production greater than
demand, right? That always will create some bad behavior in the market. Of course, it's always the other
guy, right? So that's -- we just want to make sure we're not participating in that process. And look, I
think we have fought to get pricing back to a reasonable level that represents the value of the product.
And I think we got that back over that '17, '18 time frame. So we just want to make sure that we hold
pricing and get increases that are reflective of inflation going on, right? It's a perfectly reasonable business
position to take, I think.

So I think in general, that's -- the overall dynamic is the way we see it and how we think we should
behave. Look, Longitude pricing, I'd say we're -- I think we're pleased with that. We're getting the value
that we expect to get from an aircraft that's performing very well. Customers love the cabin, the range,
the speed, and the price levels in there are appropriate. And we're continuing to make sure that we're
getting the right value of aircraft. So...

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then as a follow-up -- and on different matter, actually, on Kautex and the decision there to not
sell the business. If the automotive environment were to improve, multiples were to move higher, would
you reconsider this sale in the future?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Look, I don't think we will make -- we don't make any comments about M&A, right? Look, we went out
and we had to do this in a public way, which was very difficult, as you can imagine, on our team to go
through that. But I mean our general view is we don't really want to forecast or comment one way or the
other on M&A. And I think given where we are in that process, we'll go back to that practice. So it's a good
business. It does really well for us, and we're going to focus on running it.

And next we have George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Scott, I was just wondering, we had talked about if the economic environment got more stable towards
the end of the year that you would see some improvement in the business. It sounds like from your
comments that you haven't, and I was just wondering why you might think that is. I mean we certainly
have a pretty good environment, economic- and stock market-wise.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, George, I don't know. I mean I can't -- I'm not trying to be an economic forecaster, but I think
there's still a fair bit of uncertainty. And a lot of it at this point is -- I think the trade things seem like
they're quieting down. But look, there's still enormous amount of political uncertainty that is in front of
us every day. So I think in large part, people want to see how all this plays out. It makes a big difference
when you think about tax policies and things of that nature.

So I think that -- look, the market hasn't stopped. There's still a fair bit of activity going on. There's lots
of conversations going on, but it's -- I think that it still does -- that uncertainty does create some friction
to people going ahead and doing a deal. And that's why, again, that's why we pulled back a little bit on
production. And we're -- our position is that customers are going to make their decision. We're not going
to use price to try to go accelerate the decisions if they don't want to make that decision yet.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Okay. And Frank, one for you. The inventories were up like $250 million for the year. I mean -- so what is
still an inventory that effectively wasn't delivered in the fourth quarter?

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Well, that's across the entirety of the corporation, George. But again, that's -- we are ramping Longitude,
and so there is additional inventory at Aviation that reflects that ramp.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

I was just wondering because the cash flow turned out a little bit weaker than you were expecting, and so
I thought maybe there's something else going on there.

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

No. Cash flow was right in the middle of our guide. And kind of, again, as I said before, the cash flow is
impacted certainly for the year by a significant headwind at Bell associated with military programs.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

And then, I guess, one last one. The profit mix at Industrial between special and Kautex, you alluded to
the -- in the release that it was primarily special vehicles. If Kautex wasn't down much, it would imply that
special vehicles didn't earn much in the quarter. I mean is that a correct assumption? And if so, if you can
expand on why?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, look, George, we don't -- generally, we don't get into the margin mix in the segment. I think the
commentary was that as it relates to vehicles, we certainly had a lower volume year-over-year. And as
Frank said, a big part of that was snow because we delivered snow product largely in Q3 versus Q4 a year
ago, and we should be delivering them in Q3. So it's a good thing that we did them in Q3 versus Q4. So
the overall volume was lower, which certainly has an impact on margin. But we don't -- we're not going to
break out any more detail on the margin splits between the different subsegments.

the chance that you will be spending some of your own money? And I know the dollars that they have
for you are not huge, but you'll be spending some of your own money, and therefore, that would be an
earnings drag because you want to win what's really a very sizable potential.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

So our guide incorporates that, Cai. So we have been spending our IRAD money with really no match on
FARA and little match over the years on FLRAA. There certainly has been some government money on the
V-280 program. But again, largely, that's been funded through our IRAD numbers. So what we have in
our plans, as you look at 2020, the amount of R&D actually increases in Bell. But you have a much higher
level of participation of government co-funding than we had just under straight IRAD funding. So it takes
something like a FARA.

And look, FARA, I think they will down-select to the 2 companies to go do the flyoff. We expect that
to be in the February to March time frame, is what they're saying. But look, we love our offering, and
we've talked a lot about thinking that this is a fabulous performance. It clearly meets their requirements.
We think it's taking great new technology that we matured on 525. The Army, remember the way
they're running that program is they provide a few very high-level critical requirements, but they're not
prescriptive in terms of how you accomplish that. So the down-select process from 5 to 2 will happen,
again, probably in that February, March time frame.

If it does happen, we will have a lot more R&D effort in the business, but it will actually be less R&D in
terms of IRAD than we spent in previous periods because, again, you do have a very large portion of
government cost share where we had none before on that program. So it's relatively neutral to the overall
plan even though it's a lot more R&D because of the dynamic of the cost share.

The FLRAA program, again, you're right, this is -- the anticipation is that it's sometime probably in the
March time frame. What they're saying is they would award 2 contracts in all likelihood. They don't say
it has to be 2, but sort of the expectation, I suppose, that it's 2. With V-280, we obviously have the
expectation that we would be one of those. That's not a huge program because it really is going through
and sort of crossing T's and dotting I's and working on risk reduction towards the ultimate EMD or OTA
decision, which is probably still in late 2021, is what they're saying. So that's not a big mover for us one
way or the other in the year, but the FARA program is. But again, it's not a headwind because you're --
even though you have a much higher level of R&D on that program, it does have a large cost share.

Cai von Rumohr
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Terrific. Great answer. And then second one, the coronavirus clearly becoming a bigger issue. Have you
done any preliminary thinking in terms of what this might mean, i.e., taking a look at 2003 and the SARS
virus? And was this a benefit to biz jets because people didn't want to travel on public air transport or
were not allowed to? Was this a negative? What does it do for Bell? What are your thoughts?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Cai, it's a good question. Look, I'm not going back to 2003 to try to do that. So I don't know that I --
I certainly don't know the answer to that question. I mean in terms of a direct impact to the company, we
-- obviously, we do business in China, largely in the automotive side. So of course, automotive volumes
have already been down pretty dramatically in the last couple of years. So whether it has a further impact
on that or not is hard to tell. And I think, look, like everyone, we've got to watch and wait to see what
happens here after they get through the Chinese New Year. And does this thing get contained and start to
settle down? Or does it become a bigger problem? So at this point, I think we're more or less in a watch
and wait.

that in terms of what you see as the relative risks and opportunities for the corporation?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, look, Carter, I mean the genesis of that thing is that for many, many years, this company has been
on a long-term plan that kind of rolled through 3 years, okay? So it was a 3-year plan that had TSR as
kind of a wrapper, if you will, around that 3-year performance. So TSR was absolutely a factor, but the
goals and objectives were set annually. And that really stems back to just enormous volatility around
business jets and can you really put together a 3-year plan that has any credibility to it.

So the new plan, obviously, still has TSR. It has it as a direct factor as opposed to a wraparound. So it
remains a very important part of our performance objectives and, ultimately, our compensation. But we
were -- try to put together something that could do a 3-year forecasted plan rather than a series of 1-
year plans that built that 3-year plan. So -- and we try to do longer-term metrics like things around ROICs
and long-term cash. And just -- we just have to adapt and consider a lot of unknown around -- one of
the fact that one of our biggest businesses is a biz jet business where it's just hard to predict what that
end market looks like over a period of 3 years. So I think we've come up with a set of metrics that can
accommodate some of that volatility and have a more conforming, if you will, 3-year plan, of which TSR
still remains an important metric.

Eric Salander
