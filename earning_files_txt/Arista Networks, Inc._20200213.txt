Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the
Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Curtis Mckee, Director of Corporate and Investor Development. Sir, you
may begin.

Curtis McKee
Head of Corporate & Investor Development

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are
Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer; Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial
Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal fourth
quarter ending December 31, 2019. If you'd like a copy of this release, you can access it online on the
company's website.

During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks' management will make forward-looking
statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year,
longer-term financial outlooks, industry innovation, our market opportunity, the benefits of recent
acquisitions and the impact of litigation, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in
detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Specifically, in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These
forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views
in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call.

Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis
and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Jayshree.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Curtis, and welcome to your first Arista earnings call, and thank you, everyone, for joining us
this afternoon for our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call.

We delivered a non-GAAP revenue of $552.5 million, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.29.
Services contributed approximately 19% of the revenue consistent with the typically higher renewals
at the year-end. Our non-GAAP gross margins was 65.2%, influenced by a strong performance of the
enterprise vertical and associated software-attached products. Overall, our 2019 gross margin came in at
64.7%.

We registered a record number of million dollar customers in Q4 as a direct result of our enterprise
momentum. By the end of 2019, we have acquired over 6,300 customers cumulatively, with Microsoft at
23% of total revenue and Facebook at 16.6%.

In Q4 2019 and actually much throughout the year, cloud titans was the largest vertical. The enterprise
segment is now consistently the second largest and strongest segment followed by the financials in third
place, Tier 2 cloud specialty providers in fourth and service providers in fifth place. Both service providers
and Tier 2 cloud providers have been slow for us.

Arista, as you know -- in terms of geography, 2019 international contribution was 24%, with the Americas
at 76%.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

In terms of new products in 2019, Arista, as you know, delivered a banner year of disruptive products,
redefining networking with a highly differentiated software stack, management and flagship platforms.
The 7280 and 7500 series, especially have become the gold standard in 100-gigabit spine networking. We
also introduced substantial 400-gigabit innovations with 10 new platforms. We launched a new portfolio
of cognitive campus edge products for wired, Power over Ethernet switches and wireless, including Wi-
Fi 6. Our inherent software flexibility brings federated management and control planes across multiple
merchant silicon data planes, and this is one of our key differentiators.

We continued our systematic innovations in cloud EOS and CloudVision features. In particular, we have
doubled our CloudVision customers delivering real-time streaming telemetry availability, scale, automation
with change control as well as third-party interoperability. We are pleased with the increased acceptance of
total software bookings, both in subscription and perpetual licenses now approaching 5% of total revenue
annually.

We began Q1 2020 with the close of our third acquisition, Big Switch Networks, an SDN pioneer founded
almost a decade ago. This is a strategic step for us in bringing a strong combination of engineering
expertise, deeper entry into the network packet broker market and increased software multi-cloud
visibility. As you know, we've always been focused on software-driven networking as a mission in Arista.
With Big Switch, we are expanding that mission to a more deep analytics trend complementing our switch-
based DANZ or data analyzer platforms with Big Switch's deeper monitoring fabric across public, private
and hybrid clouds. Both companies also share a unique visionary status with data center networking in the
Gartner Magic Quadrant.

We welcome the BCN team -- BSN team into Arista family and really look forward to a strengthened
partnership, not only with them but with Dell Technologies as well as the approximately 300 customers
we're getting to know better. While the Big Switch acquisition is not material, we do expect this to
contribute to our software strength and bookings, and our goal is to become accretive in calendar 2021.

As we wrap 2019, I really do believe that Arista is in the clear forefront of making cloud area networking
more and more mainstream. We see that networking and the future of it is not silos or boxes with multiple
operating systems and spaghetti OS', but a new uniform, software-driven place in the cloud architecture.
We are proud of our market leadership with the #1 spot in 100-gigabit Ethernet switching and ready for
400-gigabit migration ahead of us. We are experiencing trials that are going well with several customers.
We are poised to achieve our first $100 million target for the first 4 quarters of campus revenue as well.

Our go-to-market strength continues to be an important investment area for us, as we have doubled
the sales and systems engineering capacity over the past 2 years. With the promotion of Chris Schmidt
to Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales; and Ashwin Kohli to Senior Vice President of Customer
Engineering, reporting to Anshul Sadana, the transition to their new roles has been seamless following the
departure of Manny Rivelo to a PE firm in conjunction with his executive advisory role to us. Both Chris
and Ashwin have long tenure with us and epitomize the Arista ways.

As I've traveled the world, including hundreds of customers we touch, it is clear to me that we're winning
strategic enterprise franchises across high-tech, media, banking, health care, insurance and retail sectors,
to name a few. Larger enterprise are increasingly frustrated and anxiously seeking better quality and
architectural leverage to cloud-based principles. Our programmability with software and quality with the
lowest critical vulnerabilities in the networking industry is a refreshing and welcome change to them.
Arista is gaining strategic relevance, almost doubling our million dollar customers within the past 3 years.
I expect this momentum to continue and happen across all the noncloud verticals.

With that, I'll turn it over to Ita for more financial specifics.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q4 and full year 2019 results and our guidance
for Q1 2020 are based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain

acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-
GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.

Total revenues in Q4 were $552.5 million, down 7% year-over-year and above the midpoint of our
guidance of $540 million to $560 million. Service revenues represented approximately 19% of total
revenue, up from 15.2% last quarter, reflecting typical fourth quarter service renewal seasonality in
conjunction with the lower product revenue number.

International revenues for the quarter came in at $137.7 million or 25% of total revenue, up from 19% in
the third quarter. Looking to the year, international revenues accounted for 24% of total revenue, down
from 28% in the prior year. This shift in geographical mix for the year was largely driven by heavier U.S.
deployments by our cloud titan customers.

Overall, gross margin in Q4 was 65.2%, above the upper end of our guidance range of 63% to 65% and
up from 64.4% last quarter. This reflected a lighter cloud titan contribution in the period, combined with
good performance from our enterprise and financial verticals.

Operating expenses for the quarter were $154.3 million or 27.9% of revenue, down from last quarter
at $163 million. R&D spending came in at $96.2 million or 17.4% of revenue, down from $105.3 million
last quarter. This decline largely reflected lower engineering and prototype costs in the period. Sales and
marketing expense was $46.4 million or 8.4% of revenue, with increased head count, somewhat offset
by reductions in other sales costs. Our G&A costs were consistent with last quarter at approximately $12
million or 2.1% of revenue.

Our operating income for the quarter was $205.8 million or 37.3% of revenue. Other income and expense
for the quarter was a favorable $11.2 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 15.5%.
This lower tax rate reflected the release of some uncertain tax position-related reserves following final
agreement with the relevant tax authorities. Please note, however, that we do expect to see some upward
pressure on the effective tax rate over time as various tax jurisdictions continue to modify their tax rules.

This resulted in net income for the quarter of $183.4 million or 33.2% of revenue. Our diluted share
number for the quarter was 80.26 million shares, resulting in a diluted earnings per share number for the
quarter of $2.29, up 1.8% from the prior year.

Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at
approximately $2.7 billion. We repurchased $51.5 million of our common stock during the quarter at a
weighted average price of $189 per share. This brings our total repurchases for the year to $266 million
over 3 quarters. As a reminder, our Board of Directors has authorized a 3-year $1 billion stock repurchase
program commencing in Q2 '19. The program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock
opportunistically and is funded from operating cash flows.

We generated $327 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, affecting strong net income
performance and a decrease in working capital requirements of approximately $115.4 million. DSOs came
in at 65 days, up from 63 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of billings in the period. Inventory turns were
2.9x, down from 3.1 last quarter. Inventory increased to $244 million in the quarter, up from $240 million
in the prior period.

Our total deferred revenue balance was $575 million, up from $529 million in Q3. As a reminder, our
deferred revenue balance is now almost exclusively services related with any significant product deferred
revenue amounts having been recognized to the income statement in the first half of the year. As Jayshree
mentioned, we had 2 greater than 10% customers in the year, Microsoft at 23% and Facebook at 16.6%.
If you exclude the recognition of product deferred revenue referenced above, Facebook would have
represented approximately 12% of revenue for the year.

Accounts payable days were 44 days, up from 31 days in Q3, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts
and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.4 million.

Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and beyond. While we're not in a position at this point to
provide full year guidance, we wanted to reiterate the various puts and takes discussed on our last call.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

2019 has been a challenging year for our cloud business with significant volatility and an overall muted
demand picture. As we look forward to 2020, we believe this trend continues with demand from this part
of the business being flat to down on a year-over-year basis. This trend, combined with tough year-over-
year revenue comparisons due to the recognition of $118 million of product deferred revenue in the first
half of 2019, will likely result in a meaningful decline in cloud revenue for 2020. Enterprise and financials
are expected to grow healthily, but are not yet large enough to fully offset the expected revenue decline
from cloud. Service provider and specialty cloud will likely remain sluggish for the year.

On the gross margin front, we would reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65%, the
customer mix being the key driver. Focusing specifically on Q1, we expect to trend lower in this range
given a lighter revenue number and a typical first quarter weighting towards cloud. We'll continue
to manage investments in the business carefully with targeted growth in sales and R&D head count,
balancing the need to expand our market coverage with prudent financial management.

We announced the acquisition of Big Switch Networks earlier today. This represents an immaterial
transaction who brings us some additional software capabilities and a strong engineering talent pool. From
a financial perspective, this is an software subscription business with upfront license revenue recognition
and a fair amount of services deferred revenue. We're beginning the business and accounting integration
now, and the acquisition will be recorded in our financials for the first quarter. We have included a small
revenue contribution and 2 months of expenses for Big Switch in our guidance for the first quarter. We will
provide additional clarity on the go-forward income statement impacts once we've completed the purchase
accounting analysis.

Finally, our guidance for Q1 does not reflect any impact from the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China.
While we do not have a significant direct manufacturing footprint in China, there may be some indirect
supply chain impacts. We will look to monitor and attempt to mitigate these as the situation unfolds.

With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the first quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and
excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows:
revenues of approximately $522 million to $532 million, gross margin of approximately 63%, operating
margins of approximately 34%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% with diluted
shares of approximately 80.5 million shares.

I will now turn the call back to Curtis. Curtis?

Curtis McKee
Head of Corporate & Investor Development
Thank you, Ita. We are now going to move to the Q&A portion of the Arista earnings call. Due to time
constraints, I'd like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for
your understanding.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.

Pierre C. Ferragu
New Street Research LLP

I was wondering on like the outlook for your cloud titan clients, so we understand like flat to slightly down
year-on-year, which means that we'll have a bit of recovery during the year, and I think it's surprising that
it contrasts -- it's contrasting a lot with what we've heard from other suppliers on the compute side, on
the memory side. We've heard much -- we've seen much better numbers in the second half of last year
and much more positive comments about the first half of this year. So you don't seem to be on a similar
cycle, things seems to be coming back slower for you guys. And so any way you could help us understand
that would be very helpful.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Sure, Pierre. I will take part of the question, and Anshul can elaborate. The cloud CapEx spending has
never correlated 1:1 with Arista's network numbers. And the reason is many because as you know, it's a
very small part of their total CapEx. It's almost negligible, the network piece. And often, they make the
compute and the storage decisions first and the network comes later. So there's a lag.

So our visibility right now, as I've often told you, is 1 to 2 quarters. And we can't say much about the
whole year, let alone Q2 or second half. So while we are making predictions based on our 2019, both the
absorption of deferred revenue and the current understanding of their plans, things might change. We're
reflecting what we know best as of now, especially when you look at our year-over-year comps for 2018
and '19. Anshul says I did good enough, so he has nothing more to add.

Operator

Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.

Meta A. Marshall
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to know if you could kind of give a little bit of an update on the campus business traction?
And just whether you had seen any kind of pause in purchasing activity due to macro?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Well, thank you, Meta, and thank you. I think it's the first call for you with Arista. So welcome. So as you
know, our campus business is in its very early stages. We only started shipping in Q3 2019. We've had 2
full quarters now of campus. And I'm very encouraged by the enthusiastic response from both our existing
customers as well as new customer acquisition.

As I look at our million dollar customers, that I was talking about and the record number we have
achieved, many of them have also been campus. And so we -- I see that, at least from our little oasis or
island, we're not really a macro bellwether. We're more of a technology bellwether and the technology
both on our PoE and Wi-Fi has been very well accepted, along with clients and CloudVision. And Q4 was a
very good indication of that.

Operator

Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.

JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

One, what are the priorities in terms of your integration with Big Switch? What are you going to be doing?
Which products are you going to be focusing on? Then secondly, is there anything that we should be
concerned about with China? Did you see any evidence of impact from the virus issues going on there?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

So I'll take the first question, and Anshul, maybe you with your COO title, you know more about what's
going on there. So on the -- what's the priorities for the Big Switch? Well, as I said, first of all, we were
incredibly impressed by the engineering team. So we have selected the best of the best, and they are very
much part of -- the acquisition has closed, and I want to give a big shout-out to Marc Taxay and Ita for the
hard work that went into that. It's a 10-year old company, there's a lot of detail.

So the -- at the end of the close of the acquisition, we have absorbed approximately 75 employees, a
large percentage of them in engineering. And there are 2 product lines that Big Switch carries, the BMS,
which is the monitoring product, which as I explained, is a perfect complement to DANZ. DANZ is Arista's
in-line integrated switching product, and BMS is just icing on the cake, it has deeper visibility, service
nodes, recorder nodes and monitoring fabric, et cetera. And then BCF, which is meant for more of a
converged fabric. And we fully expect that to be a very important piece, especially with our converged
infrastructure partners like Dell Technologies. So both products will be fully supported and carried through,
but with different channels.

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

To your question on China and supply chain with respect to coronavirus, as Ita mentioned, we don't do
any direct manufacturing in China. So it really comes down to second degree effects of our manufacturers,
suppliers or their sub-supplies and the raw material coming from China. So far, we haven't seen any big
impact because it's just been a few weeks after the -- really a few days after the end of the Chinese New
Year. And our manufacturers are saying, maybe that's okay for the short term.

However, if the situation continues for a long period, and there's very little supply able of raw materials
and -- over an extended time, then it can have impact in the future. But it's too early to say anything
right now. And we expect more answers from the Chinese suppliers to the factories through the rest of the
month and even in March. So again, it is too early, but for now, we're okay.

Operator

Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.

Roderick B. Hall
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And girls, I wanted to -- I guess, I wanted to -- or girls and guys is probably the right order for that
actually. I wanted to ask a couple of verticals question. So Ita you had commented that cloud, you expect
a meaningful decline. And I don't know if you could give us any more feeling for what you mean by that?
We were thinking at kind of low double-digit sort of decline this year. But I don't know if that sounds like
more than that.

And then the other -- on the positive side of this equation, the service provider commentary, you said
sluggish, we were thinking that would be declining this year, but it almost -- just want to clarify, do you
think that, that -- are you expecting a little bit of growth there or stabilization there, kind of flattish
revenue there?

And then a bigger picture question, Jayshree is, have you guys considered disclosing these verticals or
some subset of them? Is that something we could maybe look forward to at some point in the future, at
least on an annual basis, so we can all track kind of what's happening under the covers in the verticals?

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Rod, I'll try and answer all -- as many of your questions. The last one first. So the answer is, we try
to do our best by ranking them. And I guess, you're looking for more granularity. So we'll definitely take it
under advisement, like we do anything you suggest, and maybe that's a data point for Analyst Day.

And going back to your cloud decline and service provider, flat to down, I think, definitely means flat to
double-digit down. We don't exactly know how much now because we're in the first quarter. I think Anshul
and the team will get much more visibility in maybe Analyst Day or second half because that's when we
really get a good sense. But Q1 is such a seasonal quarter. We don't have enough data. It's more an
extension of Q4. So ask us this question again in May or June. And I think we'd have a lot more to say.

Service providers, yes, I think when Ita actually explained the definition of sluggish to me, which is, it's
not that bad. And I think the worst was last year. So it's bottomed out and it can only get slightly better is
our feeling, but we're not like holding our breath or anything, but we believe it can't get worse.

Roderick B. Hall
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

But sluggish, would it be some range around 0 then Jayshree not like [ declining further and that would
be ] a negative number.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

0 plus or minus, yes. Not minus. Not minus.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Not declining further. Rod, I think...

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Above 0.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

It's our hope, right? I mean it did decline a fair amount in 2019. And we'd like to think that it starts to
recover a little bit from there, but sluggish kind of implied slowly.

Roderick B. Hall
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. But that's better than I thought. So I appreciate that.

Operator

Your next question comes from John Marchetti with Stifel.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Just Jayshree, I just -- as we're getting closer to this, reaching the end of this sort of first $100 million
on the campus side, and you've added a couple of pieces there. I'm just curious, as we look out the next
couple of years, how maybe we should think about that business trending up towards a little bit more of a
meaningful contribution to the overall growth rate?

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

And then Ita just real quick on the tax rate. I just wanted to make sure that I heard it correctly that at
least starting in '20, we should expect this lower rate to continue and that it may tick back up over time,
but that we're at least expecting that lower tax rate to continue over the near term?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. Let me take the tax one first, maybe. So the Q4 tax rate at the 15%, I mean, that's a once-off, right?
It's some very specific reserves that were released in the period. As we go forward, we've been thinking
about the structural tax rate somewhere around 21%. That's what we guided for Q1. There's probably
more upward pressure than downward pressure on that over time. So I think 21%, 21.5%, it's is in that
range somewhere, but I think for now, you're in the 21% range for Q1. And then maybe you see a couple
of basis -- tens of basis points kind of increase over time, but it's -- it will take time. That was more kind
of a longer-term structure rate statement. The 21% plus or minus hasn't really changed in the current
time frame.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

And John to take your question on the campus, we think being a new kid in the block when there's been a
fairly mature market and a $10 billion TAM largely Cisco and maybe HPE Aruba, just for us to enter in and
be taken seriously is the first order of business. And I have to say the enthusiasm for Arista, the software,
the cognitive CloudVision has been very well received. So I think delivering the first 4 quarters of $100
million will really establish a baseline for more growth.

As I said at the last analyst meeting, I'd be very disappointed if we didn't have that more growth translate
into doubling and doubling again. So I'm -- my team would be looking to take that $100 million to $200
million and then to $400 million and then some. But more on Analyst Day maybe on exactly how we do
that and the details.

Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair.

Jason Noah Ader
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Jayshree, you guys have prided yourself from day 1 on a single OS. Now with Big Switch, you're going to
have a second OS. So I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about the future of Big Switch's OS?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, that's a really good question, yes. And we've actually done 3 acquisitions and had to deal with
the OS twice before. So before I answer your Big Switch question, let's take the other 2. Metamako very
FPGA-centric, it was really for the high-frequency trading market, low latency. The OS did not play a big
role. And when it does, it will be EOS, right? Mojo, really a radio management Wi-Fi, we immediately
integrated into CloudVision, and again, the OS was less important than the CloudVision integration to
bring wired and wireless together.

Big Switch, we fully expect that same CloudVision integration with DANZ and BMS, the monitoring fabric.
So the OS will be somewhat transparent and unification of in-line DANZ and a monitoring fabric will be
much more important. The Big Cloud Fabric is the unique product. And we believe the go-to-market
channel there is not necessarily a typical Arista customer who's looking for EOS and CloudVision, but a
technology partner like Dell Technologies or Nutanix that wants to integrate this with their servers and
storage. So very much like SONiC or FBOSS, this is a converged infrastructure solution.

So is it right to think about that serving a part of a market that you probably never would have served,
and therefore, you can reconcile it with the overall strategy?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

That's correct. Again, it's early days, and we're still learning. And both Doug Murray and Kyle, the co-
founder, are teaching us as we speak. But if we look at the over 300 customers, the overlap with our
customers is only 1/3. So 60%, 65% of the customers are new to us.

Your next question comes from Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Yun
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I wanted to ask about your 400-gig opportunity. Can you talk about expected market share for 400 gigs
maybe just at a high level, especially versus your peers? I think it's fair to say that you're dominant in
100-gig at hyperscale clouds. But is the expectation to win the majority of 400-gig deals? Or are you
taking a more conservative view where your peers might see sizable wins as well?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think our peers should have seen sizable wins on 100-gig too, I don't know why they missed
the boat. But it's very unnatural for an incumbent to lose a speed transition. So the fact that Arista
became #1 is just -- never been done in the networking industry before. Now what we see with 400-gig
overall time line is we have been consistent on that. We are seeing early trials, we expect mainstream
deployments this year, particularly in the second half, and obviously, the cloud will play a big role, but it'll
also be some of the high-end enterprises and service providers as well.

And so given the trials we're seeing, we don't expect material revenue of 400-gig until the second half of
this year and really 2021. And the other thing I'd point out is nobody just builds 400-gig in isolation. It
always happens in conjunction and there are always mixing and matching 100-gig and 400-gig. So Anshul,
do you want to add to that?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

So Jayshree, 2 comments here. Brian, I know everyone's focused on 400-gig. I do want to remind you and
everyone else, 100-gig is actually growing in 2020. It's not going to replace just yet. And there are many
other equations coming soon as well, whether it's 8x50 going to 4x100 or 8x100 as well. It's not just a
single transition that our customers are planning or working with us on the multiple 3 years generational
road map as has been discussed.

Lastly, there is some dependency on the DCI or backbone networks on availability of the other optic cloud
scale and that's still expected to be second half, maybe even end of the year. And hence, any material
deployments in that space will be in 2021.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

And Anshul, just to reiterate your point, the TAM for 100-gig is $4.5 billion. I don't know the TAM for 400-
gig will even hit a few hundred million this year.

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Pilot is not a TAM.

Our your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.

Ittai Kidron
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Two questions for me. I know Curtis tries to limit me to one, but I'll try to sneak one in. Yes. Regarding the
acquisition of Big Switch, I do want to understand the relationship with Dell, and also if there's a revenue
concentration for Big Switch? If I remember correctly, Microsoft is a big customer for them. So if we could
discuss that.

And then on Dell, they also have other companies they work with in this space, Cumulus, if I remember
correctly. Help me understand how do you think the nature of that relationship is going to look like going
forward?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

That's a good question. First of all, we didn't see any significant revenue concentration and certainly
not Microsoft, that could have been a past statistic, but not true now. So there's obviously some big
customers, and they have some top 10, but not specifically one that is a 10% concentration.

So coming back to your question on how do we see this, we do see the partnership with Dell getting
stronger. How Big Switch was selling was really software-only disaggregated from hardware and a lot of
the hardware was Dell switches. We continue to plan to offer that model and strengthen our partnership
with Dell and make that stronger. So we are not changing the sales motion, and it complements what
Arista is doing in the high-end enterprise and cloud titans very, very well. So no change.

to do very well for you. But can you perhaps help us understand what the margin profile for this business
looks like versus your broader portfolio?

Jayshree V. Ullal

Okay. I would generally say the margin is about the same. But if you say versus our router portfolio as
opposed to versus our switching portfolio.

Jyhhaw Liu
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

The broader portfolio. Sorry, not router, but just broader.

Jayshree V. Ullal

Okay. The broader. Okay, yes. Not the same. More pricing pressure in the campus always because the
market is defined that way, but the margins aren't significantly different.

Your next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

I wanted to go back to 400-gig. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you think the builds for
400-gig differ from what you saw in 100? And specifically, I'm interested in any thoughts you have on
how your partners approach their own OS development efforts, any switch standardization efforts? Just
any high-level thoughts there? And then how do you think the margin opportunity for 400? How does that
compare to what you saw with 100?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Sure. Ben, in terms of the 400-gig architecture and how our largest customers are leading the way there,
the entire architecture needs to contemplate a server flow, let's say, at 100-gig being able to go through
the network. So you have to upgrade it end-to-end. You cannot just upgrade in silos and be done with
it. So for large-scale architectures, upgrading the backbone and the DCI networks is almost a necessary
step one before you can do 400-gig in the broader leaf spine design. And that depend on ZR, other optics
and so on, and -- but that's where the testing is going on already in the last trials that we are involved in
today.

For AI, which are closed clusters, 400-gig is already starting to see a little bit of deployment, but these are
still very small scale, simply a 32x400 gig type of design in our mini-leaf spine. And there, we are working
with our customers very well. With core development, it may not be just the OS. That problem, I think
we've already addressed with our best customers and partners, but it's actually core development with the
NIC and the FPGA and the GPU and so on, that is also happening already.

Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Crédit Suisse.

Ahmed Sami Badri
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I had a question for you regarding Big Switch, and just the operating margin drag that the Big Switch
acquisition is going to create in 2020? And maybe I was hoping for some specifics on 2021 accretion that
you mentioned. Is this a 1Q, 2Q 2021 accretion? Or is this a back half of 2021 accretion that you are
anticipating?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

I'll answer the second question, and then Ita, if you could. I wouldn't call it too much of a drag, but
maybe. But in terms of when it will be accretive, the forecast we have challenged the team with is to be
accretive by the end of 2021. Obviously, I'd like to see it sooner.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. I mean I think once we get out of Q1, Q1 was always going to be a quarter that was tight from a
operating margin perspective just because where the revenue came in at and the mix of business that we
have with cloud being heavier. So you are seeing a lower kind of operating margin in Q1. I think once we
get out of Q1, we had talked on the last call about a 35% operating margin being kind of the target. And I
think we can absorb Big Switch within that, right? As we move through the year, and then we'll have more
to say kind of on the top line on the next call once we sort out some of the purchase accounting and other
stuff that we need to work through.

Thejeswi Banavathi Venkatesh

It looks like Microsoft was only down 5% in 2019, a bit better than what you were expecting. Given that

Jayshree, you could do that for 2020. And then secondly...

Jayshree V. Ullal

Tejas, I'd be a fool...

Thejeswi Banavathi Venkatesh
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Well, this one went better. But the second thing I wanted to ask about was, is Tier 2 cloud now less than
10% of revenue? And is the visibility sort of improving, given that it was such a drag in 2019?

Jayshree V. Ullal

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I kind of want to build on that last kind of question is, as you look forward, I think last quarter, you alluded
to that one of your large cloud titan customers were actually just flat out pausing with regard to their
spending dynamic as it relates to maybe a server cycle, a variable kind of consideration. As you think
about your outlook today, how would you characterize if whether or not that's changed at all? Has the
slowdown become more pervasive across your cloud titan customers? Just any kind of update on how you
kind of roll up that cloud titan forecast this year relative to what you thought coming out of last quarter?

Yes. That's a good question, Aaron. So first of all, just to reiterate, all the surprises we received from
that specific cloud titan remain and are being factored into the 2020 forecast. So those numbers will be
lower this year, right? As for the other cloud titans, each one is unique. So it's not necessarily feeding
into the others. So that is specific to that one. And each one has their architecture, their time lines, their
migrations, their specific CapEx plans. So I wouldn't roll one into the other.

Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.

Paul Jonas Silverstein
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Jayshree, I've got a similar question but from a different angle with respect to cloud. So if we went back
several quarters ago, you spoke about the dramatic pause. And I think you also mentioned the fact that it
wasn't just a question of when they would return but to what magnitude when they did. So the question
I now have for you is, I assume, by definition, your visibility for Microsoft and Facebook is not what it
was at its peak, far from it. But what visibility -- how would you characterize that visibility today and
looking downstream not just the next quarter or 2, but further out, do you have any visibility as to what
those customers will look like a year from now, and not speaking about a quarterly period, but obviously,
speaking from an annual standpoint, what the contributions will be.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Paul, so if you go back consistently to our last 3 years, I think we've always said, we don't have more
than a 1 to 2 quarter visibility on any of our cloud titans, and that hasn't changed. So I wouldn't be able
to give you annual visibility of what their spend this year versus next year would be. I do think we get
greater visibility in the second half of this year on how their next year will look like, but -- in terms of
broad trends, but that answer hasn't changed despite the pause and puts and takes.

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

If I can add to that, we don't have visibility into their surprises.

Paul Jonas Silverstein
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Fair enough. Guys, on the enterprise, just very quickly, Jayshree, you kept referencing the million dollar
plus deals. You said it's almost doubled over the past 3 years. Can you tell us how many million-dollar
deals you have in enterprise?

Jayshree V. Ullal

100, many hundreds.

Paul Jonas Silverstein

about campus specifically.

Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

We have been hearing from some of the larger OEMs that the server chipset availability is a little tighter
than they might have hoped. I wouldn't have necessarily thought that there would be an implication for
Arista a year ago. But given sort of the tenor or the conversation we had last quarter, I'm wondering if
that is something that we should be monitoring just in case some of your other web scale customers can't
get all the servers they want or some of the Tier 2 players can't get the servers they want, and that may
then impinge upon your switch sales to them.

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

So just, it doesn't really impact us as much on a short-term variation over there, especially the cloud
companies, they decouple supply chain planning for these issues and have 1 or 2 months of gaps anyway.
If it's a fluctuation of 1 or 2 months, it doesn't really impact us.

Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

Okay. Then as a clarification, I think in the past, you've talked about the likelihood of coming back to year-

below 10% versus what's this year, the growth is only 6%. If I assume for Facebook 5%, which again,
it wasn't a 10% customer, so it has to be below that. So if I assume anything below, the growth is even

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Okay.

Ita M. Brennan

Yes. Part of the issue going from 2019 to 2020, is that you have this deferred revenue, $118 million, which
is like 5% of revenue effectively, right, both, right, that you have to backfill effectively in '20, right? So
that kind of -- that's a drag on the growth rate before you start, right? So you have to adjust for that. But
even with that, what we're saying is that, that cloud vertical will be kind of flat to down from a demand
perspective, right?

But the deferred related to Microsoft or Facebook or the deferred related to everyone else?

If you trace back in time, it was non-Microsoft, and obviously, it's a large number. So I think you can
figure out that it's a Facebook impact, right? And we talked about that as a 16.6% with the deferred,
probably 12% revenue without the deferred, right?

Simon Matthew Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I got confused not only from Tal's question there. Anyway, I wanted to ask you about the commentary
several of the hyperscale providers made about extending the useful lives of their servers. Wondering how
that translates into your business for intra-data center switching? And if this was an aspect that you were
aware of when you had provided your forecast last quarter or whether the commentary we heard during
this earnings season was also new to you.

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

No. Simon, when we did our earnings call last quarter, we very much stated what we had seen from at
least one of the cloud titans where they were delaying the refresh, and now you've seen in market that
some of the other cloud customers are doing this as well. But we're not seeing this with the other Arista
customers so far, even in the cloud space. So for us, it's limited to one customer. We don't deal with the
other larger company you're referring to as much, so we're not as exposed there. But it's not a market-
wide trend. It's very specific to their architecture, the next-generation thereon and the sort of type of
offloads they're looking for to decide which generation to select.

Simon Matthew Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And is there a way or some math to figure out how to translate if, say, they extend the life by 1 year. So
instead of 3-year replacement, they get a 4-year. Is there some arithmetic or rule of thumb to help us
think about how to quantify the impact for you?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

We don't have it. I'm quite sure someone on this call has a models around that. But no, that's not

Jim Suva
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I sincerely just have 1 question because I'm just a very simple guy and not as smart as others. But
whether it be Jayshree or Ita or Curtis, a quarter or 2 ago, you had talked about a cloud titan skipping a
refresh cycle or elongating their purchasing. Some of the commentary after that was, well, maybe they're
using white box or maybe they found a better compute standard or a way to fit more through compression
or duplexing or some other standard. Now that we've had several months behind us, can you give us
any visibility of -- do you feel more confident that it truly is just a delay? Or are they looking at other
solutions? Or just kind of revisit that topic?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So Jim, I think all the theories of those answers are not true. I think the customer has been pretty
straightforward with us, that they have always been using Arista as well as some internal development,

Samik Chatterjee
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just wanted to kind of -- given kind of your commentary on the slower spending you're seeing from your
customers, you obviously have a Q1 seasonality that's weaker than what you've seen historically. As we
look through the rest of the year, is it kind of fair to assume, given the visibility you have right now, that
the seasonality through the remainder of the year will be weaker than what we saw in kind of normal
years like 2018, for example? And are you still kind of comfortable reiterating the full year, I think, guide
that you gave last time, which was for a modest decline in revenues?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So Samik, I'm a little confused by your question. We did not give -- are you talking about cloud
customers or customers at large? What's your question?

Samik Chatterjee
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

For cloud customers. Cloud customers.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Cloud customers. Okay, okay. Now that makes sense. Yes, yes. So look, we feel the same way as we did
last time, which is we had a lot of weakness in the spending, and it's reflected in our Q1. I think we will
know better about the rest of the year when we get to the second half more. But as it stands, nothing's
changed. The CapEx that they will spend Arista fields in a very strong position to compete, differentiate
and get the business. So we're not losing market share. We're winning the sockets but the rate of spend
and adoption, we do believe will be a flat to down year this year.

James Edward Fish

Happy almost Valentine's Day. Can you guys go over the linearity of the mix for customers over the course

to down double digits on top of the $118 million deferred headwind? Or is the flat to down double digits,
inclusive of the headwind?

Ita M. Brennan

Right. So the meaningful revenue decline and the double-digit are all referencing revenue, right? So
saying basically the revenue numbers will decline meaningfully, right? That includes $118 million, right?
When we talked about demand, and we said, that we expect it to be flat to down, that's not referencing
that double-digit number, right? That's a commentary that obviously will play out as we see where it goes,
but it's not trying to say that it's a double-digit number.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

And then to answer your question on Q4 linearity. I'm just looking at the chart Mark Foss is giving me. It
was pretty linear across the 3 months. We had a record million dollars of customers in Q4, and good spend
across our top 50 customers. So nothing unusual except more campus.

Your next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Tim, are you there?

Curtis McKee
Head of Corporate & Investor Development

Tim?

Let's go to the next one.

Your next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities.

Ryan Boyer Koontz
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

I was hoping if you could speak to your outlook for international. Obviously, hyperscale has been a big
piece of that, shipping to their international destinations. But if you could speak to -- kind of is there any
updates on strategy or channel development there that's going to supercharge that business for you?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Anshul and the team have invested pretty significantly in international, especially, of course, the
developed countries in Europe and Asia Pac. We had a strong quarter. And we're starting to see some
important customer wins in the enterprise and even some small service providers. We -- obviously, a much
more channel led in international. That's always been the case. So that's been a strong area of experience
for us. And I actually want to add to that. I think that's a strong area of growth.

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Really, both in head count growth, we actually have a significant amount of heads added to international.
And on the channel side, the channel development plan we have is a separate one for U.S., separate one
for EMEA and APAC as well with a different ecosystem, different set of partners and so on, and that's
coming along reasonably well. As Jayshree mentioned, the international locations are mostly fulfilled by
channel, but now we are working with them to make it channel led as well. So if you remove clouds and so
on, the rest of the organic international business is doing well.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

And one other -- just one quick add to what Anshul said. Generally, our customer logos are higher
internationally than in the U.S. lower purchase of sale. But out of the 6,300 cumulative customers have
come internationally.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Sorry about that. Yes, I just wanted to ask kind of 2 related questions. First, could you talk a little
bit -- there's been a lot of chatter about silicon diversification in the switching area. So could you give
us your views, obviously, with a big customer making an announcement and starting to talk about some
traction there. So what do you think the impact is there? And related, what are you seeing just overall on
white box these days? Are you seeing any change to who's using it or how they're using it?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Look, as you know, Arista has always been a big component of merchant silicon and ASICs,
notwithstanding this new announcement have been around 30 years. It's not -- ASICs by themselves are
not new. We do see 3 dimensions. First of all, is, from a best-of-breed silicon standpoint, we couldn't be
more pleased with our -- the silicon we receive from Broadcom, both on the Trident and Tomahawk side,
and Jericho, we have very high confidence. It's a case where you can't just build one point product, you
have to have a full road map, and we've always been ahead of vendor specific at ASICs, and we believe
that will continue.

In terms of software, silicon by itself is not so interesting if you can't build a system. So obviously, EOS,
we feel is the most competitive software differentiated across many merchant silicon devices. I think it's
-- we supported over 18 silicon families, maybe more than that. And so in general, we feel like that leaves
only one other thing, which is Cisco selling chips. And obviously, that's not our business. They're going to
be competing with Intel and Broadcom on that one.

Operator

Your last question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.

Tal Liani
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

By the way, I just want to comment something. We'll take it offline, but we shouldn't remove the deferred,
and I can explain later why. The number is the number you could remove both sides. But in any case, I
wanted to ask about the gross margin. Why is it declining sequentially next quarter? I don't think anyone
asked this question.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

No. They didn't.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Large customer mix, right? We were a heavy enterprise and financials in Q4, and we'll be -- we're heavier
cloud mix in Q1. Q1 always has a heavier cloud mix because enterprise just takes time to ramp in the first
quarter.

Curtis McKee
Head of Corporate & Investor Development

Okay. Well, this concludes the Arista Q4 2019 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Please note
that moving forward, our earnings calls will move to Tuesday, starting with the Q1 2020 call, which
