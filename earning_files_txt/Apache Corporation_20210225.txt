Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Apache Fourth Quarter and Full Year
2020 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that
today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Gary Thomas Clark
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020
Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and
President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color
on our results and 2021 outlook. Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell,
Executive Vice President of Development, will also be available on the call to answer questions.

Our prepared remarks will be just over 15 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for
Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our fourth
quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at
investor.apachecorp.com.

Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences
between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures
can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting
practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest
in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.

And finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and
assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the
supplemental information on our website.

And with that, I will turn the call over to John.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I will recap Apache's 2020 accomplishments, discuss
our fourth quarter results and provide commentary on our outlook for 2021. First, I want to take a
moment to acknowledge the severe weather and devastating power outages experienced here in Texas
last week. Nearly all of our Texas-based employees were directly affected. Our field staff worked tirelessly
to maintain safe operations and like millions of Texans, our employees across the state experienced
notable challenges, including a lack of power, heat, water and many of the modern conveniences we all
rely on. While it appears that numerous factors played into the situation, one thing is certain: this event
has underscored the need for resilient and reliable energy infrastructure and supply.

2020 brought many unexpected challenges, which required immediate and aggressive actions. Shortly
after we issued our initial guidance for the year, a confluence of events signaled clear trouble for near-
term oil prices. The Russians and Saudis, in a battle for market share, were flooding the market with
supply. At the same time, the spread of COVID-19 was emerging as a significant threat to global demand.

In response, on March 12, we announced several important steps designed to protect cash flow in the
event of a prolonged adverse oil price environment. We reduced our capital budget by 37% from the
budget we had laid out just 2 weeks earlier. We cut our dividend by 90%. We initiated a shutdown of all

drilling and completions activity in the U.S. and a reduction of rig activity in both Egypt and the North Sea.
And with the significant reduction in planned capital activity, we decided to double our target for combined
G&A and LOE cost savings from $150 million to over $300 million. While these actions seemed extreme to
many, they turned out to be necessary and timely.

Throughout 2020, relative to our original plan, we lost over $1.3 billion of oil and gas price-related
revenue and more than $300 million of cash flow to working capital. Despite this, Apache finished the
year with no increase in net debt when excluding Altus Midstream. We were even in a position to take
advantage of volatility in the debt markets to buy back some bonds at a significant discount and later
issued $1.25 billion of new bonds to restructure the debt portfolio and protect near-term liquidity.

In addition to these actions, our response to the pandemic was equally swift and effective. We protected
employees and minimized operational disruptions by quickly implementing a work-from-home program
for office staff and changes in field operating protocols. To date, there have been no known cases of a
COVID-19 transmission from one Apache employee or contractor to another. I am also especially proud of
the assistance we provided to the pandemic response in each of the communities where we operate.

Finally, as we look back on 2020, one of the key highlights was our exploration program in Suriname,
where we commenced activity under our joint venture with Total. We have now made 4 significant oil
discoveries in our first 4 exploration tests and recently began the appraisal drilling program.

Turning to the fourth quarter results. We ended 2020 on a strong note, beating our fourth quarter
guidance for adjusted production, upstream capital expenditures and LOE. Oil production in the quarter
was slightly ahead of expectations, while gas and NGL production was notably strong as we returned all
previously curtailed Alpine High volumes to production around the end of October.

In the Permian Basin, we resumed completions activity in response to significantly lower service costs and
improving oil prices. In Egypt, we continue to leverage our large acreage position and modern seismic
program to further enhance our long-term exploration and development inventory. A recent example
of this is the Tayim-North discovery, which encountered 88 feet of high-quality oil play. We are waiting
on pipeline connections to further assess the reservoir extent and potential for additional development
locations.

In the North Sea, we made an important oil discovery in the tertiary play with our Losgann well, an offset
to Aker BP's Froskelår discovery on the Norwegian side of the border. In combination with 2 previously
undeveloped Apache discoveries in the tertiary, Losgann is part of a longer-term development opportunity
that could contribute meaningful incremental volumes while leveraging existing infrastructure.

Looking ahead to 2021, last night, we announced an upstream capital program of $1.1 billion, consisting
of approximately $900 million for development activities and $200 million for exploration, predominantly
in Suriname. This program is expected to deliver substantial free cash flow under our assumed price deck
of $45 WTI oil and $3 Henry Hub natural gas.

In 2020, we directed a higher percentage of our development capital to international projects that
generate better returns in a lower price environment. With the improvement in oil prices, we are returning
to a very modest level of activity in the U.S. during 2021.

In the Permian, we are currently running 1 rig and plan to add a second rig at midyear. This measured
approach will advance our objective of mitigating Permian oil production declines. We will likely need to
add a third rig at some point to fully arrest the decline.

At Alpine High, we have completed 2 lean gas DUCs that are performing very well, and we are planning
5 similar completions this spring. While there are no specific Alpine High drilling plans in 2021, we will
continue to monitor commodity prices and remain flexible with this asset.

Following several years without operating activity in East Texas, we recently added a rig in the Austin
Chalk play. This rig will drill a few wells that are necessary to hold our core acreage position and preserve
optionality. We believe the Austin Chalk, which is well situated in their existing infrastructure, will likely
merit future capital consideration.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

In Egypt, we plan to continue running 5 rigs this year. Our goal is to stabilize production and ultimately
return Egypt to growth, both of which will require the addition of more rigs. We can quickly flex spending
in Egypt as conditions warrant, and we will monitor oil prices and cash flow for the appropriate time to do
so.

In the North Sea, the capital program remains relatively unchanged this year, with 1 floating rig and 1
platform crew. While production from the North Sea is lumpy on a quarterly basis, we believe we can
generally sustain output in the 55,000 to 60,000 BOE a day range for the next several years at this level
of activity.

Lastly, in Suriname, we began the transfer of Block 58 operatorship to Total at the beginning of the year.
They are an excellent operator, and we look forward to this year's exploration and appraisal programs.

On the exploration side, our fourth well, Keskesi, is continuing to explore deeper objectives in the
Neocomian. As previously announced, we have selected the location for our fifth exploration well, Bonboni,
which will be in the northern portion of the block. Total spud the first appraisal well in Block 58 earlier this
month, which will be appraising aspects of both the Kwaskwasi and Sapakara discoveries.

I would like to close by discussing Apache's oil production trajectory and provide some perspective on
maintenance capital levels. As previously noted, we chose to significantly reduce capital spending in 2020
and plan to maintain a conservative investment approach in 2021. One of the outcomes of this choice
is that our global adjusted oil volumes decreased by 17% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth
quarter of 2020. This year, we are projecting a much more moderate decline of around 1% to fourth
quarter 2021. This implies the $900 million of capital investment we have earmarked for production and
development activities is just a bit shy of the spend required to sustain global oil production at fourth
quarter 2020 levels.

As we look to 2022 and beyond, our goal is to establish a development capital investment budget that
will, at a minimum, sustain production volumes for the long term. While we have experienced a very
welcome oil and gas rebound over the last 3 months, our strategic approach remains centered around
capital discipline and flexibility. As such, we are continuing to prioritize the retention of free cash flow to
reduce debt, a focus on long-term returns over short term growth, aggressive cost structure management,
the advancement of our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname and continuous improvement in
our ESG practices and metrics.

In 2020, we increased the weighting of ESG goals in our short-term compensation calculation to 20% and
refined our focus areas to air, water, communities and people. During the year, we emphasized robust
employee safety programs related to COVID-19, assisting our communities impacted by the pandemic
and advancing programs that foster a more inclusive workplace. We also made good progress on the
environmental front with enhanced greenhouse gas data collection and expanded disclosures, particularly
with regard to TCFD. We plan to continue to build on these efforts in 2021 with ESG goals that tie directly
to compensation and includes specific emissions and water usage targets and enhance our employees'
experience. These include delivering less than 1% flaring intensity in the U.S., achieving freshwater
consumption less than 20% of total water consumed and further progressing our diversity and inclusion
programs.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our key results
and 2021 outlook.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, John. I'd like to provide a bit more color around Apache's fourth quarter results, debt
management efforts in 2020 and our outlook for 2021.

As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache
reported a fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net income of $10 million. On a fully diluted basis, we
incurred a loss of $16 million or $0.04 per diluted common share. These results include items that are
outside of core earnings. Excluding these items, the adjusted loss was $20 million or $0.05 per share.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

Company-wide adjusted production for the quarter was 365,000 BOEs per day, a 7% decrease from the
third quarter. This was driven by declines in the Permian Basin and Egypt, where we felt the impacts of
reduced activity levels after the first quarter cut in capital spending. These declines were partially offset by
increased North Sea production primarily associated with the timing of workover activity.

Lease operating expenses of $269 million for the quarter were below guidance, but did rise a bit from
the third quarter. G&A expense of $76 million was at the low end of our guidance range. This was also an
increase from the third quarter, but mostly due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of certain stock
compensation programs.

Entering 2020, one of our key financial goals for the year was to retain free cash flow to reduce debt.
While the collapse in oil prices made this significantly more challenging, the decisive actions we took
to reduce our capital program, cut operating and overhead costs, decrease our dividend and numerous
smaller actions, enabled Apache to avoid further leveraging its balance sheet. We also took some
important steps to rearrange the bond maturity profile and to create a cleaner runway for the next few
years.

Through a combination of discounted open market repurchases, tender offers and call options, we reduced
shorter-term bond maturities by $600 million, with only minor changes to our average maturity profile and
coupon rate. We now have only $336 million of bonds maturing before November of 2025. We still intend
to reduce debt levels through free cash flow retention. And if oil and gas prices sustain anywhere near
current levels, we will make substantial progress in 2021.

Further to the 2021 outlook, as John stated, we are planning an upstream capital budget of approximately
$1.1 billion, with the primary goals of advancing our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname and
stabilizing global oil production around fourth quarter 2020 levels. At this point, it looks like our planned
capital program will fall just a bit short of stabilizing oil production. But we continue to look for ways to get
more out of those investments.

More specifically, to our production profile for 2021, we expect U.S. oil output to decline in the first
quarter. This is primarily attributable to 9 days of extensive Permian Basin shut-ins during the recent
freeze event as well as the timing of Permian DUC completions during the quarter. Consequently, we
expect a significant rebound in U.S. oil volumes during the second and third quarters before backing off a
bit in the fourth quarter to a rate similar to fourth quarter of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate continued
declines for the year compared to fourth quarter 2020 levels as upstream capital investment remains
below maintenance levels, and we will incur more downtime in the North Sea for scheduled maintenance
turnarounds.

In 2021, we are projecting LOE to rise approximately 7% year-over-year, which primarily reflects the
impact of some cost deferrals from 2020. This includes items such as increased workover spending and
platform maintenance in the North Sea. We also expect to see some higher foreign currency exchange
impacts associated with the weakening U.S. dollar. G&A will also rise a bit this year to a run rate of around
$75 million per quarter.

In closing, we are cautiously optimistic for a year of improved oil and gas prices. Even if we fall a bit from
the current strip, with a very conservative approach to capital budgeting, we should generate significant
free cash flow for debt reduction.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Appreciate all the color this morning. I got one set of questions on Suriname and one on workovers, if I
may. So on Suriname, John, there's been a lot of incremental information partly coming from your partner,
including, as you pointed out in your release, the likelihood of an FID this year, first oil by 2025. And
then you yourselves talked about an appraisal program that appears to be tapping both Kwaskwasi and
Sapakara. So I wonder if you could just walk us through what's going on in the appraisal and what the
scale might be of a first development in your mind.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, Doug, thanks for the question. Yes, the first thing I'll say is I really don't want to add a lot of color
to our partners' commentary a long time line. I mean we're aligned with them. And what I would say is
that given that when we made the press release after the Sapakara discovery, we said that it merited
consideration for fast track. It had those key ingredients. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that the very
first appraisal well is doing exactly that. We've always talked about the first 4 wells, and I'll go back and
talk about Maka, Sapakara, Kwaskwasi, and now Keskesi -- is really 4 different kind of deepwater turbidite
channel systems. They are placed where potentially you could do some overlap and so forth as you start
to think about development. So the nice thing about where that first well is placed, Sapakara West #2, is
it will be appraising both aspects of Sapakara, and we get to see some of Kwaskwasi. So it shouldn't come
as a surprise, and we're obviously anxious to get the results.

When we think about the appraisal program, it's just the next step following exploration. And in terms of
scale, those are the things we want to determine through the appraisal program. So I don't want to get
into discussions on that at this point, but we're going to be looking to determine things like flow rates,
connectivity, those types of things, boundaries, things you might see as you work through this. So we're
anxious to get on with it. And quite frankly, excited with how quickly Total's grabbed the hold and is
running with it.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I can't press you on a scale, John?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

It's -- we'll take it to one phase at a time, but we're in appraisal mode. So...

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. I'll let someone else ask about Keskesi, but I do want to ask about the maintenance capital, the
-- just the trend that you've had there. And it seems kind of remarkable to us that you're managing to
hold a decline as shallow as you are. Presumably, some of that capital is translating into workover costs
in places like the North Sea. So I just wonder if you could kind of walk us through how you think about
the dynamics of workovers versus capital? And really, what I'm trying to drive to is what do you think that
sustaining breakeven oil price is for that low decline that you seem to be able to hold in 2021?

APACHE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

Yes. Well, I mean, the thing I would say is I'm really proud of what our teams, our asset teams and our
operation staff have been able to accomplish. I mean in a really tough environment, with COVID-19 and
a lot more protocols added, I cannot say enough good things about our organization and all the hard
work that's taking place. And you see that. You saw it in our cost structure reductions. You see it in these
numbers. Not only did we reduce all the drilling rigs in the U.S., we dramatically cut the workover rigs in
the U.S. and then the other areas as well. And it just goes to show you what the focus and the effort we're
putting on it.

This year, we did pick up a rig in the Permian. It's one that made a lot of sense to pick up. We plan to add
another rig midyear, and we're going to be just short as I said in the commentary. We probably need to
add another one, but we don't plan to do that right now to be able to kind of hold our oil production. We're
just short of the activity levels in Egypt to kind of hold it. And North Sea is going to be lumpy, and we're
kind of in that range now where we think we can manage it between 55,000 and 60,000. It's just going
to be a lumpy profile with the turnarounds and the types of projects we're bringing on through subsea
tiebacks in the barrel area. But I really -- kind of hats off to the operational staff and the asset teams
because we're really managing things on cash flow and managing the cost structure really hard, and it's
amazing what that's done as a result to the oil curves.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Unsurprisingly, I'll follow up a bit on Suriname. If I think about the $200 million exploration budget, that
seemed to have 3 buckets: a small amount going to Austin Chalk; some going to Suriname exploration;
and then the remainder going to appraisal in Suriname, where you're paying $0.125 on the dollar
effectively because of the JV. Can you break those out any more for us? Or should we just kind of think of
it as one big lump?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, Bob, what I would say is number one, the Chalk money was not appraisal, right? It's development
capital. It's in an area where we've got leases that are expiring and we had some wells. We had to make a
decision there to either drill those wells or let the acreage go. It's not exploration capital. So -- and we feel
good about -- we've been participating in offset wells so -- the first thing I would say there.

And then when we look at Suriname, it -- you're right, there are 2 buckets, but it really will hinge on
the types of wells that we're drilling. The exploration wells will be 50-50. And at this phase of our joint
venture, the appraisal wells will be 12.5%. And so we really didn't break that bucket out. Clearly, the first
appraisal well, we're paying 12.5% of. And clearly, we're paying 50% of Keskesi. But that dollar amount
doesn't change much from where it's been last year when we were running a rig at 50-50 the whole time.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. Interesting. A quick follow-up would be what's the time line for Staatsolie deciding whether to back
in for 20%? And any thought on where their heads are?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean, they actually have that election at the time you FID a project. So we've got some time
there. Yes, I think they would like to participate. That's what we've always planned on from the get-go,
but we'd obviously be in a position to take additional interest if you get there. So -- but that's -- they
would come in on a point forward basis at FID.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Our first question is on the 2021 CapEx budget, and you're anchored at the very conservative $45 and
$3. And so what's your appetite for incremental activity if the strip ends up playing out? We know you
said you'd be very conservative and you're going to watch things and be very measured. But you said that
you ultimately need a third rig in the Permian to rest declines. You have some really good opportunities in
Egypt, and you maybe need a little more activity there to mitigate declines as well. So I guess where are
you -- where is your appetite on all of that? And where are you most likely to add that incremental activity
if it could be done this year?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Jeanine, right now, our appetite is generating free cash flow that we can set aside for debt
repayment. And we're just pointing out that to really stabilize Permian, we probably need -- we do need to
add another rig. There may be an opportunity in Egypt. But right now, I mean, we're -- like I said, we're
going to be very disciplined on the capital, and we would be -- just be very measured. And right now, the
appetite is to generate free cash flow for debt repayment.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. We like free cash flow and debt repayment. That's good.

And then my second question, maybe just following up on Bob's question just now. I might have missed
part of it. In that $200 million in exploration CapEx that's primarily Suriname, is there anything in there
for offshore Dominican Republic? I think you all were like finalizing something on that a few months ago.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. There's a small bit there, Jeanine. I mean we're starting to go through the work of scoping out our 3D
seismic shoot. So there is a little bit of money in there, but it's not a lot, but it would be captured.

Operator

And our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Well, I'd hop out of the queue. And I guess you put me back in. I was going to let other people get a
chance. But...

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Bob, I don't know what happened because there's a list here so I would say the operator put you back in.
But if you want to ask one since we've done it, I would say ask it.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I'll send her the check later.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

But we weren't trying to step over anybody else. But -- because there's a list here.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So I guess I'll stay on that Suriname theme, which is talking about getting to FID. Is there a drill stem test
planned for the year? And I'm just kind of surprised by the speed at which you can go from no appraisal to
FID in less than 12 months. Is there something you can do to give us comfort on that time line?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I would just say our partner is pretty confident in the rock. And I mean, it's -- I'll just leave it at that. I
mean it's -- we've got 4 exploration wells now. We've been taking our time with those, collecting a lot
of data. We've done side wall cores. We've done a lot of PBT analysis. They're not wellbores we intend
to use, but we've been gathering a lot of data as we've gone along. We've been doing a lot of lab work
subsequent. So I'll just leave it at that.

I mean clearly, we will be doing flow tests with the appraisal program is the other piece, Bob. But I'll leave
it there. I don't want to -- I, by no means, want to do anything but state we're going to the next phase.
And I don't want to try to add any commentary to the time line that our partners talked about. But we are
moving on the appraisal wells that we think could be fast tracked.

Operator

And our next question comes from Harry Halbach with Raymond James.

Harry Robert Halbach
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I was looking at Total's release, and they said around 9 wells are expected this year. Any sort of rough
estimates on the timing of those? And when we can expect results and kind of just the rough split for
exploration and appraisal wells going forward?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I mean all we'll really say, Harry, is there's 2 rigs. I would say that 9 wells is their whole portfolio. But
we've got 2 rig programs here that I would say. We drilled 3-plus wells with 1 rig line last year on the
exploration front. Some of the appraisal wells could go quicker because you've now got penetrations in the
basin, but some of these may take longer because of flow test and things. So I would just say we haven't
given that color. We've just said kind of think of it as an exploration rig line with program and an appraisal
program, and we're going to move out -- move on them concurrently.

Harry Robert Halbach
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Great. Appreciate that. And then looking at the U.S., what does the maintenance mode sort of program
look like, including Alpine High? And how are the returns at Alpine High stacking up to the Austin Chalk or
the other Permian stuff, just with the move in propane and butane prices lately?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. Harry, this is Dave Pursell. On the -- so when we think about maintenance in the Permian, we're
thinking about it on the oil side. And so when we talk about 3 rigs, we're thinking about what it takes to
keep oil production flat. We haven't run those -- that math at Alpine. I think when you look at the forward
curve on gas and NGLs, the -- even though we have preliminarily positive results from the 2 DUCs that are
flowing back now, given where oil prices are, it's unlikely in a limited capital budget that those compete
within the Apache budget. But if they're economic, we're open to think about partnering with someone to
help us move Alpine forward.

Our next question comes from Michael Scialla with Stifel.

Guillermo Huerta Gallego
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

This is actually Guillermo sitting in for Mike. I was wondering if you could provide additional color on the
U.S. You mentioned you're adding a second rig, but just to confirm, to hit your guidance number, will you
need that third rig? Or are your comments on adding that third rig or -- showing some upside potential to
your guidance?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

No. I mean we do not have it planned. It's not in the plan. And obviously, if it's not in the plan, it wouldn't
be in our guidance. So we were just making the reference point that we're just shy on the oil side, and we
would likely need one more rig in the Permian, which right now, we do not plan to add. I want to be really
clear there. And it's not in our guidance.

Guillermo Huerta Gallego
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And going forward, you mentioned that maintenance mode. Is it fair to assume a slight growth in
the U.S. to offset international volumes? Or should it be maintenance all across the board?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. I think we're really -- when we talk about this, we're talking about maintenance across the board.

Guillermo Huerta Gallego
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And last one for me. At Austin Chalk, a competitor of yours suggested well performance that could
compete with the Permian. Do you have similar expectations for those wells?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. This is Dave again, Guillermo. The -- yes, we've been patient as we've watched this play develop.
We have a big acreage position. It's legacy. We participated in some non-op wells, and we have high
expectations, which is why we're drilling these. But again, John said it, it's -- it allows us to preserve the
optionality of this, again, to bring in some additional capital if we choose to.

Operator

Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens.

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Steve, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there are some cost deferrals on the LOE side in '20
that are hitting in '21. Could you quantify that amount? And then what does a more normalized LOE rate
look like post '21?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I don't have -- sorry, Gail, I don't have a quantification of the amount that was deferred from 2020
nor how much of that is actually showing up in 2021. I'd maybe just suggest that you could follow up with
Gary after the call, maybe we can get an estimate of that. But I think it's -- I don't think it's a material
amount, but it's certainly contributing to the 7% rise in LOE from 1 year to the next. And sorry, what was
the second part of the question?

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to know if we excluded that amount, what would the normal LOE run rate look like.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Obviously, the more normal -- well, I think actually, the 2021 amount is probably the more normal
amount because what we've done is we've just deferred some stuff out of 2020 into 2021. We're not
necessarily doubling up a lot of stuff. There could be a little bit in there. So you're probably in the low
single digits in terms of the band of the error there in terms of doubling up some expense from -- into
2021. I don't think it's got a material effect there.

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then in the supplement, you guys talked about the Egyptian decline rate is expected to
moderate in 2021. Can you talk about where it is today and where you think it will be by year-end? And
what is driving that moderation?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. This is Dave again. I think when you look at the -- particularly in the Permian, you look at the way
unconventionals behave, yes. I'm sorry. In Egypt, sorry, I misunderstood the question.

Yes, in Egypt, it's a combination of activity and where we're focused. We have a pretty significant
workover program there that is also really bringing in behind-pipe resource. So as production declines, you
tend to have an easier time holding it stable. So that's the real -- the way the math works there in Egypt.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

If I could move back to maybe discussing Alpine High. I mean do you all think there's some latent
value that's in -- that's associated with the infrastructure or even maybe the gas -- the well and the gas
production opportunity here is -- and if that's the case, is there opportunities for you guys to do something
to get some of that value recognized and specifically, too, on the infrastructure side, with what you all
have there as well as your joint venture agreements?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

No. Scott, there's no doubt. I mean we've got resource there. We've gone in and done a couple of DUCs,
which we said they're the first 2 we've done. They're performing very nicely. I think we've got 5 more
DUCs that we'll finish the DUC program with later this spring. So there is opportunity there to potentially
bring in some capital. I mean what we've got right now with where our capital budget is, it's pretty tight,
so we don't plan to add any, but there is opportunities to potentially look at some things out there.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Is that an initiative for you all? Or is that just something that could happen?

APACHE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

No. I mean I'd just say that there's a lot of things we always work on that you don't spell out as -- but I'll
just leave it at that. It's something that we might be working on or would be thinking about, but there's
nothing we've got set up or planned in the activity set.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

No problem. And then my next question is if you all could remind me in Egypt, with the PSC and higher oil
prices, like at what point do you start getting to sort of that cap on the value? Are we a ways away from
there? Obviously, I think the strip has moved up pretty nicely. And there is obviously some conversation
out there, whether we get into next oil super cycle. I just kind of want to remind me the sensitivity to
higher oil prices with that PSC?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

No. I mean the returns there are good. It's just things shift as you move higher, right? And you get to
a point in there where inventory in the U.S. and the Permian actually spins over and can be even more
attractive. So we're not in that ring. I mean we're at a point today as -- if you go back and look last year,
we put out some priority sheets that kind of showed investment levels and with some price decks and kind
of at $50 was where we considered Permian. I mean there's nothing that's changed off of that -- those
priorities that we put out there.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sorry, before we go to the next one, if I could just add a bit to that. I'd say that at -- in the $50 to
$60 Brent range, we've still got plenty of running room where price continues to add meaningful amount
of value to the Egypt opportunities. So we're not near any type of ceiling on value opportunities in Egypt,
nowhere near that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Want to follow up on a couple of the topics. First, maybe starting with Suriname and the exploration
appraisal budget that's largely the large component of $200 million. In a continued success scenario and
reflective of the less demanding capital contracts as part of the joint venture, how do you see Suriname
CapEx evolving in years to come? And how does the optionality of the call on Suriname capital impact your
willingness to flex other assets like Egypt, Alpine High and Permian?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Brian, I mean, the nice thing is as you start shifting more dollars into appraisal and development, but
the carry is really kicking in. So those numbers don't go up, so it doesn't hinder. I mean that's part of why
we structured that deal in the first place. It's really the exploration rigs that drive because of the 50-50.
But obviously, as you shift into development and assuming you would FID something, then your dollars
will go up. But I mean, it's not going to be something we can't manage. It's not something that's going to
take away capital from other areas.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then my follow-up is trying to piece together some of the comments from your opening
remarks as well as other questions as it relates to the CapEx flexibility. You were very nimble in flexing
CapEx to the downside in 2020. There seems to be a consideration to be nimble on the upside. And I was

APACHE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

wondering if you could quantify, if you were to stabilize production in the Permian with a third rig, stabilize
production in Egypt and if pricing in NGLs and natural gas warranted some greater activity in Alpine High,
what the combined incremental capital would represent to make that happen?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean I'd say today, Brian, we're not thinking about trying to be nimble there and add, right? I mean
we poured our plan. Actually, the rig we picked up in Permian, we've been paying standby rates on. So it
made a lot of sense for us to pick that rig up and -- when we reduced last year, we drastically reduced. In
fact, like I said, we were paying some standby rates.

So we're not really motivated right now to try to be nimble and pick up incremental capital. We're just
pointing out kind of where those things would be. But I mean, right now, I think, Steve, especially wants
to see some dollars come in that we can earmark for debt repayment.

Operator

Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes. I wanted to follow up here a bit on Suriname. Just wanted to dive a little bit into the Neocomian zone
here. What can you kind of tell us about that particular zone? Is that present in the other 3 discoveries?
And then in general, is it present across your block or maybe just other areas of the basin? And has
anyone else had any penetrations potentially elsewhere in the basin in this particular zone?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Great question. I mean when we talked about Block 58 in the first place, we laid out more than
a handful of different play types. And quite frankly, our first 3 play types are all upper cretaceous;
Campanian, Santonian are the first 2; and then the third one actually is Turonian, which is also upper
cretaceous. We attempted to get down to the Turonian with Maka, but we were unable to due to pressure.

With the Neocomian, it is actually a lower cretaceous target. When I talk about the upper cretaceous,
Campanian and Santonian, they're really deepwater channel and levy turbidites. But the Neocomian is --
it's lower cretaceous, and it's more shallow water carbonate reef buildups.

And so there's -- I will tell you that we're not through the first 2 targets. We've got 2 Neocomian targets to
test in Keskesi, is -- what we had to do was swap out the BOPs. And so we're in the process of doing that,
and we'll be back to drilling. But these are carbonate reefs. They're pretty visible on the seismic. But this
will be the first test for us, and this is the -- was an optimal place to go on down through the source rock
to the Neocomian. And we're anxious to see, but it is exploration. They're visible. There's -- if it were to
work and bear the right fluids, then it sets up a whole string of these that are down there. So it's a play
concept test. And this just was the logical best place to do the first test for the Neocomian.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

So just to confirm, you guys certainly believe this is present across your block and potentially in other
areas in Suriname. And is this kind of the first test that you're aware of in the basin?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean, I'd say when we've got multiple, it doesn't mean across the block. I mean you've got to --
what you've got to understand is that with the geology here, there are play types that are present in -- as
you start thinking about other play types, there are play types in this portion to the block that are present
in some areas but not everywhere. So it gets back down to what the settings were like when it was laid

APACHE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

down. And as I said, this is lower cretaceous. It's more shallow water, carbonate reef buildups. And so
there's probably a trend of those that -- there is a trend that moves across our block, but we're focused
mainly on our block, and this is the first one.

I'll just say that it's exploration. So obviously, the chance of success you put in there that -- it's likely
not going to work. But if it does work, it does set up some more targets for us. But we are -- it is an
exploration well for a reason. It's a play concept, but if it happens to work, we've got more of these on
the block that would be additive and potentially could become part of whatever you did in terms of an FID
somewhere down the road.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful color for sure. I just wanted to shift over to Egypt here. You guys obviously made a
discovery at Tayim-North. It sounds like you're waiting on pipe there. Just wanted to get a sense of when
you guys might think you'd be able to get back out there, just a high level time frame. Is it something
that we can just talk about just in a matter of months? We can go out there and get a better look at the
appraisal? Or is this something that could be longer term that might get pushed into next year?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

No. It'll be pretty quick. I was thinking about Western Desert as we've got good infrastructure. I think
the most important thing with Tayim is it proves concept with the new seismic because it's something
that we would not have seen without the new seismic. And while it's a very nice discovery. We need to do
some flow testing and things to figure out if there's offsets and how many. Most importantly, it's proof of
concept, and we've got some other key wells that are on the rig schedule that are coming pretty soon. So
we're -- it's just further validation of the time we've invested over the last few years with sewing together
more acreage, shooting the seismic and really refining some of our interpretation skills on what we're
doing there. So it's just a lens into the rock that you would have seen otherwise, and that's what we're
excited about.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

So a quick question for you. Looking at Slide 12, just on the operating cash margins. John, I mean,
obviously, you continue to have great margins on North Sea, among the others. I'm just wondering, given
the type of margins you continue to see there, why not push that even further?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean, I think the key there is we're in a pretty good rhythm. If you look at what we did last year,
we had 2 platform crews. They're actually one at Beryl and one at Forties. We started alternating those.
Yes, we're in a pretty good cadence of projects. With the one rig, we've been doing what we could do in
terms of prioritizing. We've got a really nice discovery there with Losgann. So yes, I think we're in a good
place with where we are, a really good cadence. And when you look at our other types of opportunities
across the portfolio, while the margins were really good there, it's -- I think we're investing, and we're
showing good work. And now we've got a tertiary project that we're working on, not ready to talk about
yet. But I think we're in a good cadence in the North Sea.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just lastly, can you talk just on Egypt about being still? Is it free cash flow independent, I
assume, John, and will continue to be?

of opportunity in Egypt. I think the new seismic and the new acreage is going to open some things up.
And there's more to do there. But we're always working on preserving cash flow and those cash margins

Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy.

David Martin Heikkinen
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

And then also just a couple of quick hits, kind of good luck with the Neocomian. It sounds like I could
characterize it as a string of pearls type prospect or trend, but you hit this one and then you'll have other
high spots that are just going to follow along the same depth position.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean I would say it's how you could think about it, right? I mean they're definitely -- that's how
carbonate reefs work in a shallow water environment. So...

David Martin Heikkinen
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

That's what you're seeing, though? So you're seeing that type of string of pearls is what I was getting at.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. There's multiple targets that this would set up. But it's deep. And there's risk, right? So -- but we'll
see what happens.

David Martin Heikkinen
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

And then just, Dave, you kind of hit on some of the base decline tempering, and you had it in the slides.
I don't think I heard an answer as far as that this -- you got the sustainably low level of CapEx, and you
have a base oil decline tempering in 2021. Can you put any numbers to that tempering? As you roll into
2022, you're sustaining CapEx, it sounds like it might go down, and your operating expenses don't sound
like they would go up. So I'm trying to think of how things temper through the year?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. I think if -- let's talk about the Permian for a minute. We've given some numbers on base decline
in the past. I don't have those at the tip of my fingers, but you know how unconventionals work. As
you anniversary in the big first year production decline, you start to moderate the declines on the
unconventional. And then we have, obviously, a big legacy position. So think about 1/3 or more of our
Permian production is a very shallow decline that the Central Basin platform type well. So we have an
advantaged position. We never got into that super size growth mode in the Permian. So our -- the first
year declines that we anniversary-ed in weren't as big as others. So when we look at the capital required
for sustaining production, it's kind of in that 3-rig mode or 3-rig level.

And you'll see the kind of similar analysis if we look at Egypt as well. It's a bit more conventional declines,
but you'll see, as overall production declines moderate, it becomes easier to hold production at those
levels.

So I don't have numbers in front of me, but that's directionally where the -- why the maintenance capital
is probably lower today than what we've talked about in the past.

David Martin Heikkinen
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

And then just an absolute debt level target, do you have one this year post the use of cash?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Not necessarily a specific debt level target, but my target is as low as possible. So longer term, we're
trying to get -- we've said this before. We're trying to get back to something below 2, approaching 1.5x
debt-to-EBITDA. We were getting close in '19 and then 2020 happened. It looks like this year, at $55 WTI,
we're going to be approaching 2 again at strip. At the current strip, we'd actually be below 2. So -- and
that's with the current level of debt. And we should be able to generate a significant amount of free cash
flow at anything $55 or above. There's going to be a huge amount of free cash flow.

We're planning on being free cash flow positive, a few hundred million at $45. So -- and absent the 2020-
ish collapse in oil price, we're going to generate quite a bit of free cash flow this year. So I think we're
going to get debt-to-EBITDA back in the right direction by the end of this year and should be quite a bit
stronger by the time we enter '22.

Operator

I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO,
John Christmann, for closing remarks.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thank you. I really want to close by the following key points. Despite the recent run in oil prices, our
priorities have not changed. We remain focused on funding projects that provide the best returns over the
longer term, maintaining a balanced portfolio, generating free cash flow to pay down debt and continuing
to move our Suriname program forward. We are taking a very measured approach with our 2021 capital
program, and you've seen that through the Q&A today. We ended 2020 with 0 rigs in the Permian, and the
combination of higher WTI prices and lower service costs make this an appropriate time to restart a very
modest drilling program. Our goal is not to pursue growth, but to sustain oil production beyond 2021.

Our program in Suriname is progressing well. The transition to Total as operator has gone smoothly. And
we are aligned with our partner on both the appraisal and exploration programs and most importantly, the
objective of achieving first oil as quickly and as safely as possible. We look forward to updating you on our
continued progress throughout the year. Thank you.
