AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference call.
[Operator Instructions]

And now I'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Julienne. Welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year
2020. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice
President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's
Life Science and Applied Markets Group; and Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics
Group. Due to certain personal engagements, Mark Doak, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, is
unable to join us today.

You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on
our website at investor.agilent.com.

Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most
directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted,
all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. Revenue growth will be
referred to on either reported or core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the
acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates
as of January 31.

We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no
obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of
our risks and other factors.

And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I'd like to start today's call with a
reminder that Mark Doak, ACG Group President, will retire on May 1. While Mark and his wife are currently
enjoying a long-planned vacation and he's not able to join us today, I would be remiss in not taking the
opportunity to recognize the outstanding accomplishments Mark has made in his stellar 38-year career. His
track record of results speak for itself. Thank you, Mark.

We have a very strong bench at Agilent and have already named Mark's successor, Padraig McDonnell.
Padraig knows the business well. He's been on Mark's staff for several years. He's currently run our
Chemistries and Supplies division. Padraig and Mark are already working on transition activities as Padraig
prepares to take the helm of the ACG business at the start of fiscal Q3. I congratulate both Mark and
Padraig.

And now on to the quarterly results. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2020. Q1 revenues are
above our expectations as business grew in all regions and markets. Total revenues of $1.36 billion are
up 5.7% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2.4% on a core basis. We continue to translate our top
line growth into strong bottom line earnings. Our EPS of $0.81 is up 7% and is at the high end of our
guidance.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Before going into business unit market details and our quarterly results, I want to speak about 2 specific
areas that highlight how our building-and-buying strategy investing in fast-growing markets continue
to deliver growth and help us create a more resilient business. First, I want to talk at our most recent
acquisition, BioTek. This was the first quarter with the BioTek team onboard, and the business is off to a
very strong start with revenue growth above our expectations. We continue to be very enthusiastic about
the cell analysis space, and BioTek continues a strong momentum that really got us interested in bringing
them into Agilent. The BioTek leadership team was just in Santa Clara for a few days of planned meetings,
and they are very energized and excited about the future possibilities in making a great business even
stronger as part of Agilent.

Second, the resiliency of our business model is on full display this quarter as Agilent delivered strong
growth and earnings in the face of a negative Q1 impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China. As this
has dominated headlines, let me add a few additional comments regarding the coronavirus and its impact
on Agilent. Most importantly, our thoughts go out to all those affected by the coronavirus.

On the Agilent front, our team fortunately has not had any direct health impact, and many returned
to work last week. We are remotely supporting our customers as a number of them gradually resume
operations. We have also restarted our in-country production activities and are shipping product to
customers within China and internationally, albeit at a reduced rate.

On the business side, given that our first quarter ended January 31, we are seeing business impact across
both fiscal quarters, Q1 and Q2. In Q1, our revenues are running ahead of expectations right up to Lunar
New Year holiday. However, the extension of Lunar New Year holiday affected our customers' ability to
transact and accept shipments during the last days of the quarter. This reduced our reported revenue by
approximately $10 million in total for the quarter, primarily in our LSAG instrument business. We have
since recognized the bulk of this revenue now in Q2.

Looking ahead, we are projecting that coronavirus will continue to impact our China business throughout
Q2. Bob will share additional details, but we are anticipating delays in new equipment purchases and
slower uptake of consumables and services. This slower uptake is due to the reduced number of selling
days resulting from the extension of Lunar New Year, along with customer and logistics operations that are
ramping but not yet fully operational.

It's important to note, while we're forecasting the impact to our Q2 business, our full year outlook for total
Agilent revenues and EPS remains unchanged. Our business outside of China remains on a solid footing,
and we believe a large portion of our China business that is currently being impacted by the coronavirus is
not lost, but rather is delayed.

As you know, the coronavirus outbreak is unfortunately impacting the health and safety of tens of
thousands of people. I'm very proud of how the Agilent team has responded to do our part to help. Our
Agilent China team is exactly supporting those customers doing crucial research into the virus. We have
donated instruments and supplies to 4 clinical and research institutions based in China to support disease
research and drug development efforts. We continue to closely monitor events in China and are prepared
to act quickly to help wherever possible.

Now on to additional details of our quarterly results. Agilent's growth is broad-based as our business
grew across all regions and end markets. Regional performance was led by the Americas posting 5% core
growth, with America coming in with low single-digit results and Asia holding steady. Despite the timing
of the Lunar New Year and the coronavirus impact late in the quarter, our China business grew low single
digits, while all end markets grew our results led by strong growth in the biopharma and environmental
forensics markets.

Now taking a closer look at how the individual business units performed. LSAG revenues grew 5% on a
reported basis driven by strong performance in our biopharma and cell analysis business. On a core basis,
LSAG's revenues were down 2% against a tough compare and inclusive of the unexpected Q1 impact
from the coronavirus. With the exception of China, all regions and end markets performed in line with
expectations.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

The ACG business continued to deliver strong results, posting 7% core growth even with reduced selling
days in China. This growth was broad-based across all major market segments and regions. These
results continue to demonstrate the strength of our ACG CrossLab strategy and how we are leading the
transformation of the analytical lab.

DGG is also posting 7% growth in the quarter against a difficult 12% growth compare. We are
experiencing a continuation of positive trends, winning share in our core pathology business and seeing
strength in our NGS QA/QC franchise. We continue to be pleased with the revenue ramp at our new oligo
manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado.

In addition to driving strong financial results, I want to highlight some other notable events that took
place during the quarter. We continue to bring differential new products to the market, gaining strong
customer and external recognition. We just introduced the Agilent SureSelectXT HS2 DNA Kit. This, along
with our recently launched automated sample prep platform, Magnis, further strengthens our leadership
position in the NGS sample prep market.

In addition, 2 industry publications honored the Agilent InfinityLab LC/MSD iQ system with 2019
innovation awards. The award-winning mass spectrometer introduced last June incorporates intelligent
designed-in innovations such as embedded sensors that monitor instrument health.

And finally, early this month, Barron's named Agilent #1 in the list of the 2019 Most Sustainable
Companies in America. We're very proud of this recognition. Sustainability is a critical topic that is gaining
increased interest from customers, employees and investors. More importantly, we believe focusing on
sustainability is simply the right thing to do.

Before I pass the call on to Bob, I'd like to close with a reminder of Agilent's resilience and our shareholder
value-creation model, delivering above-market growth, expanding operating margin and a balanced
deployment of capital. We are able to thrive by focusing on platforms with multiple large end markets
and long-term growth opportunities. We're also driving growth in the aftermarket, increasing our focus on
faster-growing end markets, streamlining our infrastructure and operations and investing in the future of
Agilent, both organically and inorganically. We do all this while maintaining acute focus on delivering EPS
growth with superior quality of earnings and driving shareholder value creation.

Despite the temporary business uncertainty created by the coronavirus in China, I remain confident about
the longer-term growth prospects of the China market, our China growth energy and, most importantly,
our team.

I'm very proud and confident in the strength and resiliency of our China team and their ability to overcome
any near-term challenges that come our way. When I look at our global team and our business, our
growth prospects and team have never been stronger. We're laser-focused on driving revenue and
earnings growth. I'm pleased to tell you that all these factors allow us to maintain our growth and
earnings outlook for the year.

Thank you for being on the call, and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the
call to Bob. Bob?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail
on revenue, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and
then finish up with our updated guidance for Q2 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will
focus on non-GAAP results.

Our first quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across all regions and markets.
Revenue for the quarter was $1.36 billion with reported revenue growth of 5.7%. Currency negatively
impacted revenue by 0.4 percentage points, and acquisitions added 3.7 percentage points to growth. Our
core growth was 2.4% in the quarter.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

As Mike indicated, our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due
to the coronavirus. This reduced the number of shipping days in China, and we estimate shifted $10
million in revenue out of Q1. If not for the reduced shipping days in Q1, our performance would have been
stronger, with the shift affecting our core revenue growth by roughly 70 basis points.

In terms of end markets, we saw growth across all of our 6 end market segments. Pharma, environmental
and forensics and diagnostics and clinical led the way for us in the first quarter. During the quarter,
pharma grew 3%. Double-digit growth in DDG and high single-digit growth in ACG offset a mid-single-digit
decline for LSAG.

Within pharma, our biopharma, or large molecule segment, grew high single digits. And on a geographic
basis, our pharma business experienced high single-digit growth in the Americas and mid-single-digit
growth in Europe. This was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in China, largely associated with
the timing of the Lunar New Year and, to a lesser extent, the execution of the 4+7 program. The 4+7
program is playing out as we expected, with the third round completed in January and multiple winners
per drug. We continue to believe that this is a long-term positive for the industry as drug quality improves
and access to health care increases.

Our environmental and forensics business grew 4% against a very tough compare last year of 10%.
During the quarter, we saw balanced growth between instruments and aftermarket sales.

In diagnostics and clinical, revenue grew 3% against a strong 11% compared to last year. Mid-single-digit
growth in DGG driven by continued share gains in our pathology business were partially offset by declines
in LSAG and ACG, with both only having small businesses in this segment.

Chemical and energy revenue grew 2%. Services and consumables grew mid-single digits, offset by flat
instrument sales. Academia and government grew 1%, with services and consumables growing mid-single
digits, partially offset by flat instrument sales. Mid-single-digit growth in the Americas was partially offset
by flat to low single-digit declines in the other regions. And finally, food returned to modest growth, up
1%. Low-teens growth in services and consumables was partially offset by declines in instrumentation.
While one quarter does not make a trend, we are pleased with the continual progress in this market.

On a geographic basis, we saw growth in all regions led by America's growing mid-single digits. Europe
grew 2%, in line with our expectations. And as Mike mentioned, our business in China was running ahead
of expectations through the first 2 months of fiscal 2020. As mentioned earlier, despite the shift of the
$10 million, China still grew 1%. If not for the extension of the Lunar New Year, our core growth in China
would have been solidly mid-single digits.

Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.7%, down 120 basis points versus the prior
year. This is a result of the planned start-up costs for our new NASD facility as well as product mix and
some negative pricing effects on our instrumentation business. We offset 90 basis points as we leveraged
our cost basis and operating expenses. And as a result, our operating margin was 22.9%, down slightly
from 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. Adjusting for the $10 million coronavirus impact on revenue,
operating margins would have increased versus the prior year, and so we feel good about our continued
opportunity to expand operating margins. We were also able to lower our tax rate slightly to 15.5% and
expect that rate to continue for the rest of the year. This resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming
in at $0.81, at the top end of our guidance and representing 7% growth.

Before turning to second quarter guidance, I want to touch on a few other financial metrics. Our operating
cash flow was an outflow of $59 million, in line with expectations as we incurred the onetime tax outflow
of $226 million related to the transfer of intangibles, as noted last quarter. We also paid out $56 million in
dividends and purchased 726,000 shares for $60 million. We ended the quarter in a net debt position and
a net leverage ratio of 0.9x.

Now let's turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for Q2. We are anticipating revenues in the range of
$1.28 billion to $1.32 billion in the second quarter. This range is larger than we've traditionally provided as
we've intended to estimate an impact of the coronavirus on our business in the second quarter. As this is

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

a fluid situation, we thought it would be helpful to detail out our assumptions, particularly as we've seen
impact across both Q1 and Q2.

Our guidance contemplates a $25 million to $50 million impact in our first half of our fiscal year, which
translates to roughly to a 1.5- to 3-week impact on China revenues. Of this, we saw $10 million in Q1, and
we are estimating a net $15 million to $40 million incremental impact in Q2.

The Q2 revenue range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion translates into reported growth of 3.4% to 6.6%
with core growth of 1% to 4%. Currency is expected to have a negative 1.1% impact, while M&A is
expected to contribute 3.5% to 3.7% in the quarter. We are estimating the coronavirus to negatively
impact our Q2 core growth by 1 to 3 points.

Our revenue outlook translates Q2 earnings in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share or 1.4% to 7%
growth versus last year. Importantly, as Mike mentioned, we believe the majority of this business is not
lost, rather delayed as customers and the government ramp and recover. In addition, our business outside
of China remains strong. As such, we expect a larger second half of the year and are not changing our full
year guidance for revenue or EPS.

So before starting up the call for questions, I want to conclude by saying we had a very solid start to the
year that shows the strength and breadth of our portfolio. It is that portfolio, coupled with the strength of
the Agilent team that despite the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, we are maintaining our full year
outlook.

With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A.

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions]

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I appreciate you guys quantifying the corona impact. I guess a couple of things. I mean you've previously
talked about mid-single-digit China expectations for the full year. So should we assume that's still the
case, just more back-end loaded?

And then, Mike, as we think about collateral damage within China, how should we think about the C&E
market, just given that the broader economic activity in China is slowing? So should we think about some
impact on C&E as well?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Tycho. I think I'll handle both questions. And Bob, correct me if I go off script here, but I think -- we
still think that the mid-single-digit number is doable for the year in China. What we're seeing already on
ground from our team, we're just on the phone today with our team in China. We're still able to transact
and orders are actually coming in as forecast. I think that -- we think a lot of the procurement is going
to occur a little bit later in the year. I think a lot of it's recoverable with the exception of probably some
aspects of our service business, where customers really are looking for service people to arrive on their
sites. I think we feel pretty good about how we're thinking about China throughout the rest of the year,
albeit being a very fluid situation.

And we really haven't seen any kind of transitory or connected impact on C&E. In fact, C&E actually did
better than we were thinking in the first quarter. It's too early to call a trend, but some of the PMIs are
actually inching up, which would maybe give an indication of perhaps a better outlook and some initial
noise with some of our major accounts about thinking on procurement. But we still remain cautious in
terms of the outlook for C&E, but we're encouraged by the Q1 results. And again, we're not really seeing
any significant movements around in that area on a global basis. And we think, back to the first comment
on China, we weren't expecting a lot in C&E this year in China, anyway. So I think we're in pretty solid
shape relative to the outlook there as well.

Tycho W. Peterson
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then a follow-up on biopharma. You grew 3% on a 10% comp. Last quarter, it was 7% on a 14%
comp. So was that a pull-forward last quarter? And if so, can you maybe talk to that dynamic?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

No. I think the big story there is China, right?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. That's exactly right, Mike. There's 2 elements there. One is the shifting of the Lunar New Year from
Q1 into Q2 as well as the impact -- Q2 into Q1, excuse me, as well as the extension of the Lunar New Year
holiday. So those are the 2 primary pieces.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Yes. And then within the pharma numbers, Tycho, the biopharma segment really was strong for us again
this quarter as well. And then we think as the 4+7 initiative rolls out in the latter part of this year, then
we'll see the growth in the small molecule side of that space. And then we have really strong growth in
NASD and the ACG business, strong in pharma. So we're feeling pretty good about pharma.

Operator

Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen.

Ryan Blicker
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

This is Ryan on for Doug. Maybe just to round out the China dynamic quickly, can you provide some more
color on your supply chain exposure within China? It sounds like the operating environment is improving.
But how should we think about your direct and indirect supply chain exposure? And do you see any risk to
your ability to fulfill demand within and outside of China over the course of this year?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Sure, Ryan. Thanks for that question. So as I touched briefly onto my call script, we actually have
resumed production and are in a really solid position right now to not only ship a product to our customers
in China, but also products that are manufactured in China to have them exported into the global market
environment.

And as we have a very diversified global footprint in terms of supply chain and manufacturing capabilities,
we think, for the near term, we're in pretty solid shape relative to ability to meet our commitments from
a shipment perspective. And then you also may recall that starting with the initiation of the U.S.-based
tariffs, we actually had initiated a movement of a lot of our supply chain out of China. So it actually has
mitigated our risk here as well.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Ryan, this is Bob. Just to follow up. We have twice-weekly calls with our team in China, inclusive of
logistics as well as our supply chain. And obviously, it's quite dynamic. But as it currently stands today,
we feel like we have the ability to be able to procure not only raw materials, but also produce the finished
goods and ship not only within China, but also get product into China and vice versa.

Ryan Blicker
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just following up with a brief 2-parter. Number one, on the food market, it sounds
like things were improving a bit prior to this coronavirus dynamic. Can you talk a little bit more about what
you are seeing in the market? And if you think that the China portion of that market specifically could be
poised to return to growth as we get past this coronavirus dynamic?

And then specifically for gross margin, can you talk about what the timing headwind was for the quarter
versus the other dynamics that you called out?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Do you want to take this, Bob?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, yes. So on food, as I mentioned, we certainly are pleased with the progress. We have had several
quarters of kind of very predictable performance there and actually Q1, despite the coronavirus, it
probably had more impact on the pharma side than in food, grew 1% on a global basis. It was down

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

slightly in China, but certainly not to the level that it had been in the past. So we feel good about that.
It's probably too early to call that it's going to return to growth long term. We do believe it will return to
growth, but not ready to call that in this fiscal year.

In terms of the timing of the coronavirus, that $10 million, that was a quite a large incremental because
we had all the costs. So that was probably a higher-than-normal kind of incremental drop to the bottom
line. That was probably a little over $0.01 of impact on the full quarter.

Operator

Your next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays.

Jack Meehan
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I was hoping maybe you could give us -- can you give us an update on the NASD rollout at the new site?
And how much that contributed to the quarter in both DGG and the pharma end market?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

So as I imagine, you maybe get a little tired of hearing this from Bob and myself. I'm going to pull Sam
into this conversation. But as we highlighted in the call script, the NASD business continues to ramp as
we'd expect. Really pleased with the progress on how we're starting to fill up that factory. Still not yet at
full capacity, operating at full capacity yet, but it was a contributor to our growth in the first quarter, no
doubt. And Sam, anything else you'd like to add there?

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

No. Mike, you hit the nail on the head. It is that the business is performing as we've expected. We
continue to see interest in all the customers, the pharma customers that we've given tours to. We're doing
work now there for a number of customers. Not to be boring, nothing new to report. It is progressing.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

It's all good news right now.

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

Yes.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would just add, Jack. As we had talked about, this will ramp up and be a more material impact in
the second half of the year. It's progressing as we expected. It had a slight impact to the DGG and a slight
impact to the overall Agilent organic core growth, and we're very pleased with the progress.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Bob, I think there's maybe just one more point, too. I mean look at the second half outlook for the
business, it's not all about China recovery. The other elements of the business, including NASD, which we
know we're going to have a strong second half.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

That's right.

Jack Meehan
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. One follow-up on DGG. The core growth of 7%, not to nitpick it too much, but was there anything
that was a little softer in the quarter in that segment? Just knowing some of the other growth drivers
relative to how the segment was growing last year.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

I think it was really -- this is Mike, Jack. And Sam, feel free to jump in on this. We had a 12% growth last
year. So a tough compare. We had solid growth across all elements of that business. And outside of again
maybe a China impact for an element of the business, I mean things are firing on all cylinders across the
business, is how I recall.

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

Yes. That's right, Mike. I mean we had -- we continue to have good growth with market, above market,
with our overall NGS portfolio. So we feel good about that in the low double digits. Our pathology
business, as you heard in Mike's opening comments and Bob's as well, we believe we'll continue to gain
share there, growing in the mid-single digits. So -- and you just heard about NASD. So you look at the
major parts of DGG, we had, I think, a really well balanced good quarter.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

It's mainly just to compare [indiscernible]

Your next question comes from Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just a couple of things to circle back to. One, what decelerated in the Americas in the quarter? Your
growth rate in that region had been trending higher than 5% for quite some time.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Dan, welcome back, and I appreciate the question. It's really a combination of a very tough compare.
I would say probably the area that was a little softer was the instrumentation business. They had a very --
the most difficult compare in the first quarter, and we would expect that to improve in Q2 through Q4 as
we get to easier compares.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I know, Jacob, you were looking into this. So...

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes. And I think the continued depressed PMI certainly impacts the C&E business, chemical and energy
business. So we continue to see that in U.S. being performing at least flat, and we would like to see
improvement. But I think it's still -- going to still take some time before that is happening.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Sure. And then a related question, Bob. You mentioned when discussing the gross margin dynamics that
there were some negative pricing effects on the instrument business. Could you elaborate on that? Or are
you pulling maybe the pricing lever to drive more demand in the instrument business after 4 quarters in a
row of soft demand in LSAG?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Dan, I just can't help but to jump in on this one. And I think that question would be posed to our
competitors because we saw -- particularly as we finished the calendar year, we saw some very aggressive
pricing by some of our competitors, particularly in the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry
platforms. And I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Jacob?

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

No. I think it's fair to say that we continue to be premium-priced, but there is certainly some competition
in the market space right now. And yes, so there is a price pressure.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

But we don't play the price game here. I mean that's not how we want to win.

Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi.

Jesse Klink;Citi;Analyst

This is Jesse on for Patrick. First, just wanted to touch on the China impact, and I think you guys had laid
out about 1% impact to core growth from that. I just wanted to understand how that kind of compared to
your expectations that if coronavirus -- made that a lot worse than anticipated.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Maybe just to be crystal clear here. We saw roughly a 70 basis point impact in Q1. We had product
that was getting ready. It was staged and getting ready to ship. And on the last couple of days of January
and with the extension of the Lunar New -- the formal holiday, there was no one there to pick that up. So
we know that was clearly an impact in Q1.

In terms of Q2, what we're expecting between the -- the first half of our year, it's roughly a 1.5- to 3-
week impact as we're ramping up and most of that's happening in Q2. We're expecting in Q2 that the
coronavirus has roughly a 1- to 3-point impact to our growth in Q2, roughly $15 million to $40 million. In
the first half, it's $25 million to $50 million, and we'll expect to get that back in the second half of the --
our fiscal year.

Jesse Klink;Citi;Analyst

Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe one on the BioTek acquisition. Just wondering how that business
performed relative to expectations and just kind of how the customer reception has been so far as you've
kind of broadened the portfolio offering there.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Jesse, I happen to hit that right up, and relative to expectations, that's ahead of our expectations.
It really has been just a tremendous addition to the company. And we were talking about this the other
day inside the company. Typically, when you put together a deal scenario, it's often out of the gate. You
don't see a team beating the revenue numbers all the time, and that is actually what we saw in the case
of BioTek in the first full quarter as part of Agilent.

And Jacob, I know you've been talking with customers. And how are you thinking about the BioTek being
part of Agilent?

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes. Again, I just want to underscore once again that we've been very pleased with the performance of
BioTek while it's been here in Agilent. But not only BioTek, the whole cell analysis business is doing very
well, and we are posting double-digit growth for the whole business. So we're very pleased with that, and
we actually believe this is going to continue for quite a long time.

We see lifestyle analysis is going to be a key driver for understanding the immune system and immuno-
oncology. And with -- and all the Seahorse, ACEA and BioTek and Luxcel combined, we have a very unique
value proposition. And that is really what excites us. And what also is very exciting for customers is that
when we combine those technologies, these techniques together, we can create more insights for the
researchers and the biopharma customers that nobody else in the industry can do. So this is very exciting,
and we're just getting started.

Your next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

So first question on Europe. You pointed 2% growth there. I was hoping to get a view from you on outlook
and what you're baking in the guidance here.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

I guess, Bob, why don't I just talk about the performance, and you can maybe comment on the outlook.
So came in right as expected. And I think that Europe is in a difficult economic environment, and we think
our team is really doing well there relative to what's going on in the market environment. So we were
actually quite pleased with how Q1 came out for us in Europe. And Bob, in terms of the outlook?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, yes. So Puneet, as Mike said, we were pleased with the outlook of being 2%, and that's kind of what
we're forecasting in Q2 and the rest of the year. And so certainly, the team is doing a really great job
being able to deliver in a tough environment. But it kind of hit where we expect, and that's kind of what
we're expecting for the rest of the year as well.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Okay. That's very helpful. If I could touch back on China, I know you covered quite a bit. But if I -- really
appreciate your thoughts there given one of the strongest legacy positions in that country for Agilent.
As the recovery happens here, are there certain segments which you think where you will see more
acceleration, more faster recovery, certain product lines or certain segments where you see recovery
faster versus others?

And then I was sort of also surprised with the growth you were seeing in ACG, just CrossLabs continues
to deliver. Was trying to understand what sort of exposure you had there in China. And given the travel
restrictions and everything, are you still able to ship products and service instruments, seeing the growth
in CrossLabs here? Or was that -- how much was the impact in CrossLab, if you could quantify it.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Puneet, let me take -- there was a lot into that question. So let me try to hit them. In terms of
recovery, we would expect that, obviously, the instrumentation portion would recover within that --
probably pharma first, and so we would expect that to be prioritized over some of the other markets.

In terms of ACG, we continue to be pleased by the broad-based strength there actually. Even in China,
despite kind of the reduced selling days, it grew 11%. We do expect probably a slower ramp-up there, less
on the consumable side as the factories are getting back to production, but more on the services side. As
you can imagine, having our folks getting into labs right now is fairly difficult, and there's a portion of that
would be on demand for servicing equipment. And so we would see that probably ramp up a little slower
in Q2, but then ramp back up to normal latter half of Q2 and into Q3 and Q4, at least that's our current
assumption.

As Mike mentioned, we've been in close contact with our teams in China and have been watching the order
flow, and the order flow to date is across both ACG and LSAG as well as our DGG business, which is a
smaller piece, tracking to our expectations.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Okay. And any sense on terms of the exposure that you have in China? And could that mix change given
the -- in the next quarter or so?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

No. I don't anticipate a major shift. We've largely got a instrument-heavy business in China relative to the
rest of the business anyway. But our opportunity really lies in the consumables and service over time. So I
don't see a dramatic change in Q2 or in the back half of the year.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

Your next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel.

Daniel Anthony Arias
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Mike, just back to Tycho's biopharma question. Next quarter, I think the comp goes way down to low
singles for that customer segment. So where are you feeling like biopharma growth heads in 2Q as we just
think about the momentum and the favorable comparison but also China? Can that be more mid-singles
when we net out the moving parts there?

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

CEO, President & Director

Dan, I think that's a reasonable expectation. So what I was asking earlier about the comment on pharma,
we remain confident about our ability to grow in pharma. Part of it's going to be the pickup and the
continuing growth that we're going to have in our NASD business. We also know that we're getting to
some of the easier compares relative to the LSAG instrument business. Because as you will all recall,
that's -- the Q2 is when we started seeing the slowdown as China went through this whole -- looking at
their procurement practices around the generics. So we think there's a lot of good reason to be positive
about the ability to have a higher growth rate in the outer quarters than we did in Q1 in our pharma
business.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And we're expecting a faster growth in Q2.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

Daniel Anthony Arias
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe one again for you, Mike, or maybe even Sam. It feels like 1Q is always a good time
to ask this question, just given that some of us are heading down to AGBT. Any update you can give us on
Lasergen product development? How much of a focus is that at this point? And then maybe what are you
looking at in terms of the change in total investment there if we compare 2020 to 2019?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

So -- and I think, Sam, you're getting your bags packed, maybe your team is getting their bags packed to
head to that -- you're staying home. That's right. Okay. Maybe just a few comments on this. So...

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

Yes. Overall -- thanks for the question, Dan. If you would have heard my comments already from
JPMorgan, we're making progress on a number of fronts related to the development work we're doing on
the Lasergen sequencer, particularly as it comes to the technical specs on our read length, on our quality
and so forth. So we're continuing to make that progress.

When you think about AGBT, of course, it's not just about sequencers, it's about the overall NGS workflow,
it's about really looking at beyond NGS, overall genomics. So we are excited about Magnis, which we
introduced not too long ago. We are seeing -- sorry, to remind you, Magnis is this really walk-away
automation for taking DNA libraries or actually putting DNA in and being able to come back and just
load that directly onto your NGS sequencer. We've seen some really good interest in that in Europe, in
America and in China. So we're going to continue sharing the message there and sharing some data from
a number of customers.

We also, as you would have heard us talk about, we have launched a new SureSelectXT HS2 DNA reagent
kit, which allows us to look at even lower starting amounts down to 10 nanograms of DNA from FFPE,
which is very important for cancer. Also allows on Illumina sequencers. It's very important to be able
to use molecular bar codes. We have that going on as well. And we have a number of partnerships that
we're working on with a number of customers and collaborators. So stay tuned. I think it's going to be an
exciting AGBT.

Michael R. McMullen

Investment outlook and...

Robert W. McMahon

Yes. So our -- just quickly, our spending forecast in 2018 or...

Michael R. McMullen

2020.

Robert W. McMahon

2020 is the same as 2019. So we're not expecting any ramp-up.

Operator

Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I have a number of -- got a number of questions. So the first one is, I guess, just on the gross margin
outlook for 2020. Can you sort of walk us through the next couple of quarters in terms of how that looks?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We talked about -- at the beginning of the year, our guide was contemplating roughly a flattish gross
margin across the company, and that hasn't changed. So we've always said that the first half of the year
with Q1 being the hardest comparison because of the start-up costs in NASD, and you can see that kind of
in our numbers. We also were affected a little, as we mentioned before, in LSAG. We would expect that to
recover as we get through the course of the year.

So in -- at a high level, Derik, I would expect our gross margins still to be within that range, roughly flat
year-over-year. And where we're getting our operating leverage is really in the OpEx expense line.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And Bob, I think we're also looking to see maybe a more favorable mix in our instrument business as we
move forward. And I made some comments about the pricing pressure that we saw more of a calendar
year-end kind of phenomena with pricing more stabilizing as we started the 2020.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes.

17

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Well, great. That segues into my next question on instruments. And so I think you had said last quarter,
you were expecting maybe flattish instruments for the full year. Is that still sort of your expectation? And
then that leads into a -- any idea of sort of what pent-up demand could be? I mean do you sense from
customers, particularly in C&E, there's people waiting on the sidelines to buy when the budget gets better?
I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of what the instrument dynamic look like.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Derik, this is Bob. I think short answer on your first question is yes. We're still in that range of
roughly flat. Actually, if you looked at Q1, we were down 2% core. But if you adjusted for the coronavirus,
it would have been down about 1% on the most difficult comp that we had.

To your point around C&E, there were -- there have been shoots of life, and some of our customers
looking at things now. What I would say is the coronavirus kind of throws some of that into question. But I
would say that's still intact right now. I don't know, Jacob, if you have anything.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

No. Overall, I do think that there is some pushed out pent-up demand here. And eventually, there will be a
tech refresh, and we have invested over the past period quite a lot into our instrument portfolio and really
refreshed across the whole portfolio. So when that pent-up demand is coming forward, we're ready, but
we just can't call it right now exactly when that's going to happen.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And Jacob, I'd just add one thing. Early on in my tenure, we had a similar kind of slowdown in C&E.
The difference here is that, at that time, a lot of our platforms are rather aged. This time, we have a
completely refreshed platform. So it also is a great productivity message there to customers. And our lab
managers obviously have the ability to go to their management and say, "Listen, there is something new
out there. I'm not buying this. I'm not replacing like-for-like."

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then just one, maybe I missed something, but you did 3.7% contribution from M&A in the
first quarter, 3.5% to 3.7% in the second quarter. And then the guide for the full year is 2.8% to 2.9%.
Is it something else in the first half of the year besides BioTek? Or -- and if not, are you expecting -- why
you're expecting a step-down?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

So you've got very good math, and we're not expecting a step-down. That is the only thing that's in the
numbers, and that could be an area of potential opportunity.

Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Mike, just on a separate topic, can you just sort of speak to the Twist settlement last week? Why only
$25 million? And should we expect any legal savings from having that case out of the way now that you'll

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Yes. So first of all, just a few comments on the settlement. So we're very pleased with the agreement
that was reached with Twist. As you know, we think it's in the best interest of our shareholders to
rigorously protect our IP. And not only in addition to receiving a payment from Twist, they also had to
secure a license for us for certain aspects of our oligo synthesis technology. And we are a company that's
committed doing innovation in the right way. So we're really pleased with how the settlement goes. And
Bob, relative to the treatment of the legal expenses and outlook for the rest of the year? I think we have
that in pro forma, right?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We will pro forma that. That's correct.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

So you see both the settlement come in, Brandon, as well as the costs associated with that, I guess, in our
Q2 results? Yes.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

That's correct.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then maybe one more higher-level question for you, Mike. I mean you mentioned sustainability, that
recognition. Clearly, that's becoming a much bigger focus, I think, for the investment community. Can you
just help us contextualize how that focus may help contribute to your growth or cash flow or differentiate
you in terms of the customer base?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It's a great question. So as I mentioned in my call script, we've been doing these things because we
thought it's the right thing to do, and now people are really paying attention to it. So I think it helps on
multiple aspects of the business.

So first of all, relative to our new products, which have a very favorable environmental impact, there's
a real compelling reason for customers because a lot of our most important customers have their own
sustainability initiatives, and they're very interested. I'm going -- I have several European customers I'm
visiting next month, and they want to hear about our sustainability plans. So when you talk to them about
how we're reducing footprint, the electrical consumption, that some of our products don't even use gases
and that we've eliminated the use of gases and gas chromatography or in the case of NPIS. So there's just
a really -- and we're reducing the size of the packaging.

And by the way, that also comes with a benefit to Agilent's P&L. So it really helps in terms of our customer
relationships and our ability to drive sales into those accounts. It also is really quite helpful for recruiting
of new employees into the company. New employees, when they're looking at potentially joining the
company, really want to know what Agilent stands for. And we talk to them about our culture and what
we do as a company in the local community, what we do for the environment, our views on diversity and
inclusion. And I think it really is a powerful message to attract new employees to Agilent, but also for
those who are part of the Agilent team to really be proud of the company they work for and be energized
about where the company is going forward.

I think we've talked before, I'm a big fan of sports. And if you build a great team, you get great things
happen in the marketplace around the field. And I think that really is really one of the major benefits you
get here, which is what it does for your team. So really is a multitude of impact for the customers -- I
mean for the company, and it's something we really believe in.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

One maybe on China, Mike. We've heard some chirps possibly the government doing -- initiating some
sort of stimulus here to kickstart the economy. If that were to be the case, where would that impact fall?
Is that in C&E and food? Is that where we would see your China numbers coming up?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Well, I have to say I have heard some rumblings of stimulus, but I haven't seen anything around the
specifics of where the stimulus would be. I don't know, Bob, or whether you have anything.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

No. But I think your guess is...

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

I think that's a likely area.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, exactly. I think that's a likely area, that and pharma.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And also, I'd also expect environmental as well. So that would be my guess because these are major
quality-of-life initiatives that the Chinese government has been behind. So my guess is that's where they
would put the stimulus. But again, we don't have any specifics. That would just be pure speculation on my
part at this point in time.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. And Bob, a quick one on the EPS guidance here. I see that the tax rate ticked down
sequentially on the guidance front. Did anything change on the margins at all? Because it looks like for --
the revenue range remain unchanged. So I'm wondering if this is below the line or margins -- some sort of
impact here?

Stephen Christopher Beuchaw
Wolfe Research, LLC

I guess, first, I wanted to start with Bob with just a question about one of the underpinnings of the
outlook for the year that hasn't been touched on so much just yet, and it's NASD. Maybe a 2-parter on
NASD. One is, do you think we feel good about getting to a few dozen million dollars of contribution from

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

NASD? And then can you give us any perspective? And I guess maybe this is a Sam question. As to how
much of the capacity on the new facility in Frederick is now contracted? And then I have one for Mike.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. I -- let me make sure I answer your question correctly. What I would say is Q1 came in slightly
better than what we expected on the ramp. So we feel very good about that trajectory. Obviously, the
second half of the year is going to be significantly greater than the first half of the year as we ramp up
that business. And I would say that the order book, we feel very good about, yes.

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

And maybe, Steve, to build on what Bob said, we've said that there is a ramp rate that we've been
planning all along. That's what we're seeing. So as you really get into Q4, we'll be much more in the run
rate, if you will, of what to expect going into financial year 2021 in terms of the Frederick site in particular.
So it's ramping as planned. It is being utilized. We were happy to produce good product and good revenue
from that in this quarter again after starting last quarter.

And further to what Bob said, a lot of these programs and projects are long lead, both working with
our customers to really lay the groundwork and do the work. So though I can't tell you exactly what
percentage, I do feel good about the percentage of programs and projects that we're already lining up
going into next year.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And Steve, if I can exemplify one of the points that Sam made. It was absolutely crucial that those first
batches we produce for customers met their expectations. And as you know, we are very cautious in terms
of how we are sort of positioning the ramp here because we just had to get it right, and we've gotten it
right for those first few customers. I think that really positions us well when we look at the outlook for the
rest of the year.

Stephen Christopher Beuchaw
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That makes a ton of sense. And then, Mike, I wonder if we could just do the zoom-out thing,
if you will. We're -- we think about the full year. I mean, there are so many moving parts, right? And
the coronavirus certainly makes it more complicated. But if I rewind to 90 days ago or so, there was
a perspective, not necessarily from Agilent, but certainly in investor conversations that the outlook for
fiscal '20 was really conservative or significantly conservative. And I think we've, of course, heard from
you guys over the years outlook that started at one point and you pretty consistently do better than the
outlook. I wonder if you could just give us your perspective on the outlook and guidance philosophy now
that you know 90 days more than you did at the time you gave the outlook at the beginning of the year.
To what extent is this middle of the fairway? To what extent is this conservative? And as you talk to your
customers and you think about the outlook, I mean, how are you feeling, and how has that evolved? Just,
again, really zooming out.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Steve. So I'm in the conference room zooming out right now, and great question. And I think that
that's how we had thought about the full year guide, which I'll leave it to you to prescribe the first
adjective -- I mean the proper adjective. But we started this year with a guide that we thought was
relatively the floor of what we could do and talked about areas of potential upside for the business.
And we were actually tracking well in the first quarter, where it would have been a beat both on the
revenue and EPS side of the quarter, albeit the impact of the -- much talked about today, the impact of the
coronavirus.

So that's why we felt pretty confident about our ability to say, "Listen, there are still a lot of puts and
takes relative to China in the near term. But there are other aspects of the business that are doing
extremely well outside of China, whether it be NASD or ACG business, the compares and the strength of
our LSAG instrument portfolio, that's going on NGS." So we have a lot -- and then back to cell analysis. So
we have a lot of confidence.

And we -- what we are let me call it in the middle of the fairway right now, but we feel pretty...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would say, Steve, one thing, obviously, 90 days ago, we didn't have the epidemic that we're seeing
right now, which is unprecedented. And so what we're trying to do is we're saying, hey, in the first half of
the year, we're expecting a $25 million to $50 million impact that we're going to make up in the second
half of the year. Now the question is how fast. And we hope for everyone's sake that, that will ramp up
fast, and we'll get this behind us. But that certainly puts a lot more variability in our forecast. We feel good
about where our forecast is, but we certainly didn't anticipate that at the beginning of the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Sandler.

William Robert Quirk
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So I guess, Bob or Mike, just update on M&A. You had mentioned on the last call that you'd be considering
looking at larger deals in and around $1 billion. Just curious what the update is.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

I think the statement I made in the last quarterly call remains, which is we think that deploying our capital
towards growth in earnings drivers on M&A front makes a lot of sense. We -- for our shareholders in deals
that make sense for us, in markets that we know where we can really leverage the scale of the company.
And we did our largest deal of BioTek the past quarter. And as you heard earlier, that's off to a really good
start.

I think we often get the question, "Well, how large are you willing to go?" And the way Bob and I have
described it is, "Listen, we could go maybe multiples of that, but we're not looking to -- we're looking
to stay in our lane here and not do anything that's magnitudes larger than a BioTek." So I'm not saying
that BioTek is the max level, but it'd probably be multiple to that as opposed to something that's of a
magnitude size.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Bill, as you can appreciate, timing there is always very difficult to understand, and we're going
to remain disciplined. And if there isn't anything out there that would meet our financial criteria, we're
not going to do it. We don't need to do M&A to make our model work. But certainly, you see in the first
quarter the benefit that we've seen with BioTek and really building scale and cell analysis, which we think
has a long-term growth opportunity for us, not only in LSAG but across the business.

William Robert Quirk
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Understood. And then just secondly, I guess, a bigger-picture question about the pacing of CrossLab. Over
the course of the year, we are going to be heading into slightly more difficult comps for the next couple of
quarters.

Senior VP & CFO

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Yes. The beauty of ACG has been its predictability across the business, and we're expecting -- we're not
expecting any dramatic change in the back half of the year with the possible exception of slightly an
elevated ramp in China. But that business that Mark and team have built has been just phenomenal in
terms of providing stable, high-growth and profitable growth over the course of the last several years.
And I think that, that, quite honestly, is a great legacy to what Mark has been able to accomplish. And not
only that, it really speaks to what our customers are looking for in terms of productivity in the labs and so
forth. So we would expect that to continue to kind of chug along as we've talked about in the past.

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations

All right. Thanks, everyone. With that, we would like to wrap the call for today. Have a great rest of your
day.

Operator
