CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. And welcome to the Q1 2020 Earnings Call for ConocoPhillips. My name is Anera, and I'll
be the operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis. Ellen, you may begin.

Ellen R. DeSanctis
Senior Vice President of Corporate Relations

Thanks, Anera. And good morning to our listeners. Thank you for joining us today to discuss this
morning's press release, which contained our first quarter earnings results, our dividend declaration
announcement and an update on our curtailment actions. Our speakers today will be Ryan Lance, our
Chairman and CEO; our Chief Operating Officer, Matt Fox; and our Chief Financial Officer, Don Wallette.
Ryan will make some very short opening comments, but we'll reserve most of the time on today's call for
the question-and-answer session. We don't have any slides this morning, but we will post a replay of this
call shortly.

As you know, given market volatility, we have temporarily suspended guidance. However, we may make
some forward-looking statements in today's call. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of the
risks and uncertainties that could impact future performance.

And now I'll turn the call over to Ryan.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Ellen, and welcome to today's call. Well, here we are at the start of first quarter earnings for
the E&P sector, and it's a brave new world for all of us. Ordinarily, we would use this call to discuss our
recent quarter results in detail and provide guidance for future periods, but the first quarter already feels
like a long time ago. And as you know, due to significant uncertainty and volatility in the markets, we will
temporarily suspend guidance. So here we are.

But while we won't provide guidance, we continue to believe it's important for ConocoPhillips to provide
insights. How are we thinking about this environment? What actions are we taking or considering taking to
respond? And that's how we'll intend to use this conference call time today.

I'll make some very brief remarks, then turn the call over to our listeners for a question-and-answer
session.

There are 3 themes I want to emphasize in these remarks. First, our underlying business is running
very well. You saw our first quarter results in this morning's press release. It was quite a strong quarter
operationally despite the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm certainly very proud of our organization. While some
activities are changing day-to-day, I assure you that our workforce is all in on safely delivering the
business, including our upcoming seasonal turnarounds and our ongoing capital activity.

The second theme I want to emphasize in these prepared remarks won't surprise anybody. It's this. The
next few months are going to be very bumpy for the industry and for us. A couple of weeks ago, we
announced plans to begin voluntary curtailments in May. This morning, we announced that we expect to
curtail about 265,000 barrels per day gross in May from our Lower 48 and Surmont combined. We'll --
we also announced that we'll expect to curtail about 460,000 barrels of oil per day gross in June from our
Lower 48, Surmont and Alaska combined. On a net basis, this represents about 1/3 of our first quarter
production. This should be seen as a clear signal that we're willing to use flexibility and balance sheet
strength to protect value for our shareholders.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

And that brings me to the third theme of these remarks. In our previous 2 market update conference calls,
we've emphasized that our actions in this environment are driven not only by our view of the markets,
but by the fact that we entered this downturn in a relatively advantaged position compared to most of
the industry. You saw in today's press release that we ended the quarter with total liquidity of nearly $14
billion, including the $6 billion available under our revolver. Our portfolio is diversified and relatively low
decline. These are the factors that allow us to make rational decisions based on a reasonable views, and
we can continue to assess and monitor the markets then act.

We continue to manage the business in a way that preserves our strong relative position, allows us to take
additional actions, if needed, and protects our ability to resume programs in the future.

So in summary, here's what I want you to take from my comments. The underlying business is running
well. We had a strong first quarter operationally, all things considered, and our workforce remains focused
on safely delivering our plans. We expect a period of significant volatility over the short term. We know
what we need to do. And we are relatively advantaged coming into this downturn, and we'll protect that
relative advantage as this environment plays out.
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator, and we'll begin our Q&A.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.

Douglas Todd Terreson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So Ryan, your production curtailment seem to have been more market responsive than peers, which may
have to do with your higher proportion of operated production, your working interests or your -- or other
factors. So my question is, are these the primary drivers of your curtailment decisions? Are there other
control or economic factors that play into it?

And then also, what are the risks to recoverability for your portfolio after output starts to be restored if
you think that they're meaningful?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Doug. I can probably take the first one, and Matt, maybe can provide a little bit of color on
the second part of that. Honestly, Doug, we'd be curtailing as much as we could right now. And I think
we just don't think it's right to be accepting these kinds of netback prices for the product that we're
producing. We've got a very strong balance sheet, as I said in my remarks.

We're taking a modeling sort of short and the longer-term scenarios to guide our decisions, and these
curtailment decisions are guided by the way we see the market playing out over the short term. We
certainly have more control over things that we operate. We expect things to be coming from governments
and infrastructure curtailments, but these are the things we can proactively go to do based on our recent
view of the market and based on our capacity that we've got on the balance sheet to do these kinds of
things.

In our view, we see this as a sign of strength, and we're deploying that, and I think, acting in a reasonable
fashion. So I'd let Matt maybe talk a little bit about the -- what recovery would look like on the back end
of these curtailments with improved markets.

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Doug, I think there's 2 aspects to the -- to that answer. One is how quickly can we bring production
back? And are we taking any risks associated with the curtailment of reservoir down into other lines. And
basically, we can bring the production back across North Slope, Canada, Alaska within a few weeks. It
doesn't take months to bring it back, so the majority of it can be bought -- brought back very quickly.

And -- but to get to full production in a matter of weeks, we are making sure that we're not doing
anything that's going to take any risk either from a reservoir or wells or facilities perspective. That's why
we're -- in Surmont, we're going down to a minimum rate so that we can still provide enough heat and
temperature to the steam chambers to keep them intact. In Lower 48, we've got a very specific set of
protocols as to how we shut down and prepare those wells for restart.

In Alaska, we're not shutting in completely. We're getting down to a rate that's the -- a minimum sort
of operating level that we can consistently operate at for a period of time. Across all of these, there's no
risk of reservoir damage there. So we can come back in a couple of weeks, and there's no risk of any
permanent damage.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Okay. And then also, Ryan, there's been a lot of commentary surrounding prorationing of supply that
would be mandated by regulators over the past several weeks. So I just wanted to see where you stand
on that topic and how you think it's going to play out.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We haven't been supportive of that, Doug, from a regulatory perspective because we think the
market is going to ration that very quickly and -- either through both voluntary-type cuts that we're taking
or infrastructure and storage-related cuts that become involuntary, I guess, to some degree for maybe us
and other operators as well.

So the market is reacting. The market's working, and it's going to drive supply down to kind of match
inventory levels and what the demand or what the refineries can take on the other end. So we haven't
been supportive of efforts that like the Railroad Commission recently has been analyzing and thinking
about.

Operator

Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess we've heard different things from different companies about the shut-in, elective shut-ins and
reservoir issues, and I heard your answers to the first question. But I was just curious, can you give us
any examples of what brings you confidence about reservoir -- maintaining reservoir integrity as you go
through the shutdowns that you are doing or will be doing in May, will be doing in June? And then if they
continue beyond that, what gives you that confidence?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Roger, that's a fair question. The -- it's really because to some extent, we go through this on a regular
basis in our field generally just for a shorter duration. For example, in Alaska, every other year, we do a
full turnaround at Alpine. And we go through shutdowns or turnarounds on different processing facilities in
Kuparuk. So we know how to take the wells down and keep them in good condition and bring them back
on again.

The same is true in Surmont. I mean occasionally, we've had to put Surmont fully shut down because of
wildfires, where we've had to go down very quickly. So we know how to how to handle that as well. And in
the Lower 48, the most recent example, for example, in June, Hurricane Harvey. Eagle Ford, we had to go
down. So we've got plenty of experience that gives us confidence that we know how to handle this. We've
got the advantage just now that we can plan it, and we can get it.

And so there's no reason to be particularly concerned about that. We also understand what our decline
rates are. And we also understand what our flush production is that comes back after shut-ins. So that
gives us everything that we need to make a sensible economic analysis as well. So trust me, Roger, this is
all pretty well thought through.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Well, I didn't doubt it wasn't thought through. I was just mostly trying to understand where the experience
comes from because there are some different attitudes out there. Switching gears a little bit. Don,
obviously, significant liquidity in the company. I was just curious, is there anything else you're looking at
balance sheet-wise? And I'm not just thinking about revolvers or new debt or anything like that, but also
kind of how you're thinking about the working capital side of the business that we should be thinking of
levers you could pull here in coming quarters?

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Not really, Roger. We -- our working capital is pretty finely managed, always has been. So we don't have a
lot of optionality there. We don't carry surplus inventories or anything like that. Just thinking about other
items coming down the road that would affect liquidity, I can't think of anything in a negative way other
than the low cash from operations that we expect over the next few months as oil prices continue to be
low.

We do expect the proceeds from the Australia-West transaction. We still believe that, that's going to close
in the second quarter. So that will be coming in from a positive direction. But other than that, I can't think
of any big-ticket items out there.

Operator

Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. The first question I had is around the sanctity of the dividend, and this is for anybody who wants
to take it. We assume one of your large competitors reduced their dividend today. Conoco, in some ways,
took this medicine a couple of years ago. So -- but curious on your view about safety around the dividend
and strategy around that distribution.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Neil. Yes. I think you kind of have answered the question. We declared our dividend today,
as you saw in our press release. That kind of remains a priority. And really, we were committed to a
return of cash to the shareholders of greater than 30%. We've outlined that since we see -- we set our
value proposition a number of years ago. The dividend is a fixed part of that, that we expect to be able to
execute through the cycles.

We exercised the flexible part of that return to shareholders with the suspension of our buyback program
here a month or so ago. So we're pretty confident. As you described, I mean, we took our pain a couple
of years ago back in this last downturn, and we wanted to set the company up because we knew the
volatility was with us to stay, and maybe this is a 3 or 4 sigma event that's even beyond maybe what
we were thinking about in a couple of years ago and what we outlined in November. But through Don's
comments on the balance sheet, the strength that we have as a company, I think we're well positioned to
get through this downturn in pretty good shape.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

A follow-up question is around consolidation. I know you spoke to this a little bit on the capital spending
call, but I wanted to get any updated thoughts around it. One could argue this is towards the bottom of
the cycle, and there's a potential to be opportunistic, but curious on your views as you've been patient in
the past and had some strong views on bid and ask.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, I think -- you're right, Neil, our views haven't changed. We're patient. We're persistent. We
monitor the market. I certainly believe there's going to be significant stress across the sectors, as you've
described. And we're -- we've been willing to transact. We've talked about that. But it has to be accretive,
and it can't break our long-term financial framework that we've described to the market many times.

So the strong balance sheet and we won't put liquidity at risk. So I think broadly speaking, it makes it
obvious that this E&P industry needs structural change. The growth model is broken. There's too much

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

G&A running around this business, and I think it was addressed with an interesting article by Liam
Denning in Bloomberg here yesterday, so read that, I think it's reasonably accurate. There's too many
names for investors. It's getting less relevant in market cap terms. So we do believe the assets could be
run more rationally for improved returns over growth. But imagine the depth of this downturn. There's
some pretty tough discussions going on between boards and management right now. So it will probably
take time for some of this to realize, but I think it needs to happen.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first question is on the June production curtailments. The anticipated June curtailments, they're a bit
more than what you're expecting in May. And so can you talk about how you settled on the June versus
the May level? Because I guess, when we look at the forward curve plus the implied CMA rule adjustment,
June and July, WTI pricing looks stronger than May. So is your decision based on something you're seeing
in the physical market versus the paper market? Or are you just being a little bit more conservative here?
Or is it just related to something else?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. I'll take that, Jeanine. This is Matt. The -- to me, essentially we curtailed as much as we could while
still honoring contracts that we have entered into with buyers. The -- and so we had in the previous
months, March and April, entered into contract to sell crude in May, and we were going to honor those
contracts. So what we curtailed is areas where we didn't have contracts in place or where the buyer was
happy not to take.

And in June, we have more flexibility in that respect because we have much fewer barrels placed already.
So that's the primary reason why the curtailment is higher in June. There's also still this issue of a bit of a
dislocation between the market price and the netback prices that were actually are being offered, not just
as everyone else. So I think that phenomenon was stacked in May, and it's still here in June. So there's an
element of both of your potential responses. I think both are somewhat true.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then maybe my second question for Ryan. That's on the 10-year
plan. So I'm wondering, do you see the current or medium-term environment simply pushing out the 10-
year plan? Meaning that you would resume pretty much the exact plan maybe a year or 2 of delayed? Or
have the conditions changed so much that you could see more value to shareholders if you make more
meaningful adjustments to the underlying plan?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Jeanine. And I'd add to the last question to Alaska is an additional 100,000 barrels a day
that we are doing in June that we aren't doing in May, so. But to your second question about the 10-year
plan, it was much a philosophy and principles that we think are -- that E&P companies need to be taking
to focus on returns and really bring value investors back into this business.

We don't see the basic tenants of that plan changing. Strong balance sheet, diverse low-cost supply
portfolio, returning more than 30% of our cash back to the shareholder, looking through return -- through
cycle returns. I would say that I'd remind people, we've got a 15 billion barrel resource base of less
than $30 cost of supply. And in that cost of supply, it embeds 10% after-tax rate of return. So we've got
something that's quite resilient and in sets up. And we've been long preaching about volatility and lower
-- you got to be prepared for these lower prices. So they're the right ones for an E&P business. Now the
tactics of the 10-year plan were based on how we're going to optimize our investment choices that we

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

had. So clearly, the early years of that plan has changed with the downturn. But the shape and the speed
of the recovery will dictate how quickly we return and get back executing that previous scope and pace of
work that we had outlined last November.

So when this event passes, we expect to have the same philosophy and approach. The programs might be
staged and phased a different -- a little bit differently, but we intend and fully expect to emerge with an
even more competitive plan when we get done.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I hope everyone is doing okay out there. Ryan, I wonder if I could bring you back to...

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Hope you are, too.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. Well, I'm enjoying going to work in my shorts, but we'll save that for another conversation. The
breakeven that you have with the adjustments you've made, I'm just wondering if you could give us a
refresh with the reduced production capacity with the shut-ins. Where do you think your breakeven is right
now, just to give us a kind of road map for how your cash flow capacity was coming out the other side of
that? That's my first question.

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Doug, this is Don. I think on a recent call, we mentioned with -- on a go-forward basis, if you're
looking at our spending for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we said that our breakeven to cover
CapEx was under $30 WTI.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Does that include the dividend and the reduced -- the additional curtailments, Don?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

It does not include the dividend. So to get to the dividend, you'd be in the mid-30s WTI.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And with the curtailments?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

And as far as curtailments, it doesn't because we're not projecting them beyond June. We don't know what
they're going to be. But I can tell you the CFO impacts of the curtailments that we've announced is quite
small because of the prices that we expect.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Of course. Okay. I appreciate that. My second question, I don't know if either -- which one of you want
to -- wants to take this, but it goes back to the issue of sustaining -- supporting or sustaining your
production capacity. So when you think about the shut-ins that you're taking, and obviously, you can
recover those volumes, as you discussed. But when you're not drilling against the backdrop of a declining
unconventional business, what happens to the underlying production capacity? Because I have to believe
that running up back down an escalator, you're basically going to come out the other end of this with
lower absolute production capacity on the Big 3 and the Lower 48. Can you walk us through the dynamics
there? And I'll leave it there.

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Doug, this is Matt. I'll take that one. The -- so based on the capital and operating cost reductions that
we announced a couple of weeks ago, and if we don't pay any attention to production curtailments, our
average production for 2020, the average productive capacity would be about the same as 2019. So
capacity-wise, about flat.

The actual production will be whatever it ends up [indiscernible] including the curtailments. In terms of
the shape of the profile through the year, which is what I think you're getting at, I mean, obviously, the
capital was front-end loaded. And we're assuming in our capital program that we don't complete any wells
in the Big 3 over the last 8 months of the year. So that means there's some -- there's certainly some
decline in capacity as we go through the year.

But we're not giving specific guidance on that because there are so many moving parts just now, including
the curtailments. We're concerned about getting that misleading guidance. But the overall direction is
yes, there will be some decline in capacity. Now keeping mind that we have -- we're actually going to be
building some DUCs here, probably somewhere in the region of 130 or so DUCs. Any loss in productive
capacity, we can recover very quickly. So this is a sort of transient thing that we can manage through. But
we're not giving any specifics on that because we're concerned about giving misleading guidance.

Operator

Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The first question is somewhat related to a couple of the prior ones. You've talked about this WTI
breakeven in the low 30s for the full year and in the high 20s for the rest of the year. Back at your Analyst
Day, it's originally going to be about $40, and then over time, work its way down to $30 as you ramped
some of your production objectives over the next few years. How do you think about this moving beyond
2020? It -- do you think it makes more sense to maintain a breakeven where you're run rating now? Or
does it make sense to ramp spending back up a bit as you see increased visibility?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Phil, this is Matt. The -- that becomes a question of, in the long run, how we see this epidemic and
implications for demand -- the implications for long-term demand, and therefore prices. But generally
speaking, although we could run at a very low sustaining capital price and very little sustaining price in
general the -- because the cost of supply of our investment opportunities average below $30, we don't
feel it's in our shareholders' best interest to not to exploit those development opportunities. So I think it's
unlikely that the choice we would make would be to try and run at such a low breakeven because it would
be deferring a lot of very low-cost of supply investment opportunities.

Having said that, we'll just have to see how this plays out. We have to see if we sense it's a very long-
term implication on the mid-cycle price. But the -- I think it's too early to make a decision on that right
now.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Yes. And I would add, Phil, that if you recall back in November, we talked about our asset optimization
model, and we've looked it, and obviously, if we come back to a different mid-cycle or a different sort of
long-term price, we would -- we'd redo that. But we have a pretty strong idea of what that optimum kind
of exploitation rate across our Lower 48 and unconventionals is and I have applied that to our broader
portfolio as well.

So we obviously -- we look at that, but it is a higher level than what is -- what you might call the
sustaining capital level because there is a sweet spot of investment that we would make that would
generate what we believe is the better returns in the business. And we're going through this downturn
today, and we've retained all of our capability. So we've not eliminated any of that organizational capacity
because, again, we're that -- we're informed by our short- and medium-term view of the market what we
think the recovery might look like and have chosen to retain that capability so we can come back strongly
if we -- if and when we choose to.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Sure. Okay. No, I appreciate that. It's early to be asking those types of questions. The other, I guess,
piece of this is there's a very lumpy part of the development plan over time, which was Willow in Alaska.
And I'm just curious how you're now thinking about Willow and how the timing -- I guess, just based on
your base case macro view from your another, lot of potential outcomes, but what would be your base
case on how you think about Willow moving forward and the timing around it?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So this is Matt again. We're working through Willow, and we're in the concept selection stage just
now. We have a time line that would get us to the end of this year with the opportunity to select the
concept. And by that, I mean, how big a facility do we build, how many drill centers do we have and so
on. So we're continuing to work towards that decision point towards the end of the year for Willow. And
we'll make a decision at that time, and then that will dictate the pace beyond. So we have not made the
decision to defer Willow, and that we have -- that decision is ahead of us, so we're continuing to work
through that.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

And we expect permits here this summer supporting the development at Willow, both at the federal and
state levels.

Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

If we could stay in Alaska a little bit. Obviously, you've completed some of your winter program with some
appraisals and tests out there. Can you give us a sense of what you have learned from that and how that
helps you form your decision to the next year or so?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Scott. We did some exploration at Harpoon and appraisal at Willow. And at Willow, we drilled 2 wells
and -- having planned 4; in Harpoon, we drilled 1 out of planned 3. And the reason that we drilled for
about half the program is we were concerned the -- about having these exploration camps way out west
on the North Slope if we had a COVID outbreak. And, thankfully, we didn't have a COVID outbreak. We

have an abundance of caution for people and our contractors. We decided to shut down the exploration
program earlier. So we drilled 2 of 4 wells at Willow. And the -- those wells had the results that we were
expecting, and we're still on track for a concept select decision. We'll just have to decide if we want those
additional wells before we make that decision then. But we were still evaluating the data just now.

On the Harpoon well, which is the exploration complex in the South, our original plan was to drill 3 wells
there. We only drilled 1. The -- and that well appears to have clipped the edge of the top set based on
its log response. And we won't know that for sure until we get a chance to drill the second well. So we're
still evaluating those results and -- but I think the bottom line is that the jury is going to remain out on
Harpoon until we get back out there to complete the exploration program.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. I appreciate it. Good color. Good color. And this one might be for Don. The LNG outlook. And can
you provide any kind of color on expectations for distributions, maybe over the next quarter or a year, if
you have information you think that would be good enough at this time?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Scott. Actually, LNG realizations have held up pretty well so far. I think our LNG netbacks were only
down about 4% from the fourth quarter. But that's because of the lagged nature. So that's going to roll
over, and we're going to start seeing the impacts as we go through the rest of the year. But we do have an
advantage in that most of our LNG -- I'm talking about all of our projects globally.

The vast majority of our LNG is under term -- long-term contracts, and so they're holding up relatively
well compared to the very weak current spot market. In fact, I think 90% of our total LNG sales are term
and less than 10% spot. So back to your question as far as distributions, we reported, I think, about $100
million distribution in the first quarter from APLNG. We're still expecting somewhere between $500 million
to maybe $550 million for the year.

Our next question comes from Alastair Syme from Citi.

Alastair Roderick Syme
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I had a related question for Don on the cash flow. I'm just wondering if you could give some sort of
guidance on how you're thinking about cash tax in this environment. I think if I remember back in 2016,
you had substantial tax-loss carryforwards, particularly in the U.S. I was wondering to what extent these
still exist?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We're still, Alastair, in a noncash tax paying position in the U.S. And I think coming into this year,
when markets were still stable or relatively stable, we were thinking that we could come out of that
position, maybe as early as '21, but probably more likely '22. So now this is going to obviously set that
time frame back because we're going to have some large losses this year. So I don't have an estimate of
when we might come out of it now, but it's going to certainly be beyond what we thought before.

Alastair Roderick Syme
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

So does that mean the U.S. is in a minimal 0 taxpaying position in 2Q in effect?

Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Ryan, I think your overall business model, you are not changing. You have a good business model of a
balanced growth and cash return to investors. But with this event, is there in any shape or form that have
changed some of the parameters, whether it's the leverage ratio that would consider as a acceptable or
a comfortable range? Or what that -- what is the percent of the reinvestment? Any of those parameters
within your framework because of this event has been changed? If not, why not?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think time is going to tell, Paul. I think we got to go through this, find out where demand returns
to, if there is any permanent demand loss as a result of this pandemic, changes in consumer behaviors
that might drive a different longer-term view of the price. So I don't think we -- we're kind of like a lot of
people watching that very closely to try to understand where supply and demand rebalances out at the
end of this downturn.

So it's probably a bit early, but we'll continue to, again, rely on the fundamentals of the business that I
talked about earlier, the strong balance sheet, executing on a low-cost of supply resource base. And we're
committed to the value proposition that we laid out at back in November.

We've really been -- we reinforced back in November and what we've been operating under for quite some
time or at least the last few years. So I think your question around capital intensity and how you return
money back to the shareholders, we just have to see what the long term -- our long-term view of prices
ends up being and where supply and demand rebalances itself as we come out of this downturn.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Ryan, that's fair. I mean with the -- the only problem is that we probably won't know what is the real long-
term impact or if there's any, maybe for 4 or 5 years. I mean, that I think by the end of this year or the
more -- or next year, I'm not sure we can really tell that we know what is the long-term impact. So yes,
that means that you guys are probably not going to do anything differently until maybe 4 to 5 years down
the road for you that you have some kind of confidence level that you really know what is the long term
impact? Is that the way how we should look at it?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

How long have you noticed, Paul, to take 5 years to react to market environments that we're in? We're
pretty -- we've run our scenarios. We know what we're doing. We know what the philosophy is around the
business. And we'll match our efforts around capital and return back to shareholders and where we put the
balance sheet and how much cash we need to have on the balance sheet based on the environment that
we find ourselves in.

We have confidence because the low cost to supply resource base that we have existing in the company
competes in a very low commodity price environment. So we know what wins, and that's what we're going
to be focused on. And we're going to be flexible and do what we have to do to make sure we're putting
the money into the portfolio in the right places and reacting to the kind of environment that we find. We
certainly won't wait 5 years.

Joshua Ian Silverstein
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just on the Alaska volumes, we've typically thought about A&S and Brent just kind of interchangeably
there. That relationship has broken down over the past month. Can you just remind us how you sell those
volumes and like how that might be different from how you're selling the Lower 48 volumes?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Josh, I'll take that one. Yes. Most of our A&S sales go into the West Coast, which is why you're seeing the
traditional relationship between A&S and Brent break down because of the very low refinery utilization
rates in pad 5. So we would expect that relationship would return once demand picks up in California and
the rest of the West Coast.

Some of our cargoes we do if the opportunity is open for us, we do send them to Asia as well. But
generally, our A&S sales, wherever they go, they're going to correlate usually very closely with Brent,
except under unusual circumstances as we're facing today.

Joshua Ian Silverstein
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. And then right now, there's a lot of defense being played right now, whether it's by Conoco or
everybody else in the market. Just wondering where Conoco can play offense in this environment to lower
the forward breakeven price. I guess the M&A question was asked before, but is there anything from
service cost standpoint or anything else that Conoco can pull the lever on to get that breakeven price
lower?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Josh. I mean obviously, we're working with our supply chain partners on the opportunity to see some
deflation in this environment. We have a strong relationship with suppliers. We -- and there may be some
value there. We also see value. We've had a very strong focus on innovation in the company over the last
many years, and so there are opportunities to accelerate the adoption of new technology and find ways to
continue to drive the cost of supply down.

We've made incredible strides on that over the last few years, and we're not done yet. I mean we know
that part of our job is to continue to drive cost of supply down because what wins in the end in the
commodity business is low cost of supply. And that mantra is fully understood by everybody that works
here, and we're focused on moving every little -- every cent we can on the cost of supply over time.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

And our workforce, Josh, sees the volatility in the market. So they see what happens in these volatile
markets and why, as Matt said, we have to continue to lower the breakeven and drive the cost of supply
down.

Our next question comes from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy.

Michael Anthony Hall
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

I guess I was just curious as you think about bringing back the curtailed volumes. Do you expect to
see any sort of material or notable incremental operating costs and/or capital costs associated with
bringing those back for things like workovers or ESP refurbishment or any other associated costs that are
associated with restarting those volumes?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

This is Matt, Michael. And not particularly that they -- we have slowed down our well work and workover
activity, it's part of our operating cost reductions. So when prices recover and we want to produce those
barrels and we go ramp that back up again. But for the most part, the production at [indiscernible] don't
result in any incremental -- significant incremental workover activity, for example, to bring them back on
again. I think that's what you were getting at.

Michael Anthony Hall
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

Yes. That's helpful. And I guess also, as you think about the second quarter, I mean, are there anticipated
turnarounds that we ought to keep in mind as well that would go beyond any of these curtailments outside
of the Lower 48, Canada and Alaska, just thinking the rest of the global portfolio? Is that -- is there
something that was already baked in that we just ought to be keeping in mind as we head into the second
quarter?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. We have sort of standard turnarounds going on across the portfolio this year. Last year was a very
heavy year for turnarounds. It's less heavy this year, but we're keeping to that schedule and there are no
hugely notable ones that are unusual as we go through the year, but they will be occurring predominantly
in the second and third quarter. We did take a turnaround in Qatar in the first quarter, but the majority of
them will happen in the second and third quarter.

Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Mizuho.

Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

There's a lot of disconnect between paper markets for oil and physical markets. And obviously, within that
physical dynamic there's tremendous differences across the board in regional crude prices. Could you just
talk a bit about how that's been affecting you? And I'm also wondering about some of your crude quality.
There's been a lot of talk that very high API crude has been a problem. And then while we're going there,
could you also -- there's a bull case for natural gas here as people shut down production. Could you talk
about your exposure to the natural gas theme, please?

Donald Evert Wallette
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Paul. I'll take that one. This is Don. Yes. It's been 2 different worlds, really the last month or so,
speaking to your comments about what's happening in the physical markets versus what's going on in the
financial markets. We've certainly seen that in the U.S. in particular, and that's really driven our decisions
around curtailment that the netback prices are lower than what you might assume reading the screen. So
I would say we haven't had any -- we haven't faced any problems in placing the volumes that we wanted
to place. So we call these voluntary curtailments, and they are. They are elections that we're making just
because we don't like the price that's being offered, but we haven't faced a situation where we've had
difficulties finding a market for our crude. Not here in the U.S. and not anywhere in the world, not yet,
that may be coming.

On the natural gas side, I mean, we are seeing some -- at least somewhat bullish views on the natural gas
side. We just don't have the same exposure that we used to have. Our exposure is mainly on the LNG side
and on the European gas side. We have very little domestic production anymore.

and how that -- how markets are around the positions you have in North America? And I'll leave it there.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Paul. I guess you're talking more about some of our marketing activities. And well, maybe both equity
and marketing. But we do have long-haul positions on both the oil side and the gas side, probably more on
the natural gas side because we've been such active marketers of natural gas in North America. So we've
been marketing our own equity gas out of the Permian Basin, generally moving at West towards California,
some to Mexico, Arizona and up the West Coast as well. But we also move a lot of third-party volumes as
well.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Great. As I read the release, you mentioned the Kamunsu East Field is not moving forward into
development. Can you kind of talk to that? And talk about, as an example, how has your capital allocation
philosophy changed, at least in terms of sanctioning projects this year, if it has at all?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Bob, this is Matt. The Kamunsu East, that was simply a sort of financial recognition of the fact that the
timing of when we would develop the KME -- it's essentially a satellite to Kebabangan, KBB. And because
KBB has been slowed down by this pipeline issue, third-party pipeline issue on -- between Sabah and
Sarawak, the license for KME is going to expire before we can bring it to an economic development. So
we were just recognizing that in our book's treatment of the asset. And so that was what caused that and
recognition in this quarter.

The -- in terms of the second part of your question, I wouldn't say that there has been any significant
change in our view of how we should be allocating capital. We should be allocating the lowest cost of
supply and we should be facing it so that we're doing that in the optimum weight. And so no significant
change, at least not yet, Bob, in our thinking on that.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. A quick follow-up on Ankor. You are -- sorry, on Harpoon. You mentioned that you clipped the top
sets, which tells us something about missing reservoir, but you didn't mention fluids. Did you encounter
hydrocarbons in that?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. We did encounter hydrocarbons. We're still interpreting the results there, but the -- and it's -- it looks
from a lithological perspective, similar to other lithological signatures we're seeing on the edge of these
top sets. But we spared 2 other wells to drill. We would have got a lot more information had we been able
to finish the program, but for safety reasons, we chose not to.

There are a few asked already on capital spending in the balance sheet, but I wanted to just follow-up in a
bit more detail on that. And you provided back at the Investor Day, your helpful analysis of stress testing.
The balance sheet and cash flow profile through a low commodity price period. And clearly, what we're
seeing right now is a bit unprecedented, different than that stress test, but the balance sheet is still a very
strong competitive advantage for you.

I was wondering if you could just give an update on how you're thinking about the required cash balance
and willingness to take on kind of additional leverage here or lean on the balance sheet to the extent we
see a sustained period of long -- of low prices over the next few quarters to years? And at what point
further CapEx cuts become consideration?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Devin, this is Don. I'll take that. As far as cash balances back at the Analyst Day, I think we said that we
had an operating requirement of about $1 billion, and we felt like we wanted to keep a reserve balance
on top of that of $2 billion to $3 billion. I think generally, we feel the same way about it. Technically, it's
probably -- those numbers have probably come down a little bit. Operating cash is not quite $1 billion
because -- mainly because of some of the assets that we've sold. We just don't need that much.

And the reserve capital or the reserve cash -- that's a number that we recalculate every month based on
our outlook for the next 6 to 12 months. And that number has probably come down a little bit because of
our lower spending on CapEx, OpEx by the suspension of our buyback program. But it might be $1 billion
lower than what we were thinking in November, but that's about it.

So those numbers are still pretty good. We think we'll -- as we look out, say, to the end of the year, we
think that we'll be able to maintain cash balances above those levels of operating and reserve cash. So
that would imply that we don't expect to have to access the debt capital markets.

Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.

Pavel S. Molchanov
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

You may have mentioned a few minutes ago, are you going to be having any involuntary shut-ins in
Norway or Indonesia, both of which were part of the OPEC Plus agreement?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes. I'll take that, Pavel. We just saw today, as you did, Norway announced that they would be
participating in the OPEC cuts. They announced a 250,000 barrel a day curtailment for June and about
135,000, 134,000 I think it was, in the second half of 2020. So we are likely to be allocated some of that
in Norway. And -- but we're working -- they have a reasonably complicated way of working that, and so it
is likely to have some impact in our Norway business.

Our estimate at the moment is it will be in terms of the impacts of -- on average rate for the year, it will
be in the low single digits barrels a day for the year for us. But we are still working through that. And they
also made some interesting changes to the tax regime over there, and the most interesting one being
accelerating the depreciation schedule to 1 year for capital. So that was a pretty smart strategic response
from the Norwegian government, as you would expect.

In terms of Indonesia, we -- I think you mentioned Indonesia. We -- we're -- we sell gas in Indonesia to
the domestic market, most of the fixed prices are take-or-pay commitments. So we're not going to be
affected by any Indonesian action to support the OPEC Plus group. But we may be affected in Malaysia.
The Malaysian government has announced that they are going to participate to some extent, but we don't
know the details yet of how that will play out.

John Phillips Little Johnston
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Your oil mix in the Lower 48 has been pretty consistent over the last several quarters in the 57% to
60% range. As you mentioned, you aren't planning on any well completions in this environment. So my
question is, if we look 9 to 12 months out, would you expect your oil mix to move significantly lower from
that range just as GORs and existing wells naturally move higher without any new volumes to offset that
mix shift?

Matthew J. Fox
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Phillips. There would be -- there may be some modest increase in the gas ratio over there as we go
through the year, but it shouldn't be that significant. We'll have declining production in the Bakken and
the Eagle Ford, the Permian. And with that, there'll be some increases in GOR, but it shouldn't be that
significant.
