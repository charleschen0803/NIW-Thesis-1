Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results Conference
Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Chief
Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Pauline, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be
making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial
performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual
events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent
filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of
operations.

In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy,
Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter financial performance, and Steve and
Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well
as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.

We had an unintentional posting of our earnings release on our website shortly before the normally
scheduled timing today. Once we determined this occurred, we moved quickly to get the releases sent out
over our normal distribution processes.

We are including information in our press release and our conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP
measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our
website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-
GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our
website.

I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating
expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based
on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other
adjustments as described in our press release.

Net sales in the December quarter were $1.352 billion, which was up 3.3% sequentially and above the
midpoint of our quarterly guidance. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales by product line and
geography as well as our total end market demand on our website for your reference.

On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were a record of 63%, operating expenses were 23.2% and
operating income was a record 39.8%. Our factory underutilization charges decreased from $12.2 million
to $3.7 million sequentially as we continue to ramp our factories to respond to the strong business
conditions. We expect the continued ramp of our factories to lead to no underutilization charges in the
March quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $444.9 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.62,
$0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance.

On a GAAP basis in the December quarter, gross margins were a record at 62.6% and include the impact
of $6.4 million of share-based compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $600.2 million and
include acquisition intangible amortization of $231.6 million, special charges of $4.3 million, $5.4 million of
acquisition-related and other costs and share-based compensation of $44.8 million. The GAAP net income
was $36.2 million or $0.13 per diluted share and was adversely impacted by $142.1 million loss on debt
settlement associated with debt refinancing activities in the quarter.

Our December quarter GAAP tax expense was impacted by a variety of factors, notably, the tax benefit
recorded on the convertible debt exchange transactions occurring during the period. Our non-GAAP cash

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

tax rate was 4.25% in the December quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '21 to be
about 4.8%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring the Microsemi
operations into the Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in
prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S.
interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash taxes low in the future.

Our inventory balance at December 31, 2020, was $666.1 million. We had 120 days of inventory at the
end of the December quarter, which was flat to the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in
the December quarter were 26 days, which is a record low level and down from 30 days at the end of the
prior quarter. In the current environment, it is quite challenging for Microchip or its distributors to increase
days of inventory.

In the December quarter, we exchanged $1.086 billion of our 2025, 2027 and 2037 convertible
subordinated notes for cash, shares of our common stock and a new convertible bond that matures in
2024. While these transactions did not impact the overall level of debt on our balance sheet, we believe
that these convertible exchanges will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution
to the extent our stock price appreciates over time, which Steve will comment on further in his prepared
remarks.

In calendar year 2020, we reduced the amount of convertible bonds on Microchip's balance sheet by
approximately $2.9 billion. In the December quarter, we also issued a $1.4 billion senior secured bond
with a maturity date of February 15, 2024, and an interest rate of 0.972% and used the proceeds from
that transaction to pay off our Term Loan B which we were paying an interest rate of about 2.15% on.

Our cash flow from operating activities was $509.7 million in the December quarter. As of December 31,
our consolidated cash and total investment position was $372.7 million. We paid down $289.7 million of
total debt in the December quarter, but please remember that this is inclusive of the cash paid for our
various debt financing activities in the quarter, including putting a capped call in place for our newly issued
convertible bonds.

Over the last 10 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in
debt to do so, we have paid down $3.24 billion of debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our
excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this despite the
adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony to the cash
generation capabilities of our business as well as the ongoing operating discipline we have. We continue to
expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years.

Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was a record $593.4 million, and our trailing 12-month
adjusted EBITDA was $2.271 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated
convertible debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 3.93 at December 31, 2020,
down from 4.04 at September 30, 2020. But please note that the amount of the 2037 bonds were reduced
by $407.7 million during the December quarter as part of the financing transactions, which has impacted
this metric. Our dividend payment in the December quarter was $96 million.

Capital expenditures were $21.4 million in the December 2020 quarter. We expect between $50 million
and $60 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal '21 to
be between $87 million and $97 million. In the last quarter's conference call, we explained that our capital
expenditure plan for fiscal '21 had increased as we more rapidly prepared for growth in our business as
well as actions we were taking to increase our internal capacity in the face of constraints our outsourcing
partners are experiencing.

Our fiscal '21 capital expenditures are coming in lower than we indicated last quarter due to longer
equipment lead times and deliveries pushing out due to overall industry conditions. We continue to add
capital to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations, support the production capabilities
for our new products and technologies as well to selectively bring in-house some of the wafer fabrication,
assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring
gross margin improvement to our business and give us increased control over our destiny during periods
of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $40.3 million.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the
December quarter. Ganesh?

Ganesh Moorthy
President, COO & Director

Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our
microcontroller revenue performed well with revenue sequentially up 3.3% as compared to the September
quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our microcontroller revenue was up 5.9%.

We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new microcontroller solutions, including: the first
safety-certified capacitive touchscreen controllers for the home appliance market; the first Trust&GO WiFi
module, delivering powerful 32-bit microcontroller functionality and verifiable identity; the industry's
highest density secured Ethernet switching solution for hyperscale data centers and telecom service
providers; and last but not least, 3 new broad market 8-bit microcontroller families to extend our
leadership in this product line. Microcontrollers overall represented 53.7% of our revenue in the December
quarter.

Moving to analog. Our analog revenue also performed well and was sequentially up 3.1% as compared
to the September quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our analog revenue was up 2.6%. During the
quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, too, including the
first cryptographic companion device supporting in-vehicle network security solutions; a new family of
configurable 12-bit digital-to-analog converters; the first highly integrated radiation-hardened motor
controller; and finally, a family of low-latency PCI Express 5.0 and Compute Express Link retimers. Analog
represented 27.6% of our revenue in the December quarter.

Our FPGA revenue was down 8.5% sequentially as compared to the September quarter. On a year-over-
year basis, our FPGA revenue was up 7.1%. As we cautioned on our prior conference calls, FPGA revenue
does have some lumpiness associated with it because of the large exposure to the aerospace and defense
market and the associated purchasing patterns. During the quarter, we announced a radiation-hardened
fourth-generation FPGA family and a low-power radiation-tolerant fifth-generation PolarFire FPGA family.
FPGA represented 7.3% of our revenue in the December quarter.

Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was up 13% in revenue
as compared to the September quarter with strength in licensing revenue driving this growth. LMO
represented 11.4% of our revenue in the September quarter.

A quick note about our product line reporting. Given the relatively smaller size of our FPGA product
line at about 7% of our revenue as compared to our microcontroller and analog product lines, we have
decided that starting in calendar year 2021, we will no longer break out the FPGA product line separately.
Our FPGA products remain important to our overall total system solutions goals. We continue to make
significant investments in our FPGA products and expect those investments will help drive our long-term
growth and total system solutions initiatives. Going forward, we will combine our FPGA revenue with our
LMO, or licensing, memory and other, revenues into a new category that we'll just call Other.

From an end market standpoint, we continue to see the automotive, industrial and consumer markets
strengthened further in the December quarter, approximating a V-shaped recovery in the second half
of calendar year 2020 as compared to the first half. The end markets have benefited earlier in the year
from the work-from-home-related demand search. Namely, computing, communications and data center
remained at more normal demand patterns as the surge we saw in the June quarter dissipated.

The Huawei ban, which was in effect for all of the December quarter and represented 1% to 2% of our
overall revenue, had a more pronounced negative impact on our data center business where it was a
more meaningful percentage of that business. Finally, demand for our products that go into the office
environment, which we refer to as enterprise demand, remained weak as most businesses remain
predominantly with the work-from-home policies that's deferring enterprise spending for the office
environment.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

The supply chain constraints that started in the September quarter continued to grow through the
December quarter. A robust overall business environment, accentuated by rising demand from the
automotive, industrial and consumer markets combined with low levels of inventory in the distribution
channel resulted in constraints in practically all of our internal and external factories. Since September,
we have been ramping our internal factories as well as investing in capital additions to further expand our
internal capacity. We have also worked with our supply chain partners to increase our fab, assembly and
test capacity allocation.

However, based on the current strength of the business environment, we expect that the constraints
we are currently seeing are likely to continue through much of calendar year 2021 and possibly into
calendar year 2022. As a result, we have seen our lead time stretch out for many of our products where
the constraints are most acute. We have also experienced increases in material and subcontracted
manufacturing costs and have taken steps to secure capacity for 2021. Steve will discuss more in his
prepared remarks about our actions to address the current environment of increasing manufacturing cost
and seemingly insatiable demand.

Let me now pass it to Steve for comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the
fiscal third quarter of 2021. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021.

The December quarter represented the shift of the business cycle back to revenue growth with a 3.3%
sequential growth in a quarter where ordinarily, we would see a 3% sequential decline from typical
seasonal factors. December quarter revenue also grew over prior year's December quarter by 5%. We
started ramping our internal factories in September as well as investing in capital additions to expand
our internal capacity. We also started working with our supply chain partners to receive more allocation
from wafer foundries and assembly test subcontractors. These efforts improved product availability in the
December quarter but still constrained some of the revenue upside.

We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin of 63% helped by significant reduction in factory
underutilization and better overhead utilization from revenue growth. We also achieved non-GAAP
operating margin of 39.8%, an all-time record and getting very close to an emotional 40% mark. We also
hit a record EBITDA of $593.4 million despite revenue not at a record yet showing the robust strength
of our business model. Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, $0.05 above the midpoint of our
guidance. This was also our 121st consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability.

Now I will discuss our guidance for the March quarter. Our bookings were exceptionally strong in the
December quarter and were an all-time record. We received bookings both for short term as well as into
the future quarters. The backlog is also an all-time record. Please remember that bookings as well as the
backlog is what is shippable in the next 12 months. The backlog for the March quarter is the strongest
starting backlog I have ever seen. Our bookings have remained strong in January. On the operational side,
the December quarter was constrained by product availability. We will have more internal and external
capacity in the March quarter since we have had multiple months to ramp, although I believe that wafer
fab as well as back-end constraints are here to stay with us through calendar year 2021.

In response to the business environment, we have taken 3 actions. First, in the middle of December,
we changed our cancellation and pushout terms with our customers and distributors. The standard
terms used to be that an order cannot be canceled or pushed out once it is within 45 days of shipment.
We changed our standard terms so that an order cannot be canceled or pushed out within 90 days of
shipment effective January 1, 2021. We gave customers a couple of weeks to adjust their backlog before
it went firm for 90 days. In response to our change in terms, we did not see any unusual cancellations
or pushouts, which indicates to us that the backlog was firm and needed by our customers. That gave us
a solid backlog for the March quarter, which cannot be canceled or pushed out. Therefore, we can batch
process the orders and use our manufacturing assets most efficiently knowing that what we build will get
shipped.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

The second action we took was that we sent a letter to our customers on January 4, 2021, informing them
of the business environment. We also informed them that we are seeing broad-based cost increases and
some aggressive commercial terms from our supplier base, and we must pass these cost increases to our
customers through a broad-based price increase.

The third action we took just this morning. We posted a letter on our website and sent it to our customers
and distributors announcing a new program called the Microchip Preferred Supply Program, or PSP. This
program offers our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity in the second half 2021 and first
half 2022.

The program has the following elements: the customers participating in this program will have to place
12 months of orders, which will be noncancelable and non-reschedulable. The capacity priority will begin
for shipments in July 2021. The program will not be a guarantee of supply. However, it will provide the
highest priority for those orders which are under this PSP program. And the capacity priority will be on a
first-come, first-served basis until the available capacity is booked. We will, of course, reserve a portion of
our capacity for new customers, small long-tail customers and new designs.

We expect that a significant portion of our capacity will be booked under this new program. With a large,
committed, noncancelable backlog for 12 months, Microchip will be in a stronger position to make capacity
and raw material commitments to our suppliers, buy capital equipment with confidence, hire employees
and ramp up manufacturing and manufacture products more efficiently.

Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales for March quarter to be up between 5%
to 10% sequentially. The March quarter guidance at the midpoint would represent record GAAP net sales
with the prior record being in the September quarter of 2018. The September quarter of 2018, based on
GAAP sell-in revenue recognition, was $1.432 billion.

Some of you may still carry a sell-through-based number of $1.513 billion for September 2018 in your
historical financial model spreadsheets. The March quarter will also be limited by product availability on
many product lines. Our guidance assumes working through a myriad of capacity constraints qualifying
incremental equipment installed, qualifying alternate subcontractors in some cases and still dealing with
the risk of production constraints with a new wave of COVID cases plaguing the planet and at the same
time, ramping up vaccinations.

For the March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 63.3% and 63.7% of sales,
which would be a new all-time record. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.2% and
23.6% of sales, and we expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 39.7% and 40.5% of
sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.67 per share to $1.79 per share. We
also expect to pay down another approximately $350 million of our debt in the March quarter.

Finally, I want to cover one other area, which is our future cash return strategy. At the rate we're paying
down debt, we expect to break a net leverage of 3 within a year and continue to decrease from there. At
that time, we expect to begin distributing more of a substantial amount of free cash flow to the investors
in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.

Regarding buybacks, through multiple tranches of convertible debt buyback, we have essentially bought a
substantial amount of stock back from the future. This is because as the stock price rises and exceeds the
conversion price of the debt, convertible debt dilutes the share count. [ Trying to ] convert back prevents
future dilution as the stock price rises. Our first convert buyback was in March 2020 when Microchip's
stock price was about $71. Since then, we have done 4 other buyback transactions at various stock prices.

By doing these various buyback transactions, we have purchased a total of $3.525 billion in face value
of our convertible bonds. For the transactions from March 2020 to September 2020, we issued a total of
about 20.4 million shares of our common stock to the investors for in-the-money value of their bonds. If
these bonds have remained outstanding until an assumed stock price of $140 per share with the stock
price about now, the dilution would have been about 26.4 million shares.

Thus, our repurchases had the impact of creating a savings of about 6 million shares worth $840
million savings to our investors at $140 per share. This calculation does not include our November

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

2020 transaction, which was very recent and executed at $133.47 per share, so it is not yet accretive.
Therefore, while we have not done an open market stock buyback in the last year, our convert transactions
have had the impact of a buyback of approximately 6 million shares. At some point in the future, we
expect to start pure stock buyback from the open market.

We are also initiating a path to higher dividends and not waiting until our leverage reaches a given number
before the dividend starts to increase. In this regard, we announced today that the Board of Directors
have approved a dividend increase of 5.8% sequentially to $0.39 per share, up from $0.3685 previously.
We expect to continue to increase dividends quarterly as part of our cash return strategy.

Given all of the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles,
restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance
and track its results on a non-GAAP basis except for net sales which will be on a GAAP basis. We believe
that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we expect that the
analysts -- and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.
With this, Pauline, will you please pool for questions?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take the first question at this time.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

We can't hear you. Maybe you're on mute.

Unknown Analyst

Steve, can you hear me?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Yes, now.

Unknown Analyst

Apologize. I didn't hear my name get called. I just heard caller. Apologize for that. Just really quickly.
We've lived through multiple times of you sending out customer letters, and we kind of have an
understanding of how the market responds to that. I'd be kind of curious, the preferred supplier
agreement that you talked about in your opening remarks, is this the first time that you have done that?
And if it's not, what's been the historical response to programs like this?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So the Preferred Supply Program is brand new. I have not ever implemented it in my 42 years of career,
and I have never seen anybody else do that, too. The program is largely a response to the current
environment because bookings level is just so strong and people are booking parts out in time. The
industry seems to be 30% plus short to really what the capacity requirement is. And many of our
customers have been asking what can they do if they give us longer-term demand, longer-term orders.
Will that give them parts? Will that give them better support?

Now customers can give us longer-term orders. But if the orders are cancelable or reschedulable after
90 days, which was the case prior to the program, then I could have a lot of orders for September and
December and could buy capital, hire people to ramp. But just before I get there, people could cancel
if there was a double ordering, people were asking more than they need and they cancel part of the
orders. So that is often the problem always, and you guys ask the question, is there any double ordering
or whatever. And this program basically eliminates all that. It asks the customers to place 12 months
of backlog, which will be noncancelable, non-reschedulable so I can take that one to the bank, buy raw
material, do batch processing, grow the capacity and give them preferential supply. So this is the first time
we have implemented it. It's just the need of the times.

Unknown Analyst

And I know it was just this morning, but what do you expect the intended response to be from your
customers?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, a small number of customers we already have feedback through the day, including a couple of
distributors, the response is positive. They would place such orders. I don't expect any customer to place
their entire backlog on every product on the PSP program because customers themselves have some
programs where they are solid, that the demand is good, they have a good market share on that particular

design. But some others could be some new programs where the demand is yet not known. So I think
customers will really take a lot of the product and put it on PSP and some others that they won't.

Operator

And we'll take the next question. It comes from Toshiya Hari.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Steve and Ganesh, given the current supply and demand situation, what are your thoughts on pricing
across your microcontroller and analog business? And if you can kind of speak to gross margins on the
back of that, that would be helpful. And I guess sort of related to that, given the preferred supplier
program, how should we think about the economics of that program?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So we sent a letter to our customers on January 4, really informing them, first, of the business
environment and also informing them that we were seeing broad-based cost increases and some very
aggressive commercial terms from our suppliers who were facing similar issues from their suppliers really
up and down the supply chain and we must pass these cost increases to our customers through really a
broad-based price increase. So after writing that letter, then we need to really develop that program, and
we've got several hundred thousand SKUs and going through the price increase on which part and how
much and passing on to the customers, working through their contracts and long-term prices and stuff like
that. So all that really has been implemented at this point in time. We aren't breaking out what portion of
the guidance is price increase. That's kind of relatively difficult. But the price increases have already been
made effective.

As far as the economics of the PSP program, the economics of the PSP program really are in having a
committed noncancelable, non-reschedulable backlog on the books that we can build it in batches, buy
raw material ahead if we wanted, increase our inventory if we wanted to serve that and build it whenever
we have a lull. Essentially, that's where the economics are to be able to serve the customers better who
joined the program and Microchip not be subject to ordering more than they need and double ordering
because they're not going to double order and order more than they need if they cannot reschedule or
cancel. So that's where the economics are. There's no price change with that price program. It's totally
separate. I don't know if that answers your question.

Operator

We'll take the next question. It comes from Vivek Arya.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Steve, you used the phrase significant revenue growth in calendar '21, and you're starting the year at
about 10% year-on-year growth. Is that a significant number? Is it something higher than that? And more
importantly, what kind of growth can your supply chain support this year?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, I -- I don't know, you must have not heard what I said. I thought I talked about -- the question
really was that Street had 7% growth. Do you expect something higher than that? And my answer was
yes. So whatever anybody interpreted it, I don't know what significant means. And I can't really give you
a number for the growth for the year, although I think the revenue is more constrained by capacity than
the demand, at least now and for the next several quarters.

Which leads to your second question, what can -- what kind of growth the supply chain support. I think
one of the problems that we're dealing with is that the supply chain is not as stable. We're finding that

the assembly test subcontractor will commit that they can do x number of parts per week, and as we get
there, they would change that number. They would lower that number or push it out by a couple of weeks.
Well, what happened? What happened was they got a de-commitment from their suppliers. They didn't get
some bonders they were expecting. They couldn't hire some people. Somebody tested positive for COVID,
so they had to send 50 people home who had come in contact with it.

So there's no slack in the system. Everything that gets built gets shipped. There's absolutely no slack in
the system. So any perturbation, there was an earthquake in Taiwan, we had a car that hit our substation
in a fab in Oregon that knocked out about 3 or 4 days, partial knockout, not complete, none of those
things are [ amicable ] because all factories are working 7 days a week, full board. So any delay in
equipment just leads to a de-commitment. So I think those are all the myriad of problems we are dealing
with in adding equipment, adding people, qualifying additional subcontractors, getting our customers to
waive qualification.

Automotive are the hardest customers to qualify production in a different plan or to approve a change.
And in the last 6 months, we have been so successful in getting even all the automotive customers that
they would buy the product from this alternative assembly site or test site and all that. So we're getting
help in that area, but it's still a very, very complicated process to put it all together. And therefore, we're
not willing to dollarize the number or what percentage we could grow, not yet.

Operator

We'll take the next question. It comes from Craig Hettenbach.

Craig Matthew Hettenbach
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Steve, just a question on the disti inventory at 26 days. When would you expect that to perhaps get
back to kind of within normal ranges? And any trends you could share just by geography in terms of disti
resales?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So distribution would love to grow the inventory in this environment to serve the end customers better.
But disti inventory can't grow. There is just not enough product available to grow the inventory because
the product keeps getting shipped out. Another point I would like to make is that our inventory as well
as distributor inventory is calculated based on last 90 days of sales. So it's based on the prior quarter. So
essentially, if you -- the real value of the inventory is to support the future.

So if you take our guidance and take the midpoint of that guidance, let's say, and calculate the days of
distributor inventory or Microchip inventory based on that guidance, then the inventory numbers are
extremely low. But they're calculated as we report, which is a standard convention based on the prior
90 days. In a very stable environment, flat sales, it doesn't matter. But in a significant growth, the real
inventory is actually much lower than the numbers we're reporting. And we don't think it's going to grow.
I think our internal inventory will drop this quarter, we expect, by several days, and distribution will do the
same.

Craig Matthew Hettenbach

Got it. And then just a follow-up for Ganesh on the total system solution. Any progress there or things you
can share with us in terms of developments?

Ganesh Moorthy

Sure. So it's not a 1 quarter of progress. It's a multi-quarter activity that we've had. The processes that
need to be put in place have been there. New processes are going in. It is reflected in how we see the
design activity taking place, some of which we've shared anecdotally in some of the conferences. We will

share some more this coming quarter as well. But I think the power of the whole coming together, putting
all the different parts of Microchip on a customer's board, is very much strong and alive and a key part of
our growth strategy.

Operator

We'll take the next question. It comes from Gary Mobley.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So I know you started the December quarter with your distributor inventory levels slightly below average.
And it looks like you under shipped into the channel by about $26 million in the December quarter. Is that
how we should think about perhaps what -- how much higher your revenue could have been if you had
available production capacity and whatnot in a similar amount as we look out into the March quarter?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, we had unsupported orders for every geography for every product line for direct as well as for
distribution. So just picking a number that the distribution inventory went down by and just saying that's
the revenue we missed for the December quarter will not be [ equative ]. We're not breaking out the
number, but the total amount of revenue that we missed also was also from direct and essentially, every
geography.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask about your philosophy towards M&A when you get to that magical
net leverage ratio of less than 3x. Is that -- should we take that to mean that you're also open to some
M&A transactions at that point as well?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

I think we have spoken extensively about this in the past, saying that we believe there was an era of M&A
in the last 12 years or so. We did 16, 17, 18 acquisitions, a few large ones public and lots of them small
private. And all of that was intended to scale the company 10x or so, and now we are over $5.4 billion
company and really not have a scale disadvantage to our competitors. I think we have achieved that. And
today, we have a product line with which we can complete a customer's entire solution and essentially
have all the parts built out of Microchip products. And other than resistors and capacitors and connectors
and battery, everything else is really made from Microchip.

So today, there is not that need for M&A, and there are no gaping holes. So we are really building our
strategy going forward on organic growth built from really large amount of success in providing total
system solutions to the customers. There could be a tuck-in acquisition here and there, private, small,
really buying some people which is a technology pipeline or something like that. But there's really no plan
currently for doing any kind of large acquisition even after we reach a certain leverage.

Operator

We'll take the next question. It comes from Chris Caso.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

The first question is about some of the capacity additions that you're undertaking now. Could you talk
about, one, the direction of CapEx over the next couple of quarters as you try to address these -- some
of these supply constraints? How long does it take to get the capacity in place? And then lastly, to what
extent are you looking to address these constraints through internal means as opposed to getting them

through outsourcing? What's going to be the quicker and more sustainable path to getting some more
product to your customers?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Eric, you want to take the CapEx question?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Sure. So we've indicated that in the very short term, so the March quarter, we're expecting to spend
between $50 million and $60 million in CapEx. We've kind of given general guidance to The Street that
longer term, we expect our CapEx as a percentage of net sales to be somewhere between 3% and 4%.
This quarter, we'll be going through our annual operating plan for our next fiscal year, and we'll provide
kind of a more detailed forecast in fiscal '22. But I wouldn't be surprised if we're on the high end of that
range for next fiscal year. We've been well below it for the last 2 fiscal years. And so [ quite clearly ], the
demand environment is driving that.

And I'll start with the second piece of the question and Steve or Ganesh can add on to it, but we have
been making significant investments in assembly and test expansion. And actually, this last quarter, we did
55% of our assembly in-house. That's up significantly quarter-on-quarter, and we did 57% of our final test
in-house. So these metrics tend to be slow moving, but we are making progress on that and it's allowing
us to take a little bit more control of our own destiny. So with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So I think one of your questions implied that what portion of the CapEx we were spending for internal
versus external. I think 100% of our CapEx is really being applied to grow the capacity internally. The
external capacity growth, we're getting it just by getting larger allocation and negotiating for a larger
piece of the total capacity pie at the foundries and subcontractors. We're not really spending our CapEx
dollars in growing their capacity. But our capacity is growing significantly outside also. But overall, as Eric
mentioned, especially in the assembly and test area, a large portion of the capacity growth is happening
inside.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

All right. As a follow-up, given the strongly better-than-seasonal March, the fact that you've got backlog
that's difficult to fill all of that, how do we think about seasonality through the rest of the year? And there
are always difficult questions right now, but any kind of qualitative comments that you could provide
would be helpful.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

I think seasonality has been difficult to define for Microchip for some time because of all these
acquisitions. And especially with Microsemi, the end market mix changed so much that we said, if you've
got a year or 2 years of stable environment, then one could figure out what the seasonality would be.
And we haven't gotten that stable environment. First was the U.S.-China trade then last year was COVID.
And this year is just runaway growth or capacity constraints. So in this environment, it's not the seasonal
factor that's changing what you can or cannot do. It's a combination of how much capacity you can grow,
what the overall demand is. So I can't really comment much on seasonality in this kind of environment.

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Maybe as a follow-up to the last question. I know the difficulties and complexities in quantifying full
year revenue generation potential, but maybe more near term. I assume that the team is almost fully
booked for the June quarter, maybe you guys can confirm that, and that would include any unshipped
delinquencies from March. In June, we could argue about seasonality, but typically, June is up sequentially.
So your foundry wafer requirements are probably already fixed for June given the lead times from your
foundry partners. But wondering if you guys would be able to bring on and qualify additional wafers and
assembly and test capacity in time to support higher levels of revenues from where you are here in March,
if it plays out that way in June.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So you can't qualify different fabs in a matter of 3 months or 6 months. Depending on what the process
and products are, it's a much longer effort. So a lot of the capacity growth is really coming out of growing
capacity where the processes are already installed. We got some processes that are installed outside as
well as inside. And most of the other -- the majority of our processes either run outside or run inside. And
when they run outside, they usually only either run in one foundry or the other foundry.

So there's really no process that runs in 3 or 4 different foundries. They may run in 3 or 4 different fabs of
the same foundry. Like -- take TSMC. It could run in 3 different fabs of TSMC, but it doesn't run in TSMC
as well as Global as well as UMC or something. So the capacity growth is largely coming from where the
processes are already installed from a fab standpoint.

From an assembly test standpoint, yes, we're qualifying additional alternate assembly subcontractors
which could give additional capacity. But there also, majority of the growth in assembly as well as test
is coming from buying capital and installing in 3 of Microchip's large facilities: 2 in Thailand and 1 in the
Philippines. They're basically doing a record amount of assembly and test every day, and capacity is rising
every week, every month, every quarter for the rest of the year.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I guess my question is...

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

So there was a second comment there from Harlan talking about or kind of implying that June quarter is
fully booked, and that is not the case. June quarter isn't fully booked. The March quarter isn't fully booked.
It can be fully booked on certain products, and maybe Ganesh can expand on that a little bit.

Ganesh Moorthy
President, COO & Director

Yes. I mean even for this quarter, we have strong backlog, but we have some terms yet to take, and there
are terms to take for the June quarter. As Eric mentioned, there are certain product lines which can be
much closer to being booked up. And that's typically -- it is starting at a much higher backlog than would
-- a normal quarter would be. Now there is still work to be done, and there's capacity coming online,
which will help with some of the growth, both that's helping this quarter as you can see versus December
and some more into June.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. So you answered my -- what was going to be my third question or what was my third question in
that, which is irrespective of how the demand plays out, if June quarter backlog ends up suggesting a
higher June quarter, you guys would have the capabilities in place, foundry or internal, to drive higher
revenue levels sequentially in the June quarter?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Absolutely, yes.

Operator

We'll take the next question at this time. It comes from Ambrish Srivastava.

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

One in near term and then I had a longer term, Steve, and really just wanted to make sure I understood
that part. On the near term, the preferred supplier program, you started just this morning. But does the
guide for March, does it include the change in cancellation from 45 to 90? Is that part of -- has that been
implemented long enough to reflect in the March guide?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So that was told to the customers in early December. Maybe it was the middle of December, around maybe
8th to 10th of December, and we gave them then the following 3 weeks or so to make any changes to the
backlog they wanted to make. And on January 1, the backlog will go hard for the 90 days. So -- and there
were very few changes made, and there were just meaningless, very small changes. So as of January 1
then, whatever was on our books for the March quarter became firm, so no changes could be made. And
that backlog position for the March quarter was very strong, strongest we have ever seen in our careers.

Now as Ganesh answered earlier and Eric answered, that doesn't mean the March quarter was fully
booked because you always have products where there's product available and customers and distributors
can continue to come and buy those products where the lead time is still fairly short and shippable within
the quarter. But a very large number of products were also completely booked and nothing available for
March. On some products, even nothing available for June. So the impact of that 90 days was effective
on January 1. And then as you go -- as you finish the month of January, then the backlog is now hard for
February, March, April. By the end of February, the backlog will be hard for March, April and May. So that
was a 90-day program.

The PSP program is an entirely new program. The 90-day program was applicable to all customers
worldwide, direct or distribution. The PSP program is a customer's option. It's not -- we can't force them
to give us 1 year of backlog. So that was an option given to the customer that they can have an ability to
get preferred supply support if they would give us 12 months of noncancelable backlog, which helps us
in bringing capacity online and buy capital and hire people with confidence and it gives them preferential
capacity. So there is something in it for both.

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes. No, I understand. I just want to make sure...

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

The PSP program support starts from July. Now the orders, they can place it now for 12 months. But if
they come up with a whole bunch of new orders for March, April, May, June, they can't get the supply
ripped off from other people who have placed a backlog before. So PSP capacity support does not begin
until July.

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. I wasn't confused about PSP. I just wanted to make sure that the March quarter is -- it sounds
like you were able to pull together a lot of internal and external to guide to what you did, and it also has
some solidity, for lack of a better word, because of the 90-day that you started in December. That's what
I wanted to understand because there's a concern about double booking, that sounds like the way you
have framed it and the way you're running the business at this point. It seems like you have quite a lot of
visibility on that.

My longer-term question, Steve, and thanks for addressing that. Your business model is transforming
and you've been talking about M&A being less of a priority given where the valuations are and focus on
organic. So the question -- and you addressed it by saying the buyback, even though not directly, you
have been bringing down dilution. What was the point you made on dividend? I missed that. What's the
formula that you have in place for dividend growth?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

We don't really have a formula in place. We just -- Board will meet every quarter and decide the dividend
for every quarter. In the current quarter, we grew the dividend by 5.8%. And you could expect that Board
will grow the dividend every quarter, and that's really our commitment. We -- I told in the last couple of
quarters that we will build a glide path towards higher dividend, and this is a glide path towards a higher
dividend. So if you accumulate the increase in dividend for 4, 5, 6 quarters, then by middle of 2022, you
already would have a significantly higher dividend after seeing 6 increases at the time we just did. That's
really what we're trying to do to get to higher dividends. And by that time, the leverage would have come
down and such that higher dividend will really be supportable at that point in time from the cash flow and
still have enough cash available to keep bringing the debt down further.

Operator

We'll take the next question. It comes from Chris Danely from Citi.

Christopher Brett Danely
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I guess just a little bit of color on the capacity constraints and shortages. So Steve, you talked about it
being in the automotive, industrial and consumer sectors or end markets. Most of your competitors are
just saying automotive. Would you expect this to spread to those other end markets for your competitors
and other folks in semis? And then what -- when do you remember these shortages being this bad? Do we
have to go back to like 2010 or 2000?

Stephen Sanghi

17

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

I do not remember shortages being this bad ever. So this is just like a -- this is a Six Sigma event in terms
of shortages, call it, a Black Swan event, although that's more meant for negative. We -- I don't really
know what other competitors are seeing what, but our capacity for automotive products and industrial
products and consumer products is really common. It runs out of same fabs, the same processes.
Sometimes they are the same parts that we can ship into an automotive or ship into an industrial. So the
capacity constraints would really be shared by all markets.

Now the largest increase in demand has been in automotive where in the June quarter, automotive
demand went to 20% of normal because all the factories shut down. And as that demand has gone back
to 95% of normal or 100% of normal, that's a 5x increase in auto demand. So they are seeing sort of the
worst shortages because they didn't place their orders. They didn't really guide towards having this strong
V-shape recovery. So they're [ partly ] a little worse than that, but the capacity is common.

There's also a fact that in automotive, a $1 part can prevent a $40,000 car from shipping. In industrial, a
$1 part could just prevent a [ 1999 ] power drill from that shipping. So the hard factor is quite different.
So therefore, the noise from automotive, the escalations of the management team and the pressure and
all that is really at a different level.

Operator

We'll take the next question. It comes from Harsh Kumar.

Harsh V. Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

First of all, congratulations on the [ tremendous ] [indiscernible] what you're seeing. Steve, I have 2, and
I'm just going to lump them all into one. I wanted to go back to what Harlan was talking about earlier.
As you get over your supply issues, let's say, whether it's June or July, am I incorrect in thinking based
on your -- kind of what you mentioned in the press release as having a very strong year, that as you're
able to supply, should you not expect a second half that is better or stronger? Or how can you think about
linearity from here? And then for Eric, the question is on gross margin. If I'm not mistaken, you're at
your target or very close to it. With no M&A, would [ they not be a potentially ] to think about that gross
margin [ model you have ] as you get more and more efficient?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So I think taking the question of capacity, you mentioned somehow that we catch up by June, July. We
don't expect to catch up on demand capacity balance for the balance of the calendar year 2021 and could
possibly go into 2022. I mean we already know that the demand on lots and lots of products succeeds
where we have no product available. If you place an order today, we were shipping you in September,
October, and people are booking September, October, November fast. And with PSP program, we're going
to get backlog all the way through next January, February. So I don't think the capacity issue is getting
solved in the next 4, 5, 6 months. I think we're talking a 12-month at least to solve that, to really have
the capacity to get in balance. I don't remember the other part of your question for Eric.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I'll take the gross margin question. So we did actually update our long-term targets for gross and
operating margin back in December. We took the gross margin target to 65% and the operating margin
target to 42%. So we essentially achieved what was our prior target of 63% on the gross margin with
these last quarter results and are guiding at the midpoint to about 63.5% this quarter.

So gross margin has absolutely been a highlight over the last couple of years, and we're continuing to do
all the right things to be efficient in our operations to drive improvements. And I'm not sure if you have
more follow-up than that, but we definitely have outlined 5 or 6 things that are going to help us continue
to make improvement on gross margin into the future and we can go through that separately if you'd like,
Harsh.

We'll take the next question. It comes from Janet Ramkissoon.

Janet Ramkissoon

Nice creativity, guys, with this new program. I was going to ask a question about the margins as well. It
just seems to me that if you have a lot of visibility and you could procure supplies in a more timely and
efficient manner and just plan better, generally speaking, as you go -- as you exit 2021, you should be in
a position where you would hit those target margins -- you could hit those target margins a lot sooner. Am
I correct in thinking that, Steve? Or is there something I'm missing?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, the PSP program doesn't really do anything to the margin. [ Anecdotally ], it could make us more
efficient if we get a large amount of backlog, lots and lots of customers take up on that offer and then we
can build the product more efficiently. It could help a little bit on the cost side of the equation. But PSP
program wasn't launched to drive margins. It was launched to get a firm customer backlog that we can
be confident of growing our capacity and not have any double ordering or excess ordering in that backlog
which could go away when we get there. That's why it was launched. It was not launched for margin, and
I don't think it's going to have a lot of impact on margin.

Now as we are growing through this growth period, you have 3 or 4 things happening. Number one, all
the underutilization is going away. Most of it is going away in March, but some could be going away in
June. Number two, as the incremental capacity is being added, the incremental capacity usually is more
productive because you're not adding the entire -- every machine. You're adding bottlenecks here and
there. So when you add that capacity, the incremental margin thrown for every dollar of revenue tends to
be better. And you could go back in the price cycles and calculate incremental margin to get some idea.

The third being we are bringing some products, both in fab and assembly and test, from outside to inside
and those moves are accretive. There could be something else. The impact of price increase, I think, is
going to be relatively benign because we largely launched that to offset the cost increases, but you can't
always increase the price on a product where you have seen the cost increase. You got to look at the
product, whether there's a competitive element there or it's a proprietary product. So the price increase
and cost increase don't completely match product-by-product. But overall, we might get some benefit
certainly in revenue, probably not in margin.

That's very helpful. Great quarter.

capacity to impact your margins over the next 3 quarters? Would you say that there's going to be a

we want to improve our gross margins to the long-term target. But I would not be looking for quarter-by-

Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Just 2 quick ones for me, and then I'll get off. I guess, Steve, first of all, PSP, ultimately, what percent
of revenue do you expect to go through the PSP program versus other? And then secondly, as you bring
some internal capacity home even on the wafer side, does this bring up a conversation about 300-
millimeter fab or not? Is that -- at what point does that become of interest to Microchip?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So I think the first part of your question, what portion of the revenue we expect to go through PSP, we
really have no idea. It's never been done before. It's being launched by taking on questions from many
large customers saying, "What can you do to make sure I get capacity support in the second half? I'm
delinquent now. You're not giving me everything I need. So how can I ensure that I get that in future?"

And so we came up with this program and saying, "If you commit that your orders for the next 12 months
