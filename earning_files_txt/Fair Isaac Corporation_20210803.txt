Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation quarterly earnings call. [Operator Instructions]

As a reminder, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 3, 2021. I'd now like to turn the call over
to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.

Steven P. Weber
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's FICO Third Quarter Earnings Call.
I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and
our CFO, Mike McLaughlin.

Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call,
management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding
of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as
forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve
many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company's
business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information
concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk
factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC from
the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.

This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the
company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these
non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation
G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or are on the
SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 3, 2022.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. Before I discuss
our results, I'd like to thank our FICO colleagues for their dedication, adaptability and innovation during
this past year. As we begin to open our offices back up, we're moving to a hybrid system where more
of our team is working from home. But we've proven in the past year that we can make the most of
technology to collaborate and continue to serve our customers and optimize our business both remotely
and in person. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that offer financial
highlights of our third quarter.

In our third quarter, we delivered revenues of $338 million, an increase of 8% over the same period last
year. As previously disclosed, we completed the divestiture of our debt collections and recovery products
during the quarter. Adjusting for that, revenue grew about 9% year-over-year. We delivered $151 million
of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $5.18 per share, including the gain on sale of the C&R products.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the sale, net income was $99 million, up 29%, and earnings per
share of $3.38 was up 31% from last year. We continued to deliver very strong free cash flow growth as
well. Free cash flow was $99 million in the quarter and $462 million for the last 4 quarters. And we're
dedicated to using that cash flow to return value to our shareholders through our repurchase program.
This is a very strong quarter for us, and we are well positioned for a strong finish to our fiscal year.

As we continue our strategy of migrating our business model toward a subscription-based model, we
see some disruption in our near-term numbers. We're not recognizing as much revenue upfront and
not selling and delivering as much lower margin services revenue. But these efforts are positioning the

company for long-term predictable and profitable growth. Beginning next quarter, we will be providing
additional metrics that will give additional transparency to our business. Metrics like ARR will complement
our revenue reporting and provide a better indicator of our growth trajectory. We'll also be talking about
the different delivery vehicles for our software, specifically, whether the products are delivered on platform
or off platform.

The Decision Management platform is the linchpin to our software strategic vision, and bringing new
customers on to that platform will enable us to scale the business and realize its full potential. As I've
stated, we believe we can become the preeminent player in decisioning analytics. That is our singular role
in our software business.

On the Scores side, we remain committed to innovation while maintaining the predictability that has
always been the cornerstone of the FICO Score, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to drive
outstanding growth in our Scores business. Scores posted another record quarter, up 31% versus the prior
year.

On the B2B side, revenues were up 23%. Mortgage originations, as predicted in the marketplace,
appeared to have peaked and were flat with last year's numbers. It is now a year since the refi boom
began, and we expect those numbers to trend down as the market returns to more normal levels.

Auto originations continue to be strong with those revenues up more than 30% year-over-year. The most
dramatic growth came from credit cards and other unsecured lending products. We had a record revenue
quarter in card originations with revenues up more than 50% from last year. We saw acceleration in card
origination activity throughout the quarter and expect that activity to continue to be strong.

Prescreen volumes were up more than 150% versus last year. This is typically a leading indicator for new
card origination activity and shows the financial institutions have a strong appetite to market and originate
new accounts in the unsecured market. We believe banks are in a very strong financial position to pivot to
other lending products as mortgage demand wanes as expected by the industry.

On the consumer side, we continue to drive impressive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 50% versus
the same quarter last year. Net growth at myFICO.com, while still strong, is slowing, which we expected as
the mortgage market cools off. Growth among our partners has picked up as Experian and others find new
ways to serve an increasingly sophisticated consumer.

Finally, this quarter, we closed the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery product line. Mike will review
the financial impacts and talk about how we are using the proceeds for share repurchases. As we said
last quarter, the divestiture further focuses our resources on refining and distributing the best-in-class
decisioning platform that we believe is an incredible opportunity for FICO.

I'll have some final comments in a few minutes. But first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial
details.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our third quarter results in more
detail and provide some information on the divestiture of the Collections and Recovery products we closed
in the quarter.

Total FICO revenue for the quarter was $338 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Our
Applications segment revenues were $133 million, up 3% sequentially and down 6% versus the same
period last year. Adjusting for the C&R divestiture, Applications revenues were up 6% versus last quarter
and down 4% from last year. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily driven by reduced
professional services revenues.

In our Decision Management Software segment, Q3 revenues were $33 million, down 20% over the same
period last year due primarily to decreased upfront license revenues. As Will said, our shifting business

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

model is continuing to impact our software business in the near term. Our on-premise license revenues
will continue to decline as we move away from license sales to a ratable subscription revenue model.

Second, at the start of our fiscal year, we noted that we have also changed our revenue recognition
assumptions for on-premise term license subscription deal. As a result, we now recognize less upfront
license revenue and more revenue ratably over the term of each deal. The net impact this quarter was
lower license revenue in our Applications and DMS segments of about $4 million versus what it would have
been under our prior methodology. We anticipate the full year impact will be about $40 million in lower
software license revenue this year, all of which will be recognized in future periods.

As a reminder, last year, we booked $61 million in upfront license revenue in our fiscal fourth quarter
under the prior methodology. So that will be an especially difficult year-over-year comparison.

As we pointed out in the past, this change in timing does not have an impact on free cash flows or the
total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. I'd also
like to remind you that we are deemphasizing low-margin nonstrategic professional services engagements,
which is resulting in lower PS bookings and revenues. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling
more high-value software with recurring revenue. This quarter, services revenues were down 18% versus
last year.

As Will said, we closed the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery product line in the third quarter.
We recognized a pretax book gain of $93 million in the third quarter. The sale contributed $2.52 of after-
tax EPS to the quarter's GAAP results. Proceeds from the sale were used to fund a previously announced
accelerated share repurchase program.

Turning to our Scores segment. Total revenues were $172 million, up 31% from the same period last year.
B2B was up 23% over the same period last year, driven by continued high volumes in credit card and auto
originations and as well as some unit price increases across our different score categories. B2C Scores
revenues were up 15 -- I'm sorry, 50% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and B2C partner
revenues grew significantly. This quarter, 80% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region.
Our EMEA region generated 14%. And the remaining 60% was from the Asia Pacific region.

Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 85%
of total revenues. Consulting and implementation services revenues were 11% of total revenues. And
license revenues were 4% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues, not including related PS revenues,
continued to grow and were $67 million for the quarter, up 10% from the previous year.

Q3 bookings totaled $75 million, down 29% from the previous year, and had an average weighted term
of 30 months. Those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues, a 12% yield. Much of the
decline in bookings was due to our deemphasis of low-margin professional services and the shorter term
lengths of deals signed. Professional services bookings totaled $21 million, down 50% from last year.

We continue to see a strong pipeline in our software business. And typically, we have our strongest
period for new deals in our fiscal fourth quarter. As we have said, we expect bookings to trend lower
overall compared to historical numbers as a result of our deemphasis of professional services sales and
the somewhat shorter term length of typical subscription and on-prem term license contracts. As Will
mentioned, we plan to begin providing more subscription software financial metrics next quarter, and we
believe that the additional transparency will lead to better understanding of the results of the company,
particularly in the software segment.

Our operating expenses totaled $144 million this quarter, which included the $93 million gain on the C&R
sale, compared to $230 million in the prior quarter. Excluding that onetime gain, expenses were up $7
million, primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense. Compared to Q3 2020, operating
expenses, excluding the onetime gain, were up $6 million. We do not expect expenses to -- sorry, we
do expect expenses to continue to increase in Q4 as we gradually add strategic headcount to drive our
decision management platform development and distribution and increased customer-related travel.

Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 39% for the quarter, a margin
expansion of 500 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $151

million, which included $93 million of pretax gain from the divestiture. Our non-GAAP net income was $99
million for the quarter, up 29% from the same quarter last year.

The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be
approximately 26% to 27%. And we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%,
including the impact of the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery business.

Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million, flat with the same period last year. For the trailing 4
quarters, free cash flow was $462 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $238 million in cash, up $40
million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at just over $1 billion with a weighted average interest
rate of 3.64%.

Turning to return of capital. We bought back 489,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price
of $466 per share. This includes a $200 million accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered
into following the close of the C&R divestiture. For the 9 months ended June 30, 2021, we repurchased
1,031,000 shares. At the end of June, we had about $225 million remaining on our stock repurchase
authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm extremely pleased with our team's ability to manage
our business and serve our customers in the midst of all this uncertainty created by the pandemic. We
continue to prove that the FICO business model is strong. Our customers rely on our mission-critical
software, scores and other analytics to manage risk and optimize interactions with consumers. We
continue to invest and innovate to provide state-of-the-art solutions for customers looking to use analytics
to make better decisions.

I'll turn the call back over to Steve now for Q&A.

Steven P. Weber
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer
Thanks, Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks. Operator, if you'd like to open the lines, we're now
ready to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I think to start with a question about just the adoption of a competitor score by a large card issuer that
was recently revealed, I guess. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive marketplace at this point
in terms of just how you think about the FICO 10 Suite and maybe kind of if there's anything unique that
prompted the issuer to switch from using FICO?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The short answer is, without getting into all kinds of details, that was a special situation, I think.
Those scores have been around for a long time. And our scores are very strong and continue to stand the
test in the marketplace of being desirable. We believe our scores are the most predictive out there for
what they're used for. And our business in Scores is as strong as it has ever been. Our volumes are very
strong. We have not seen a decline. And we don't see major issuers switching away. So I guess the best
way to characterize that is a one-off. And I think that's really it.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then in terms of just -- when I think about the Scores business broadly and especially
the strength that we're seeing in B2C, is there any additional color that you can provide in terms of the
framework for how we should be thinking about the growth that, that business is seeing? If we were to
rewind to last year, I think the thesis was that there's a lot of people that were concerned with their credit
scores. And so there's kind of a rush to kind of do credit monitoring on a personal basis. But now that the
pandemic has resided, I guess we're further through that process, can you talk about the resiliency of that
business? And maybe are there additional factors that are now driving the growth? When I think about it
on a sequential basis, the growth was still very impressive.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think that there's some offsetting trends here. So the 1 trend that we worry about -- we don't worry
about it, but we recognize is that mortgage was super hot over this last year, and we can't expect it to
continue at the same levels. And that's what all the market analysts predict. And we don't see any reason
to disagree with that.

And it is true that when consumers go shopping for a mortgage, they often go to credit score monitoring
to get a sense for what they're able to get by way of mortgage and pricing. So there's -- that's a positive
factor that won't be as present going forward, at least until the next cycle.

Offsetting that, I think, is a level of awareness on the consumer part of the importance of credit scores,
which has just been on a steady upward trajectory for a very long time, certainly in the last 5 years. And
as I've shared with you in the past, 10 years ago, our -- the FICO Score-aided awareness was about 30%
in the U.S., and today, it's over 90%. And most consumers are well aware of how important the FICO
Score is and continue to try to monitor it. So we see that as a positive and a positive that will continue.

And then finally, our partners who provide credit report monitoring, credit score monitoring services are
increasingly sophisticated in the way they get the message out and what they provide to their consumer
customers. And they're doing very well, and we encourage that. So we feel pretty good about the
business.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe one other quick one. It sounds like auto and credit card volumes were an
important contributor to the B2B part of the growth story. Can you talk about maybe where we might be
in terms of how close are we to prepandemic levels within like the credit card segment at this point? I feel
like there's a good visibility into auto volumes, mortgage volumes, but just kind of the third leg of that
stool.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Mike, I don't know if you have any detail on that, that we can share.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, we need to be careful about that because of the nature of our relationships with the bureaus, of
course. But it feels as though there's definitely still room to grow. They have rebounded smartly and you
can see that in our results. But we're not in the business of predicting credit card volumes as you can
understand. But from what we can see, looking backwards, which is all we can do, is it's still growing and
doesn't appear to be plateauing.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kyle Peterson with Needham.

Sam Salvas

This is actually Sam Salvas on for Kyle today. I was wondering if you guys could provide a little more color
around the pricing environment for the Score business. Did that last round of pricing changes have any
noticeable impact on the Scores business this quarter?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would say not dramatic differences, not dramatic changes, not dramatic impacts from that.

Sam Salvas

Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. How should we think about the expense and margin
trajectory of the business moving forward after that recent divestiture there?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I wouldn't expect tremendous changes. I mean there's some benefit that comes from deemphasizing
lower-margin professional services as we talked about. So there's a benefit there. But at the same time,
you've heard us talk about the opportunity in the platform space and the tremendous amount of R&D
that we're pouring into it. And so I think there's a -- there's focus on cost and expense control on the one
hand, but at the same time, our investment levels are high. So I think those offset one another, and I
wouldn't look for tremendous margin improvement. There's also -- and this is a much more modest effect,
but there's also -- coming out of COVID, there'll be more travel expense, that sort of thing.

Operator

Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Going back to the Scores business, revenue grew 31% in the quarter. And you mentioned mortgages were
relatively flat from a volume perspective. Cards and auto's strong. Can you, at a high level, discuss how
much card and auto volumes grew by and how much pricing contributed to growth?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Well, I don't think we break that out. I think that's something we kept to ourselves. Mike, do you want to
help me with that?

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Well, sure. There were some numbers in the script, which we can revisit with you on the one-on-ones,
if you like. But as Will said in his previous answer, the story this quarter was about volumes, not price. It's
not that there was no impact of price, but it was the lion's share, for sure, about volume in the segments
we discussed.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then I'd like to dive a little bit more into your on-platform strategy. Can you talk
about evidence that you're seeing increasing customer adoption of your on-platform solutions and what
initiatives you have to further drive client adoption of your on-platform products?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. So all of our major -- if you think about our major franchises, customer management,
what use -- the TRIAD franchise, which goes to line increases and judgments about how and what to do
with customers, existing customers and our other franchises, we are increasingly putting those solutions
on top of the platform. So we're selling our software in a couple of ways.

One is where the customer is after a solution, and they happen to get that solution on top of the platform
or they will, but that they're still after a particular solution. But increasingly, what we're seeing is major
financial institutions saying, we want to standardize on the platform. And we want to do not 2 or 3 or 4
solutions. We have an intent to do 10 or 15 or 20 solutions on top of this platform. We want to leverage
all of our data across all the different; places where it resides and apply analytics and do it in a unified
way. So we leverage everything that we have to make decisions with respect to customers. And that's very
much the future of our -- that's our platform strategy, and that's -- our future is doing that.

We have -- it's a lumpy business. So we've landed a number of big customers over the last 12 months for
the platform for this very purpose, with an intent to start with 5 or 10 or 15 use cases and then expand
beyond that. So we're pretty happy that the solution is meeting the need in the marketplace. The platform
strategy has legs and it seems to be working.

That said, we have a lot of work left to do. Not all of our solutions are completely ported to the platform.
And the platform isn't as modular as we wish it were. We're working on that. So there's definitely plenty of
investments still going in. But from a customer reception standpoint, we have medium and large financial
institutions who have adopted it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.

Ashish Sabadra
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I was just wondering if it's possible to quantify how we should think about the impact from the C&R
divestiture in the fourth quarter or quarterly impact going forward.

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Mike, do you want to take that?

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

I can take that one. Yes, I'm happy to. We mentioned last quarter -- or perhaps it was in the press
release when we announced the deal, that roughly it's 6% of our revenues, and that's [indiscernible].
And expenses are -- in the near term that we'll be able to flex are in the same ballpark as those revenue
numbers.

It's a Q4-heavy business, just like our other software businesses are. So the year-over-year impact
of not owning that business in Q4 in '21 would have some seasonality associated with it versus a pure
[indiscernible]. But that will give you the ballpark of what to expect.

Ashish Sabadra
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Good color. And then maybe just to follow up on the earlier question around the software. I was wondering
if you could talk about the -- like the progress on the API -- the external API strategy as well as the
studios. Any color there would be helpful.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I would say both of those proceed to pay. And that we have -- am I hearing this interference? We are
making progress on both the external-facing APIs and on FICO Studio. [indiscernible] but much of that will
be ready this year.

Operator

The next question comes from Caroline Conway with Autonomous Research.

Caroline Conway

I wanted to ask about the expectations for Applications going forward following the recent divestiture.
Would you say that the business at this point is rightsized? And can you talk about the strategic role of the
business unit at this stage, particularly as it relates to the Decision Management business?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I guess I would say that it is rightsized. We don't have any plans for any significant divestiture going
forward, at least not at this time. So I would call it rightsized. I think the way to think about it is that the
Applications solutions will increasingly be available on top of the Decision Management platform. And so
what we [indiscernible] forward [indiscernible] be able to share with you how those things break out. But
rightsized, yes.

Caroline Conway

Okay. And my other question is, next quarter, as you're talking about the ARR and other metrics, are you
expecting to provide additional detail on Decision Management profitability, especially the timing of turning
to a profitable level? And will we see some guidance at that point as well on growth rates?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

We'll start with the revenue, and I think we'll have the TBD on getting down to margin level.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Anything further you can say on bookings? It was the third quarter in a row of relatively weak bookings,
and it sounds like the emphasis of professional services is a large part of that. You also mentioned
shorter term lengths. And I guess is that customers electing shorter terms? Or you and customers jointly
preferring shorter terms because of how the subscription-based software is sold? Or is that timing of large
deal activity? Just how much of the weaker bookings is that? How much of it is other things?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

The shorter term length is significant. It's -- Mike can keep me honest. I think it's on the order of 25%
reduction in term length. So it's significant. In terms of whose idea is that, we always do what the
customer wants. That said, if we have -- to the extent that we have a choice in the matter, our preference
is for shorter because we do think that's a better way to go. We think that there are more opportunities for
us to revisit things sooner if we go for the shorter term length. So -- and this is part of why we changed
the way we compensate our sales force as well. We used to compensate on bookings and longer terms to
commissions, and we no longer do that. I mean our goal is to provide the term that our customer wants,
but shorter is absolutely fine with us.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

And Jeff, I can add a little bit of color to that. So the term length, the average term length was 37 months
a year ago and it was 30 this time. That's about a 20% decrease, 19% to be specific. And if you apply
the rough math, that's $15 million to $20 million of bookings right there just because of term length. And
the other factor is PS intensity. Our PS bookings were $20 million lower this quarter than they were last
quarter. You see we're $30 million down in total bookings. So those 2 factors alone would, all else being
equal, explain that.

Helpful. And then when you're giving the example of customers landing on the platform with a eventual
intent to do 10 or 20 solutions, how many SKUs are there? Like how many solutions could a customer buy
today if they bought everything? Or like where is that going?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's probably -- SKUs is not even the right way to think about it. Because when we think about
SKUs, we're at, I don't know, call it, 150 SKUs. But the platform in this modular form provides the
opportunity to do hundreds and potentially thousands of combinations of things. And so I think what we're
moving to is more of a usage-based pricing and a modular pricing that lets customers mix and match the
components that they want to achieve the goals that they want from a solution standpoint. And so it's not
like everything will be prepackaged.

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then last one for me. Just on B2B scores, how do you maintain an ongoing dialogue with the
ultimate end market enterprise customers? So I think technically, it's your customer's customer because
your Q and K disclosure is revenue concentration based on the bureau relationship. So how do you
maintain that end market dialogue and I guess monitor their commitment to staying on FICO Scores?

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Obviously, we stay close to it through our channel partners, the bureaus. But we also -- certainly, for all of
the major institutions, we have direct sales relationships. And so any significant activity in one direction or
another is well understood by our people, and we are in a dialogue with them.

Operator
