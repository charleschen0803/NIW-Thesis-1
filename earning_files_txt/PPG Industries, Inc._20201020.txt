PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would
like to welcome everyone to the PPG Industries Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.

John Bruno
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your
continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2020 financial results conference call.
Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince
Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Monday,
October 19, 2020. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on
the investor center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the website for this call
and provide additional support to the brief opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following
management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.

Both prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements,
reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and
financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results
to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking
statements.

This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in
the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these
non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional
information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.

Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2020
earnings call. Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.

Throughout the pandemics, we have focused on our purpose of protecting and beautifying the world. First
and foremost, this is meant to protect our employees, our communities and our customers. This remains
our highest priority.

Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed third quarter 2020 financial results
we released last evening. For the third quarter, our net sales were about $3.7 billion and our adjusted
earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were a record $1.93. Our strong operating results
were led by improved sales volumes when compared sequentially versus our second quarter results. The
global architectural coatings business performed exceptionally well, led by double-digit organic growth in
our European business.

In addition, our global positioning and advanced product technologies drove significant improvement in
quarter-over-quarter sales volumes in our automotive OEM and industrial coatings businesses. We couple
these sales volumes improvements with strong cost management and delivered segment margins that

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

were about 300 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter or more than 18% in aggregate.
This clearly demonstrates the strong operating leverage we have on incremental volumes and a tribute
to the structural cost savings we have achieved in the past few years. The higher margins were achieved
with about 30% of our businesses still facing significant demand headwinds, most notably the automotive
refinish and aerospace coatings businesses.

During the third quarter, our sales recovery continued to robustly advance in China, where volumes
were a low-teen percentage compared to the prior year third quarter. This was driven by above-market
performance in several of our businesses, including automotive OEM, general industrial coatings,
automotive refinish and protective coatings. While year-over-year demand was still lower in other major
global regions, it was vastly improved compared to the second quarter of 2020.

Specifically on our cost management, we delivered about $90 million of interim cost savings and a little
more than $35 million of structural cost savings. We are working diligently to ensure that a portion of the
interim cost savings will be made permanent. We're going through our annual profit plan process, and
we'll have more details on the additional catalysts in January when we report our full year 2020 results.

Our teams have also done an excellent job managing working capital and cash uses during the pandemic.
Through September 30, we have reduced our working capital as a percent of sales by about 150 basis
points on a year-over-year comparison. Coupled with the strong operating results of our third quarter,
we generated more than $800 million of operating cash flow, higher than what we achieved in the third
quarter of 2019.

Looking ahead, we expect economic activity to continue to recover with differences across end-use
markets and geographic regions. For the company, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be down
a low to mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter with differences by business and region. We
do anticipate normal seasonal trends sequentially versus the third quarter, which does result in lower
absolute sales for several of our businesses that have been delivering some of the highest growth. We
expect our aggregate global architectural business to remain more resilient and once again deliver higher
year-over-year organic sales in the fourth quarter. Although we anticipate continued softness in the U.S.
commercial maintenance segment and for the do-it-yourself demand to begin to moderate somewhat from
the elevated levels, we're continuing to invest in our digital capabilities and expect more activity to be
digitalized in the coming quarters.

The most recent demand increases experienced in the global automotive OEM and general industrial
coating businesses are expected to continue, including the impact from very low customer-facing product
inventory levels in its end-use markets. We continue to manage through heightened level of uncertainty,
with the ongoing pandemic still impacting several of our key end-use markets and other geopolitical
matters. The more challenged sectors, including automotive refinish and aerospace coatings, will provide
further margin expansion opportunities once demand begins to improve.

We project adjusted earnings per diluted share to be about 10% higher than the adjusted earnings per
diluted share realized in the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding the lower effective tax rate we expect in this
fourth quarter's projected results.

Our liquidity position remains strong. And we are evaluating earnings accretive cash deployment
alternatives, most notably, bolt-on acquisitions. Our teams around the world have been providing essential
products and services that our customers rely on for their businesses. As we continue to manage through
the pandemic, we remain committed to partnering with our customers to create mutual value.

Finally, I want to thank our global team. As one PPG, we are effectively managing through this prolonged
and extremely challenging time and clearly winning in several of our key end-use markets. Our third
quarter results are a further testimony to my confidence that we will emerge as an even stronger
company.
Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Michelle,
would you please open the line for questions?

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.

Thomas Glinski
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is Tom Glinski on for Bob. So first question, just how would you frame the low end of your 4Q '20 EPS
range? Does this bake in another round of lockdowns? And then how do you get to the top end of your
range?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I would tell you that our -- we are not assuming any significant lockdowns. We're watching it closely.
Clearly, the one area that is most important to us would be France. Our architectural business there is
#1, and it's one of our larger businesses in Europe. But I would tell you that right now, we have a pretty
balanced view of that.

Thomas Glinski
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just as a follow-up, how are you thinking about the price in raws formula going into
next year? I know you're calling for a sequential increase in raw material costs. But how long do you
expect raws to remain moderated on a year-over-year basis? And then, secondly, on the price side. On
the second quarter 2019 call, you called out that you hadn't yet caught up on the most recent round of
raw material inflation from 2016 to 2018. So could this help buffer your pricing power, especially on the
industrial side, going into next year?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, we've had multiple quarters of 2-plus percent price increases. We anticipate continuing to be
successful in raising price in our Performance Coatings side. We expect price to be relatively flat in our
industrial side. Although with all the new products that we're rolling out, they will come with improved
margins. So I think you'll need to be paying attention to that.

Raw materials sequentially will be modestly higher. You have to look a little bit at oil. You have to
look a little bit at propylene. You have the force majeures that have come through the hurricanes. So
we're paying attention to all that. Right now, we're anticipating just a moderate, very slight, moderate
sequential inflation in raw materials.

Operator

And your next question will come from John McNulty, BMO.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Congratulations. So I guess, can you give us a little bit of color around the temporary cost cuts vers the
restructuring ones? And in particular, how to think about the cadence of each one flowing through 4Q and
into 2021?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, John, I would tell you, some of the temporary cost cuts that we're going to make permanent are --
think about travel and expense. We're learning how to deal with that on a regular basis, so that's internal

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

6

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

and external costs. Think about digital experiences. So we're trying to convert more things digitally, so
that, over time, will continue to drive more structural cost savings.

When you think about the restructuring cost savings, those are more people-related as we get more
productivity initiatives completed and we've closed a few plants. That will turn into permanent cost savings
as well. So I feel good about the pace that we're doing. I think we're meeting or exceeding all our internal
targets from that respect, John.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

And John, I think we gave out in our guidance, $30 million to $35 million of structural or restructuring-
related cost improvements in Q4. So that sizes that element for you.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up question. So your cash flows are coming
in pretty solidly. And normally, as you get kind of into the back half of the year, at least historically, if
the M&A hasn't really caught on, we tend to see more buybacks, and we didn't really see that this time
around. So I guess, I'm curious, is that a reflection of just what you see as a chunkier kind of M&A pipeline
at this point? And maybe if you can give a little bit of color as to the types of things that you might be
looking at.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. John, we're obviously not going to get into what we're looking at. But we have a very active pipeline.
You probably saw somebody make an announcement in Europe. That's a sign of things loosening up. I
anticipate there'll be further announcements in the fourth quarter and obviously, more in the first quarter,
second quarter. So we're anticipating that the pipeline, because of its activity, that we're going to continue
to look for that being our #1 priority just like it always has been.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

John, one comment, I think, it's important. Given our global breadth, our participation in all the end
markets, we typically have at least similar, if not more, synergies than most of our competitors as we look
at these deals. So going forward with the pipeline Michael talked about, a robust pipeline, hopefully, we
can participate assuming these are at the right price for our shareholders.

Operator

And your next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So Michael, on the 30% of the portfolio that you referenced that includes commercial aerospace, auto
refinish, et cetera, how did the volumes sort of shake out in 3Q in aggregate for that 30%? How do you
see that rebound building off of 3Q levels going forward? And then on the other 70%, should we anticipate
moderation in volumes for any subsegments as we cycle into 2021?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think we gave pretty clear guidance that aerospace was down 35%, and I anticipate a similar kind
of number in 4Q. But what's happening in aerospace right now is they are destocking as fast as they can.
So assuming they get to a new level at, say, the end of the year, what you should have is a double catalyst
going forward, not only as improving demand but also restocking back to more appropriate levels.

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

So what I see right now from talking to a number of people is COVID fatigue, right? So people -- I
anticipate people are going to be traveling at the holidays. And so on the back half of the quarter, we're
going to start to see our MRO activity start to pick up. Now they may not buy anything in the fourth
quarter, but I anticipate that they'll relook at their inventory levels, and they'll relook at how they're
thinking about that in first half of next year.

So I'm not as pessimistic as some of the folks are out there on aerospace. You get a vaccine. I think
there's a pent-up demand. We had the highest CSA flow-through of people last week. And I anticipate a
gradual recovery until there is a vaccine.

Now refinish, I think what you saw, our China business is doing very well, better than prior. So people are
back in the office and people are working. We saw the same thing in Europe. As people start to return
to office, the congestion levels start to get back. Right now, they're blooming again with COVID. So we
anticipate and we have factored into our guidance a slight amount of moderation in our refinish volumes.
But then, as we get a better handle on this, we anticipate refinish volumes will continue, plus we have a
very good land industrial coatings business within refinish. We have our SEM acquisition in there. So we're
benefiting via our good mix within refinish. I anticipate a gradual recovery of that all of 2021.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then a second question. At the onset of the pandemic, you were very focused, along with
others, on maximizing free cash flow. And I think you made the comment that you were going to work
through finished good inventory, et cetera. Can you just update us more broadly in terms of that dynamic,
where you are on your inventory levels at PPG specifically? And then as you rebuild inventory, is that part
of the reason that you've seen this sort of ferocious operating leverage in 3Q? Just kind of trying to get a
sense as to how sustainable that is.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, yes. Ghansham, actually, our inventory is down year-over-year. It's one of our reasons for strong
operating cash flow. It's actually working against us on the cost side. We're not running our factories
as hard as our demand -- our current demand would indicate. We hope to hold that inventory discipline
through certainly the balance of this year and into next year. So we're not intending to rebuild our
inventories.

If you look more broadly our inventories, most of our coated products through our customers all the way
to the consumer are very lean inventories in the automotive. Auto OEM business are very lean. Appliance
is very lean. Electronics, very lean. As Michael alluded to, we think in aerospace, it's getting leaned out.
So we do feel there is an opportunity if we do see a spike in -- or some spike in demand for not only the
demand to improve but also inventory levels to have that second catalyst.

Operator

Your next question comes from John Roberts from UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

A nice bounce back in earnings. The Wall Street Journal had a story this morning on the need for more fire
protection in lithium-ion battery powered cars. It was disappointing that it didn't mention PPG coatings.
But is it a problem that car companies might not want to discuss fire protection, including your coatings,
since that just highlights the risk that it's something that car buyers don't want to think about?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, John, the way I think about this is, every car company that make electric batteries are coming at
it in a slightly different fashion. And every company has a different solution. The good news is, in a lot

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

of these batteries, we are part of the passive fire protection system that helps them eliminate that. So I
would tell you, the opportunities going forward are going to just be really good.

I think I shared with you in a prior call and so for the broader group, China is trying to come out with a
standard. So far, PPG is the only one that has passed that standard, which is to allow the vehicle occupant
5 minutes to exit the vehicle in the event of a fire. So I'm feeling very good about that. We have great
technology. We've already solved this problem in other companies, so we feel confident we can solve it
again. Clearly, we'd love to see a government-mandated fire safety hazard standard, if you will, and we
think we can certainly participate in that. But we have so many opportunities in batteries right now in
electric vehicles that we're super excited about. Every -- hardly a week goes by that we don't have a win
in that space somewhere, whether it's in Europe, U.S. or Asia. And we're really -- I think we're doing an
excellent job there.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then MOONWALK seems to be getting some good traction. Do the economics to PPG change with
MOONWALK adoption? Or is it just a share gain?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, it's both, right? So we have a subscription model out there on MOONWALK. So we're going to think
about Software-as-a-Service. So we're going to be collecting revenue on MOONWALK as you go. We've
-- I would say, about 25% of all MOONWALKs that have been installed have been share gained. And
the only thing that's holding us back is making them. We're making these things in Southern Europe,
and that's where it was hardest hit by the pandemic. We're getting over that right now. But there's a
lot more opportunities. The people that have them, we have nearly 500 of them installed in Europe, are
exceptionally pleased with the performance and the ability to drive better productivity in their body shops.
And that's what this is all about, is improving the productivity as well as allowing their painters to spend
more time painting. So those are the 2 big wins, and our team has done an excellent job highlighting both
benefits.

Operator

Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

A nice job on a quarter. I guess things are going better in Pittsburgh in more ways than one. Michael,
if I could follow up on that MOONWALK. Given the fact that you are gaining share, I just thought it was
interesting in the color heat map that you provide that European auto refinish, your volumes year-over-
year were a little bit lower than they were in the second quarter. And you indicated that you're only
gaining -- you were only growing at market. I would have thought that, that would start showing up, that
you would be growing faster than market. When can we anticipate that we will be flipping that heat map
indicator to above market?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, Frank, as you know, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's really hard to justify a market gain. And so we
tend to be conservative in that area. Maybe we should be a little bit more aggressive trumpeting our wins.
But I would tell you, from what we've seen, we're doing very well there. I do see our results as being very
good. Now obviously, I'll have a better feel for that after all the company's report in the next 10 days,
and I'll be able to give you a little bit more -- a better feeling for that. But I feel very comfortable that
we're doing better than average in Europe. And especially from a profitability standpoint, our team has
done an excellent job. Our ICR acquisition over there, we could have clearly ticked that as above market
through the acquisition, but that's not how we do that. But that's allowed us to get mid-tier and some

value opportunities. We've expanded that out of Southern Europe also to Eastern Europe. And we feel very
confident that we're going to continue to grow share in refinish in Europe.

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

All right. That's very helpful. And I guess, the kind of the biggest eye opener that I saw in the quarter was
the industrial coatings margins. Can you talk about the sustainability of that? How much of it may have
been driven by these -- by the $90 million of temporary cost savings? So just give us a flavor for where
you see that heading down the line.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, the biggest thing about the industrial segment margins was really the recovery of the volume
and our productivity in our paint plants. The productivity has been outstanding. The team has done
an excellent job. When things were super light in the second quarter, they got a lot of people, they
got to think about how can we do different tasks more efficiently? And so they've been able to drive
that productivity throughout the paint plant, and that's been the #1 thing. So any further recovery in
automotive is just going to lead to more enhanced profit to the bottom line. So I would tell you, that
part is where I'm feeling most comfortable going forward, and it's all being driven by our Lean Six Sigma
initiatives.

Operator

Your next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Nice quarter. Lucky win on Sunday. But just a quick question on...

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

So we just barely covered the spread, Mike.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Barely, but a nice one. But in terms of your sales trends, it looks like September looked flattish, and you're
guiding for down in the fourth quarter. Is October trending down? And just curious why the sales trend
couldn't have been a little bit better given September looks pretty decent.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I would tell you, Mike, we were minus 5% for the quarter, and we guided minus 5% to low single
digits. So I don't regard that as trending negatively. I regard that as trending positively. But when I look at
our October results to date, and obviously, we don't have a profit number, all we have is a volume number,
we're well within our guidance. So I feel confident that we're going to be at or above where we are in the
guidance. So I'm not concerned about that, and I would not characterize it as the way you did.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Mike, a couple of anomalies with August, September. Labor Day fell early last year. So for the architectural
businesses, we actually had some Labor Day paints billing to August in the 2019 year. Most of that was
in September in 2020. Hurricane Laura in the Southeast part of the U.S. hit late in August. There was
certainly some conservatism around inventory build and some inability to get to some projects. And we
did have a strong European holiday season that we saw some snap back in September. So I'd call those

10

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

anomalies month-to-month, but it all worked out in the quarter. So the quarter, we think, was a more
representative number for 2020.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then if you think about your EPS growth in the third quarter, double digits, fourth quarter looks
like double digits again. How do you think EPS growth looks when your volumes actually turn positive?
Should it be stronger? Or does some of the interim costs come back? And just kind of get a feel for how
earnings goal should be when volumes look -- turn up.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We're still guiding to negative volumes in Q4. We haven't given 2021 guidance. A little too early to do
that, Mike. But I think Michael's last comment was, we are still expecting very strong incrementals for the
foreseeable future on any volume growth. We're holding costs in check. Our operations are running very
well. And again, we expect price in raws to be neutralized at a minimum. So again, we're still expecting
very good incrementally. We can't tell the volume trajectory in the first part of next year. It's just too
early.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Mike, the other thing I would add to that is, don't forget, 2 of our best businesses, refinish and
aerospace, are the ones that are going to be the tailwind, no pun intended, the tailwinds going forward.
When their volumes recover, that will be very positive for our margins.

Operator

Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So can you just break down your current thoughts heading into '21 on the U.S. and EMEA architectural
businesses? I mean there are a lot of trends that we're monitoring, resi versus commercial, into extra
paint, stain, sealant, trade versus DIY. Just what are the biggest trends in the context of reverse
urbanization that your team is monitoring?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I would tell you that in Europe, you're not going to have the reverse urbanization that you have
here in the U.S., right? They don't build this 1 million, 1.4 million houses in Europe like they do here.
But I would tell you, they're -- they tend to maintain their homes in a better shape than the U.S. does.
So during the pandemic, they have been -- when the stores have been opened, they have been very
aggressive in maintaining their properties. And I think we're anticipating that, that trend for the next few
quarters is going to continue. This has been a market -- Europe that has been slight to minus volume on
-- for the last several years. So this uptick does not surprise us in the least. The big concern in the U.S., of
course, is the new construction for buildings. Once these buildings are completed, there doesn't appear to
be a lot in the pipeline for new ones coming up. So that's a bigger issue for us.

Great. And you've done a solid job at a minimum holding price in industrial, and then you're up low single
digits in performance, which I think is overall a pleasant surprise. But just given volumes in most of the
industrial end markets, they're still a bit sluggish, albeit recovering, how should we think about your ability

to raise price in the current environment? And we see some positive moves in mix in terms of like EVs. But
are there any other new product launches we should be considering to drive uplift?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, obviously, mobility will come with some attractive margins going forward. Any time we launch a new
product, we're always trying to capture some of the -- share 50-50 or so with the customers on the value
creation. So that will be an opportunity going forward. Overall, right now, our customers are most focused
on ensuring their plants are running. And so our tech service teams are in high demand. So if you look at
automotive, we outperformed the market in 3 of the 4 regions. And the reason for that is our tech service
people are so highly valued. They want to make sure they captured our tech service people to help them
start up and now to keep them running. And because run uptime is so highly critical, we have a number
of projects that our customers have asked us to look at where they're trying to drive more productivity in
their paint shops. So I would tell you, right now, their primary focus is on uptime and new products, and
that's where they're going, going forward.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We do expect positive price in Q4 for the company in aggregate, certainly positive price in 2021 for
the company in aggregate. Both segments are exploring targeted pricing as we get to negotiations toward
the 2021 calendar year. So again, these opportunities to price, be it service, be it technology-based,
permeate both of our operating segments.

Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I wanted to come back to the auto refinish business. My question relates to some of the differences in
trends by region. In the U.S., I think you indicated collision claims were down 20% or so. And EMEA, I
think you said your sales were down mid-single digits. Just wondering if you could kind of talk through
that disparity. Is it wider than you would have expected 3 months or 6 months ago? And how do you think
those trends progress over the next few quarters?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Now, Kevin, I would tell you that the trend lines are pretty consistent with what we expected. Think about
the U.S., work from home, a lot of people have big homes, and it's easy for people to work from home. In
Europe, the homes are much smaller. I would say people were claustrophobic. They wanted to get back to
the office. And so they moved back to the office at the first opportunity they could. Here in the U.S., there
tends to be more conservatism. I mean it's somewhat amazing. There's 100 million people going to work
every single day in the U.S., but there's not a lot of people going downtown to various cities to go to work
because they're able to work from home. And so gasoline sales were only down like 5% or 6%. So people
are out there driving, but we don't have that congestion that we normally have at rush hour.

So you get a vaccine, and that will be a catalyst for more people getting back into the office. Clearly, some
companies have people back in the office. Other companies don't. It's really pretty disparate how people
are approaching this. But you've got higher speeds in the U.S. So totals are up 2%. So right now, what we
see is a lot of traffic in the suburbs and not as much traffic downtown areas. But I know our refinish team
has done a really good job of driving share gain, and that's what we're focused on right now.

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Kevin, the one other thing we're seeing in Europe is there's less utilization of public transportation. That's
been historically more utilized in Europe vers here. So there is still a fear factor of folks getting on public
transportation. So the driving trend there, even if there's not as many people going to work as there were
in the past, more people are driving as opposed to taking public transport. We're seeing the same effect in
China as well. And again, our China refinish volumes were up, we think, largely due to that effect.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

That's helpful color. And then second, for Vince, want to ask about your tax rate. With regard to the 18%
to 21% range in the fourth quarter, I think you mentioned some discrete items in the prepared remarks.
My question is, is there any component that is perhaps more sustainable? Just thinking about how you
might expect the rate to trend into 2021.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

So there are a couple of items we're looking at for Q4 that we hope to achieve through tax planning.
Kevin, I wouldn't call it structural at this point. We're certainly interested to see what happens here with
the U.S. elections to determine what our tax rate will be next year. So we'll give some more guidance in
January. But the items that we referred to for Q4 were tax planning, and we hope to achieve those in the
quarter and not carryforward items.

Your next question will come from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Michael, just on your heat map, U.S. architectural, you highlighted that trade was below market. I know
you had some weather issues in that segment. Anything else you can highlight as to why you were below
market in that business in September -- in the September quarter?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I would say, David, our 2 biggest markets are Texas and Florida. And given the hurricanes, we
underperformed because we couldn't keep our stores open or we had limited ability to do that. And of
course, we're a little bit over-indexed on maintenance. Think about the hospitality industry, things like
that. So that hurts us a little bit when you consider where we are in res repaint. We're under-indexed
on res repaint. And res repaint, obviously, doing better. People are much more comfortable. We're doing
very well in exterior. We're over-indexed in exterior. So we're winning there. We did outperform. We don't
break USCA up into U.S. and Canada. We did outperform in Canada, so we gained share in Canada. And
we gained share in some minor markets like Puerto Rico. But I would say, overall, net-net, we felt like we
were slightly below market.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And just going back to these temporary interim cost savings, Michael, should we think about those as a
headwind to 2021 earnings? Are we thinking about a bridge between 2020 and 2021? Or how should we
think about those as a temporary cost savings year-over-year?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Hey, David, this is Vince. Again, we're not adding those costs back unless we see at least ratable volume.
So I wouldn't assume those are a headwind going into 2021.

Your next question will come from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Michael, do you expect the DIY business will slow down as the weather turns cooler? Or is it -- there is still
pent-up demand from the lost business in the summer months? And can you also talk about the interior
versus exterior paint trends?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So clearly, exterior, interior is the easy one. You can't paint in bad weather. You can't paint when it's
really cold. So at some point, that is going to slow down. But we have not seen through the first, whatever
it is today, 20 days of October, any change in the demand pattern. So interior's picking up. People are
more comfortable with having contractors in their home. DIY remains solid and steady. And that's across
the board. So I look at that number in China. I look at it in Australia. I look at it in Europe. And of course,
you saw our numbers in Mexico. Our Mexican team is clearly winning share. We were up mid-single digits
in an economy that's down minus 8% or 9%. So -- in Latin America, we're doing Central America, Brazil.
So I would tell you, overall, I don't see any change yet. We are anticipating that it will slow down at
some point. We don't think it's sustainable at this rate forever. But right now, our fourth quarter, we're
anticipating a continuation of what we see so far.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Great. And a question for Vince. Vince, can you take a minute and talk about your digital strategy? And
what does it mean? Is it mostly customer-facing platforms? Or is it digitalization of entire PPG, including
HR, MROs, supply chains? Can you just -- where are you exactly investing and what kind of platforms?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, P.J., I would tell you the most exciting platform for us is our customer-facing platforms, where
we're really trying to take the customer experience to fulfillment and digitize that process. We've talked
many times with investors about -- we're not going in -- starting in the middle of the supply chain. We're
starting with the customer decision. That's where we think there is the biggest pain point. We've seen in
other retail industries those end-to-end digital platforms starting with the customer, most effective over
a longer period of time, as opposed to trying to optimize somewhere in the middle of the supply chain.
So that's where our biggest investments are. We're able to -- again, because of our global breadth, we're
able to take this investment, and not only use it in the U.S., Canada, but Europe, Australia, Latin America,
South America, Mexico. So we're able to get a bigger, we hope, a bigger breadth of business activity on
digital simply due to our geographic spread.

Your next question comes from Laurent Favre.

Laurent Guy Favre
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

The first one is on the EV side. I think in the slide pack you released last month, you talked about a value
uplift of 2x to 4x for EV. I was just wondering if you could perhaps tell us your line of sight on this for the

next couple of years on new product launches. Is the $100-plus value uplift actually foreseeable for those
new product launches? Or is it an aspiration for the longer term?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Michael -- I'll let Michael answer the question, Laurent. But just a baseload for everybody on the call.
So we did provide a little bit of a foretelling of what we see coming from a coatings perspective in the EV,
electric vehicle market. We do believe, at some point in time, there'll be 2 to 4x the coatings content on a
traditional EV versus a gas combustion engine. And so that's the background that we want to make sure
anybody has. And the timing of that, Michael, was the question.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Laurent, we are clearly seeing wins on, like I mentioned earlier, on a weekly basis. China has said
that 25% of their cars by 2025 will be EV. You've seen Europe make an aspirational target of the same
25%. And then, of course, you saw California's announcement. So everybody is working seriously in this
space. I would tell you, we have initiatives with every single company out there. We're the #1 guy in
automotive OEM. We're also very strong on automotive parts. We're very strong in protective and marine.
So we are the people that can bring all this together. And we're selling gap fillers right now, so we're on
that. We have a number of electric battery trials going on as well, adhesives and sealants. So we have a
very broad product offering. And as people try to come forward with solutions, our team has come forward
with a solutions-based approach that minimizes the number of people they have to deal with. And I think
that's also exciting to the car companies because they're being inundated with all these new ideas, and
what they want is to be able to get to market faster, and our teams help them get to market faster.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

In terms of adoption, Laurent, China has a target to get as much -- so much percent of their new fleet by
2025. Europe, as you're probably fully aware, different targets by country. We're seeing an uptick this year
in EV sales. So really, the adoption by the consumer is what's going to drive the additional sales in the EV
market by PPG.

Laurent Guy Favre
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

And maybe as a follow-up for Vince. On the last call with Q2, you talked about how some of the temporary
savings were binary, and they were either in or out. I was wondering if in the number you disclosed last
night, now all those binary costs are back in, so to speak?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Okay. We're bringing those in by region, by business as volume comes back. And so for those costs that
are binary of that nature, they've come back in Q3. To John's point earlier, they've come back when we
have volumes come back. So still very margin-accretive even though we brought back some of those costs
in -- from Q2 to Q3.

And your next question will come from Jim Sheehan from Truist Securities.

15

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll take that one, Jim. When you think about what we slowed down in the second quarter, it
was mostly in our industrial space, so automotive and industrial coatings. That is no longer the case.
Obviously, with the automotive guys back, we're ramping all those costs back up. More importantly,
what I'll tell you, what we did not slow down is we did not slow down any investments in China. We did
not slow down any investments in electric vehicles. And we did not slow down any investments in our
packaging business that we knew would be doing exceptionally well. So from that standpoint, we feel very
comfortable that our run rate coming out of the fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter will be very
similar to what we had last year.

James Michael Sheehan
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And in auto OEM, you talked about outperforming auto builds and your technical service teams. Is
that a feature really of the rapid ramp-up that's happening in 2020? Or do you see that as sustainable into
2021? And also, if you could relate that to your pricing discussions. If you're critical to the customer, do
you expect to get more pricing leverage as we get into next year?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think the way to think about that, Jim, is that when we have discussions on price, they're a lot
less aggressive on asking for things if they need us in the paint shop. And right now, they need us, and
one is in the paint shop. So that makes it a much more forward-facing discussion instead of a -- what's
the raw material environment. And so they're looking for value creation as well. And they're looking
for productivity, and they're looking for new product ideas. And so when you can have those kind of
discussions, that's way more productive than, what I would call, how do you split the pie.

And your next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

If there were a large infrastructure bill passed next year, would that make an appreciable difference to
PPG's domestic volumes?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I do think there will be an infrastructure bill passed. From our standpoint, I think it will come either
shortly after the election or Jan -- first -- early January. It will be a positive for us. But you have to
remember, those things take a while. They use the term shovel-ready, but nothing is really shovel-ready
because of the environmental due diligence they have to do on some of these projects. So it will be a net
positive for us. But I would tell you, it might not be noticeable in the first few months that after the bill
was passed.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And can you describe how much your incentive compensation is likely to change this year versus
2019? And of the $90 million in interim spending cuts, how does that split between SG&A and cost of
goods sold?

Yes. If you look, Jeff, the biggest change in our incentive comp really is around our TSR, our total
shareholder return, our stock price. It's going to be up probably high single-digit millions, really reflective
of the higher stock price this year than last year.

In terms of the $90 million split, 2/3 of that would be in our SG&A bucket, and 1/3 would be in cost of
goods sold. Those are round numbers, of course.

And your next question will come from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I guess I was just curious on the margins. Usually, you have anywhere from 100- to 250-basis-point
sequential decline in margins Q3 to Q4. This year, it looks like your guidance implies something maybe in
the 200- to 300-basis-point sequential deterioration in margins. Obviously, Q3 was very strong, aided by
probably continued robust production and a lot of the cost actions you described. Could you just, I guess,
frame your thought on margins in Q4? Do you think that you've kind of now maybe entered a structurally
higher level of margins that we should see that persists kind of through the next couple of years? And
again, it seems to me that maybe the typical deterioration is too much this time, and maybe there's a
chance that margins would be better in Q4. Maybe what are some of the headwinds that you're seeing on
that side?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think a couple of -- there's a lot of moving pieces, obviously, this year from quarter-to-quarter. So
looking back at historical trends, provide some guidance, but I wouldn't say it provides a bible to how
we look at things. What we're seeing in the industrial segment Q3 to Q4 is much less seasonality. The
automakers are not going to -- we don't think the automakers are going to go down as much around the
holidays as they did in Q4 prior year.

On the other side of the coin, one of our best -- as Michael alluded to in his opening comments, some
of our best-performing businesses have a higher level seasonality. So in aggregate for the company,
they're going to be more impactful. So the architectural businesses have been performing well. They
typically would have seasonality in Q4. We think they're going to have traditional seasonality. So again, an
aggregate for the company, that has an unfavorable impact on the quarter-to-quarter comments you're
talking about. So just a lot of moving pieces. I don't think there's anything abnormal in those, Arun.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then, I guess, just on the portfolio in general. You do have relatively low leverage. I know that
there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. But -- and I imagine that the pipeline -- is it mainly still more
tilted towards bolt-ons? And what is it going to take maybe to get a larger opportunity on the M&A side?
Do you see any of those kind of coming to fruition in the next little while?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, for the bigger ones, it takes a meeting of the minds to make that happen. So I would say you can't
predict those. So I would just say sit tight. So the vast majority of the things we're looking at in the
portfolio are bolt-ons. But there's some pretty meaningful bolt-ons out there. The pandemic, again, has
illustrated to people how this is twice in the past 12 years that there's been a meaningful downturn in the
economy. And people are looking at, okay, what's the best way for them to manage their private wealth
and maybe owning a coatings company where their ability to flex is not as robust as ours is. So if you

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

think about how quickly this is 2 times in a row we've had record earnings, a second quarter coming out
of the downturn in the economy. And a lot of these private companies are not able to do that. So I would
tell you, they're looking at that as an opportunity maybe to put some of the earnings from the selling their
business into their pocket and diversifying.

Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just wanted to follow up on OEM auto. On the last -- on the second quarter call, Michael, you mentioned
that some of the outgrowth coming from the tech service, you expected that to normalize in future
quarters. And just from sort of the -- some of the conversation, on this call, it sounds like maybe you're
thinking that's going to be a little bit stickier. And I'm just wondering, is that the case? And are you finding
ways to make that market share growth be a little bit more structural?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I do think it is going to continue to grow. We have turned our tech service teams into a business.
And so we're charging for tech service, where, in many cases, we used to give it away for free. And people
in the beginning were kind of like Missouri, the show me state. But during the start-ups, they could see
the value creation that our tech service teams were allowed them to get up faster, run more consistently
and think about the -- right now, a lot of these folks are running weekends and things like that. So they're
having some unusual period of times where controlling the environment in the paint shop when it's
running more frequently is hypercritical. And I would tell you, right now, they've been willing to pay for
those services, and we're pleased to provide them. So I think there is going to be more stickiness on that
going forward.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Great. As a follow-up, I just want to ask, on the architectural side of the equation, maybe more into
the retailers rather than your own stores, clearly, the do-it-yourself trends can't stay at this pace forever.
But I'm just wondering, if things decelerate, it seems like customer inventory levels are probably not that
high. So do we still need to have a pretty big buildup into the next spring season in order just to manage
sort of a regular season? I'm just trying to bridge sort of the downturn in takeaway versus what you have
to actually ship into the customer.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I would say, clearly, inventory levels at our customers are below what our customers would normally
have. But I'm not going to try to predict how they're going to think about inventories in Q1. So I'll just tell
you that inventories are low, and we'll wait to see how they decide to manage them next year.

Your next question will come from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just after you released last night, I was talking with our aerospace guy. And he thought your volumes
were much stronger than what he was going to see from the average input provider into aerospace. He
was thinking things would be down kind of 50%, 55%. So can you comment on, are your -- the business
you're in, is it doing better than the average input supplier in aerospace? Or is there a chance that maybe

18

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

customers are building a little bit of inventory of your product and we'll see a double dip there where that
will come in a little bit closer to what peers are doing later down the line?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Duffy, I don't see a double dip. I see -- I know very specific customers that have clearly taken
inventories down. And we are on a number of winning platforms. So as those winning platforms continue
to roll out, that helps our volumes. But overall, I would tell you, we're anticipating being down 35% in the
next quarter as well in aerospace. And then from that point on, I think it's going to start to trend up. So
we have a good mix in our business. Obviously, military is helping. Military is in a space where not only
are we strong there, but our business with the F-35 is getting bigger and bigger every year because we're
winning more content on that plane. So it's not just the build rate for the F-35. It's also the additional
content that we're winning. So I think that's really important for people to understand.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

And Duffy, if you look at our mix of business, we're about 30% military, 70% conventional aerospace.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I'll take another cut at it just because it's been the biggest incoming question I've gotten
since you guys put out your preannounce and people have kind of backed into margins. But if you look
at Q3, last 10 years, your margins kind of bounced around between 16% and 19%. So this quarter was
several base -- or several hundred basis points higher than the average of that period. Clearly, 150 basis
points higher than the best third quarter you've ever had. When we get out a couple of years from now
and turn around and look at this quarter, is this going to be an anomaly as far as the margin goes? Or do
you think this really kind of resets the bar and this higher margin level is something more structural?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

So Duffy, the way I would answer that is we launched something called The PPG Way 2 years ago. And one
of the tenets of The PPG Way is that we do better today than yesterday every day. So you're not going to
look back at this in a less anomaly in 2 years because our team is fully committed to The PPG Way, and
that's doing better today than yesterday. So that's going to carry forward.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would just add, Duffy, that if you look at Q3, and Michael alluded to this earlier, some of our most
technical businesses, aerospace and refinish, were -- remain in a recession. So hopefully, 2 years from
now, those businesses have recovered, if not fully recovered, and those should help the metrics you're
talking about.

Operator

Your next question will come from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Securities.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So SG&A was down sharply but so was R&D. So presumably, a lot of those are lower costs or part of this
interim cost-reduction bucket. Other than less travel, what are the big buckets that are in this interim cost
savings that enabled those 2 cost line items to be down so much? And do you need to bring them back up
when volumes recover in order to drive sustainable growth? Or could they stay down?

19

PPG INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

So Stephen, I'll take the question. When you think about R&D, the first thing you have to remember is
part of that cost is currency. And so we haven't been helped with the currency from that regard. Second,
what we -- we have our run rate on R&D in the third quarter is back to normal. We had some -- in the
second quarter, we did some things like 4-day work weeks, and we had the salary -- temporary salary
reductions. So all those are gone. So right now, the spending on R&D is at the same level as what we had
last year.

So -- but we are continuing to optimize our lab footprint. So we'll have less labs, so that drives permanent
cost savings. We also are using digital to drive more productivity. So that's a permanent cost savings. So I
would tell you that the spending on big projects is at the same level, but the efficiency is better.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And on the $170 million restructuring program, how would you allocate that between COGS, SG&A and
R&D? And how long do you think it will take to roll that through?

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Again, don't have those numbers right in front of me, Steve, but most of those were not -- most of
those were optimization of our workforce, our C&A workforce. We did have some facility and supply chain
optimization in there, but the vast majority of that was not supply chain or manufacturing.

John Bruno

Yes. Steve, circa 85%, 85%, 90% is SG&A.

Operator

Your next question comes from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research.

Kevin William Hocevar
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Maybe one other stab at some of the interim cost savings. So it sounds like those coming back are going
to be volume-dependent, or at least some portion of them coming back will be volume-dependent. And
with the fourth quarter, it looks like volumes are expected to be down low to mid-single digits, which is
a little bit better, similar to slightly better than what you saw in the third quarter. So is it fair to say that
$90-ish million will still be what's saved in the fourth quarter? Is that what's baked into guidance? Just
kind of curious what you have baked into the guidance for the interim savings in the fourth quarter.

Vincent J. Morales
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Kevin. If you look, sequentially Q2 to Q3, we think we brought back costs ratably with volume. We
do some volume -- if you look at Q3, Q4, we hope volumes on the low -- on the higher end, I guess,
that range. So we'll manage our costs back accordingly. But I think $90 million is probably too large of a
number, but we're not providing that. We did embed that in our guidance what we thought we could retain
in Q4 and heading into next year.

Kevin William Hocevar
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

And you talked about mix being a headwind, with aerospace and refinish being below the company
average in terms of volumes. How much is that holding back margin? So if you were to normalize that
and have those businesses performing more in line with the company average, I guess, how much room is
there for margins to improve as those businesses recover?

Senior VP & CFO

We don't give margins by business. But as we alluded to earlier, those are some of our most technical-
based coatings businesses, and those typically -- customers can see the value in those businesses.

And your next question will come from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the protective and marine business, what you're hearing
from customers there. You mentioned some project delays in Europe and the United States. Are those
significant and lasting kind of through the fourth quarter? Can you maybe talk about when you see the
protective and marine business getting back to growth?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, let me first start talking about it from the marine side. Marine build continued to be on the very
low end of the spectrum. So new ship builds are down 55%. On the positive side, our mix, we're very
advantaged here. We're much stronger in China than we are in Korea. And so our protective business and
marine business is actually, I think, doing better than the industry from that regard.

Clearly, you saw a lot of infrastructure projects that were delayed because of COVID. They got -- they had
to figure out how to have a COVID-safe working environment when they're working on these infrastructure
projects. So we think they have been delayed, but we think they're coming back now. Of course, now
you're getting into the winter, so a lot of those projects are going to be put on hold again. But I would
say, oil and gas is weak. Nothing significant change there. But we're launching some new products. We
launched some new polyurea product for the food business. So we think that's going to be a nice win for
us. And overall, the economy will get better, and so I'm anticipating that our wins in the refinery side will
start to blossom into the maintenance side of that as well. And Asia is a big place for us.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

All right. And then speaking of Asia, the packaging business, APAC shows up as growing below market.
How big is that piece of business, Asia packaging? And what's driving the weakness there?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Well, I would say it's not a huge piece of the company. What's driving it is they transition from what I
would call an older generation to a newer generation. We focus on the newer generation of -- in what they
call easy-open ends as well as 2-piece cans. And so from that standpoint, we're focused highly on the
next generation of cans. And so right now, as that transition hasn't moved as fast as it has in the U.S. and
Europe, we are losing a little bit of share. I don't regard that to be a permanent. I think we will get that
share back, especially because there are a number of global products, think about tuna and other things
that are made in Asia, that are exported. So as those global standards take hold in Asia, then we'll get our
share back.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.

So just to follow up on that. In the North America architectural trade and the Asia packaging, as you think
about the 2021 growth rates, will PPG be back to growing in line with the market? Or will the share loss
continue?

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

I would definitely say for packaging in Asia, we'll be back to market because those technologies will roll
out. And in the U.S., I see no reason why we wouldn't be growing that market in 2021.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. So 2021 should really be an at-market or above-market year across the board.

Michael H. McGarry
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean right now, we haven't done our 2021 planning process, but our initial assumption going into
that will be at-market.

Operator

We have no further questions in queue. I turn the call back over to Mr. Bruno for closing remarks.

quarter earnings call. Thank you.
