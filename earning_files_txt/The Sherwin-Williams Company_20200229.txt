THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. Thank you for joining The Sherwin-Williams Company's review of first quarter 2020 results
and our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year of 2020.

With us on today's call are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; David Sewell, President and COO; Al
Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice
President, Investor Relations.

This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet
at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at sherwin.com beginning
approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes and will be available until Wednesday, May 13,
2020, at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.

This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities
laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as
of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release
transmitted earlier this morning.

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over
to John Morikis.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy
during the pandemic.

Given the extraordinary circumstances over the last quarter, we've changed our typical format a bit today
to provide you with some additional perspective. After my opening remarks, I'll turn the call over to
Jim Jaye, our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, for some short comments on our first quarter
results. David Sewell, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will follow Jim and provide you with
details on how we're responding to the pandemic. After David's remarks, I'll share some color on what
we're seeing across our various end markets before turning it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Al
Mistysyn, who will provide you with our revised outlook for the year.

Let me begin today by thanking the more than 60,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams for their courage,
determination and resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their extraordinary efforts to serve
each other, our customers, our company and our communities during this challenging time truly has been
inspiring. This wonderful team has my deepest appreciation and my deepest respect, and I'm confident in
their ability to meet the challenges ahead of us.

Clearly, we're in a much different economic environment than anyone could have imagined when we
provided our 2020 outlook back in January. More than 26 million have filed for unemployment benefits in
the U.S. alone since mid-March, and other geographies also remain under significant pressure. Sherwin-
Williams is not immune from these grim realities. We are seeing major near-term impacts to demand
in most of our end markets. We have a long-tenured and experienced management team that has
successfully managed the company through a number of challenging times: recession in early 2000s,
the 2008-2009 financial collapse and the integration of Valspar, the largest acquisition in the company's
long history. Our entire global team remains undaunted and has taken actions to navigate this crisis. We
remain very confident in our ability to manage the near-term impacts we are seeing while positioning
ourselves for continued long-term success.

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

We've developed and are executing a comprehensive response to the pandemic focused on the safety and
well-being of our employees, our customers, our company and our communities. We are implementing
multi-phased contingency plans across our businesses to adjust to the near-term business environment.
We are well positioned from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective. We've adapted in order to stay
connected to our customers through this crisis, including modified operations in our stores and increased
use of e-commerce and other technology. We believe we're seeing a pause in demand in many of our end
markets rather than destruction of demand. We believe the long-term fundamentals remain intact.

We intend to continue strategic investments that support profitable growth. These include continued
investments in our stores, our products, our e-commerce platform and other initiatives as we look for
opportunities to expand our business. But before moving ahead, I'd like to thank our team again for
remaining focused and delivering on our first quarter plan, even as the COVID pandemic began to impact
us.

Let me now turn the call to Jim Jaye for some additional comments on the quarter.

James R. Jaye
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.

In addition to this morning's press release and our commentary on today's call, we've provided a slide
deck on our website with additional information. All comparisons in my remarks are to the first quarter of
2019, unless otherwise stated.

Overall, Sherwin-Williams delivered a strong first quarter that was in line with our expectation, with
year-over-year improvement in sales, gross margin, profit before tax, EBITDA, diluted net income per
share and net operating cash. First quarter 2020 consolidated sales increased 2.6% to $4.15 billion, and
consolidated gross margin increased to 45.6% from 42.9%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $93.4
million to $392.3 million. Diluted net income per share for the first quarter 2020 increased to $3.46 per
share from $2.62 per share.

The first quarter of 2020 includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.62 per share. And the
first quarter of 2019 includes acquisition-related costs and other adjustments of $0.98 per share as
described in the Regulation G reconciliation table included in our press release. Excluding these items, first
quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.3% to $4.08 from $3.60.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $48 million to $623.1 million or 15% of sales. Cash from operations was $54.9
million, an increase of $91 million year-over-year in the quarter. As is typical for us in the first quarter,
we used cash to build inventory levels in advance of the busier spring and summer selling season. We
continue to monitor the demand environment closely.

From a segment perspective, The Americas Group grew same-store sales by 7.4% and improved segment
margin by 140 basis points. Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group also delivered
improved segment margin performance. Additional details on our segment performance are included in the
slide deck I referenced previously.

Let me now turn the call over to David Sewell for some specific comments on how we are responding to
the pandemic. David?

David B. Sewell
President & COO

Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.

Let me also add my sincere thanks to our entire global team. Without a doubt, our incredibly talented
and dedicated employees remain our most important asset, and we have implemented a wide range of
temporary policies and protocols over the last 2 months to protect their health and safety. These actions
include: enhanced paid sick and/or family leave; alternate, flexible and remote work arrangements;
visitor and employee screening protocols; social distancing best practices; additional PPE and sanitary

procedures; and we have established a global crisis response team, among many other measures. We
also took the unprecedented step of temporarily closing our paint stores sales force to further protect
employees as we move to serving customers with curbside pickup and delivery options. As for our
customers, we provide essential products and services that are helping painters create and maintain
clean and healthy living environments at health care facilities, manufacturing plants, residences and for
other vital infrastructure. Many of these contractors have expressed their gratitude to us for keeping our
stores open and enabling them to keep their businesses running, doing their jobs, generating income and
supporting their family.

We're also supporting industrial customers in mission-critical areas, such as food and beverage packaging,
health care equipment, food manufacturing, water treatment and energy infrastructure. During the
crisis, we have delivered critical coatings products to producers of ventilators, oxygen tanks and hospital
bed frame. At this time, all major architectural and industrial plants and distribution service centers are
in operation. Utilization rates vary based on manufacturing site and customers served. We have had
no significant issues with raw material availability or supply. We've had a very small number of North
American stores closed intermittently during the crisis related to varying government orders. The vast
majority of stores remain open.

All of our businesses have developed and are executing on multiphase contingency plan to adjust to the
near-term business environment. We have taken targeted action to reduce costs, pause or eliminate
certain programs, cut general expenses and delayed filling open positions. We've also made adjustments
to a small percentage of our workforce through involuntary leaves and reductions in force. We have
additional levers we can pull, if necessary.

Through all of this, our employees continue to support the communities where they live and work. To
date, we have donated hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and lab coats to those on the front lines
fighting the virus. We have also manufactured and donated hand sanitizers to many hospitals throughout
the country. Our entire team remains focused and determined as we manage through this crisis, and we're
confident we will emerge from this as a stronger company.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, David.

As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe we are seeing a pause in demand rather than
destruction of demand, and we continue to feel confident in the long-term trajectory of our end markets.
While some economies cautiously begin taking steps to reopen, the pace and scale at which this will
happen is far from clear. We believe April will be the most challenging month of our second quarter from
a comparison perspective, with some gradual improvement as the quarter progresses. Whether the
recovery gains momentum in the second half of 2020, or not until 2021, remains to be seen. We believe
providing additional granularity on our end markets and how they might begin to emerge from the current
environment may be helpful to investors.

Let me begin in The Americas Group with our North American stores. Again, first quarter trends were very
strong with same-store sales up 7.4%, reflecting robust underlying demand. We've seen a dramatic near-
term pause brought on by the pandemic with all end markets, except DIY, being significantly impacted.

In residential repaint, customers are delaying interior work related to social distancing concerns and
having painting contractors in their homes. We expect this demand to return gradually as the pandemic
subsides and customers and contractors implement appropriate protective measures. We expect exterior
repaint work to gain momentum near term, which will help to offset some of the interior softness.

In new residential, starts were up strong double digits to begin the year. As workers return from stay-at-
home orders, work on these homes should resume. Our national homebuilding customers remain positive
long term, though cancellations have increased and order rates have softened near term. Activity should
eventually improve as mortgage rates are low and the supply of homes is limited. As a reminder, there's
about a 90- to 120-day lag from the time construction begins to the painting phase.

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

In new commercial, many of our customers were reporting strong backlogs, and our first quarter sales
were up mid-single digits. Construction has been deemed as essential in most locations and jobs in
progress will be completed. Work is largely continuing, albeit at a slower pace due to increased jobsite
restrictions and labor challenges. We expect starts to be delayed in the second quarter, but we're
optimistic that they will pick back up as the economy begins to reopen more broadly.

In property maintenance, overall renter's demographics are favorable, though apartment turns have
slowed dramatically near term. Management companies remain positive and expect renter movement to
begin quickly once the economy reopens. Maintenance related to hotels and restaurants is likely to return
more slowly. Some CapEx projects have been put on hold in some areas due to local mandate.

Our DIY business is strong as consumers are nesting and using stay-at-home time to work on affordable
home improvement projects such as painting. We expect our DIY business to remain solid in the second
quarter before returning to more normal low single-digit rates as stay-at-home orders are lifted.

In protective and marine, approximately 40% of our sales are tied to oil and gas, which has fallen
sharply over the last quarter. Major oil and gas companies have suspended or delayed capital expenditure
projects, which have and will continue to impact our results. Conversely, our sales in other end markets,
such as water and wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical, flooring, rail and marine, remain as planned,
which will help to offset the softness from weaker oil and gas business.

While we're seeing short-term disruptions and headwinds, the long-term drivers we have cited in the past
remain intact, including household formations and demographic trends. Given these long-term drivers, we
intend to continue to invest in our business. We anticipate opening approximately 50 new stores this year
while continuing to focus on sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity-
enhancing services.

Moving on to an update for Consumer Brands Group. DIY demand in North America continues to be strong
as stay-at-home mandates have increased home improvement demand. Sales to home centers and other
retail channel partners continue to perform well, and we are encouraged by growth prospects with multiple
customers in this channel.

Looking at our international businesses, we expect our sales to be under considerable pressure through
the second quarter. Our expectation is for these businesses to slowly return to more normal activity in the
third quarter as the economies of the world begin to open.

Lastly, let me comment on trends in Performance Coatings Group. Overall, we anticipate industrial demand
recovering more slowly than architectural demand. From a geographic perspective, North America remains
the largest region in Performance Coatings and was our strongest performer prior to the pandemic. We
would expect that to be true going forward. We have started to see some recovery in China, but at a
slower pace than anticipated. We expect continued pressure in Europe and Latin America.

In packaging, demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. We anticipate strong continued demand
and additional business wins driven by sustainability trends and our non-BPA valPure V70 coatings.

In coil coatings, we're seeing a temporary pause and slower pace of some commercial construction
projects. Jobs in progress will eventually resume. And coupled with the continued capture of new business,
we expect this business to remain one of our best performers.

In general industrial, we're seeing substantial demand weakness in various end markets, including heavy
equipment, agriculture, transportation and general finishing. We expect this recovery will be slow and will
see continued pressure throughout the rest of 2020.

In industrial wood, softness across various end markets, including furniture, kitchen cabinetry and
flooring, has continued. It is difficult to forecast the timing of improvement, though many of the same
drivers influencing new housing could benefit this business.

In automotive refinish, the business has been impacted by the various stay-at-home mandates that have
been instituted across the country. The decrease in miles driven has led to a decrease in collisions. The

7

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

pace of recovery in this business will depend on how quickly stay-at-home orders are lifted and people
begin to return to their normal routines.

Let me reiterate that while we are seeing near-term pressure across most end markets we serve, we're
confident in the long-term trajectory.

Now I'll turn the call over to Al Mistysyn, our Chief Financial Officer, to talk more specifically about our
revised 2020 guidance, our cash and liquidity position and our approach to capital allocation. Al?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.

We anticipate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economies will most likely continue
through the second quarter. We do not expect immediate, meaningful improvement ahead in most end
markets we serve, and we are unable to predict when any noticeable improvement in those end markets
will occur. Given the near-term trends and indicators we see at this time, we anticipate second quarter
2020 consolidated net sales will decrease by a low to mid-teens percentage versus the second quarter of
2019.

Looking at our operating segments for the second quarter, we anticipate The Americas Group to be down
by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up by a high single-digit to
low double-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be down a high teens percentage.

For the full year 2020, we are revising our sales guidance to reflect uncertainties in the timing and pace
of improvement in the U.S. and global operating environment. If economic conditions begin returning to
normal in the third quarter 2020 and continue improving through the fourth quarter, we anticipate full
year consolidated net sales to be flat to down a low single-digit percentage. If economic conditions do
not materially improve until the first quarter 2021, we anticipate full year 2020 consolidated net sales to
decrease by a mid to high single-digit percentage. This revised full year 2020 consolidated sales guidance
is compared to our previous full year guidance of an increase of 2% to 4%.

On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to down by
a mid-single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up or down by a low single-digit percentage
and Performance Coatings Group to be down by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage.

Considering our revised range of potential sales, we are revising our diluted net income per common
share for 2020 to be in the range of $16.46 to $18.46 per share compared to our previous guidance of
$19.91 to $20.71 per share and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings
per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.54 per share.
On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $19 to $21. One key assumption
embedded in our outlook is the raw material deflation we expect to realize for full year 2020. We expect
the raw material basket to be lower year-over-year by a low single-digit percentage.

Switching to our balance sheet, which, along with our liquidity position, remains the strength of the
company. At March 31, 2020, we had $239 million in cash and $2.5 billion of unused capacity under our
revolving credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio improved to 3.1x on net debt
to adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.5x a year ago. As Jim noted earlier, during the first quarter, we used
cash to build architectural inventory levels in advance of the spring and summer selling season. However,
our teams reacted quickly to slowing demand in various businesses and regions where it occurred and
aggressively reduced inventory which helped reduce our year-over-year working capital $151 million.

We have completed a number of actions over the past year to reduce our risk and improve our financial
flexibility. We recently completed a bond issuance in March for $500 million of 10-year notes at 2.3% and
$500 million of 30-year notes at 3.3%. These are the lowest coupon rates in the history of the company.
The proceeds of these issuances were used to complete a tender offer for $500 million of 2.75% notes due
in 2022 and will also be used to pay off a $429 million 2.25% notes that are coming due in May. Our next
long-term debt maturity in 2021 is $25 million.

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our company's stock and increased our quarterly
dividend by 18.6% to $1.34 per share. We are committed to maintaining this dividend increase through
the rest of 2020.

As David mentioned, we are executing contingency plans to reduce spending and conserve cash. As part
of those plans, we are lowering our full year 2020 capital expenditure forecast from $320 million to $180
million and temporarily delaying our share repurchases until we see improvement in the end markets we
serve. Finally, we have put a pause on spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility projects
but continue to work through various planning processes.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll
be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Parkinson with Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. Good to know everybody is doing well. So I'll leave this fairly open-ended, but can you speak to
some of the key trends in The Americas Group, such as the sustainability of the DIY boost? Any color
on the magnitude of the divergence between exterior and interior paint trends? And just how to think
about things on a subregional basis for what you're seeing in April, are there any differences between, for
instance, the Southeast versus the Northeast?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Chris. First, I would say, regarding the DIY business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks,
the nesting phenomenon, if you will, of our customers is largely the result of their spending more time at
home, and we believe that, that will continue largely through the stay-at-home orders. Historically, if you
look at the underlying principles that have us believing that this gradually shifts back to the do-it-for-me
as opposed to DIY primarily, we think those are still intact. Those are the aging demographics, the home
appreciation, the aging housing stock and as well, I would say that if you look at the last recession in DIY,
it grew not in huge amounts, but it was not protracted either. Here, we have a much more significant jump
in DIY business. And we're experiencing the DIY business in our stores for those customers that are still
preferring a more specialty store experience and through many of our customers on our Consumer Brands
business, and we're working hard to serve them as well.

As it relates to your next question regarding the -- what was it -- interior versus exterior, both were up
double digits in the first quarter. And we expect that as the season starts to turn a little bit here that we'll
start to see more lift in the exterior business as a result of more contractors getting the go-ahead from
homeowners who, in some cases, right now, are preferring not to have -- in many cases right now are
preferring not to have painting contractors enter their home.

And regionally, you asked a question, what we see regionally. I'd say that we are starting to see more
estimating. And I would say, the close rates in those estimates are growing largely in Southeast and
Southwest right now. They're lagging in the Northeast and in the Midwest, which, you would expect,
heavily influenced by what's happening in New York, what's happening in Illinois and Michigan. So I'd
say going back to the point that we referenced a few times in the prepared remarks, we feel structurally,
there's not been much shift. So we expect this do-it-yourself to continue short term, gradually shift back
to do-it-for-me, and we love our position with those customers to be able to capitalize on that.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. That's great color. Also just as a corollary to that, can you just very quickly just break out the
trends in P&M across The Americas Group and PC, just if you go through the oil and gas, protective
anti-corrosion and then just the smaller marine, just anything changing there in terms of your thought
process?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I'd say in P&M, we mentioned that, that represents about 40% -- I'm sorry, oil and gas represents
about 40% of our P&M business through our stores, and we have a very strong position there. I'd say
that the oil price has had an impact, primarily in the upstream business, where your offshore, shale, et
cetera, midstream with storage. Downstream, I'd say, in refining and cracking, there's still quite a bit of

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

investment going on. What I'm really pleased with is the shift that our teams are putting into place, the
pivot to where the business is, not necessarily where we are. We have a very strong position in those
areas that are under pressure, but we've got wonderful talent and wonderful products, and we're doing a
very good job, I believe, in moving into some of those areas that are underserved by Sherwin right now
in the oil and gas as well as other areas that we mentioned. Those are the water, wastewater, food and
beverage, even pharmaceutical, flooring. So this is a pretty experienced team we have here, and we're
taking advantage of those experiences, the scar tissue, if you will, from some of the past experiences.
We're not waiting for things to happen. We're trying to capitalize and drive things and make them happen.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I hope everyone is doing well. John, just kind of picking up on the last few comments, right? So your
comments, you're viewing this as sort of a pause in demand versus necessarily a disruption in demand,
but some of the metrics in terms of U.S. unemployment and credit markets have changed dramatically
over the past couple of months. I guess what gives you confidence that apart from the dislocation that you
and others will see in 2Q that this is, in fact, a pause versus something that's going to have a tail with it?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I think in each market, when we look at the drivers of those segments, we look through and
understand, we think, with a pretty good line of sight on what's going to happen. I think if you look at,
for example, in new residential, we feel there's a pause. That there's a fundamental need for housing in
the country. And that while the short-term traffic in models and the feedback that we're getting from our
large new residential customers clearly indicate some concern with the shorter term, we're not running the
company to have a great second quarter here, and that's it. We're doing the best we can with the cards
that we were dealt with in the second quarter. But we're looking at the fundamentals and we believe that
if you go by segment through our business that there are some very sound fundamentals. In areas where
there is some softness, we're not waiting. We're moving into those areas that offer opportunity. And so
segment by segment, we're dissecting our business, understand we have the right people doing the right
things to capitalize on those opportunities.

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

And Ghansham, I'd just add to that. The unpredictability about how our segments come out of this and
the timing of that, that's why we, if you will, bifurcated the guidance to say, okay, if we see things start
improving in the third quarter and then continue to improve in the fourth quarter, we think flat to down
low single digits. But if the true recovery doesn't start until the first quarter of 2021, we're looking at that
mid to high single-digit down estimate. So we perfectly understand the uncertainties, but that's why we're
giving a range of the timing of when we expect the businesses to come back.

Understood. And then just on the DIY piece that you're benefiting from in the stores group, how are
consumers engaging with your associates? I mean, generally, your stores offer a very high-touch
experience with high percent of consumers. How are your associates pivoting towards this new reality of
social distancing? And then just sort of related to that, from a high-level standpoint, are you seeing any
specific trends that are visible in terms of maybe the DIY piece being a bit more price-sensitive in terms of
the choice of paint?

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Thank you for that question because it gives me a terrific opportunity to recognize a wonderful team.
We've got a terrific leadership team in Pete Ippolito and Bill DeSantis and all our division presidents there.
But more importantly, as strong as those leaders are, we've got just a wonderful team in our stores and
are close to our customers and sales reps that are doing a terrific job. And your question gives me just
that, the opportunity to thank this wonderful team for everything they're doing.

You're right. It's changed things. We are curbside only. So it's given us an opportunity to leverage some of
the investments that we've made in our digital platform. We have orders coming in via the digital platform
that we've been investing in with a much greater utilization, so we're excited about that. And I would
tell you, we've been inundated with e-mails and notes and even phone calls from customers that have
gone out of their way to comment and recognize our employees and their willingness to work with people.
We've begun utilizing our color fulfillment. So customers can go online, order colors and have them into
their homes in a relatively short period of time. And our people in the stores are eager to help these
people over the phone to make sure that they're taken care of. And then the transaction takes place. It's
a contactless transaction when these customers pull up into our stores and the product is ordered at the
back of their car.

I don't know. I couldn't count how many points of contact I've had with people recognizing the wonderful
service and approach that we're taking. And that's on our stores. I would say that we're blessed with a
number of really, really strong and good customers on our Consumer Brands team. And Heidi Petz and
Keith Valore, the 2 leaders running that business, have really helped us to try to be as responsive as we
can to that important segment and channel to our customers. And we're trying to instill as much as we
can in our learnings from our store side into those customers and vice versa and just really providing
solutions to our customers. So we're really excited about this. I would say that the trend that we're seeing
in our DIY business is exciting on the consumer side as well as our stores.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And the pricing sensitivity piece?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'd say that on pricing, we continue to see a positive mix in our business. I'd say that much like
contractors who recognize that 90% of their projects are labor costs, many homeowners, particularly
those that are shopping at a Sherwin-Williams store, are typically willing to pay a little more to get the
finish that they're looking for and to have it be as productive as possible. So we are seeing a positive mix
shift in both the contractor business that we see as well as the do-it-yourself.

Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I guess 2 points. So on the raw material side, down low single digit. Just given what we've seen in oil
prices and propylene, it seems a little bit on the low side. Can you give us a little bit of color into what
you're seeing in the various baskets for raw materials and how you're thinking about how they trend
throughout the year?

James R. Jaye
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Sure. John, what I would say is, given the significant decline in crude, as you point out, we do expect to
realize lower year-over-year raw material costs throughout the remainder of 2020. The full year will be
down by low single-digit percentage, as we talked about, compared to our prior estimate of being flat
for the year. I think the rate in the second half of the year will depend largely on how the downstream
derivatives like propylene and ethylene react to the declines in crude. And I would say also, if demand

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

does not improve through the second half of the year, then we could potentially see a more meaningful
benefit. The majority of the benefit year-over-year is going to be on that resins and solvent side.

If you take a look at the TiO2 side, I think we've seen strong demand there in the first quarter and the
second quarter, but it's probably too soon to fully understand the supply/demand impact and the effect on
pricing there. I would say, at this point, we do anticipate stable to potentially lower prices for TiO2 in the
back half. Historically, weaker global demand has resulted in lower pricing. But again, I think the decline
that we're expecting to see in the basket is tied more on that petrochemical side and it's really going to
depend on how propylene and ethylene respond.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess in the stores business, so if I understand it correctly, you shut
down the front part of the store kind of in late March. Is there a way to think about how much sales
dipped when you went just to curbside pickup? And just so that we can kind of think about when these
required closures and that type of thing end, how to think about the snapback. Can you give us a little bit
of color or anecdotes on that?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes, John. It's hard to say exactly how much of a decline we saw, but in our second quarter guidance,
we're talking about The Americas Group down low double digits to mid-teens. I think just commentary, as
we've seen April progress, the weekly sales on architectural have improved week-to-week from a dollar
volume standpoint. As a reminder, April was our toughest comp a year ago. If you think about how North
America paint stores progressed through the second quarter last year, April was our strongest quarter, and
then it ticked down in May and ticked down in June. So we were fully expecting April to be our toughest
comparison. So that's what makes it a little bit harder to gauge how much is related to the shelter in place
and the changes to our sales force.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

John, I would add this, though. David Sewell here, our COO, has got all our businesses leaning forward
in a very positive way. So I'm a bit more optimistic, I might say, in the sense that we've come into this
business with a pretty strong performance, a strong comp store sale number. And David has our teams,
every one of them, including our stores, taking the activities right now that will help us grow even faster
coming out of it. And so the activity that we have in new accounts and product demos and information,
this is probably some of the most aggressive time we've had because we have had some customers on
the professional side that had interior projects that have been delayed. They're not able to get on the
exterior projects. And so it's provided our teams more accessibility to some of these customers. And our
new account activity is actually up as a result of this. Our demos of new products are up. So I give hats off
to David and our teams, not only in our stores and all of them, for what we're doing during these times.
And so I get what you're asking, as these stores close, how quickly do they rebound? Our desire, really
strong desire is to come out of this much stronger than even what we were before.

Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I wanted to go back to the comments you made earlier. I guess you referenced potential for opening
50 new stores this year. Maybe you can just discuss how you see that playing out? Are there particular
regions that you're targeting? And if you could relate that to some of the performance that you saw in
Q1 or Q2 that you're seeing right now, are you targeting areas where maybe you're seeing some weaker
performance regionally or is it just underpenetrated areas?

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

It varies by division. We are looking at in some areas what we call fill-in markets, where we have
underserved markets in areas that we might have more penetration, but we're missing some gaps
in there. A lot of areas, quite frankly, that we're just not happy with our performance yet in the
area of market share and our position, and we've got a long way to go. And so I'd say it's kind of a
balance between the 2. We'd like to take advantage of our position in the market while providing more
accessibility to our customers. And at the same time, we have to get after some of these markets that are
underserved.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about the refinish business as well. We all have
seen miles driven drop significantly. Maybe just give us your thoughts. You've had some growth recently in
the last couple of years, just a little bigger business for you now. So could you, yes, just comment on that
business and what you see for the outlook there?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Sure. You're right. We've seen miles driven down considerably. And we expect that, that impact could be
for another 30 to 45 days following the end of stay-at-home orders. So it's a little bumpy right now, if you
will, in that business, no pun intended. But our teams are really doing a nice job there. I think I mentioned
last quarter, it was a bold statement, and I stand by it. I think our position in this auto refinish business is
as strong as it's been since I've been on this floor of the building here. And I've got a lot of confidence in
our leadership in automotive, a lot of confidence in our Performance Coatings team and what we're doing.
And I think we've got a lot of determination in this business to outperform. We're going to have to get
some cars on the road to be able to see some of that, though.

I'd say here, though, as well, if I could. The effort that we have in the connectivity and virtual learning and
the virtual demos that our teams are initiating here is another area. Out of adversity sometimes comes
the best. We've had a lot of things that we've been working on that we've been able to accelerate, and we
believe it's helping to convert some of these customers. Some of them were on the fence before, some
who have just come online before the pandemic, and again, we expect to be able to capitalize on this as
we come out.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And just lastly, I know you had talked about evaluating your business in Australia. Could you just
comment on where you stand there and the progress that's been made?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Sure. The virus impact on Australia has been severe as well. We're 100% contactless there. But I'd say
that we've started to address, to your question, our SG&A and our position long before the pandemic.
And I'd say that our adjustments, not only in Australia, but I'd say, in Europe, even in Asia. If you look
at Europe, we had a 70% flow through on our business there. Australia, we've taken, we think, the
appropriate SG&A steps there as well as in Asia. Prior to the pandemic, we believe rightsized some of the
business there. And we've made some very difficult decisions in some areas and we've invested in some
other areas to be able to capitalize on our growth. So I wouldn't limit it to just Australia. I think we're
taking what we believe to be the appropriate aggressive steps for these businesses to drive the operating
margins. We've said time and time again, we're constantly looking at programs, we're looking at brands,
we're looking at businesses, even stores, every element of our business. If it's helping us reach our goals,
we want to put our foot on the gas. If not, we're making difficult decisions.

Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just curious about your North American consumer business, your guidance for second quarter is quite
robust. Is the trend that you're seeing in April representative of your outlook for the second quarter, i.e.,
are you seeing that strong of a volume growth during the month of April?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

I would say unprecedented growth in April.

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

I'd agree with that, Steve. And we really started seeing it kick in about mid-March, mid to late March. And
that trend has not only continued but accelerated into April.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And David Sewell made some comments about trimming the sales force or the personnel in the TAG group
in his remarks. Can you just comment on what you expect SG&A to be in the second quarter versus the
first?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. We are not trimming. Just to be clear, we're not trimming personnel in our TAG organization. In fact,
we'll continue to invest, as John talked about, in new stores. We will see the trend in SG&A decline in our
second quarter. Because of the sales shortfall, we probably won't see the percent of sales improve. But the
steps that David talked about in our contingency planning, they're material. And as he talked about, as we
see demand and the trends in demand develop, we have other levers ready to go, to pull if we need to,
but we are not going to be cutting our stores organization.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Steve, maybe just to make sure. I'm not sure what you may have picked up or the way we may have
said it, but we're always looking at our investments. And there are times in our normal business that we
might be skinning down in an area and investing in other areas. But I think the idea that is important to
hear is, our stores business is a very sound fundamental business that we expect to put more gas in that
tank every chance we can.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And if I could just squeeze one more in about housing starts. Are your contractors indicating to you that
it's a slowdown driven by delayed permitting or are they also seeing any problems with labor?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

I don't know that the labor issue is coming up right now. Let me go back to the very first part of your
question. We don't think that the fundamentals have changed and neither is our position in that market.
We feel the gap in the Sherwin-Williams value proposition is wide, and I'd say it's growing wider. If you
look at rates, and this may go back to the question Ghansham asked as to why we have confidence. Rates
are low. Housing supply is limited. And while there's some short-term impact to the business, we feel as

15

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

though the fundamentals are still there. I'd remind you that we have an exclusive relationship with 18 of
the top 20 nationals. And from the regionals, where we have the opportunity there, we have an exclusive
with 73 of the top 100. So there's more opportunity there for us to leverage.

And I would tell you that the value that we bring in distribution, our reps, the products, even the design
tools and local training are really areas that we're focusing on. And so I'd say, our customers right now,
for the most part, are dealing with the short term, but I would tell you the discussions that we're having
with them, in fact, last week alone, we had discussions with -- all top 10 builders had reached out to
us wanting to ensure of our supply chain and our capability to serve them. And I can assure you, we're
ready, more than ready to serve them. That's part of what gives us confidence. Yes, there's going to
be some bumps in the road in this quarter, no question, and maybe rolling a little bit into the Q3, who
knows, but we've got terrific relationships. We're going to be right there with them. And no one has the
responsiveness to serve our customers like Sherwin-Williams.

Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask about the CapEx reduction. That's pretty dramatic decline. I know you mentioned, John,
only like 50 new store openings, which maybe is about half of what is typical. Is that the bulk of that
decline or where else are we seeing the CapEx reduction?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. Bob, within our global supply chain, we are paring back some of the capacity projects that we had
scheduled to start this year going into next year. I would tell you that, that decrease of $140 million, what
we'll do throughout the year is monitor, again, how the demand trends are developing. And as we see, for
instance, our stores, architectural start building back up, we'll turn some of those back on. It's the timing
that causes the delay, but I think the $140 million would be kind of your max case. And then as we see
things turn around, we'll start investing back in our plants and our distribution centers and the automation
to help with our continuous improvement projects and operating efficiencies and things like that.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And I'm sorry if I missed it, Al, but you gave some guidance on second quarter TAG sales. Did you
comment on what the daily receipts in April suggested? We were thinking down 30% or something pretty
acute and then moderating. Is that reasonable?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Actually, our receipts have held up pretty well. I think maybe as you get into early May, we're going to
see a gap, but then start improving as we get towards the second half of May and into June because as I
mentioned, Bob, as we look at the progress on our weekly sales, that keeps improving. As we are staying
close to our customers, we're not getting a lot of concern about bad debt or solvency of our customers. So
right now, as we look at it, I do expect a little bit of slowdown here in early May and maybe mid-May but
then start picking up again.

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

How much is your online ordering up in the quarter from contractors or DIY? And how much of these
orders are curbside pickup versus delivery? And longer term, do you think that's a new trend that will
remain in place post-COVID?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

So you're probably not going to like these answers other than online is significant. Curbside versus
delivery, I'd say the largest part of our -- I'd say it's probably on the contractor side, pretty evenly split.
Obviously, the do-it-yourself curbside is delivered right outside of our stores. And I would say regarding
the future, yes, we want our customers using this system. We believe it helps in our customers' efficiency.
We think it helps our efficiency. It allows us to be a better partner to them and it allows our customers to
move seamlessly through our business. And you really begin utilizing the tools and resources that we have
much better.

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. P.J., it remains to be seen if curbside has staying power. I think, by and large, when you look at our
residential repaint contractors, they like the interaction with our stores. They like the interaction with our
reps. On the DIY side, I think there's some color counseling that they like to get while coming into our
stores. And currently, they're really not getting that interaction. So we'll see. They may have some staying
power, but I do think there's still a lot of interaction and the support they get from our stores on making
recommendations on colors and different things like that.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

But I might add though, P.J., the curbside aspect of it, we think that has legs and that will continue. It's
one of the outtakes that customers enjoy, in some cases, the ability to get in and get out. The majority of
the customers that come in the morning, start their business, have their crews at our stores can still do
that. And those that want to come in and zip out, we'll offer the best of both.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. And just related to that, let's say in the future it's an online order followed by delivery, does that
lower barriers to entry in the business or is it an advantage for you because you have a local store and
you can get there faster?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

It's a huge advantage to us. It's really no different when you think about it. The customer picking up the
phone and requesting an order and having us deliver that product to them. It's really no different from
that aspect. But I would say that we really enjoy this store platform that we have and the ability to do
both the multi-point distribution capability. We're 30 minutes from you anywhere. And our ability to deliver
in quick turnaround or with quick responsiveness, we think, is important. But it's also a foundation, we
believe, as those customers that are in every morning, they're building a partnership with our employees.
There's a loyalty that grows. And I'd say that loyalty grows both ways. It grows with the customer to
Sherwin and Sherwin to the customer. And we think that distribution is one, and albeit one very important
aspect of the stores. We really value our role in our customers' success, and I'd say we may value it more
than others because we have a terrific relationship with these customers. But I'd say these are valuable,
important in building a partnership. And that partnership includes problem-solving for the customers,
training, job management, helping them really run their business. And it evolves. It evolves from just a
transaction to a strong relationship.

And I would tell you, 35 years ago, when I was in a store, I built some of those strong relationships. And
unfortunately, about 1.5 years ago, I lost my mom. And I would tell you, I was shocked when I went back

home and found a few contractors that I served when I was a store manager that came back and spent
time with me there. I think I share that story because I think it captures the essence of what we do in our
stores. We build strong relationships and they last. And delivery is important, but we do a lot more than
just deliver.

Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Glad everyone sounds well. Just want to ask on The Americas Group guidance for the second quarter and
the rest of the year. We've talked about this on prior calls, but you've clearly been gaining a lot of market
share. And by my estimation, in the second quarter, you kind of lapped that step-up in share gain that
really started to take hold in the second quarter last year in that really bad weather period. So when you
think about what you're telling us about 2Q and what you're telling us about the balance of the year, is
that reflective of sort of how you think the overall do-it-for-me or just general paint industry is going to
do? Are you still baking in that you're going to continue to gain share even though the comps are maybe
getting a little harder?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

We're going to gain share, be very clear on that. We're going to gain share, and we're just getting started.
I look at what's happening and what we're doing during this time and the work that, that leadership
team and what they're delivering. And I'd tell you, we've got the best people in the field, the best store
managers, best reps. They've got great resources. And we're making investments, Vincent, during these
times that we expect to come out of this pretty strong.

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

And Vincent, when you look at those, we look at the long term, and we got an SG&A question earlier. But
as we keep adding reps, we keep adding stores, we invest in the product innovation and e-commerce
platform, this gives us the confidence that we'll exit the environment and positioned better to grow
multiple of the end market. And to highlight that point, this is similar to what we saw coming out of the
2008 and '09 recession. And I'll highlight for you the 3-, 5- and 10-year compounded average growth
rate of architectural sales in our North America stores grew at a high single-digit rate in each of those 3
categories, which we believe was a multiple of the end market, and we believe the same dynamics are in
this situation.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. No, that makes sense. Glad to hear you guys are leaning into it. As a follow-up, one of the other
things we've talked a lot about over the last few years when we had a low unemployment environment,
it was a bit challenging in periods where there was pent-up demand from bad weather to prosecute
that demand. But obviously, we go through the summer, we're unfortunately going to have some pretty
unattractive unemployment numbers. I'm just wondering, have your customers talked to you about
they're actually able to go out and hire more painters now and so maybe we will see a benefit from that,
at least for some period of time over the next few quarters.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

We might. I think it's a little bit early for that, but we might. And again, that's where I kind of feel like
I'm preaching on this store platform. But I mean, if our customers are hiring people that might be less
skilled or less experienced, that's where we can shine for them. We work with those customers. It's the
products that we provide and the [ biology ] that we use in our products to make sure that they flow and

level better than others. The touch up, the fact that we own our own colorant to allow that. The touch up
is easier and better. All of that allows maybe a less experienced or less skilled or growing in skill maybe
painter to be a producer for our painting contractor. So we like this type of environment where we can
shine, and that's what we'll continue to really try to leverage as we move through this process.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Wondering, John, if you can quantify how many of your stores are closed in North America right now? And
are those all situations where you've been restricted by the government or are there situations where
you have a handful of stores and you've decided to consolidate business from that handful into 1 or 2
locations?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Mike, let me have David Sewell answer that one.

David B. Sewell
President & COO

Yes, Mike, right now, we probably have close to 30 stores in North America that are closed. All those
stores are due to government mandates. The team is doing a really nice job in trying to fulfill orders
and deliveries from other locations that are open. And then as that continues to hopefully open up those
stores, we'll immediately open up when the government allows.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

And also was wondering a little bit about the cadence of demand from contractors as we're probably going
to see some slowing in existing home sales and if some of these commercial projects may get deferred.
Your competitor yesterday talked of a coming air pocket in some of that commercial business in particular.
Is that something that you see as well or do you think it's going to be steadier?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

I think there's structures coming out of the ground right now. And while there is some delay in getting
on those, one, because of the stay in place or stay home and the other, in some of those areas where
they're allowing workers to come in with restrictions, so there will be likely some delay in those, but our
customers are still feeling good about those. The other thing I would mention is, we track very closely
requests for specs, for colors, for data sheets, all things that we look at as data points in helping us to
understand kind of the trend, and they're very strong. And so we think short term, there's going to be
some bumpiness in this quarter. We get that. Again, second quarter is going to be a challenge. We're
going to get through that. And as our contractors and our specifiers and our architects are working on
projects, we're going to be the ones right there with them helping them.

will kill some bacteria, but it will not kill a virus. Now that said, we've had an interest as overall health and
well-being, the concern of ensuring that you have as safe an environment as possible has helped us in this
area, and we do have more interest on that product.

I think you had an increase of 3% to 4% on January 1. Perhaps you can enlighten us as to how much of
that has been realized at this point?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. Kevin, that price increase has gone as expected and we've realized just under 2% of effectiveness in
the quarter. We do expect that to get a little bit better into the second quarter but progressing as planned.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Very good. And then secondly, Al, with regard to capital allocation, you paused share repurchase activity.
Is it safe to say that M&A activity is likewise paused for some period of time or how would you characterize
level of interest for bolt-on or larger acquisitions at this point?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Well, we have a lot of interest in the acquisitions. I think what we're continuing to do is work with the
teams on generating the targets and filling our pipeline. Obviously, in this environment, it is challenging.
That being said, I feel very good about our liquidity, the amount of cash we generate, we have $2.5 billion
in available liquidity sources. We've done a lot of work pushing our near-term maturities out. I feel very
good about our balance sheet and our capacity to make M&A as we come out of this and we see some of
these targets maybe coming to the market, so I feel very good about our position.

Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

John, Al, how should we think about decremental margins in your various businesses in Q2 here?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. When you say decremental margin with all the businesses, except for our Consumer Brands being
down, what I think you see is all the actions that these groups have taken in continuous improvement.
I point to our Performance Coatings Group who, as we saw demand through the second half of last year
slowing, they really have done a nice job controlling costs, improving even how their operations are. And
you saw a nice pickup and their first quarter operating margin was up. So I think the way I look at it is, all
the actions that we've taken coming into this and all the actions we're taking now, I would not expect to
see -- it's not a dollar-for-dollar decrement, if you will. I think you're going to see us do better than that.
How much? Obviously, it depends on volume, but I think we've done and taken the right action.

Yes. I think if you look at that business, particularly the Performance Coatings Group, strong leader, Aaron
Erter and Ed Thompson there that are for the last over a year period have been really driving and have
a wonderful leadership team beneath them that are really driving expense reductions down to be in a
position to leverage everything that we can here. So I think there's been a lot of good work and it will only
continue.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And John, just in Consumer Brands, very strong results. Are you gaining share in this business or is just
the underlying growth of the market as we see it right now?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

I think it's early to tell. I think right now we're working very hard to be the best supplier we can. And as
data comes out, we'll know better. But right now, we're trying to build the brands, the products and make
sure that we're servicing our customers better than anyone else could.

Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Glad to hear you all are safe and healthy. So John and Al, you all have touched on this quite a bit, but I'm
hoping to ask it a little bit differently. In The Americas Group, you're expecting the second quarter sales
to be down low double-digits to mid-teens and then for the full year, flat to down mid-single digits. At the
low end of that full year guidance, I think it implies that revenues improve to kind of a mid-single-digit
decline in 3Q and 4Q. Could you just walk us through how you all are getting there and maybe some of
the assumptions that you're making that even at the low end we're going to kind of improve versus the
second quarter?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes, Truman. As we start seeing and where this is really going to kind of come in, as we start seeing
states start opening up and the shelter-in-place executive orders are removed and job sites start opening
up more and we can get back to work, I think as that progresses through the quarter, I expect to see
improvement in the trends in the weekly sales rates. And then when you get to the third quarter and the
fourth quarter, I expect that to continue. Exterior, even in the second quarter coming into the third quarter
on res repaint, there's opportunities, as John talked about. I mean, there are commercial projects that are
in place today that need to get painted. There are housing units in place today that need to get painted.
And we expect those to happen here. It's just timing so. And as we carry the additional stores and reps
that we put in last year, that we're putting in this year, you would expect the ramp-up as we get through
the third and fourth quarter.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then on the Performance Coatings demand, you're expecting it down high single-digits to low
double-digits in 2020. Could you just give us an idea whether you're seeing any of the pricing contracts
start to soften, especially in the face of a lower raw material environment?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes, Truman, let me just jump on the pricing. The amount of sales we have indexed or pegged to an
index is probably less than 10% within Performance Coatings. It's less than 3% overall. I just think you're

-- historically, and I'll even go back to my experience in 2000 and 2001, industrial just seems to be a
slower recovery than the architectural side of our business. Asia Pacific, which is, by and large, back
to work, is slowly coming, growing, but I think you'll see China, in particular, pick up a lot faster as the
U.S. and European economies start getting back on their feet. Our business has a significant component
that's export-related. And then it's just what do you think Europe and Asia -- or I'm sorry, Europe and
North America, how we come out of that. So it's going to be a little choppy across businesses, across
geographies but like we talked about, I mean, packaging is going strong. We expect that to continue.
As we get back to work and people driving their cars, we'll start seeing auto refinish pick up, as John
mentioned. So I just think the cadence is a little bit slower than architectural.

Operator

Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I'm glad you're all well. You gave us some June quarter sales guidance, but not earnings guidance. Where
in your cost structure is the most uncertainty that you can't flow that through? Is it in labor costs or the
stores cost or raw materials? But what are you most uncertain about there in your cost structure?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

John, we've given sales guidance only through '18 and '19. I saw no reason to start giving EPS quarterly
guidance now. I don't think there's uncertainty around our cost structure. I think the plans and the actions
we've taken to reduce our cost, reduce our discretionary spending, hold open items, all are going to
impact the second quarter, but we're not managing the company for the second quarter. We're managing
it for the long term. And we're really looking at the recovery coming out of the third and the fourth quarter
and really driving momentum into 2021. That's what we're looking at.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then the comment earlier on the raw material basket being down low single-digit percent. I assume
that's a price index for the raw materials. Do you have significant inventory of raw materials to work down
that your dollar purchases of raws will be down more than that low single percent?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

John, really, the vast majority of our dollars are in bulk tanks at our factories. We're not buying ahead
of any material nature. We're staying close to our suppliers and making sure they're able to service us.
And in particular, I would say the team has done a very good job of managing this rapidly increasing
unprecedented DIY demand. I think they're re-retrofitting plants. They're moving products around to build
capacity. And our suppliers have done a terrific job making sure we have the raw materials needed to keep
up with that demand. And I think our procurement teams and our global supply chain team need to get a
lot of credit for that, but no reason that we would be buying ahead on raw material.

Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to be clear just on the 2Q Consumer Brands guidance. Does that include the Ace exit and I
guess, softer Asian fundamentals? Because if it does, it does seem that the retail piece is running mid-
teens, if not better, if I'm not mistaken.

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. It does include both of those. Just one comment on the Ace business that we exited. Because we're
getting towards the end of that agreement, I mean, we are shipping Ace the final, I would say, inventories
of the private label in this quarter. It will be all done. So I would say that from a quarterly standpoint, the
second quarter is probably the least impacted. And then third quarter, we'll get it back a little heavier and
then fourth quarter will moderate a little bit just because it's a small quarter. And it does include Asia as
well.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Great. I just wanted to also follow-up just on a comment earlier around exterior here in the Americas
gaining momentum. Just wanted to see, is this just seasonal or are you seeing an increase in contractor
backlogs as kind of driving some of that momentum that you identified earlier?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

I think it's a number of drivers. I think certainly seasonal when you look at sequential improvement.
There's a piece of that. I'd say that our teams are doing a very nice job of really focusing on this business
through contractor relationships and as well through product technology. In fact, you may recall last
quarter I talked about a product, this FlexTemp. We're having really good feedback and interest from
residential customers as well as new residential. This is a product that can be applied down to 35 degrees
or up to 120 degrees without sacrificing performance or application. And so it's that type of innovation
along with the service and the relationships that we're building in our stores that has us believing that
we're going to grow here and outpace the market.

Operator

We'll move on to our next question, which comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research.

David Leonard Bellinger
Wolfe Research, LLC

Hope everyone's staying safe. So comparable sales, again, very strong here. Can you talk about what you
were seeing early in the quarter from an underlying demand perspective? Seems overall housing metrics
were improving at a pretty good pace. And regarding early trends into Q2, how long do you think the DIY
performance, the outperformance there, can hold up? Is there some potential pull forward in demand out
of the back half of the year?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

I'll take a first run at this and let Al jump in. When you asked about our run early, I would say life was
really, really good. We thought this was the year. And we still, again, feel the fundamentals are there, but
we were smoking. And then, Al, you can come back if you want to add anything on that.

DIY, I'd say that it's hard to say if you're pulling forward. There might be some of that. We'll have to see
how it unfolds. When you think about the professionals that are going in and doing homes, oftentimes,
what you'll find is DIY customers more willing to take on projects like a small room, bedroom, living room,
whatever, not typically 2-story foyers. Oftentimes exterior is off limits just because of the scope of the
work there with scaffolding and the work that goes there. And you want to try to complete a project.
Those projects typically take a longer time. So DIY consumers are typically more focused on smaller,
more manageable projects. And what you see is a lot of activity right now. And quite frankly, we like it.
We think that the idea that, not just the short-term benefits of having customers purchasing product, but
the idea that customers are enjoying the benefits of a repaint, we think, is a positive longer term. These
customers can get an idea of the impact that a relatively low-cost investment can have on their home. And
certainly, their mental well-being in a time like this when a lot of people have a lot of anxiety and stress,
it's relatively inexpensive. Some of them, they'll tackle themselves. And if some of them down the road

say, you know what, I got to go back to work, but this room would look well, look nice painted as well,
then that might carry over as well. But we'll have to see if it's a pull forward or there'll be more of this,
some of that or not.

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. I think it will slow as people get back to work. And if unemployment ticks up, we don't expect to see
a continued surge in DIY. And we're also monitoring on the res repaint side. We believe, and again, we'll
see how this plays out. But by and large, the people that want to do a DIY project aren't going to hire a
contractor. The people that tend to hire contract, painting contractors to do the work are going to continue
to hire painting contractors. We're not expecting a big hit in our res repaint due to the surge in DIY. And
certainly on exterior, as we talked before, typically, those are going to be done by painting contractors.

David Leonard Bellinger
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. That's all very, very helpful. And if you could tie your comments there. I think there was the pricing
increases planned throughout the year. Has there been any data to suggest customer pushback on higher
pricing in this environment? And how is that shaping your thinking towards further pricing opportunities
from here?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

It's not impacted as we can see right now the choice of products. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we are
experiencing a positive mix shift in quality. And just like we have in the past, we get together monthly as a
management team, review our total cost basket and we make decisions on a monthly basis. When we do
that, we talk to our employees, our customers and then we share with the financial community.

Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G Research.

Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli
Morgan Group Holding Co.

One area we didn't talk about really is Latin America. Could you give us a feel for what is happening there
in terms of the demand, the shutdown, if any, or the lack of shutdown actually, which may create more
issue going forward?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Sure, Rosemarie. I'd say, Chile is likely maybe best described as the closest to having normal operations.
I'd say Argentina and Ecuador, for the most part, are closed for [ most in 10 ]. In Mexico, about 60% of
our stores are operating normally and roughly the balance are running on curbside or we got a small,
very small percentage closed, but for the most part, it's split between the normal and curbside. And then
Brazil, I'd say roughly about 34 of our stores are closed, and the remaining open about, which is about
53%. Those 53% represent over 70% of our gallons. So that's through our own stores there. If you look
at our business to our dealers, about half of our dealers are closed and about 60% of the home centers
are closed but offering delivery only. So a little bit of a mix in Brazil.

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

And Rosemarie, I would just add. In the first quarter, if you look at the impact of FX on our Latin America
team, it was in the mid-teens. Embedded in our Q2 guidance is that'll accelerate because we've continued
to see the devaluation in the reais, the Argentinian peso, the Mexico peso. So that's going to be an
additional drag on those businesses in the second quarter.

Morgan Group Holding Co.

So in the past, you used to give us the number of stores in Latin America and in North America. You have
now put them both together. Are you still closing down stores in that region?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Last quarter, we did close 8 in Latin America. And I think this goes back, Rosemarie, to the point that
I made earlier about our ongoing -- I call it a pretty rigorous review of businesses, brands, customer
programs, other investments. And we've closed 8. And those were in areas that were persistently soft
markets. We've got a terrific leadership team down here as well. And David and that team are working
closely together to evaluate every one of these operations. They're going to stand on their own or we
make tough decisions. And we've made some tough decisions. And we'll continue to look at that business.
We want to continue to grow that business. There are some dynamics in that market that make it a little
more challenging, but we've got a lot of upside potential we should be gaining as well.

Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli
Morgan Group Holding Co.

And then lastly, if I may. Can you talk a little bit about any changes in the competitive environment?
Everyone is trying to gain share. Everyone is trying to offset the impact of the pandemic. Can you give us
a feel for what is going on in the marketplace?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Are you talking about just holistic, in general?

Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli
Morgan Group Holding Co.

Yes, in general, but if you can look at the different areas you are doing business in.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It'd be hard to do that for every part of the company in every region. Maybe I could make this
statement that we have a lot of respect for our competitors. We have very good global competitors and
we've got a lot of really good regional competitors. Everyone's business is different. These are really
challenging times. We're going to do what's right strategically for us and our customers through our
strategic vision and model that works for us. And other companies may be taking a different path, but we
have a lot of respect for them and it keeps us motivated and driven. It's a healthy paranoia, if you will,
because good competition makes you better. We've got a lot of really good competitors.

stores.

Allen J. Mistysyn

Yes, Greg. As you know, we kind of have been chasing the price and raw material through '18 and '19. So
we did go out with selective price increases in the first, early in 2020. We talked about the small number

25

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

of contracts we have on indexing. But I think the dynamics within our Performance Coatings Group are
similar to the dynamics that we talk about in our architectural. And that is, we continue to invest in
innovation that helps our customers be more effective, more efficient, drive faster line speeds on their
manufacturing lines to drive their total cost of application down. And it's really what we're looking at to
move off of just price kind of cost metrics. And I think that's important to continue to focus on. And we'll
continue to do that and continue to expand our services to our customers to drive growth for the both of
us.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Help them make more money, help them achieve their goals, help solve their problems, everything
we can do.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's great. And then second, on the stores business, what percentage of the orders are you now taking
via e-commerce, whether it be the app or website as opposed to just, I guess, a phone or a walk-in order?
And are there any products that your customers, especially new accounts, are asking that you add to the
assortment in this environment where you can really leverage the stores network?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Regarding the online, I would say this, Greg, it's growing. It's a high percentage growth, but it's relatively
low overall. So while we're excited with the percentage, it's off of a relatively low base as we're really now
getting behind this. We expect that to continue and we're going to come out of this better as a result of
it. As far as products that our customers are asking for, yes, there are some, and we're looking into them.
We'd like for you to find them on our shelf before we talk about them.

Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Are the social distancing practices of Sherwin-Williams uniform across its store network or are they
different in different states? And how do you expect them to evolve from now to the end of the year? Will
the state set your guidelines or will you set them?

David B. Sewell
President & COO

This is David. Thanks for the question. We have some standard protocols that we follow for social
distancing. As our stores come back, the team has done a phenomenal job. There'll be details on floors.
We'll be guiding walkways. So it's a little different dynamic than, say, at our manufacturing plant, where
Joel Baxter and his team have done a great job ensuring strong social distancing practices. We follow CDC
guidelines at a minimum. We have some health care professionals that we consult with as well. So we take
that very seriously and we try to go above and beyond everywhere we can.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. When you think about the next year or 2 in terms of the value of paint, we're going to go through
a period where raw materials are going to come down quite a lot, the consumer is going to be distressed,
the contractor market is going to be much looser. Now Sherwin really likes to price for value as do many
coatings companies. Do you think we're going to go through more of a deflationary period in terms of
product pricing in paint with raw materials coming down and the margins being good or do you think

THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2020

we're going to have more of a continuation of the pattern before the recession, where there would be
intermittent general price increases as a base case?

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Jeff, I think an important element to keep in mind is the cost structure of a contractor. When you
mentioned the Sherwin stores, 90% of the cost of goods for a painting contractor is labor. And so our
focus is on driving the efficiency and productivity and profitability of that customer through innovative
products and services. And we'll continue to invest in areas that will help them to do that. And we believe,
in turn, our position with that customer improves and improves from a loyalty, usage and acceptance
standpoint. And so not our intent, we know we have to be competitive in the marketplace. That's the price
of entry, if you will, into the market. We'll continue to ensure that we're competitive, but we'll also be
making those investments, we think, that will help justify the price that we're charging our customers.

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. And Jeff, I think that's a very important point. By continuing to invest in that innovation and making
the painting contractor more effective where they can get more jobs done with same number of people
makes it, the paint, such a small portion of their cost. But I would point to '10, '11 and '12, when we saw
the big run-up in costs, raw material costs, and they rolled over, and we, by and large, held our price
'13 through '16, and we saw a nice improvement in our gross margin. But you can only do that if you're
continuing to invest in products and services that are going to continue to help the painting contractors
make more money.

John G. Morikis
Chairman & CEO

Yes. You can't offer commodity products and services and ask for specialty store margins or pricing.

Our next question is from Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence.

Christopher Silvio Perrella
Bloomberg Intelligence

Quick question on inventory levels. With the rapid drop in demand and naturally you guys building into the
spring for robust business, I think Al touched on this a little bit, where are your raw materials standing?
And what, to the best of your estimate, is the working capital impact in second quarter?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

Yes. So Chris, we, I think, did a very good job of managing our inventory. And I would just say that
the raw material inventory is a much smaller part of our overall inventory. But we did a much better
job, a very good job of managing inventory down where we saw weakness in demand, and that helped
contribute to the $151 million improvement we saw in working capital in our first quarter. And we do
and did build architectural inventory to what we had planned coming into the season. As we're seeing a
little bit softer or we're seeing softer sales in our TAG group, we're still seeing, like we've talked about,
that unprecedented increase in the DIY through the home center channel. So you've seen a switch, and I
talked about it earlier about our global supply chain, I mean, we're building and producing every gallon we
can and we're continuing to look and work with our customers on getting the right products made, getting
the right product and inventory into the store shelf, both in our stores and with our retail partners. So it
definitely varies.

Packaging, we're building inventory as much as we can across all the regions because we continue to see
strong demand. But I can assure you, we'll continue to manage our inventories lower. And we've done
a lot of different things. We have more communication between the selling organization and our supply

chain. We've cut batch sizes. We've cut safety stock. We've gone to more of a make-and-ship model in
some cases versus make to stock. So there are a lot of levers that we've pulled and we'll continue to pull
as the demand environment unfolds.

Christopher Silvio Perrella
Bloomberg Intelligence

All right. And one quick one. With the sales guidance for 2Q, is there any implied channel drawdown in
your Performance business or is that all basically straight volume out of your factory to the customer?

Allen J. Mistysyn
Senior VP of Finance & CFO

It's all volume out of the factory. But again, I think in those markets, in particular, the team has done a
nice job driving inventory down so that it's just more out of the factories.
