EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to Exelon's third quarter earnings Call. My name is Gigi, and I'll be your event
specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. [Operator
Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of
Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.

Daniel L. Eggers
Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance

Thank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings
conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer;
and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior
management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.

We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found
in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we
discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various
risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors
and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call.

Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and other factors,
including uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that may cause results to differ
from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.

Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP
measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings
release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.

I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. And as you can see from our release, we've had strong earnings and
operational performance, while continuing to focus on the health and safety of our employees and the
communities. Our GAAP basis earned $0.51 per share and non-GAAP basis earned $1.04 per share.

We did outperform our guidance that we had originally given at $0.80 to $0.90 per share due to some
favorable weather and more cost savings coming through sooner than we anticipated Joe is going to
get into the detail [Technical Difficulty] that I want to highlight. In August, we had a tropical storm that
battered the East Coast with rain and strong winds, significant impacts to ACE, Delmarva and PECO. It was
PECO's 10th largest storm on record following the 8th largest storm in June.

Then a hurricane-like derecho tore through the ComEd service territory, spawning 13 tornadoes. Between
the 2 storms, we had more than 1.5 customers lost power. We had more than 500 employees and
contractors that were helping their sister utilities moving back and forth between the East and the West to
try to respond to the needs of the customers.

And despite the intensity, we were able to restore the power to our customers in record time due to
the power of our Exelon Utilities platform. Our employees' quick response and collaboration made the
difference for our customers. So we really want to thank our employees for their great work restoring
service to customers during, not just the pandemic, but a very active storm season as we've seen.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

As I mentioned on the last call, Exelon is committed to our values of diversity, equality and inclusion. Part
of this commitment calls on our businesses and our partners to recognize these values and include women
and people of color in key roles on our accounts.

For 10 years, we've recognized partners who have excelled in this area. This year, we've included 30
companies in banking, insurance, legal, investment, professional and IT services to our 2020 diversity and
inclusion honor roll.

We also are committed to delivering clean energy in a clean-energy future. Exelon Foundation and Exelon
selected 10 start-ups as part of the first round of $20 million in climate change investment initiatives.
Beyond the financial support, Exelon will mentor the start-ups on accessing capital, structuring the
business, capital allocation and meeting the regulatory requirements.

Through this program, the Foundation will invest early in stage start-ups, working on climate change,
mitigating, adapting and resilience in our service territory. 50% are minority or women owned, 60% of the
projects focus on greenhouse gas mitigation and the others are on resiliency and adapting to the changing
climate environment that we're living in.

These investments will bring us a step closer to a clean-energy future by helping entrepreneurs translate
their ideas for reversing climate change into practical solutions. Finally, we made the difficult decision to
retire some uneconomic generation stations. Mystic generation, gas-fired station in Boston will retire in
2024 when the cost service agreement expires.

And very disappointingly, we announced our Dresden -- Byron and Dresden nuclear stations will retire in
2021. These plants produce 30% of the carbon-free electricity in Illinois. They provide over 1,500 good-
paying full-time jobs, and they support 2,000 supplemental workers during refueling outages, most from
local union halls, paying $63 million in taxes annually to support local schools, fire departments and other
services in their community.

Despite being among the most efficient, reliable units in the U.S. nuclear fleet, they face revenue
shortfalls, declining energy prices, lack of capacity revenue and market rules that allow fossil plants to
underbid clean energy resources in the PJM market auction.

Given these losses, we have made a tough decision to shut these units down and give our employees and
the host communities time to manage through the personal and economic challenges ahead.

Without these plants and others at risk, customers will pay $483 million in increased annual energy cost
under the PJM auction structure that is about to incur. The electric sector emissions will increase by 70%
and instead of growing 0-carbon energy in Illinois to reach the state's goal of clean energy will fail -- fall
decades behind.

We continue to work with interested parties on the best way to achieve these state goals, but urgent
action is needed. We have to protect our consumers from higher bills, our state from dirtier air and our
communities from the loss of these irreplaceable power plants and the jobs that they create.

Turning to operations, even with the pandemic conditions, extreme storms and record heat across our
territories, all our utilities have achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and
frequency.

Customer service remains at top quartile across all utilities with BGE, ComEd and PECO delivering service
in top decile.

Power dispatch match of 98.9% in renewable energy capture at 91.9%. The Constellation has also had
a very strong quarter of execution, and as a result was able to increase the new business targets for the
year that we talked about at trouble in the first quarter.

The nuclear performance was excellent. The plants ran at 96% for the quarter. They led the nation in 0-
carbon electricity production, producing almost 38 terawatt hours of emission-free generation. Like all of
our plants, Dresden and Byron ran at nearly full power through the hottest summer on record.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Employees at Dresden and Byron are entirely focused on ensuring the reliability and safety of these plants
through their retirement dates. The plants' forced retirement is simply hard to deal with, and it's a shame.

I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly
financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2020 guidance.

Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.51 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.04 per share on a non-GAAP basis,
which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share.

A key driver in our quarterly EPS performance for both the second and third quarters has been success in
managing costs. As you may recall, on our first quarter call, we announced $250 million of savings across
the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID. At that time, we expected our offices would reopen
in late summer. Since then, we have pushed phase 1 of our reopening for remote-enabled workers until
January of next year at the earliest.

This change in expectations, along with the hard work of the organization, led to higher savings than
originally anticipated.

For the quarter, Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.57 per share net of holding company expenses.
Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven primarily by favorable O&M and
taxes, earlier recognition of bad debt regulatory assets and favorable summer weather in our non-
decoupled jurisdictions.

This was partially offset by costs related to tropical storm Isis, which hit the East Coast in August.

ExGen outperformed expectations for the third quarter, earning $0.47 per share. The upside was largely
driven by lower O&M, where targeted savings exceeded our original expectations and were achieved
sooner than planned. Additionally, favorable weather and lower cost to serve benefited our gross margin.

On Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $1.04 per share in the third quarter of
this year was $0.12 per share higher than the third quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings
were up $0.01 per share compared to last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher
distribution and transmission rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of
2019 as well as favorable weather at PECO.

This was partially offset by storm costs at PHI and PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.11 per share
compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and higher capacity revenues.

Turning to Slide 9. We are raising our 2020 EPS guidance range to $3 to $3.20 per share from $2.80 to
$3.10 per share and are now comfortably within our original 2020 guidance range of $3 to $3.30 per
share. When we revised guidance on the first quarter call, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the
severity and the length of the impacts of COVID on our business.

Our updated guidance considers the strong ExGen performance to date, our successful cost management
as well as the favorable weather we saw in the third quarter. We are delivering on our financial
commitments, and we are confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end.

Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we have dipped slightly below
our consolidated 9% to 10% target range with an 8.9% trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter.
The 20 basis point decline from last quarter was primarily due to equity infusions at BGE and ComEd to
support capital investments.

This calculation is backward-looking, so you should continue to see some pressure on ROEs over the next
couple of quarters. This is simply due to the roll-off of better pre-COVID-19 quarters, the burden of poor
first quarter weather, summer storms and the continued impact of lower treasuries on ComEd.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities and
supporting our growth targets.

Turning to Slide 11. Since the last call, we had 2 major developments on the regulatory front. Pepco filed
its first multiyear plan in Maryland, and PECO filed its first guest distribution case in 10 years. Pepco was
the second utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan with BGE filing the first plan in May.

The filing will support capital investments in the electric distribution system made during 2019 and '20
and planned investments through March of 2024. Pepco's planned investments will continue to improve
reliability and customer service, advanced technologies and investments to modernize the distribution
system, support state environmental goals and provide tools to assist customers in managing their energy
use.

The filing considers the current health emergency and economic challenges in Maryland, while allowing for
timely recovery of our investments that benefit our customers.

A few highlights from the filing include flat distribution rates for the first 2 years of the plan, partially
offset in year 3. Residential electric bills are projected to be lower in 2024 than they were in 2011.
Recovery of electric vehicle program cost and COVID-19 costs and inclusion of tracking performance
incentive mechanisms focused on system reliability, customer service and the environment. We expect an
order in May of 2021.

On September 30, PECO filed a gas distribution case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.
PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $69 million for continued investments in its gas distribution system
to maintain and increase safety, reliability and customer service. We expect an order in June of '21.

We also have several rate cases still in progress, 2 of which expect orders on -- 2 of which we expect
orders on this year. In October, evidentiary hearings were conducted as part of BGE's pending multiyear
rate case. As a reminder, the filing supports planned capital investments from 2020 to '23 as well as
investments made in late 2019 to maintain and increased reliability and benefit customer service for our
electric and gas distribution systems. We expect an order in December.

Additionally, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year.
On October 14, draft proposed orders were filed by ComEd, the ICC staff and intervenors as part of the
case. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in
10 years.

Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd's investments in grid modernization and enabling clean
energy growth have improved reliability by 70% while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade
ago. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 27 of the appendix.

Turning to Slide 12. The Utilities continue to deploy capital largely as planned for the year, investing $1.6
billion during the third quarter and year-to-date, we have spent $4.5 billion of capital at our utilities,
improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our customers.

Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, our capital plan is on track for the year. Today, I will
talk about 2 projects that advance Exelon utility strategy. A key element of that strategy is involving our
capabilities to anticipate and meet changing customer needs and expectations of the system.

The first project is Pepco's streetlight modernization project in Maryland. This project includes conversion
of approximately 66,000 existing streetlights to smart LEDs and integration with a central management
system. The new streetlights will send automatic notifications to the central management system,
improving outage response time, maintenance efficiency and customer billing accuracy.

Additionally, LEDs improve light quality and benefit public safety and security. This project is included in
the Pepco Maryland multiyear plan filing I discussed earlier.

The second project is the Exelon Utilities' customer information system upgrade, which was completed
on time even though it was done almost fully remotely. This is a $130 million project to upgrade BGE's
customer care and billing system and implement Oracle's customer experience service cloud at BGE,

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

ComEd and PECO. This new system will provide operational efficiencies as well as improve customer
satisfaction.

It's simply one piece of an ongoing project across the utilities to transform the customer information
system. These improvements will support a platform to enable future customer benefits. Improvements
will include a more personalized customer experience allowing for more efficient issue resolution and a
streamlined and simplified implementation of billing for new customer offerings, such as community solar
where energy is produced at different locations than the customers' residents.

Additionally, it will allow for faster implementation of new rate structures, bringing pricing for new services
such as EV charging and storage pricing to market faster.

Transitioning to Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging position at ExGen. Our
disclosures now reflect the impacts of the planned retirements of the Byron and Dresden nuclear plants in
September and November of 2021, respectively.

For 2020, total gross margin is up $50 million. Open gross margin decreased $100 million, primarily due
to lower spark spreads in ERCOT, partially offset by higher prices at NiHub and West Hub.

Our mark-to-market of hedges were up $250 million due to our hedge position, which offset the decrease
in open gross margin including the execution of $150 million of Power New Business. We also executed
$50 million in non-Power New Business during the quarter.

Based on the higher load volumes associated with favorable third quarter weather and lower cost to serve
across the portfolio, we are raising our 2020 new business targets by $50 million. For 2021, total gross
margin is down $150 million driven by the retirements of Byron and Dresden nuclear plants, which is
flowing through the open gross margin line. However, open gross margin is flat due to higher prices at
West Hub, NiHub and New York Zone A.

Mark-to-market of hedges was down $100 million due to our hedge position being down $150 million,
offset by the execution of $50 million of Power New Business inside the quarter.

As a reminder, the Byron and Dresden retirements are expected to be earnings and cash flow accretive.
However, they are essentially flat in 2021 due to the timing of the retirements. The $150 million decrease
in gross margin is offset by lower O&M, TOTI and depreciation and amortization totaling $150 million.
Additionally, we remained slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 by 2% to 5% when
considering cross-commodity hedges.

Our hedge percentages reflect the removal of Byron and Dresden in the fall of 2021.

Moving on to Slide 14. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last
quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2020, we expect it to
be at 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x when excluding nonrecourse debt.

On the ratings front, Moody affirmed its existing ratings for Exelon Corporation and ComEd in the third
quarter. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings.

Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Joe. Finally, turning to Slide 15. I want to close as we do each one of these calls, with our value
proposition. We are focused on growing our utilities, and now we're targeting a 7.3% rate base growth
with a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We will use the free cash flow from the Genco to support the
utility growth, pay down Genco debt and support the external dividend.

We continue to optimize the value of Exelon Generation business by seeking fair compensation for our
0-emitting generation. And I have to say that many editorials and others call what we're asking for

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

as a bailout. It's not a bailout. We're the -- the nuclear fleet is only 0-emitting fleet that does not get
compensation towards value. So this is not a bailout. It's leveling the playing field.

It comes across nice and political venues or editorial venues, but the last thing it is, is a bailout, it's
leveling the competitive field. We'll continue closing uneconomic plants, like we announced the retirement
of Dresden, Byron and Mystic, monetizing these assets and maximizing the value through Constellation,
retail and wholesale. We'll continue to sustain investment-grade credit metrics and maintain a strong
balance sheet while -- and have grown our dividend annually at 5% through 2020.

Before turning to Q&A, I want to comment on some recent news reports that Exelon is considering
separating the Exelon Generation from the Utilities. As discussed recently on our last earnings call, we
regularly evaluate whether our corporate structure best serves the interest of our communities, customers
and our employees and also our investors. We would consider modifying that structure when we can
create value and recognize those interests. The natural -- the nature of our business and the landscape
that it's in has been evolving over the years. In addition, you've seen a number of competitive integrated
companies in our sector that have shrunk considerably.

Given those circumstances, a review of our corporate structure is underway, started earlier this year, and
we have the help of outside advisers. As we continue this review, we focus on creating value, taking into
account, as I've mentioned, all of our stakeholders: the investors, the employees, the customers and
the communities we serve. So I want to emphasize that the separation of the companies would involve
addressing some complex operational, financial and regulatory issues.
No decision has been made, but we continue to do the work to determine the best outcome for our
stakeholders, and we'll provide you an update on our progress on the next earnings call. So with that,
operator, we can now open it up to questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to first talk about the strategic review. And I respect that you're at, I guess, a fairly early
stage of thinking through your options. But I was just trying to think about the strategy here, and I guess
maybe I wanted to start with what sort of attributes or sort of risk profile would you want to achieve for
your merchant fleet for ExGen to be consistent with your strategy versus sort of what risk profile would be
not consistent with your strategy?

I know overall, you're trying to derisk the business and provide greater stability. How do you, at a high
level, think about that?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would wouldn't say we're at the early stages. I would say that we are in an in-depth review of the
evaluation. And some of the things we look at are the cost of capital, things like that, the degradation of
the Constellation business with collateral costs. There's many aspects to it that are under review right
now.

But what we want to make sure is that we have 2 healthy companies, a utility business -- if we and the
Board determine this is the right thing to do, 2 healthy businesses that can stand on their own and provide
the support needed for the balance sheets, the customers, the employees, the shareholders as we go
forward. So a lot to be taken in there. But I don't think we have pinpointed a risk profile yet that -- well, I
can say we haven't pinpointed a risk profile yet that I've agreed with and the Board has agreed with.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. Is it fair to say it is an objective to try to reduce the volatility and also just to improve the
viability, I guess, of that business going forward, right? That seems clear that, that's part of the strategy
here?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a free cash flow machine. And how do we optimize that to be the best that it can and produce the
most on valuation side and shareholder return side. So that's kind of the focus.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, that makes sense. And maybe just one last one for me. More on the tactical side, thinking about your
nuclear plants. You've obviously made some shutdown decisions already. But I guess we calculate that
some of your remaining nuclear plants are currently or will be negative cash flow. Would you agree with
that assessment?

And I guess, over what time frame are you thinking about making decisions for some of the plants that
look like they're negative cash flow?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

You've looked at our disclosures. We've outlined the plants that are sliding into that space. A lot depends
on what we do with the capacity market or the FRR and how we treat the plants is comparable with other
0 carbon-emitting plants, which they're not being treated equally right now.

So the time frame, we have to watch the auction, we have to watch the legislation. If we don't get a
capacity redesign and the auctions run, you could anticipate there would be some issues coming up in the
future.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Can you hear me okay?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I can hear you fine.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. So I guess, first, arguably, for the last year or so, you've been getting little value, if even maybe
negative value for ExGen in the Exelon stock price. So the value case seems obvious, but obviously,
there's probably risks and obstacles to just get through. Could you maybe just talk to what some of those
are in making this decision?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean you can imagine, this is a complex combination of a competitive integrated. And I wouldn't
get on the path of laying out each one of those, but I will tell you that when you start to look at the
corporate center, splitting out the IP, splitting out the financials, splitting out the corporate organization,
has a lot of design that we have to make sure we're not creating these in-synergies (sic) [ dissynergies ],
and we do that properly.

There's other considerations that we have to make for the employees, for the regulatory bodies to do that
and it's not an easy one. Many of the competitive integrateds that have switched and split have not had
the complex level of the integration or the size of the scale that we have.

If you look at our -- we have the most premier retail and wholesale trading organization, nobody that has
split had anything like that. So there's value being created, but there's expense there too. So we have
to watch how we do it, make sure we do it properly. There's a lot to be said about what we do for the
consumer and the 0-carbon market. You haven't seen anybody that has a 0-carbon fleet like ours split-off.
You've seen coal plants, you've seen gas plants, you've seen gas infrastructure split-off.

We have to make sure that when or if we do it, that we have the right compensation for the assets that
are being spun-off. And that's not something that's been recognized by the regulators or the legislators
or the administrations thus far. They recognize when they recognize solar, but they have not recognized
nuclear.

And if you look at just the state of Illinois right now, 60% of the generation is carbon-free. 90% of it's
nuclear. Nuclear is the only one that's not compensated for its low carbon or 0 carbon elements. So there's
a lot of different avenues we have to go down to, to get this right.

But as I said in the last call, the market's changing, and we have to figure out how we change with it.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. Just based on the comments you just made, Chris, is it fair to say that you need to get some type
of decision on Illinois law, either supporting nukes or not before making this kind of business structure
decision?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

I'll let Bill jump in here, but I would not say that, that is going to be a gating function. Bill, I don't know if
you want to add anything to that?

William A. Von Hoene
Senior EVP & Chief Strategy Officer

Yes. No, Chris, I agree with what you said. But Steve, you have identified a big point of sensitivity here.
As Chris alluded to, we have to take into account, in considering whether to do this or not, a variety of
stakeholders, including the communities we serve, our customers, employees and the like. So all of that
goes into the equation of not only the substance of this, but the timing of this.

There's lots of ground to plow before we get to the exact decision on -- before we decide whether we're
doing it or not. Number one, the Board has not decided that. And number two, if so, what the timing
would be.

And obviously, the FRR is relevant to that, but it's hard to -- I wouldn't put it as a gating function. It's a
function that's relevant to our consideration of what's the optimal timing if we decide to do this.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

The only thing I would add to that is, if the plants are not profitable, they don't cover their cash needs
or their earning requirements, we shut them down and -- with or without FRR. So -- and it's a business
decision. Some people have called it a threat. It's not a threat. It's just a reality.

When businesses don't make money on assets, they shut them down. And so we have to look at the
timing of all these decisions and make sure we're doing the right thing. But the legislation is important for
the value, but we have to make decisions based off of current economic conditions.

Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just 2 real quick questions. One is, I know you previously stated you conduct reviews on a regular basis.
But in your prior evaluation of the corporate structure, has this process included the retention of outside
advisers to help you kind of work through the process? Or is this kind of the next level of review this time
around?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

No. I think we were very public. In 2017, we used outside advisers, and we did a very, very thorough
evaluation. And we looked at the free cash flow coming off of Genco. And at that point, it was accretive
to be able to reduce debt, be able to put equity into the Utilities and also support a reasonable dividend
policy. So we've kept close advisers as we've looked through this in the past, not only on business
structure but assets also.

It's nothing that's been insular to the company. It's always been with advice from outside.

BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And just 1 last question, I guess, in just thinking, I guess, about cost
allocation, as you undergo the review of the potential separation. Is there any initial guidance, I guess,
you could give us on how you're thinking about the magnitude of shared services overall across the
company and how potentially that falls into the regulated and ExGen buckets? And thoughts on how you
sort of mitigate that as if you were to move forward, I guess?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

I -- it's too early to go there. I will tell you that we have to be very sensitive to what falls back on the
Utilities and what the Genco can manage. And so some of the cost savings that you've seen in this
quarterly update is us accelerating that type of focus.

Not going too far, but the Genco's done a lot. The business services organization is accelerating some stuff
on technology and contracts and other things that would mitigate those costs when split. One thing about
competitive integrated, you get to use the Massachusetts-modified model to spread the costs around.
That's a revenue generated formula.

We know if or when we do a split that, that goes away. And so we have to figure out how do we keep the
financials, right, keep the employee benefits programs in all the databases. I mean you can go through
that list of all the complex things that we have to do. But we do understand that the regulators are not
going to want to see an increase in costs because we split the company.

And the owners of the Genco are going to want to make sure their -- the shareholders of the Genco are
going to want to make sure that we're the most efficient. So we're working through that now, but we don't
have a number yet.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. I appreciate that. And just on Slide 36, you talked about -- roughly about $200 million of the $250
million on the cost savings sort of this year or coming at the ExGen level. Should we think about that as
being a decent run rate going forward? Or how much of that do you think you can retain as we move into
'21 and '22?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

I'll let Joe jump in on that. There's travel, there are some other smaller things that we're not doing right
now. But Joe, you want to take that?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. Thank you, Chris. The -- this year, we had a goal of $250 million of O&M -- or of cost savings
across the enterprise. And we're going to overachieve that by about $100 million to $125 million is our
expectation. We're working through that right now. To your question about how much of that is repeatable
in the future, we're in the throes of analyzing that.

To Chris' point, we've learned a lot here in the last almost 8 months, where we've been working remotely.
We've had savings on travel and entertainment. We've had consulting dollar savings, training savings.
We've looked at almost everything. And I think there will be things that fall to the bottom line, and we're
going through that now. We would expect to provide you an update on that on our fourth quarter call, but
there will be things that bleed through. We're just not ready to commit to how much of that is run rate in
the future.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just want to speak more on the strategic review. And could you speak more to the financial
considerations here? And namely, would ExGen require a bunch of equity to separate from the business,
if that's something you could share any details there? And how should we think about the funding needs,
growth prospects at Exelon's Utilities under an independent scenario without the support from ExGen cash
flows?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Well, there's still a lot of work going on right now. I don't think we have an anticipation of that. We're still
trying to figure out what level of the ratings that we keep. But Dan, do you want to take it?

Daniel L. Eggers
Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance

Yes. Thanks, Chris. I mean, Jeremy, I think it's a good question. Right now, I think it's probably a little
early to start making calls around balance sheet and capital allocation decisions. You could imagine
amongst all the factors we're considering with this review, looking at the credit metrics, working with the
agencies, thinking through that is going to be an aspect.

Thinking about how ExGen would use the free cash flow that's been funding the Utilities to be part of it,
thinking about how the Utilities can fund their growth, both with their internally generated and retained
cash flows, but also other sources of funding will all go into the decision.

But those are -- a number of factors will go into our analysis over the coming months.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's very helpful. And just wondering if you're in a position to share any feedback that you've received
in Illinois with response to the retirement announcements that you put out recently?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

No. There's some disappointment, as you can imagine, from the communities. There's disappointment
from employees. And these are not the first nuclear plants we've had to shut down. Some will say that
we'll -- we make enough money already, we should not shut them down, but that's just not the way
businesses work. And so you have to work through the reaction.

And the 2 major constituents that are going to feel the pain here with us shutting these units down,
because we're losing so much money, are the employees and the communities. If you look at the taxes
and what we provide in the community as far as employment in commerce and -- it's not easy. And so you
can imagine those communities are trying to figure out what they can do to support us staying -- keeping
those plants open.

But haven't heard a lot from the legislative side. And I'll let Kathleen and Bill jump in on that side.

Kathleen L. Barron
Senior Vice President of Governmental & Regulatory Affairs & Public Policy

Yes. Chris, I can jump in. I mean, as you know, the legislature is not in session. So there has been
continued work on potential clean energy legislation through the governor's working group and similar
efforts on both the Senate side and the House side. But until the legislature is back in session, we won't
have a sense of where that's going.

But I agree with you that the impact, both on the employees and the communities around the plants, as
well as the sort of broader communities in Illinois are watching this because to the extent these plants

shut down, what will happen is fossil plants will ramp up, and that will affect communities around the state
that are already struggling with air pollution and the effects of COVID. So a lot of folks are watching it for
sure.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Understood. And if I could just ask one last one here. How do you see proposed multiyear plans
impacting your return to 9% to 10% ROE target and the sustainability of maintaining that range?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll let Calvin answer that one. We've had a couple punches in the gut this year that brought us back
down with storms and some other things. But Calvin, you want to cover that?

Calvin G. Butler
Senior Executive VP & CEO of Exelon Utilities

Absolutely, Chris. What I would say is that our whole process and working with our regulators in our
jurisdictions around multiyear plans was geared to really create a foundation for long-term growth and
also giving transparency and accountability to our customers on how this was going.

So it is our commitment that we are going to remain in that 9% to 10%, but it's going to be done in a
way where it's transparent to our customers and we're able to invest in our system for just to continue to
operate a safe and reliable system. So that is the commitment, that is what we're discussing, and we are
on course to meet that obligation, as you've heard in Maryland and now in D.C. with both of our utilities in
Maryland and in D.C.

And we already have very constructive environments in our other jurisdictions. So we're moving forward
with that.

Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So if I can pick up where Jeremy left off a little bit, can you talk about the balance sheet, especially under
any prospects of a spin here? Just want to hear clearly from you all how you're thinking about it. The
rating agencies have talked these broadly about ExGen being an investment-grade entity. If I can ask you
this way, how committed are you to IG metrics under a spin? I know that you've kind of alluded to this
earlier in the call, but I just want to be extra clear about this.

And then subsequently, it seems as if in past periods, one of the calculations here has been the
implications to the retail business. Can you talk about that side of the equation under any strategic shift?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Joe and Jim, do you want to tag team that one?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. I think, Chris, the answer to Julien's question around how committed we are to investment grade,
we take our strong balance sheet and our strong investment-grade ratings that we have today, obviously,
very seriously. As you mentioned, we're still in the process of evaluating what the spin would look like and
all the ramifications of that. And that includes impacts to all the stakeholders you mentioned, the rating
agencies being one of those and how it would impact the rating of a Genco that stand alone. But at this

15

EXELON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

point, it's too early to commit to anything along those lines. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim to talk
about the retail business.

James McHugh
Executive VP & CEO of Costellation

Yes, sure. Thanks, gentlemen. And Julien, I guess, likewise, we're working through -- over the next period
of time over the next few months, we're going to work with the finance team to understand and how
we can continue to optimize our business. Our customer-serving business is really the large portion of
our overall earnings capability for -- that we bring to the Genco and cash flow capability that we bring to
the Genco. We're committed to that. We want to keep that going, and we'll work through the structures
and the product structures that we need to maintain and to continue to serve those customers and then
optimize the management in all the way through the spot market of managing the load and the generation
output.

So I think we'll make sure the impacts are such a way that we can maintain that focus all on the customer
and keep our products going and the growth that we see in that business.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And further kind of clarification, if it is. First, Chris, on carbon and the subject of how that might ultimately
translate back to your all's portfolio here. How do you think the election could impact that? Clearly
recognizing states' rights and a lot of these PPA programs ultimately end up -- for the state, right,
there's -- to implement one way or another. Given that context, how do you think about carbon today as
potentially implemented in Illinois eventually?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

So what we're trying to do is work at the state level. We have had little traction at the federal level, and
it's very polarizing as you know. It doesn't matter who gets elected, it's still going to be a polarizing
issue. So working it through the states and then through the markets because you've got the cross-state
leakages is where we've been focused. We'll have to see what happens tomorrow and what happens in the
House and the Senate, the legislative body where they want to go.

We hope they do it as a technology-neutral approach versus what some size of the house and the Senate
have gone at technologies versus outcomes. But we'll have to see. We're still going to fight at the state
level and the market level to make sure that we get the right valuation for our assets.

We are the largest noncarbon-producing entity with no remunerations for those assets. So -- but like
I said earlier, it's nice for editorial or an editor or a politician to say we're looking for a bailout. We're
looking to be able to compete with the other noncarbon that people have decided to provide a payment,
a valuation for that low carbon output. But when you look at the largest noncarbon-emitting source in the
country and the largest noncarbon-emitting company in the country and they're competing against other
resources that are getting compensated for the value of that, it is just frustrating.

And so -- but you'll pick up the paper tomorrow and somebody will write that Exelon is looking for a
bailout. We don't care about a bailout. We just want to compete. If we don't compete, we'll shut units
down.

Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore.

Durgesh Chopra

Maybe just one quick one on the quarter, and then I want to go back to the strategic review. Just on the
quarter, you showed this projected cash flow slide with the 2020 balance. The balance is significantly

lower, like $400 million lower versus the Q2 call and your guidance is up. So just wondering what drives
that.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. Chris, I can take that.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Take that Joe. Yes.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. So yes, there's a couple of things going on. Our free cash flow from our operations across the
enterprise were up for the quarter. But we did see -- because of that, number one, we had an assumption
of kind of less requirement for working capital needs. And then more importantly, we had some movement
in cash flow on other activity related to Exelon Generation, and there were just a number of small factors
that -- at normal-type quarter activity that moved the cash flow for the quarter, even though the earnings
were up pretty materially versus the range we'd given last quarter.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. Understood. And just really quickly, Chris, you mentioned FRR not a gating factor.
Maybe just to the extent that you can, could you procedurally talk about the next steps here? And if
there's a time line that internally you guys are working on to get this strategic review over?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I can tell you that although the FRR and the legislation is critical for the communities and the
employees, we have to make our business decisions. I think we're going through the review right now and
trying to evaluate the complications of the potential separation, but we wouldn't use that as the gating
factor.

So once we get through the very complicated review, we'd like to provide a whole lot more color on the
fourth quarter call. Not guaranteeing were done or saying we'd be done by then, but that will be the view
of where we think we're heading.

Dan, I don't know if you want to say anything else?

Daniel L. Eggers
Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance

No, Chris, I think you've covered it.
