Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Huntington
Ingalls Industries Earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's
conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the call over to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Blake, you
may now begin.

Dwayne B. Blake
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries First Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kastner,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer.

As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking
statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal Securities law. Actual results

results to vary materially from anticipated results.

Also in the remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of
these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings presentation
that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the call to
supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the Investor
Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I trust that everyone
is staying healthy and safe.

Now let me share some highlights from the quarter, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.3
billion for the quarter were slightly higher than 2020. Diluted EPS was $3.68 for the quarter and pension
adjusted EPS was $3.56, up from $2.43 in 2020.

New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $5.3 billion, resulting in a record backlog of
approximately $49 billion, of which approximately $25 billion is funded. Chris will provide some color on a
few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks.

Shifting to activities in Washington. We were pleased that the recently released summary of the fiscal
year 2022 President's budget request affirm that maintaining U.S. naval power is critical to reassuring
allies and signaling U.S. resolved to potential adversaries. Of note, the budget summary cited continued
recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet, investment in remotely operated
and autonomous systems and funding for the next-generation attack submarine program. And we
look forward to understanding budget details for these and other national security priorities when that
information becomes available as well as funding levels requested for the Department of Energy and the
Department of Homeland Security. We also look forward to working closely with the Congress as the FY '22
President's budget request is considered during the current legislative cycle.

Regarding portfolio shaping actions during the quarter, we completed the previously announced sale
of our oil and gas business and also completed the contribution of the San Diego Shipyard to Titan

Acquisition Holdings in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in this leading provider of ship repair and
fleet sustainment services. Completion of these transactions sharpens the focus of our Technical Solutions
business into areas where we believe our unique capabilities and close customer relationships will drive
strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion.

And as I prepare to close, I'm very pleased with the operating rhythm the team is achieving, which led
to the third consecutive quarter of solid program execution and financial results. And I am very confident
that our strength, agility and positive momentum resulting from enduring the impacts of COVID-19 will
serve as key catalyst to help us leverage our historic backlog, to generate strong free cash flow and create
long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers and employees.

Now before I turn the call over to Chris, let me make a few comments about our recent leadership change.
After serving as President of Ingalls since 2014 and with more than 40 years of service, Brian Cuccias
retired on April 1. Brian's career at Ingalls has been remarkable, and HII has truly benefited from his
leadership. Effective April 1, Kari Wilkinson succeeded Brian as the new President of Ingalls and will report
to Chris. Kari has proven herself to be a strategic and visionary leader that is focused on operational
excellence, and I am extremely confident that Ingalls is in very capable hands.

And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Operationally, we had a solid quarter, making consistent
progress across our shipbuilding and Technical Solutions programs.

With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business
segments for the quarter. At Ingalls, the team was awarded a life-cycle engineering and support services
contract for the LPD program with a cumulative value of approximately $214 million. The scope of work
includes engineering change management, supply chain management, training for new shipboard systems
and the execution of post-delivery availabilities.

Regarding program status, LHA 8 Bougainville achieved a 25% complete milestone during the quarter,
and the team remains focused on maintaining strong cost and schedule performance in support of their
planned production milestones.

On the DDG program, the team remains focused on preparations for launch of DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas
and sea trials for DDG 121 Frank E. Peterson, Jr., both planned for the second half of this year. And on the
LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale remains on track to complete sea trials later this year. And LPD 29,
Richard M. McCool, Jr., remains on schedule for launch early next year.

The team at Ingalls is also working closely with the Navy to put LPD 32 and 33, along with LHA 9 under
contract. This bundle acquisition approach is the most affordable method to buy these ships. And when
complete, affords predictable savings for the Navy.

At Newport News, the team was awarded a $3 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul
of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis, and also received a contract modification for construction of the 10th
Virginia-class Block V submarine. These key awards are additional building blocks for a record backlog,
which now stands at nearly $49 billion.

Shifting to program status, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 81% complete. The team is finalizing plans
to support the single phase delivery requirements while continuing to focus on compartment completion
and key initial test milestones. CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 87% complete and
continues to make progress with the crew recently beginning to move back aboard the ship. This is
another key milestone is supported redelivery to the Navy planned for next year.

On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana continues test program activities in preparation for delivery to the
Navy planned for later this year. In addition, SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float off
milestone as planned in the second half of this year.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

At Technical Solutions, the team booked several key awards during the quarter. This included a $175
million fleet to statement recompete and a position on a Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific, ISR and
cybersecurity IDIQ contract. Additionally, production of the first Orca XLUUV modules is now underway at
our unmanned systems center of excellence. Approximately 75% of all structural components have been
fabricated, and assembly has commenced with final unit delivery to Boeing plan later this year.

And finally, our Nuclear and Environmental Services business continues to perform very well with strong
performance across our Department of Energy contracts at Los Alamos, Nevada and Savannah River.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on the financials. Tom?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on
the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website.

Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, our first quarter revenues of $2.3
billion increased less than 1% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily due to growth
at Newport News and Ingalls that was largely offset by a decline of Technical Solutions due to divestitures
associated with the portfolio-shaping actions we have taken.

Segment operating income for the quarter of $191 million increased $35 million from the first quarter of
2020 and segment operating margin, 8.4%, increased 149 basis points. The improvement was driven by
higher risk retirement at Ingalls and improved performance to Technical Solutions.

Operating income for the quarter of $147 million decreased by $68 million from the first quarter of 2020
and operating margin of 6.5% decreased 35 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by a
less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by the stronger segment operating results
compared to the prior year.

The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 15% compared to approximately 20% in the first quarter of
2020. The decline in tax rate was primarily due to the divestiture of our oil and gas business as well as the
recognition of R&D tax credits for the current year and prior periods.

Net earnings in the quarter were $148 million compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.68 compared to $4.23 in the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding the impact of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.56 compared to $2.43
in the first quarter of 2020.

Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $43 million in the quarter and net capital
expenditures were $59 million or 2.6% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $16 million.
This compares to cash from operations of $68 million and net capital expenditures of $66 million and free
cash flow of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020.

Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan were $72 million in the quarter, of
which $60 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans.

During the first quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million. As noted on our fourth
quarter earnings call, we did reinitiate share repurchases earlier this year and continue to view the
return of excess free cash flow via share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy
over the long term. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 292,000 shares at a cost of
approximately $50 million.

Moving on to pension. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we have reviewed the 5-year
pension outlook that we provided on our last earnings call and continue to believe that remains the most
appropriate view. Due to the limited nature of our projected contributions and the impact of lower cash
sensitivity with safe harbor implementation, the passage of the legislation does not have a meaningful
impact on our outlook. We plan to provide an update to near-term pension expectations on our Q3 call,
consistent with our prior cadence.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

Moving on to Slide 6 of the presentation. Ingalls revenues of $649 million in the quarter increased $20
million or 3.2% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program.
Ingalls operating income of $91 million and margin of 14% in the quarter were up from the first quarter
of 2020, mainly due to higher risk retirement on LHA, which was related to the 25% completion milestone
that Chris mentioned earlier.

Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation. Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased to
$66 million or 4.9% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both aircraft carrier and
submarine construction as well as fleet support services. Newport News operating income of $93 million
and margin 6.6% in the quarter were down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to lower risk retirement
on CVN 73 RCOH, partially offset by higher risk retirement on VCS Block IV boats.

Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $259 million in
the quarter decreased 18.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestitures of both our oil
and gas business in the San Diego shipyard on February 1 of this year, partially offset by a full quarter of
results from Hydroid, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2020.

Technical Solutions operating income of $7 million in the quarter compares to a loss in the first quarter of
2020. This was driven primarily by improved performance in Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear
Environmental Services as well as a gain related to the sale of our oil and gas business.

Turning to Slide 9. We continue to expect we will finish the year with strict building operating margin in
the 7% to 8% range with the significant remaining risk retirement events weighted towards the end of the
year. In addition, we expect shipbuilding margin for the first half of 2021 to be around the midpoint of our
annual guidance range.

We continue to view the remainder of our 2021 guidance as appropriate with the exception of the effective
tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.

Dwayne B. Blake
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Carter Copeland from Melius Research.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Mike, I wondered if you could expand -- I mean it's been quite a string of challenges thrown at you over
the last several quarters, but the comment you made around the operating rhythm and finding, I guess,
more of a better cadence there, I wondered if you could expand on that and specifically what sort of
operating metrics you're looking at that give you conviction that, that's a trend you're going to stay on.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Okay. I think, first of all, Carter, you're right. We've had a lot of stuff thrown at us in the last 12 months,
and we took a pretty good body blow back a year ago with attendance relative to the pandemic. And the
impact that had on our ability to retire risk, we recognize that in Q2.

But what came out of that was we've stabilized our employment levels. We've stabilized our scheduling.
We've actually created the mechanisms in our risk registers so that we know where we are and where
we're going and where we need to get. It helps a lot that we have this backlog that we're working off
of. And where we are now is that when you come through a crisis like this as a leadership team, the
connectivity, the tools that you've put in place, the innovation that has happened, you're taking advantage
of all of that. And as you move forward, you start to look at what have we actually accomplished.

When we started at the beginning of the pandemic thinking that we needed to preserve the 25,000 people
we had just hired over the last 5 years in our workforce, we've done that. We actually have hired between
5,000 and 6,000 people since the pandemic started. That's pretty creative and innovative, if you will. And
that's the -- and we still have pretty robust hiring plans going forward.

Our case rates today are lower than they have been since last summer. That's inside of our yard. And the
quarantine volume today is lower than it's been really since this began. We have actually administered
vaccines to -- we've administered vaccines to about 1/3 of our workforce on top of where they're widely
available to the rest of the employees who are getting them not through us. And so we're seeing a pretty
steady rhythm now. Our folks are at work. They're engaged. We understand what needs to be done, and
we're actually getting stuff done.

I think the change where we moved Chris over to be the Chief Operating Officer and really create more
management bandwidth on how do we manage that risk going forward and how do we make sure that
we're doing what we said we were going to do has really helped. And so I don't know, I guess I've been
around it for a long time, but I feel really good about where we are right now in terms of doing what we
said we're going to do.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up. There's obviously a lot of talk macro-wise about inflation and
inflationary impacts. When you look at, at least in terms of your fixed price work, is there any cost
exposure that you watch there to be aware of? Or is it not significant at this point? How should we think
about that?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Carter, I'm going to let Tom take that one and let him talk to you about what we're seeing there.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So relative to inflation, our contracts, the much longer term, we have the benefit here with long-lead
contracts from a planning horizon and the backlog that we have to plan our workout. So we have a site
as far as the materials that we need. Additionally, when we put together proposals and the contracts that
we bring home, we generally want to see those POs in place, the backstop by proposals and commitment
shortly thereafter the award. So what we're seeing, and I've talked about yards just this week as a matter
of fact on that point.

We're not seeing a tremendous amount of inflation across the purchases that we have, and we're not
having a problem feeding the yards from a material perspective. We do see going forward as we're getting
new quotes that the stand of the validity of the quotes is short. I think the subcontractors are staying light
on their feet as far as what they're committing to. But relative to our contracts and our performance, we
don't see an impact right now.

Operator

We take the next question from the line of Myles Walton from UBS.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I was hoping, Chris, you could clarify that LPD bundled contract you mentioned, the size, timing, and if
that is more to just generate efficiencies. Or could there actually be increased levels of work versus your
medium-term plan as well?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So that's all kind of contained in the 3% guidance that we talked about from a growth standpoint. The
benefits of the bundle are pretty clear. When you can order those 3 ships together and sequence the work
in an efficient manner, you're going to absolutely get savings. So it's something we support. It's something
we're working very closely with the Navy. If we are not able to get that done, we'll get those ships under
contract incrementally. It just will not be as efficient.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

What would be the size of the bundle of those 3?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

It's about $5.5 billion, potentially.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And just a clarification for Tom. The sequential margin in 2Q given the 1H is expected to be at the
midpoint of the range. Can you point to maybe why the step-down is so significant to 6 -- mid-6s or so?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. As I relayed in my comments, opening comments there, there's not a tremendous amount of
milestones that we have in Q2, Q3. It's just a pacing year right now. So we're watching the volume come
through at the present booking rates that we have right now. We think the first half of the year will come
in around the midpoint of the guidance. And then we have milestones in the back half of the year that, if
retired, add some potential there. But obviously, we have to round that off as the year to expire.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

The next question is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.

Douglas Stuart Harned
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

We've seen a whole lot of Navy shipbuilding plans at the 500-plus versions. And the CNL appears to
have gone back to kind of the 355 ship goal. But even that goal has been not easy to get to and the mix
appears very uncertain. So Mike, when you think about planning in this environment, how do you do it?
How do you think about long-term investments and where you want to sit given all of the flux around the
shipbuilding plans?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Doug. That's a great question. It's when we actually kind of kick around a lot is are we
thinking about this the right way? I think at a macro kind of at the higher level, what we see is that the
shipbuilding execution plan is on a much longer rhythm than the shipbuilding theoretical plans. Like a 30-
year plan comes out, I don't know, every couple of years. But the contracts, we have ships right now that
are under contract to deliver -- I mean, Doris Miller delivers in 2032. So what is that, like 4 30-year plans
between now and then? So we look at those plans not so much as the precision of the plan, but more
about what's the intent of the plan.

And what we're seeing in the intent of the plan, you've acknowledged that they move around a little bit,
but what we see in those movements is maybe wants to move to a Navy that has many ships, faster
ships, maybe smaller ships, cheaper ships. So our investments are aimed in that direction. Now that
doesn't mean they're not going to build aircraft carriers or submarines because I think they are, but
they're going to want to build aircraft carriers more efficiently. They're going to want to build submarines
more efficiently. They may want to build more submarines more efficiently.

When it comes to the nonnuclear ships, amphibs destroyers, frigates, those kinds of platforms go -- they
either go through class change or block changes. And our challenge is to be agile enough to respond to
the customers' requirements and do that as effectively and efficiently as we can. So the investments
we make in our facilities are designed to be able to do that. They're multipurpose, multiproduct kinds of
investments. We'll do a capital investment at Ingalls that will apply to 4 classes of ships. We'll do capital
investments at Newport News that you can use for carriers or submarines.

And so that's kind of the way we think about that as opposed to we need to go make a big investment for
pick your program that 3 years from now may evaporate. We don't do that. So that's kind of the way we
sized and thought about this generational investment we made over the past 5 years or so, a couple of
billion dollars in our shipyards. We think that positions us very, very well for the direction that the -- that
we think the Navy is going to end up going. And we'll probably have lots of discussion about whether it's
one more submarine or one less destroyer, and all that sort of thing, but it means our investments were
still the right thing to do.

Douglas Stuart Harned
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

And do you think when you look forward, as you're saying more faster shifts, smaller ships in some -- in
a sense, it can open it up to other competitors rather post to you and General Dynamics. And we saw this
with the frigate LCS. I mean, do you foresee a time? Obviously, it's a way is a way when the competitive
structure of this industry could change because of these smaller, faster, different ships?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

I mean, I don't know, Doug, I guess, maybe. But I would say that I would caution anybody from thinking
about that question as a binary question that it's either one or the other. It's going to be a kind of a
transformation that's going to be product line specific.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

Most of the shipyards in this country build a product. Our shipyards build classes -- several classes. We
build 4 classes of ships at Ingalls. We build carriers and submarines at Newport News and refueling and all
that sort of things. So we do multiple classes of ships in our shipyard. We think that serves us pretty well
for whatever direction the future is going to be. And if the environment is going to be more competitive,
so be it. We're happy to compete.

Operator

The next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. Can we talk a little bit maybe about the services business. The margins in the quarter were, what,
2.7% and the target margins are 3% to 5%. What drives the upside there? How are you thinking about
that?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

So I'll take that. Ross, it's Tom here. So a couple of things. We have guided from 3% to 5%. You're right,
it is a 2.7% quarter. Right now, we saw a little bit of volume shortfall there as we're waiting for awards
and the sales to come along with those awards for the year. Just with COVID and then the announcements
of where we are in some recompetes, it's just a little bit stay behind relative to guidance of 3% to 5%. But
the year is still in front of us, we haven't changed our guidance. We think TS will be at year's end.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Ron, I can add to that. There's -- in our equity accounting relative to the nuclear space, the timing of
some of those are slated towards second and fourth quarters. So you see -- you don't generally see that
happening in the first quarter. So it's a bit lumpy, and we usually start light.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then a question for Mike. When you're looking out medium term, let's call it, what are
the biggest opportunities that you're trying to plan for now? I mean maybe this is a follow-on to Doug's
question. As you're positioning the business, what's the big fish out there that you want to catch, say, call
it, 3, 4, 5 years on?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

So in shipbuilding, I think that we'll start with that. I think that if there's an expansion of a product line,
say -- and there has been some discussion about what's the industry's ability to support expansion of, say,
the submarine product line, we certainly want to be able to take full advantage of that.

In the same way, if the Navy wants to expand in the frigate space, we want to be able to assist that if we
need to be able to go and do that. And then I think it's the engagement on the planning and design piece
for. So what happens in -- to the future of amphibs? Probably that's mid- to long term, probably not near
to mid-term. And what happens with the carrier? Is -- are there going to be -- the CVN 82 going to have
some design for affordability put to it and are we going to engage in that? I mean, frankly, CVN 82 is a
ship that starts to show up here. I mean, it's -- you go to contract in '27 or '28. So making sure that, that
stays on track. That's kind of the way we think about it in shipbuilding.

In the Technical Solutions space, we've made a big investment in unmanned. And expansion of the
unmanned business, I think, is something that now that we've made that investment and we have the
portfolio, it's up to us to make sure that we capture that expansion. Of all the budget items that I see out

there, the unmanned budget item is probably going to have the largest percentage growth over the next 5
years, in my view.

We've established our -- as Chris kind of alluded to a minute ago, we've established our position as a
Department of Energy prime, and there's a lot of work over there that needs to be done. And we are
pursuing all of that very aggressively. We think that's a really great spot for us to be in. It takes advantage
of capability that we have in our shipbuilding business, but it gives access to another customer. And we've
done very well with that, and we look to continue to expand that.

And then ISR space, where we've really actually done well and we expect to do well going forward. So we
kind of look at that. It's kind of a capability-dependent based on what our customers' needs for capability
are, but that's kind of how we think about it. Where do we think our customers are going to want to be in
3 to 5 years? And how do we make sure we get there and help them get there?

The next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Yes. If you -- Tom, if you could provide the VACs. And is it fair that the pickup on the LHA 8 was probably
$35 million or so?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

George, a little bit color on that is $86 million was the up, and it was the favorable. $36 million was then a
net $50 million. Across the yards, it was about 90/10 at Ingalls. The only significant drivers on the upside
there were the LHA 8. We usually don't give guidance or information on a specific shift. So $35 million is
kind of heavy there.

Ingalls had a good quarter on top of the LHA hitting the 25% vessel complete milestone where they
reevaluate the risk and they restrike the EAC. They did have a change proposal that definitize. They've
been focused on cost management there. So overall, it was a good quarter for Ingalls. There was no other
significant upsides or downsides that I'd probably highlight here.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Yes, yes, yes. Tom, if $35 million is a little bit heavy. I mean just on the rough numbers you gave, it would
imply about $45 million of favorable at Ingalls. So was there anything else you can specify? Or it's all
spread across the board for, say, another $20 million, if $30 million was the LHA 8?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The Q has the information on LHA 8. So when that pass out, you'll see that you're about $10 million
heavy there. But as I say, the other aspects of it, change management, we've definitized the change
down there, not only significant. And then just a good performance in LPD 28 is coming along and paying
attention on cost. 14% high, so I wouldn't expect that going forward. But they cleaned up well, and they
didn't get bid for the quarter. So that's where they landed.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

And one quick one for Mike. Can you update us on the Block V submarines? I mean that was the one that
you had some problems with as to where we stand right now.

Actually, the challenge we had in Q2 was on Block IV, George. And we've got a rhythm in Block -- we're
establishing a rhythm in Block IV that's going to carry through and help us do really well on Block V. So I
don't know, Chris, if you want to add to that?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Yes, I can add on Block IV. We met some important milestones in the first quarter with Montana floating
off in New Jersey, getting pressure all complete. Two important milestones on the balance of the year
there for VCS Block IV, getting Montana delivered and getting New Jersey floated off. So we're watching
those milestones very closely, good progress on Montana on getting ready for delivery. So we're optimistic
on kind of the rhythm and the momentum on the Block IV contract right now.

The next question comes from Richard Safran from Seaport Global.

Richard Tobie Safran
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

So I've just been doing reading about the work. I wanted to ask you about the Ford. I've been reading
about the work being done there. Based on that, Newport still doing work on things like the weapons
elevators and there are other maintenance items, et cetera. I just wanted to know if you could discuss
how the work on the Ford is progressing relative to your expectations, when you expect completion, and if
there's been any commentary from the Navy about the level of satisfaction with your efforts so far.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Yes. This is Chris, and I'll let or ex aircraft care program manager, Mike, talk about it after me. But yes,
really positive interaction with the Navy on the Ford, weekly interaction on the Ford, especially on the
weapons elevators. Got 7 of those turned over, 4 of them will be done this summer. So really positive
interaction. That work will go on for a while, but nothing -- not really material going forward. But yes, it's
been positive. The Newport News team is performing very well. I think the Navy is very pleased with the
performance of that ship right now.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

And I'll just add, the Ford was at see as much as probably more than any other ship in the fleet last year.
It's the training carrier for the East Coast. And the Navy will say, and they have said that they can quote
you the number of traps, the number of launches the number of -- the tons of ordinance that they've
moved on the weapons elevators, how easy it is to operate, how much power density changes from the
Nimitz-class. I mean it is the centerpiece of -- the design is the centerpiece of the Navy strategy going
forward. And the ship is coming together really well and then getting ready to go towards their shock trial.
So all systems are green and full speed ahead.

Richard Tobie Safran
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. And now I'd like to revisit this comment, you talked about -- your comments, you were making
about the future of the Navy fleet. There was one program, I think, that was omitted and maybe it was
deliberate. And there was talk of a replacement for the Ticonderogas. I was kind of wondering if you
could just comment on the status of that program. I mean if you think that will ever materialize to a real
opportunity. Or for example, do you think that Flight III was [ 5 6 ] is what you think is going to replace
the Ticos?

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

I'm not sure I know how to handicap that. One of the first things I learned at the Academy 40 years
ago was that there's countermeasures, and then there's counter-countermeasures, and there's counter-
counter-countermeasures. And what happens is the technology races ahead at a speed that's a lot
different than the build cycle of a ship. And so the question is what kind of platform are you going to need
to work the technology? If you look at the Type 3 destroyer and you look at what they're trying to do with
it, that ship is pretty full.

And so is there a -- if the technology is going to require that kind of space and weight, then it probably
needs something different to carry it forward. How we get there as an industry to design that and create
the platform that has the margin, if you will, for future technological upgrades? I think the Navy is -- and
the industry are having a pretty robust discussion about that right now. And I'm not sure I'm ready to
handicap how it's going to turn out.

Operator

The next question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just going back to the pace of margin through the year topic and the risk retirements and how they flow
through. The shipbuilding margin, if I take out the net positive EAC in a lot of your history is in the zone of
6.5%. And the different guidance comments you've provided for first half and full year sort of imply 6.5%
2Q, 3Q and then stepping up in 4Q. So I guess it implies essentially no risk retirement events 2Q, 3Q,
actually maybe even embedding something slightly negative. Just want to make sure that's what you're
looking for, and I have that correct.

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll tell you, we are in the zone there. So between 6% and 7% would be the norm. 6.5% is a good
estimate on your part. I'd tell you that the mix moves around at both yards as far as where the ships
are. So as ships get either sold off or mature when they take a step up and/or you have new ships have
started a lower booking rate that mix changes, I wouldn't read too much into that where we need to be
from a plan perspective and against our guidance that we gave you there. So yes, I think you got that
right.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Makes sense. And Tom, when you look to next year in 2022, do you have more risk retirement events or
less or a similar amount?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

So we told you 7% to 8% this year, low 8% next year. We had mentioned that as we go forward, when
Chris gave the guidance for Q4 in February, he had mentioned that, "hey, this is a pacing year. And then
as we get into '22 or '23, we'll see more ship deliveries." So there is the potential there and the plant has
us moving upwards. And obviously, as the quarters kind of click off, we'll burn down that risk and we'll
realize the -- those margin expansions that we've discussed.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just a clarification on the ARPA into pension cash flow inputs. Do the contribution and CAS
recovery numbers you've provided previously literally not changed at all? Or it's just that those had come
down enough that the change is going to be small relative to your total cash flows?

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Yes, it's been significant as far as the change. But if you do the math, there's something there, but we
really don't want to chase it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Since we strong over to safe harbor, we really
kind of mitigated the CAS variability. And already, we're at unlimited contributions over the projection that
Chris gave in February. Again, the max contribution was $80 million, half of that post-retirement benefits.

So -- and then also, obviously, the projections on pension is going to be equally a function of the discount
rate as that changes and then the planned performance. So between those 3 variables, we're not going to
update every quarter here. We'll give you a look-see at Q3. That's the normal cadence for the remainder
of the year in 2022. And then as '21 closes out, we'll give you a fresh look and a 5-year projection next
February.

The next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Mike, you touched on the unmanned portfolio and the potential growth there in a couple of your
comments. Could you size the revenue, your unmanned revenue now that sits within TS, what are
reasonable kind of targets for that business could be over the next couple of years and when you would
think about actually breaking it out so we can see what's going on there?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We haven't broken that out yet. And so we'll just -- we'll let you know when we're ready to break it
out.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. I guess, in the first quarter, you did -- you had 5% growth at Newport, 3% at Ingalls. You're
forecasting shipbuilding relatively flat to up a little bit this year, and then 3% from here. How should we
think about the relative growth rate of Newport versus Ingalls, both this year and into the future?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Yes, this is Chris. We don't break out the growth rate by the 2 shipyards. We have historically said
that Ingalls is more flattish moving forward and a lot of the growth is coming from Newport News, but we
don't give specific growth rates.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. See if I can hit on one here. The R&D amortization, Tom, what potential impact could you guys be
looking at there if that holds?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the opinion that we have on that is not constructive to -- from an investment standpoint in R&D
if that has to get amortized over 5 years. So we'll have to see how that legislation flows out. We have run
some models on that. It's not a tremendous impact. It does obviously affect the cash on it. I mean our
models say it could be in the 50-ish range, $50 million to $100 million range. And we'll have to see how
that legislation unfolds.

The next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I have a question on the National Security Cutter program. Any change in the Biden administration on the
desire to keep buying these? What should we be looking for '22 request? What's under contract? If you
could just refresh us on that.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we're pushing hard to get NSC 12 appropriated. I think it's kind of like the Navy side. We're kind
of living off of the work done on the FY '22 budget before this administration got here. And I think the
administration now is doing a kind of a top to bottom review of all of that stuff. That's why, frankly, for
DoD, you've just seen the top line number come out with not any details behind it.

Our view is that there's a lot of strong support for the National Security Cutter. The Coast Guard has -- is
gainfully using that platform around the world. And we're proud to be able to partner with them to get it
done, and we're going to continue to pursue it.

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Gala, I could add. We've delivered through 9, as you're probably aware, 11 -- 10, 11 under
production there at Ingalls, 11 delivers out in the '24 time frame. But as Mike indicated, very capable ship,
and we're working with the Coast guard for potentially in the Congress to get 12 under contract.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And is there any discussion of additional block buy fees? Or is 12 sort of the end of the line on that
program?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

I think we'll see. I think we're just -- a lot of new players are coming to the table to have a discussion
around it. We're happy to provide whatever requirement the nation needs in that platform.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And I may have missed it in your opening remarks, but where are we in terms of staffing at the
shipyards, people showing up like level of absenteeism and/or from COVID related to that?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're at normal levels now. I mean, we have our lowest case rates since last summer. We have
the fewest number of people in quarantine since last summer. 1/3 of our workforce -- we've actually
vaccinated 1/3 of the workforce, and the workforce is getting vaccinations in other places as well. And

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

so what that's doing is that's just driving our case rates down pretty dramatically. We hired 6,000 people
during the pandemic. Our hiring plans continue. And so we're moving ahead. We expect that by the first of
June, the people in our shipyards that have -- that want to get the vaccine will have had access to get it.
And so we're moving ahead.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And last one for me. Just curious, is there any precedent for the bundled purchase that you're talking
about with maybe LHA and LPD being put together? In other words, a bundle across different ship
classes...

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, we had a competition a few years ago where the competition was around an LHA and a TAO. And we
won the LHA, and our friends at NASSCO won the TAOs. So we've been building ships in this country for
over 200 years. I would say that there's probably precedent for just about everything that's out there.

The next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Crédit Suisse.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Chris, this one is for you. I wanted to ask, in your new role, I think one of the things that you're tackling is
just smoothing up the best practices from 1 yard to the other or maybe across all 3 businesses. And I was
hoping you could expand on that a little bit, talk about where the opportunities are within that?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Yes. No, that's a really good question. I do -- I have had the opportunity to work at Ingalls as a CFO there.
And then my corporate CFO job, reviewing all the processes at Newport News. And there are significant
things that happen within each of the yards and even in technical solutions that can be shared. One
example I could give is supply chain. The supply chain teams work very closely with each other. They
bundle procurements. They look at capacity across the spectrum. And they do a very good job at that.
Their operating systems are a bit different, but they learn from each other. And we've been bringing best
practices in the operating systems as well. So I could talk for days on the things we're working on across
shipbuilding and within technical solutions to learn from each other, but those are just a few of them.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I think on one of our visits, one of the things we saw at Newport News was the implementation of VR. It
sort of to replace physical blueprints as an example of where a technology can come in. Is there an update
on how well that's implemented and if you're actually using that yet or if there are other technologies
we're talking about?

Christopher D. Kastner
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So another good question. Digital is absolutely being utilized within Newport News and building a CVN
80, and it'll -- it's preparing for utilization on the Columbia class. So it's absolutely an investment we're
making. It's paying off the craft and the trades like the new product, and we're hoping for really great
things to come from that.

anything like that?

Christopher D. Kastner

We have definitely seen a 1% increase in savings. We haven't published anything to that regard. It's just
at the beginning stages on 80. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but we are achieving savings,
yes.

Operator

The next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.

Joseph William DeNardi
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Tom, just to clarify Carter's question maybe more specifically. When you think about an inflationary
environment, what protections do you have? And then where are the risks? I understand you're not seeing
anything right now, but to the extent we do see that, where are you protected and what are the risks?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So as I said earlier on that, our contracts are a little bit more long term than, say, across other
industries. We do have the planning cycle, long lead on our contracts. We -- usually, our processes, we
want to make sure that we have as much material understood on the quote. So when we go on award, the
risk of inflation hitting our handshake values is low on that. Additionally, as contracts run out, there are
some contracts with the carriers, 6 to 7 or 8 years. And we buy the material much further where it's tough
to get that quote. We still have EPA indices and pricing bands with the customer that we share in both the
potential underrun or the overrun in that. And then obviously, these contracts are FPIS. So there's some
sharing there.

But like more immediate, as we pulse right now for the execution of that -- of the contracts that we're
working today, we don't see that right now. I mean there's pockets here and there, a piece of material
that may be late. But on the whole, material is being flown into the yard at the expected times and
expectation of costs that the contracts are centered around. So I hope that hit the S&C question.

Joseph William DeNardi
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Yes. That's helpful. And then, Mike, when you look at 80, 81 and 82, can you talk about the degree
of commonality you're expecting from those ships? Does the block buy ensure greater commonality
so that maybe you can benefit more from serial production? When you think about the opportunity to
improve margins on carrier construction, how important is maybe more commonality? Or is it something
very different than that?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So 80 and 81 are the 2 ships under contract. 82 is the ship that's out there. Chris alluded to my
ancient history of being a program manager. I was actually a program manager for the Stennis and
Truman, which was the last time we built 2 ships at the same time. I can tell you that the second ship
absolutely benefits from the first ship in that -- in the way that the teams move from one platform to
the next. The learning curves are there. It's kind of hard to think about learning curves on ships that
deliver 4 or 5 years apart, but they actually -- it's real. And as you get to the second ship, you have well-
trained crews who have been through this, who are working through it, who are capturing lessons that are
carrying lessons learned with them into that platform.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2021

Then the trick will be how do you take what we've learned at 81 and make sure that you do that with 82.
And what that means is 82 has got to be on time. If you delay 82, and we've -- and I've seen this over
my whole career, you start spreading these things back out. You start breaking those learning curves. So
what 80, 81 means is that you're going to get great efficiency there. I think they may be advertised $4
billion of efficiency across the enterprise, which that's pretty significant. If you spread that out and you
delay 82 and you push it out, you're going to start to cut into that efficiency pretty dramatically. That's
what happened after Stennis and Truman, with 74 and 75 really came together very nicely. Then we kind
of pushed 76 out to the right a little bit. And then we pushed 77 out to the right a little bit. And then we
pushed 78 out to the right a little bit. And so all of that, we're trying to capture that back. And I would --
no surprise, I would argue that the next carrier contract should also be a 2-ship buy, 82 and 83. So -- but
that's just me.

Operator

I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, thanks for that, and thanks for joining us today. And we certainly hope that you and your families
are all staying safe and are healthy in this environment as we kind of come through the pandemic.

But one final thought for you all is I'd like to direct your attention to our Investor Relations page on our
website and take a look at our corporate sustainability report. We've been doing a lot of work over many
years around these kinds of issues related to sustainability. But we've collected all of that and created
a virtual report for you to take a look at. And it's only been up there, I don't know, a couple of months.
And it's a pretty dynamic presentation. But I'm very proud of what this company does relative to our
communities, relative for our employees, for their families, for our customers. I just -- I'm very proud of
what we do and how we do it, and this is a chance for us to kind of brag about a little bit. So if you get a
chance, take a look at that.

And as always, I appreciate your -- and we appreciate your interest in our company, your engagement
with us and any feedback that you have. And we look forward to seeing you again soon. Thanks.
