HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Huntington
Ingalls Industries Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's
conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the call over to Dwayne Blake, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Blake,
you may begin.

Dwayne B. Blake
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks. Good morning, and welcome to the Huntington Ingalls Industries Third Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. With us today are Mike Petters, President and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kastner,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Stiehle, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer.

As a reminder, statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking
statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results
may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual
results to vary materially from anticipated results.

Also, in the remarks today, Mike, Chris and Tom will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations
of these metrics to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix of our earnings
presentation that is posted on our website. We plan to address the posted presentation slides during the
call to supplement our comments. Please access our website at huntingtoningalls.com and click on the
Investor Relations link to view the presentation as well as our earnings release.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Mike Petters. Mike?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Dwayne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, we
released third quarter 2021 financial results that included another quarter of consistent shipbuilding
program execution.

Let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.3
billion were up 1% from the third quarter of 2020 and diluted EPS was $3.65, down from $5.45 in the
third quarter of 2020. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $600 million, resulting
in backlog of approximately $50 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $24 billion is
funded.

Shifting to activities in Washington. The federal government began the new fiscal year under a continuing
resolution, which funds government operations through December 3. Now we continue to urge Congress
to proceed expeditiously and remain optimistic that the defense appropriations and authorization
processes will be completed in the months ahead. As bills progressed through both chambers of Congress,
we continue to see bipartisan support for our programs reflected in the defense appropriations and
authorization bills in the House and the Senate. We are pleased that the 4 defense oversight committees
have shown strong support for shipbuilding to include adding a second Arleigh Burke-class destroyer,
which is a Navy -- a top Navy priority for fiscal year 2022. The appropriations bills also include language in
support of a DDG 51 follow-on multiyear procurement contract in FY '23.

So as I prepare to close, let me give a quick update on COVID-19. We continue to work with our
customers to satisfy the requirement for federal contractors to have their workforce vaccinated against
COVID-19 by December 8, 2021. At HII, we remain committed to promoting and protecting the health

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

and safety of our employees, their families and their communities and continuing to serve our customers
and the vital national security interests of our country without disruption as an essential contributor to the
nation's critical infrastructure.

We view our workforce of approximately 44,000 employees as critical partners in this effort and continue
to help our unvaccinated employees meet this requirement as safely and efficiently as possible. We will
continue to evaluate how the vaccine mandate and delta variant impact our workforce as well as material
availability from our supply chain and we expect to have more to share during the fourth quarter earnings
call in February.

And finally, let me recap what HII has done from a portfolio shaping perspective over the past 20 months.
In short, we have done exactly what we said we would do during our February 2020 Investor Day. First,
we have positioned the Technical Solutions business in growth markets that support the constantly
evolving requirements of our customers. And second, we have demonstrated the financial flexibility to
pursue these critical growth opportunities while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and
continuing to return capital to shareholders.

Following the closing of the Alion transaction during the quarter, our team is laser focused on a successful
integration in order to produce the financial returns we expect. We are also ensuring that our core
shipbuilding programs are achieving key production milestones in order to generate strong free cash flow,
which will enable deleveraging of the balance sheet while continuing to return capital to shareholders
via dividends and share repurchases. We firmly believe that these are the appropriate steps to generate
significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.

And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?

Christopher D. Kastner
Former Executive VP & COO

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report another solid operational quarter.
With that, let me share a few highlights. At Ingalls, let me first provide a brief update on the pending
contracts awards of LHA 9, LPD 32 and 33. We still believe that a bundled acquisition of these critically
important ships is the most cost-effective method of procurement and are pleased that the Navy and
Congress have protected the ship schedules with a contract for long-lead material on LHA 9 coupled with
continued support for LPD 32 and 33.

Shifting to program status. LHA 8 Bougainville continues to achieve cost and schedule performance in line
with our expectations while making steady progress through the structural erection and initial outfitting
phases of construction.

On the DDG program, the team successfully completed acceptance trials for guided missile destroyer DDG
121 Frank E. Petersen Jr. and expects to deliver the ship to the Navy by the end of this year. In addition,
DDG's 123 and 125 remain on track to complete sea trials next year as planned. On the LPD program, LPD
28 Fort Lauderdale was christened in August. This ship remains on track to complete sea trials during the
fourth quarter with delivery to the Navy planned in the first quarter of next year. At Newport News, CVN
79 Kennedy is approximately 84% complete and the focus remains on compartment completion and key
initial propulsion plant milestones.

Regarding definitization of the single-phase delivery contract modification, we have reached agreement
on the cost and schedule impacts with the Navy and expect to execute the contract modification late this
year or early next year. On the RCOH program, CVN 73 USS George Washington continues to achieve key
propulsion plant milestones and is approximately 92% complete. In CVN 78 USS Gerald R. Ford returned
to Newport News in August to begin a planned incremental availability following successful completion of
full-ship shock trials.

On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year. And
the SSN 796 New Jersey float-off milestone has moved to early next year to ensure that we achieve the
optimum build sequence from float-off to delivery, planned in 2022. And finally, on the submarine fleet
support program, SSN 725 Helena, remains on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

At Technical Solutions, the Alion transaction closed in mid-August, and the team announced new business
groups and executive appointments that directly align with the strategic focus that we have previously
articulated. We expect this very talented team to execute a successful integration of Alion and deliver
unparalleled national security solutions to our customers while growing the business and producing
returns in line with our expectations. Delays in contract awards in our unmanned business for critical new
programs remains a watch item. We're expecting this to be resolved by the end of the year, but it appears
that these awards are not likely until early to mid-2022.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on the financials. Tom?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our third quarter results and provide an
update on our outlook for 2021. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings
release issued this morning and posted to our website.

Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, our third quarter revenues of
$2.3 billion increased approximately 1% compared to the same period last year. This is due to growth
at Technical Solutions driven by the Alion acquisition which was largely offset by a decline in revenue at
Ingalls, primarily due to lower volumes on the NSC, DDG and LHA programs.

Segment operating income for the quarter of $163 million increased $1 million compared to the third
quarter of 2020. And segment operating margin of 7% was in line with the results from the prior year
period. Operating income for the quarter of $118 million decreased by $104 million from the third quarter
of 2020, and operating margin of 5% decreased 455 basis points. These decreases were almost entirely
due to a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment compared to the prior year period.

The tax rate in the quarter was a negative 4.3% compared to 1.8% in the third quarter of 2020. The
decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to additional research and development tax credits for tax years
2016 through 2020 recorded in the third quarter of 2021.

Net earnings in the quarter were $147 million compared to $222 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.65 compared to $5.45 in the prior year period. Third
quarter 2021 results include approximately $15 million of nonrecurring pretax transaction expenses
related to the acquisition of Alion. Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the
quarter were $3.58 compared to $3.73 per share in the third quarter of 2020.

Turning to Slide 5. Cash from operations was $350 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were
$73 million or 3.1% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of $277 million. This compares to cash from
operations of $222 million and $62 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $160 million in
the prior year period. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $10
million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits.

During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million. Our Board of Directors
recently approved a 3.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.18 per share, and this will take effect in
the fourth quarter of this year. We also repurchased approximately 83,000 shares during the quarter at an
aggregate cost of approximately $17 million.

Moving on to Slide 6. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $628 million decreased $47 million or 7% from
the same period last year, driven primarily by lower revenues on the NSE, DDG and LHA programs. Ingalls
operating income of $62 million and margin of 9.9% in the quarter compared to operating income of $62
million and margin of 9.2% in the third quarter of 2020. The operating margin improvement was driven by
an incentive on the DDG program and higher risk retirement for the LPD program, partially offset by lower
risk retirement on the NSC program.

Turning to Slide 7. Newport News revenues of approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter decreased $4
million or less than 1% from the same period last year, driven by lower revenues in naval nuclear support
services partially offset by higher revenues in submarines and aircraft carriers.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Naval nuclear support services revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes in submarine
fleet support services and facility maintenance services partially offset by higher volumes in carrier fleet
support services. Submarine revenues increased due to higher volumes in Block V boats of the Virginia-
class submarine program, and submarine support services and Columbia-class submarine program,
partially offset by lower volumes on Block IV boats of the Virginia-class submarine program.

Aircraft carrier revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on the RCOH of USS John C.
Stennis CVN 74 and the construction of Doris Miller CVN 81 and enterprise CVN 80, partially offset by
lower volumes on the RCOH of USS George Washington CVN 73 and the construction of John F. Kennedy
CVN 79.

Newport News operating income of $88 million and margin of 6.5% in the quarter compares to operating
income of $79 million and margin of 5.8% in the third quarter of 2020. The improvement was primarily
due to higher risk retirement on the RCOH of the USS George Washington CVN 73 and Block IV boats of
the VCS program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the naval nuclear support services.

Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $394 million
in the quarter increased 23% from the same period last year, mainly due to revenue attributable to
the acquisition of Alion in mid-August, partially offset by the divestiture of our oil and gas business and
contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture in the first quarter of this year. The acquisition
of Alion closed on August 19, and third quarter results included approximately $163 million of revenue
attributable to Alion.

Technical Solutions operating income of $13 million and operating margin of 3.3% in the quarter compares
to an operating income of $21 million and operating margin of 6.6% in the third quarter of 2020. These
decreases were primarily driven by the inclusion of approximately $8 million of Alion related purchase
intangible amortization as well as lower performance in Defense and Federal Solutions, the divestiture
of our oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture I previously
mentioned. Third quarter 2021 results include approximately $4 million of operating income attributable to
Alion. Third quarter Technical Solutions EBITDA was approximately $30.3 million or an EBITDA margin of
7.7%.

Moving on to Slide 9 of the presentation. We've updated our outlook for 2021 and 2022 pension and
postretirement benefits. For 2022, FAS is now projected to be a benefit rather than an expense, primarily
due to higher asset returns. Consequently, the FAS/CAS adjustment has increased from the prior outlook
and is now projected to total $52 million in 2022. Please remember that pension-related numbers are
subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. We will provide a multiyear update of pension
estimates on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.

Finally, on Slide 10, a perspective on the outlook for the remainder of the year for both shipbuilding
and Technical Solutions inclusive of Alion. Regarding shipbuilding, we now expect 2021 revenue to be
approximately $8.2 billion at the low end, but within our initial guidance range. Third quarter shipbuilding
revenue was modestly impacted by material timing, which may persist in the near term. Additionally,
we continue to navigate through a challenging labor market as well as the potential impact of COVID-19
vaccine mandate. Given all of that, we think it's best to be prudent and temper near-term expectations.

We continue to expect that shipbuilding operating margin will finish the year in the 7.5% to 8% range.
We expect that the fourth quarter shipbuilding operating margin will be roughly consistent with the third
quarter results as we were able to recognize some key retirement events in the third quarter, including the
completion of sea trials for DDG 121.

Regarding Technical Solutions, I've noted that Alion acquisition closed in mid-August and our updated
expectations for 2021 now include Alion from the date of acquisition, inclusive of incremental purchase
intangible amortization that impacts our segment operating margin expectation.

Turning to free cash flow. We now expect 2021 free cash flow to be between $300 million and $350 million
as the repayment of the accelerated progress payments which was initially expected in 2021 has now

moved out to 2022. Additionally, on Slide 10, we have provided an updated outlook for a number of other
discrete items to assist with your modeling.

Regarding our longer-term targets, we continue to believe that the 3% CAGR for shipbuilding revenue is
appropriate. Additionally, we remain comfortable with our free cash flow target of $3.2 billion from 2020
through 2024. We plan to provide a more detailed view of 2022 on our fourth quarter call in February.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A.

Dwayne B. Blake
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Tom. As a reminder to everyone on the call, please limit yourself to one initial question and one
follow-up so we can get as many people through the queue as possible. Operator, I'll turn it over to you to
manage the Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I was hoping I could just start with the shipbuilding revenue outlook and maybe less specific to the
revenue outlook, more specific to what you're seeing in the labor workforce. And moving to the low end
of this range, is that anticipating things that you haven't seen yet as it relates to the COVID mandate and
what it could do to attendance and workforce? Or is it more what you saw in the third quarter, if you kind
of get where I'm going.

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

It's Tom. I'll start with that one. So from an outlook perspective, yes, we did go to the bottom end of the
range. As you recall, we gave you [ $8.2 billion and $8.4 billion ] at the beginning of the year. As we see
how the quarter played out right now, what's left in front of us right now. We now move the shipbuilding
revenue expectation at $8.2 billion. A couple of points on that right now. We're a little light on material,
specifically at Ingalls. If you look from a Newport News perspective, net revenues were flat. Obviously,
I'll look back from a TSD perspective. But when we're talking about shipbuilding, the material lag behind
roughly about $40 million in the quarter. And as we look forward into Q4, that could persist.

We don't see significant labor pressures at this time that's going to impact our revenue. We have a
keynote right now with the [ DEO ] and the mandate and how that's changing very dynamic situation
there as well as keeping an eye on our supply chain to see how the material flows here. But it's just timing
right now as we see the outlook. And as I said, it's still in the range that we gave you at the beginning of
the year.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And what is the percent of the workforce that's currently vaccinated? And if there were
pervasions, is it covered in your contracts because it's a new requirements being placed upon you?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Right. Myles, this is Mike. Right now, we're, I'd say, roughly around 75%. We've seen a tremendous
uptick in the last 30 days in folks getting the vaccine. I think the breaking news right now, it looks like the
executive orders being moved out into January and the -- and they're talking about having your shot by
January, not completely through the quarantine. So we're going to have to interpret how all of that plays
out.

We're working very closely with our customers on how do you implement the executive order. I mean
the executive order is -- we've been -- we have been -- from a policy standpoint, we have been directly
aligned with what the White House put out. But as you -- as you kind of hinted out there, the executive
order is not contractual. And so working with our customers on all of our contracts to figure out how best
to implement that executive orders, what we're doing, and we're doing that across the board. So we're
continuing to move ahead. Our ambition is to get as many of our employees vaccinated as we possibly can
because we are committed to a safe workplace, and we think that's the best way to do it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Douglas Stuart Harned
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Right now, you're in the transition on Virginia-class from Block IV to Block V. Could you comment on how
Block V looks in terms of the amount of content you have on that? And how would you describe any risks
in the transition relative to the one you did when you moved to Block IV?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll start and then let Chris pick it up. The transition -- when we kicked off Block IV, the contract
took quite a while to negotiate that contract. And we -- and as a result, there was some late material
procurement that kind of helped us get off to a rocky start relative to that program as well as the ramp-up
in production. So we had a lot of things moving -- a lot of parts moving on the beginning of Block IV. We
don't have any of those partners moving at the beginning of Block V And so we're -- the transition for us
is moving basically seamlessly from Block IV into Block V. Pretty excited about that and pretty optimistic
about where that's going to go.

Christopher D. Kastner
Former Executive VP & COO

Yes. No, I think that's right. And when you think through VCS and Block IV, getting back to a cadence
where we're floating off one boat a year and delivering one boat a year and then transitioning that
workforce right into Block V makes great sense. So we have high hopes for performance on Block V
because of the lessons we're learning through Block IV when you get to a 2 per year sort of cadence.

Douglas Stuart Harned
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

And then also on submarines, you commented this time that your services revenues were down a little
bit. Can you comment on where the 3 Los Angeles class ships stand in their process? And how you see
services revenues at Newport News trending over the next couple of years here?

Christopher D. Kastner
Former Executive VP & COO

Sure. So Helena will -- this is Chris, Doug. Helena will deliver this year. Columbus is in process and moving
through the cycle in their contract and then Boise is really in their prompt start period. So we're going to
get into a place here. And I think in communication with our customer where it makes great sense to have
sort of a consistent stream work and revenue, it probably will not be as high as it's been going forward,
and we need to create that plan with our customer. But that's the status of the 3 that are in Newport News
now. And as I said, we're working with a customer to ensure we have a steady cadence of repair activity
going forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.

Seth Michael Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to start off. I think you mentioned a bit earlier that you were looking to finalize the single-phase
delivery agreement for the carrier with the Navy either late this year or early in 1Q. I guess can you tell
us, is there any kind of margin or cash impact that you should think about once that's finalized?

Christopher D. Kastner
Former Executive VP & COO

Yes. Yes, Seth, this is Chris. We will definitize that, if not this year, beginning of next, don't anticipate a
significant margin, cash impact. It's obviously an increase in the top line for that ship, but it also extends

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

the risk retirement events out a couple of years because of extensive test program. So nothing significant
from -- or material from a sales margin or cash impact at this point.

Seth Michael Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then, I mean, it seems like it's mostly a timing issue, but just wanted to ask about
the cash flow guidance increase this year. Should we think about that increasing your kind of 5-year
expectation? Or is it mainly having to do with the timing of when those progress payments go back to the
government?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Seth, yes, it's Tom here. Yes, The progress payments is the predominance of the change that we have
right now. Obviously, another quarter with risk retirement, and we have actual -- through Q3, we have
a line of sight for the end of the year. But predominantly, the change there was because of the progress
payments is not going to -- kept into the 2022 time frame. Keep in mind too at year-end, we have to pay
back half of the payroll by the tax that we did not pay in 2020. So that's baked into the numbers. So it's
timing. And within the [ $3.2 billion ], it still holds.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

I was wondering if you could give us just some more color maybe just following up on Myles' question
about what's going on in your supply chain? Where you're seeing some material shortages? And is it just
being driven by delays in transportation or what is it?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes, it's Tom here. I'll take that one. So we've had this conversation on the last couple of calls, and
we're watching that intently. I regularly touch base with the supply chain offices that we have at each of
the yards, some of to be exactly on where they stand right now. As we've given in the past, because of
the nature of our long-term contracts, long-term material orders that start ahead of the construction of
these contracts. And then obviously, with the backlog that we have to spend on contract, and we have line
of sight of the work that's going to be performed in the yards. A significant amount of those requirements
have already been put on order, and we're managing them aggressively to make sure that the material
flows in and it hits the [ in-yard need dates ]. The preponderance of the material is coming in on time and
meeting the contractual needs that we have within the yard.

I would tell you that recently, the last 3 to 6 months that as we have spot orders, what we're seeing is
a little bit of volatility in pricing and the validity dates are shrinking a little bit on things that we have to
spot by. But from a perspective of execution of the existing contracts we have, we don't see a significant
impact at this time. Obviously, we're watching how the [ DEO ] mandate impacts the supply chain. And
the pressures that we do hear our second and third tier who are dependent on the raw materials. So
copper cabling, things of that nature. But again, as you stand here today, the supply chain that we need
because of how we've contracted that work in advance has us maintaining schedule at this time.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Got it. Got it. All right. And then on the Technical Services business, if we just open up the aperture
a little bit and think about when we walk out 2, 3, 4 years from now, where do you see the margin in that

most companies don't do. So I'm not asking for that. But just if you can put a little framework around how
we should think about the margin in that business as we think longer term.

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So because of how we put that division together with the acquisitions, the purchase intangibles
and things of that nature, if you noticed we've been guiding and driving towards an EBITDA relationship
against the performance and where we see. You've noticed from the announcement we had in the July
time frame and then with the Alion close in August, we've guided you on how that was going to cause a
lift there. From a RCOH perspective, we were at 4% to 5%. We dialed in from an EBITDA perspective to
be in the 8% to 10% range by 2024. Both the initial guidance we gave you in the July timeframe of Alion
supported that. As we sit today after the close in August, and now we've closed the quarter with Alion
cranked into our financials, they're hovering on the low end of the range right now. So that's good news
because that's more than 50% of that portfolio.

And I think kind of going forward, as we see those purchase intangibles get burned off in the next 3, 4,
5 years going forward, obviously, that's going to be an improvement. I would tell you that the [ PI ] is
baked into the ROS, although the ROS even for this quarter at TSD is 2.6%, with $8 million of purchased
intangibles. When you roll that out, it's a 5.3% ROS quarter and the EBITDA is at 7.7% right now. So
that's a new term perspective and how I see it kind of evolving in the out years.

Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

I guess you had mentioned that the margin in shipbuilding in Q4 will be similar to Q3 because some items
moved to Q3. Can you just list what moved to Q3? And I thought you mentioned some might have moved
to Q1 or so of next year. So what do we expect in Q2 -- in Q4 for incentives versus what we had thought
before?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

George, it's Tom here. Yes, I'll take that. So just a couple of moving parts there. We kind of guided in Q2
going into Q3 would be light and Q4 would be a little bit heavier than that. We have pulled a couple of
incentives, Newport News on the RCOH 173 to the left as well as at Ingalls, taking DDG 121 to trials was a
risk retirement evaluation and event. So just a couple of moving parts there from Q3 to Q4. But we're still
in the lane there of the 7.5%, 8% ROS that we gave you for shipbuilding for year-end. I didn't mention
anything moving into next year in my remarks. We do have LPD 28 moving or staying on contract in the
beginning of 2022.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Okay. And then just a separate one probably more for Mike. I noticed that Newport News, you got like the
Union contract with affecting 50% of the workers up in November here now. So if you could kind of give
us what you think about the status there? I mean, it's -- I guess it's more in the news given the contract
we've all seen end of the year.

Christopher D. Kastner
Former Executive VP & COO

George, I'll start. This is Chris. We're in process with the Newport News Union working through that
contract. We have a very good relationship with them. And I fully expect we can come to a reasonable
agreement on a contract. I know Mike ran Newport News for a while. So he probably has -- for a long

time, actually, he probably has better comments on that. But we're working with them every day to try to
get to a resolution.

C. Michael Petters

We pride ourselves on having very constructive relationships with our labor partners, and I don't think this
will be any different than that.

Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Research.

Richard Tobie Safran
Seaport Research Partners

So on the Navy's new destroyer cruiser class, the ship doesn't appear to be slated to rise until very late
in the decade. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that represents a bit of a slide to the right in terms of
schedule. Could you discuss a time line for competition? And following up on your opening remarks, I'm
wondering how you think that, that the Navy strategy with the new ship now impacts by the new flight of
DDG 51s. Since the new ship isn't arriving now for close to 10 years down the line, I'm thinking that really
reinforces the idea of a new flight of DDGs, but that's my view. I was wondering what you think of that.

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

It's Mike. I don't think you're too far off there, just in general. I think general principles are, it's really
hard to pin down the development path and time line for a new program like this, this early in the process.
They're trying to work through how do they fund the design, how they fund the project, when are they
going to have it? What are the requirements going to be? That's a pretty dynamic thing. And so trying to
pin that down precisely is a bit of a challenge.

And our general view is that you don't really want to stop production of a line until you're ready to move
to a mature design product going forward. So as that product matures, it will interact. The construction
work that's going on, on the DDGs today, the Flight III ships will -- my -- we certainly will advocate and
believe that the best prudent course ahead will be to continue to build Flight IIIs until that design is
maturing and you're ready to go into production on that. And if that happens to be 20 something else,
then it's 20 something else and then we'll be ready.

As far as the competition for that goes, that will just lay in. As that program matures, we'll get more
visibility into what the competition, when it might be, what it would look like and that sort of thing. I
think it would be a mistake, though, for there to be any sort of curtailment in the destroyer program,
anticipating some kind of maturation path. We kind of went down that path in a couple of programs during
my career. We've done that with submarines. We did that actually with DDGs and trying to transition over
to the 1,000s and then transition back. So we had a gap in the destroyer program. Our industry is full
of people who have seen gaps in production become tremendous problems for restart of production. So
let's keep the production line moving. And when the production line -- when they decided to turn off the
transition, we will transition it.

Richard Tobie Safran
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. And more general, I thought you could talk a little bit about efficiency initiatives. A while back, we
had things like digital transformation, but I thought you might discuss efforts to reduce cost. And in your
answer, maybe you could talk about how much that might contribute to margin improvement and the
objective of eventually getting to 9% margins?

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Yes. Richard, this is Chris. Yes, I won't discuss the contribution to the margin rate and when we expect to
get to 9%, we'll talk a lot more about that on the year-end call. But the capital investments we've made
and the technology investments we've made both at Ingalls and Newport News are going very well. In
the most simple form at Ingalls getting all the work under cover, really drives efficiency if you've ever
been in Mississippi in August. And then the digital shipbuilding products are becoming more mature and
helping the manufacturing of CVN 80 and the Columbia-class. So we're very encouraged by the technology
investments and the capital investments we've made and we hope to continue to drive cost out of our
products.

Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.

Peter John Skibitski
Alembic Global Advisors

Just a follow-on to Seth's question on the Kennedy. Chris, I think you said you're going to get the contract
definitization that's going to maybe move the risk registers to the right a little bit. I just want to make
sure I'm in line with -- I think I've been assuming that the Kennedy retirement opportunities -- risk
retirement opportunities will be 2022, 2023. Is that still the case? Or have they shifted to the right at '24
or '25. I just want to level set that.

Christopher D. Kastner
Former Executive VP & COO

No, no, '23 and '24 make a lot of sense. We're really in volume when it comes to 79 right now, getting 2
compartments and work packages, starting localized testing but it's '23, '24 time frame.

Peter John Skibitski
Alembic Global Advisors

Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And maybe one for you, Mike. I always like to ask, any hope left on -- with
NSC 12, it seems like all the committees have reported. I wasn't sure if anyone stuck in any language or
funding at all with regard to that?

C. Michael Petters
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think you're reading that right. We are -- we have a great product line there, and we're very
excited about what we've done. But right now, there's -- in the contest for resources, it's not faring very
well. So we'll probably just leave it at that.

Peter John Skibitski
Alembic Global Advisors

Yes, the coast guard always seems to come up short. I know. It's too bad.

Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about Alion. I think when you announced the deal, you talked about $1.6 billion in kind
of annualized revenue. Based on what you did in the quarter and when you're applying for the year-end,
it would seem like either it's running well below that? Or you're expecting big growth in '22. Can you just
comment on that?

Thomas E. Stiehle

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Sure, yes. It's Tom here. So for the quarter, I think in my remarks, you'll see $163 million in Q3 is from
Alion's perspective. You kind of run that out for another quarter, for Q4 that's the run rate, a little over
$300 million there. So collectively, it's about $450 million. On an annualized basis, that's like [ $1.4
billion ] and change, right? And then to get to the [$160 million], the growth rate of a little bit higher
than 11.5%, 12%. So that's the math of it. Right now, we still stand by the guidance that we provided
in the July time frame. We're coming through our annual plans this time of the year right now and
[indiscernible] draft, and we're working ourselves through Executive Management Board. We still stand by
those projections of $1.6 billion in revenue and the $135 million of adjusted EBITDA.

Christopher D. Kastner
Former Executive VP & COO

David, this is Chris. I'd also add that the integration of the front end of that business has gone very well
in business development and capture. We have a $60 billion total pipeline that we're working through and
prioritizing a number of significant competition over the next 12 to 18 months and a book-to-bill at 1.8 in
the quarter. So all indications are positive for that business.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. As a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the -- Tom, the long-term free cash flow profile. Obviously,
you're sticking with the $3.2 billion. I think previously, you had said that '22, '23, '24, that time frame
would be fairly -- free cash flow over that period would be fairly ratable across those years. Is that still the
view? Or is there -- is it going to ramp during that period?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So as we said, the $3.2 billion is still good, right? We have $757 million behind us. I've given you the
outlook for this year, that's about $1.1 billion and that leaves $2.1 billion last over the last 3 years. So
straight math would be about $700 million. We do have next year, as I mentioned, we have to pay back
the FICA payment, that's $66 million. We have the progress payment that have to be paid back at around
$160 million. So you can do some math on that, but there is a ramp to it. So between those 2 payments
and just a slight ramp, I mean you can just model those 3 years out, but we still feel it's comfortable and
it's appropriate to guide to $3.2 billion over these 5 years.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Tom, just with these outside of the normal course of business items, supply chain, logistics, material
labor, and then also combining that with the -- with how the growth compares shake out? Should we be
thinking of next year the shipbuilding growth rate being fairly back-end loaded versus the first half? And
then just following up on that Alion discussion there, are you seeing -- we've seen those headwinds across
hardware. And outside of hardware, are you seeing some of those same challenges outside of the business
in Alion or not as much?

Thomas E. Stiehle
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So for the first part, from a shipbuilding perspective, I highlighted a little bit earlier, I didn't hit the
backlog piece of the outlook, right? So unlike, say, requiring the new awards or funding, we have a line of
sight of the work that we have in-house. So I look at it from an outlook perspective from shipbuilding, still
the 3% CAGR is good. I would tell you that although it looks like we're at the same point we were through
the first 3 quarters of this year compared to last year, last year was an exceptional year, '19 to -- '18 to
'19 with a 6% growth and then '19 to '20 was another 6% growth. And even specifically, Q4 last year, was
a 19% growth over the quarter previously there.

HUNTINGTON INGALLS INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

So some material, as I highlighted -- actually, Chris highlighted, moved into the end of Q4 of 2020 and
made that year look kind of big, which now makes 2021 look flat. So I'm not concerned right now because
we have the backlog. We have the work. We have the labor force right now. We are watching material,
as I said, and we're watching [ DEO ] mandate impacts our workforce. But I don't -- I'm not concerned
with how 2021 is shaking out from a revenue perspective. And I would think kind of going forward that it's
pretty linear in 2022 for shipbuilding.

Relative to your Alion question, I don't see, obviously, their contracts are different, more service oriented.
We're excited with them on board. Andy's put his leadership team in play. As Chris had mentioned earlier,
the initial assessments that we had going into the purchase and now to close, we've had a good 6 weeks
run rate in the financial that look under the hood there. So we're comfortable with what's in front of them,
the items that they're bidding and how they're executing on the existing contracts.

We're evaluating the revenue synergies between Alion making us better, the DFS and MDIS and vice
versa. So I feel comfortable with that going forward there. I don't see today again, the [ DEO ] mandate
significantly impacting our revenue expectations from Alion perspective. We have highlighted from a TSD
perspective. We're eager to watch the funding come about and the unmanned portfolio evolving growth
kind of going forward, so that's a watch on for us.

You made that request, Mike, so...

C. Michael Petters

Yes, I've already turned it down a couple of times. But Dwayne and his family, they've been parts of our
family here for 37 years. His personal support for all of us here at Huntington -- throughout his career,
but especially in his last position here, had just been extraordinary. So you call today to harass Dwayne
about the filing or the call, just remember, he's a short timer now. And so he might have some leverage in
that call. So with that, we wish Dwayne and his family well, and we wish them all the best as they move
forward with the next chapter of their lives. And with that, we appreciate your interest in HII, and we
welcome your continued engagement and your feedback. Thank you very much.
