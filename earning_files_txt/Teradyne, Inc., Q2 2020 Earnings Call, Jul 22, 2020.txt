TERADYNE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2020 Teradyne, Inc. Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.

Andrew J. Blanchard
Vice President of Corporate Relations

Thank you, Vincent. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent
financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; and CFO, Sanjay Mehta.

Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2020's second quarter, along
with our outlook for the third quarter of 2020. The press release containing our second quarter results was
issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you
in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.

The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that
could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage
you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC
filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation
to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make
reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-
GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure,
where available, on the website of our -- on the Investor page of the website.

Also, please take special note of the safe harbor statement in the press release and slide deck for risks
related to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes to U.S. export regulations. Looking ahead between now
and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor
conferences hosted by KeyBanc, Citibank and Deutsche Bank.

Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results and the
market conditions, including comments on the COVID-19 pandemic and expanded trade regulations.
Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the third quarter.
We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour. Mark?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and the first half of
2020, comment on the impact of current environmental conditions, including new trade regulations and
then describe our view of the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the
quarter and our guidance for Q3.

Despite the pandemic, trade issues and shutdown-related headwinds in industrial automation, Teradyne
is performing exceptionally well. In the second quarter -- our second quarter results affirm the trend of
growing test intensity and the efficiency of our business model. As you can see from our Q3 guidance,
the market demand remains robust. While Q2 saw record SOC shipments, 3Q is being driven by growth
in memory test and system-level test. Industrial Automation continues to pull out of the effects of global
industrial shutdowns as we saw sequential monthly growth in sales throughout second quarter. We expect
second quarter to be the bottom for IA and 3Q sales to be back close to 2019 levels.

Superb execution by the global Teradyne team was on full display in second quarter, as we managed
to deliver new shipment records and test. Supply line constraints were largely mitigated and remote

TERADYNE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

technical collaboration with -- both within Teradyne and with our customers continues to show success. It
takes dozens to hundreds of engineers working in concert to develop new test products. It takes similar
numbers working with customers to launch test programs for new silicon. Flipping a switch to do this
remotely without missing a beat is a fantastic accomplishment, and I congratulate and thank all the
employees of Teradyne for this achievement.

On the trade front, new regulations related to both Huawei and China military end users were announced
in the second quarter. We expect the China military end user restrictions to increase our compliance
work and costs, but we currently do not expect any material impact on our sales into China. In the case
of Huawei, while the new regulations do not impose any new restrictions on our business with Huawei
directly, we expect it will likely impact our business with subcon customers who test Huawei devices
using our test equipment. However, we expect the macro global test demand to be minimally impacted
as alternative sources of silicon supply grow to fill in whatever gap is created by these regulations. This
alternative supply should absorb any idled test capacity as well as drive new demand in the future.

Shifting to the highlights. As we reach the midpoint of the year, our January forecast for $3.1 billion to
$3.4 billion SOC test market is playing out about as planned, while our memory test market estimate has
moved up to about $800 million to $850 million. In SOC, our sales grew 60% in the first half and 82%
compared to 2Q of 2019, as our participation in this year's mobility tooling cycle is significantly stronger
than in the last 2 years. As expected, 5G infrastructure-related capacity add remains weak after a strong
2019, while handset-related silicon is driving the bulk of the demand. While 5G-related silicon is beginning
to add a small piece to the mobility handset market, the vast majority of the test demand is complexity
growth in non-5G-related handset silicon. Whether related to high-resolution still or video photography,
artificial intelligence, augmented reality, gaming, location sensing or advanced wireless connectivity, there
is a rich set of features in addition to 5G that we expect will continue to drive mobility demand for the
foreseeable future. Specific to 5G, we are still in the early innings of a multiyear rollout and expect it to be
an incremental demand driver going forward. Additionally, our new UltraFLEXplus platform will continue
ramping in 3Q, providing new revenue sources in mobility and computing going forward.

Beyond mobility, the Automotive and Industrial segments of the SOC test market remain weak, and we
do not expect to see recovery until 2021. In memory, our 2Q sales were about flat with Q1, but up 45%
from Q2 of 2019. Flash package test and DRAM wafer test, combined with ramping shipments of LPDDR5
package testers drove Q2 results. DRAM test is growing faster than flash test in 2020 due to the LPDDR5
transition, and our design win in DRAM should allow us to hold our share position in the low 40s this year.

In the System Test group, sales were up 43% for the first half compared to 2019, due to strong storage
test demand. We expect storage test shipments to grow sequentially and substantially in Q3, driven
by both HDD demand and semiconductor at system-level test shipments. System-level test is a great
example of derivative products, opening new markets for Teradyne. By combining silicon test instruments
with our HDD test product, we've grown the combined sales from $60 million in 2017 to over $200 million
this year.

At LitePoint, sales were up 32% for the first half and 19% compared with 2Q of '19. Demand is being
driven by WiFi 6 and growing shipments of 5G test sets. WiFi 6 has recently been allocated additional
frequency spectrum in the 6 to 7 gigahertz range. Testing this expanded standard, called WiFi 6E, will
require new testers, which we expect will be a positive force in 2021 and beyond.

Moving to Industrial Automation. The environment is mixed, but improving. At UR, the biggest unit of
our IA segment, sales in Q2 contracted 32%, compared with the same period last year. Manufacturing
shutdowns in Europe and North America had a significant impact on UR. MiR sales, on the other hand,
grew 7% from last year's Q2 level, as they benefited from exposure to health care and mobile disinfectant
markets. AutoGuide, our newest IA business, saw sales more than double from the same 2Q period last
year. Overall, IA sales for the first half were down 15% from 2019. We have seen positive indications of
improvement as we move through second quarter. For example, all 3 businesses had sequential monthly
sales growth across Q2 as customers began to reopen. While we expect IA demand will improve in the
third quarter, we don't expect to return to year-on-year growth until Q4 or Q1. Our longer-term growth

5

TERADYNE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

outlook for IA remains unchanged at 20% to 35%. Social distancing and the need for more resilient
manufacturing flow should add additional drivers for our collaborative automation products.

Our R&D and distribution investments in the IA business continue, as these macro dividend slowdowns
provide opportunities to widen our competitive lead. We continue to add distributors in the second quarter,
expanded our UR+ table of certified plug-and-play products to over 250 items. We also introduced UR+
applications, moving to complete solutions for specific customer requirements like industrial bin-picking
and welding. Stepping back to look at the full year, at the company level, our latest estimates have
revenue front half loaded at about 54% to 55%. This is similar to what we experienced in 2016 and '17
when we saw especially strong investments for smartphone test capacity.

In summary, first half of the year showed Teradyne's strength in familiar test markets and demonstrated
our ability to grow in new ones with differentiated products and exemplary execution. Our business model
is efficient and driving the planned drop-through on incremental sales. Our investments to broaden our
competitive moats in IA amidst a global industrial downturn showed the value of Teradyne's financial
strength in these nascent industrial automation markets. While our short-term visibility remains limited,
we are confident that our long-term strategy will continue to deliver outstanding results for our customers,
employees and investors.

Now I'll turn things over to Sanjay for additional color and the financial details.

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review how the pandemic is impacting us
from a financial and supply line management perspective. I will then summarize our Q2 financial results
and Q3 outlook.

Our priorities remain consistent during coronavirus pandemic: safety of our employees; supporting our
customers; and crisp execution to achieve our financial objectives. In line with my Q1 earnings call
remarks, I want to acknowledge the continued challenges of our employees, customers, suppliers and
their families going through during this pandemic.

From a financial point of view, Teradyne is stronger than ever. We generated $178 million of free cash
flow in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and
no short-term debt. During the quarter, we established a $400 million revolving line of credit for added
security against future uncertainty and opportunities. The strength of our balance sheet, business model
and business execution enabled us to put the revolver in place during a very uncertain time. Our long-
term debt is a $460 million face value convert, which matures in December of 2023.

From an operations perspective, our team and partners have done a great job so far this year. Over many
years, Teradyne has built a global supply line management team second to none, and the value of that
team has never been more evident. COVID-related supply line issues did not have a material impact on
our revenues in Q2. Our combined teams produced the highest number of UltraFLEX systems ever in the
second quarter, ramped new products in SOC, memory and across our IA businesses, all, while operating
in a very challenging environment. This included overcoming numerous parts and labor shortages, along
with logistical constraints. In one case, a shortage of scheduled air cargo capacity led us to charter a
dedicated 747 to deliver, quite literally, a plane load of testers to a customer to ensure timely delivery.
While operationally executing very well, we continue to take a critical view of how to strengthen our
supply chain operations. We have identified potential weaknesses and are taking actions to strengthen our
operations further.

The short-term COVID-19-related actions, along with these long-term actions, have a small impact on
margins. While the operations team clearly shined in the quarter, they were not alone. I'd also like to
extend thanks to the entire organization from HR to facilities and environmental health, to engineering,
repair services, finance, legal, our global field and applications teams, which collectively allowed us to
meet our delivery commitments, our revolver, introduce new products, maintain our R&D programs and

run the company safely and productively with a combination of at-home and on-site staffing. Well done.
Very well done.

Now on to the details of the quarter. Revenue in Q2 was $839 million, up 49% from Q2 of 2019 and
up 46% for the first half of the year. Q2 revenue was 5% above the high end of the range, driven by
accelerated shipments in SOC test. Also, while IA contracted year-over-year, IA revenue was higher-than-
expected in Q2.

Semi Test revenue was $659 million, up 76% from a year ago, driven by: one, SOC revenue was $575
million, up 82% from a year ago on broad strength in mobility; and two, memory revenue of $85 million,
up 45% from a year ago, due to continued strength in flash test and ramp up of our Magnum EPIC
solution for DRAM.

In System Test, revenues were $72 million, which included storage test shipments of $36 million, which
were down sequentially, but up 6% from Q2 of 2019. Recall, our Storage Test business tends to have
lumpy shipments. First half Storage Test revenue was up 106% over the first half of 2019 on strength in
both system-level test and HDD product lines. Growth in SLT was driven primarily by processor demand,
while HDD shipments were driven by strong exabyte growth for hard drives.

LitePoint revenue was $49 million in the quarter, up 19% from Q2 of 2019 on 5G, WiFi 6 and next-
generation WiFi 6E demand. In Industrial Automation, revenue was $59 million, down 21% from Q2 of
2019 due to the coronavirus and down 3% from Q1 '20, but above our plan entering the quarter. UR
contributed $43 million of revenue, MiR $11 million, AG and Energid made up the remainder. We believe in
our IA segment, revenue bottomed out in Q2 and is on the road to sequential growth in Q3. We had one
10% customer in the quarter. As a reminder, we disclose customers who contribute 10% or more of full
year company revenue in our annual 10-K.

Non-GAAP gross margins in the quarter were 56.2%, down 130 basis points from Q2 of 2019 as
forecasted. Margins reflect the impact of concentrated mobility shipments in Semi Test and the added
logistics and operations costs due to the pandemic. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up $11 million
to $207 million from Q1, due to company performance causing higher variable compensation. Inventory
increased to $206 million to support Q3 shipments and buffer against potential COVID-related supply
disruptions. DSO in the quarter increased to 75 days due to the timing of shipments in the quarter. Non-
GAAP operating margin was 31.5% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.33, both are tracking ahead of our 2022
model.

Tax rate in Q2 of '20 was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.1% on a non-GAAP basis. Our full year GAAP tax
rate is expected to be 14%, down from our prior estimate of 14.5%. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is
expected to be 14.5%, down from our prior estimate of 15%. The decrease in tax rate is due to product
mix. We generated $178 million in free cash flow in Q2. We paid $17 million in dividends in the quarter.
We bought back 173,000 shares for $9.4 million at an average price of $54.49 in the first few days of the
quarter. As noted in April, we suspended our share repurchase program as of April 1. We look at our share
repurchase and the entire capital allocation program regularly and we'll update you next quarter.

Looking ahead at Q3, revenues will include a significant ramp in shipments of our new UltraFLEXplus
SOC test system supporting recent design wins. In memory, we expect continued strong momentum for
our Magnum product line for flash and DRAM applications. LPDDR5 test shipments are expected to grow
significantly in Q3. In our System Test group, storage test demand, driven by system-level test and hard
disk drive markets, continue to see end market demand exceeding our expectations for the year. While
this business fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, Q3 is expected to more than double the Q2 level. I'll
also note that while we expect multiple waves of 5G-related demand for both handsets and infrastructure
in the years ahead, we are not planning on significant infrastructure test shipments in the second half
like we experienced in 2019. As a result, we expect to revert back to pre-2019 pattern of lower Q4 SOC
shipments.

In Industrial Automation, we are seeing incremental improvements in UR's business. As the U.S. and
Europe start to open up, we are seeing signs of increased momentum in quarter-over-quarter. Recall, the
U.S. and Europe typically represent greater than 70% of UR's revenue. MiR continues to execute, and in

TERADYNE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

the first half of the year, grew by 4% year-over-year, driven by ultraviolet light disinfectant demand. In
Q3, we are guiding a revenue range of $745 million to $805 million and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 to $1.17
on $175 million of diluted shares. The ranges reflect continued coronavirus supply risks and potential
impact on end market demand. The guidance exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles and
noncash imputed interest on convertible debt. In April, we previewed expected gross margin headwinds in
the second half of 2020 due to new product ramps. While the ramps continue as planned, our latest view
is that the impact will be less severe than earlier expected. Q3 gross margins will be 55% to 56%. We
expect to be back to historical gross margin levels in 2021.

In Q3, operating expenses are expected to be 26% to 28% of sales and are on track with our revised
April full year plan to grow 7% to 8% from 2019. The operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter
guidance is 29%. CapEx investments year-to-date are $84 million, and we expect full year investments
will total approximately $175 million. We're investing more in CapEx this year to support new product
rollouts, strengthening our supply chain and new facility projects.

To summarize, we closed out Q2 with outstanding financial and operational performance in a difficult
working environment. We entered Q3 with a bright outlook on the strength of new product ramps and an
Industrial Automation market that is showing signs of early improvement. While our visibility is limited
and we're not immune to macroeconomic shocks, I'm confident that we have the products, people and
processes to thrive in the quarters ahead.

With that, I'll turn things back to Andy.

Andrew J. Blanchard
Vice President of Corporate Relations
Thanks, Sanjay. Vincent, we'd now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to
one question and a follow-up.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Yes, 2 questions. First, I want to better understand how to think about the earning power? I think it was 2
quarters ago that you highlighted a $3.50 to $4.25 earnings by 2022. And your recent execution suggests
that you're already at that run rate. And my question to you is given the share gains in memory and other
areas, do you think there is an upside to that earnings scenario that you laid out 6 months ago or perhaps
a $4 earning is sustainable and it shouldn't be viewed as a onetime event? And my follow-up question has
to do with China. How much of a revenue contribution did China provide?

Andrew J. Blanchard
Vice President of Corporate Relations

It's Andrew here. Yes, I think, this year, we'll come close or be in the range of hitting our earnings model
of 2022, and -- on the top line and the bottom line. And obviously, there's many puts and takes relative
to what we published in the earnings model, specifically strength in Semi Test and Storage business,
offsetting the near-term impacts of COVID in the IA portfolio. What we'll plan on doing is, in January,
updating that earnings model and provide guidance for the future then.

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

And I think just -- I'll add, Mehdi, that as you know very well, we have a very volatile market that we play
in. And so to sustain linear growth throughout a decade is not the kind of business we're in. But the trend
lines, we do believe, support certainly reaching and exceeding that mid-term earning model. That in no
way is going to be a peak for Teradyne.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Great. Congrats. And then just quickly on China. What's the revenue contribution of China?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

So in the quarter, China was about 12.5% of revenue.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Congratulations on the strong results and the execution. Mark, you have brought up the test intensity
factor a few times, but we honestly do not know how to put that in our model. When I look at your
SOC test business, it's up, I think, on track for over 30% growth, but overall phone volumes are down,
according to TSMC, in mid-teens, even though the 5G part has been relatively strong. So how do you
quantify this test intensity factor per unit? Is there a 5G versus 4G comparison? And importantly, how will
this test intensity factor evolve as you go into 2021? Will it be 5% better or 10% better? How do we size
that? Because without knowing that, it's very difficult to size what your SOC sales will do going forward.

TERADYNE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Yes. I appreciate the difficulty because if we had a formula, believe me, we would be using it and
advertising it. But I do think what we've said is when we look at the big, big picture, we see that the
growth in transistors is what drives complexity and that over an average trend line gives us test growth,
market growth, in that 6% to 8% range.

Now there's many puts and takes that go on every year. It depends if people are making a major
transition from a node -- like a 7- to 5-nanometer node, that enables more transistors and typically has
lower yields that come with it. So it's very lumpy year-to-year and very hard to model year-to-year. But
the net effects, when you look back historically for the past 5 to 7 years and at our projections, are that
sort of 6% to 8% trend line growth for test. So I don't think anything is changing in that, but it's not going
to be smooth. It's going to be lumpy. And the other thing is -- that affects this, if you look at this year,
for example, the market, the market for SOC test is really flat with last year. It's about a 3 -- and we said
$3.1 billion to $3.4 billion market. And the underlying economic effects of what's going on in the world and
cellphone unit declines and such as all -- and automotive being off and industrial being off is netting out to
a flat market.

Teradyne, on the other hand, is obviously picking up a lot of market share this year. That's both good
news and bad news. I think the bad news is we'd love to see the market grow every year. But in a very
difficult macro year like this, the fact that it's holding its own despite the weaknesses in the pockets I just
mentioned is encouraging. And then we expect as we come out of this pandemic and the global economy
start growing again, those markets will continue to grow along those trend lines. So I wish I had the
formula, I don't, but I think the evidence is sort of speaking for itself.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And for my follow-up, Mark, when I look at, again, on the business, as it relates to 5G, could you
give us a sense for how much of your business is infrastructure versus handsets? And as part of that, let's
say, if 5G handsets triple next year, right, what does that do to your SOC test business intensity being
same or better? Does it mean your tester business will triple? Or how do we -- give us some sense for how
we kind of try and correlate your -- the growth prospects to the number of 5G handsets and the demand
for infrastructure?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So 5G is a piece of a phone. It's -- the silicon-related to 5G in a phone is one part of a phone.
So there's no way that tripling of 5G triples our tester business. But to give you some sense, the
infrastructure piece of 5G was very robust last year. And we talked about it all year long, and you saw
that our business level grew towards the back end of the year due to infrastructure investments. And
then we talked about the fact that those investments would taper off in 2020, which they have. And what
would come into the market would be handset-related growth. But we're still talking about -- and we've
also said 5G, in aggregate, should add to our test business somewhere between $400 million to $500
million of market. And at Teradyne, that's 50% of the market, that should add, let's say, $250-ish-million
to Teradyne's business, and when it's peaking. But we're not peaking. We're not near peaking. This year,
we're maybe a couple of hundred million dollars into that $500 million envelope. So that will give you
the sort of calibration on how much you might think 5G could mean to us over the next 4 to 5 years on
an annual basis. When we get to that mature $500 million level, hopefully, we're running at that $250-
million-plus or minus additional revenue level.

Next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel.

Brian Edward Chin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

industry-specific factors contributing to your 50%, 60% year-over-year, year-to-date growth rate in Semi

Test. However, do you think a layer of this growth could reflect your customers or customers' customers
attempt to put some inventory in place, be it wafer, chip or even end device to safeguard against future
supply chain and demand uncertainties? I would appreciate any thoughts.

Yes. It's Sanjay. So we do a lot of work in trying to triangulate our shipments and trying to understand
utilization and inventory levels of testers out there. And I think what you saw in 2019, as Mark articulated
earlier, was a buildup of infrastructure test tooling, and which kind of build the capacity so they can have
a run rate. From an end market and inventory perspective, we're not seeing tester inventory build. We're
always on the lookout for it and concerned about it. But our -- from the analysis we've done, we actually
don't see that inventory buildup.

Brian Edward Chin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And you're talking more about the equipment versus further downstream in terms of that activity?

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

Yes. Mainly from the tester equipment, it's very hard from an end market perspective, be it smartphone or
industrial or automotive to think about those inventories.

Brian Edward Chin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Sure. Okay. Yes. I was kind of geared at more further downstream, but I appreciate the commentary.
Maybe one last one. I know you're not guiding fourth quarter per se here, but based on your 54%, I
think, to 55% first half weighted revenue comment, does that roughly suggest 4Q sales would be down
something like 30%, 35% sequential? And do you -- would you expect Semi Test sales to decline at a
similar or higher or lower rate?

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

Yes. We're effectively guiding down 35% to 40% versus Q3 mid…

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I think, what we -- when you do the math, it is exactly what you just did. And now the decomposition
of the various businesses in that, there's a lot still influx. So IA tends to be up in the fourth quarter, and
we expect that will continue. So I think that last year was atypical with the strong semiconductor. So I
think if you looked at prior years, you get essentially the same kind of mix.

The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations on the solid results. Mark, you said in your kind of prepared comments that as the next
wave of Huawei bands come into effect, you don't see much of an impact to global test capacity as other
suppliers fill the void. I'm just kind of curious, and I know it's a little bit of a guessing game. When you
look at the potential suppliers to fill that void, how does your share with those suppliers look vis-à-vis
Huawei? And I guess, importantly, do you think the test capacity that's out there just gets repurposed for
these different suppliers or do you think it might actually cause some incremental buying?

President, CEO & Director

Well, I think, over the long haul, meaning, let's say, a year, I don't think there's going to be -- I think
they'll be repurposed, and there could be incremental buying early on. We're in a period right now where
the testers are still very full up being used through this September 15 date until we get past the sort of
grace period and into the embargo. So post that period of time, there could be some spot buying because
they're not completely fungible. But over time, they'll work their way into the supply and demand balance.
So there's no long-term consequence here that we see. And our share position in the alternative sources
of supply, it's -- some are better, some are a little lower, but I think when we've analyzed it overall, I
think, we're neutral. We don't see that we're going to be overly benefited or a detriment because of the
shift in who's going to make the silicon for those products.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And then, Mark, just going back to the implied guidance for the calendar fourth quarter, that kind of
implied sequential decline is not without precedence in your business model. If I go back to like the 2012,
'13, 14 period, you saw that kind of fall off in Q4. But I'm just kind of curious, given how uncertain the
environment is today, is that your attempt at a conservative placeholder? Or do you actually have visibility
out to the December quarter that informs kind of that view of a 55%, 45% half-on-half split?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Yes. What I would say is that if even more recently you looked at 2016 and '17, one of the differences
we're seeing right now is that those are also heavy tooling years for smartphones for us. We saw pretty
significant drops from Q2 to Q3 in those years, maybe on the order of 20% to 25%, followed by another
5% to 7% in Q4. So this year, instead of a 2Q to 3Q drop, we're kind of seeing it all come in Q4, is our
forecast. Our visibility is actually quite limited out there. We -- obviously, when you look at what we've
been doing this year and if you followed us a long time, there's quite a bit of variability in the out quarter
in terms of what might materialize. So we don't have a lot of backlog that extends out that far and what
will actually happen, there's quite a wide range around it. But it's based on the modeling we can do, the
customer conversations we're having and those kind of things.

Next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi.

Atif Malik
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Mark, can you talk about the timing of the millimeter wave opportunity when you expect the infrastructure
part of the investments to evolve and also on the mobility side?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Millimeter wave, frankly, I think, is quite a ways off from being a big part of the infrastructure and
then subsequently handset story. It's a big test intensive event when it occurs. But it's likely -- none
of the geographies are moving aggressively with millimeter wave. In the U.S., there's some boutique
deployments, I would say, in urban areas and some high-density areas. But what it appears most of
the U.S. carriers are going to do is roll out sub-6G in some flavor first and then slowly move towards
millimeter wave. So our view is, there certainly will be handsets at the premium tier that have that
capability to run on those scarce networks and there'll be some bump, and we've seen it already this
year. Our millimeter wave shipments of test equipment at both LitePoint and Semi Test are tens and tens
of millions of dollars. So it's not insignificant even if the miniscule volumes we're talking about. But it's
probably not until 2022, '23 before it starts to matter would be my estimate.

Great. And then you talked about design wins in computing, which is a relatively new area for you guys
with UltraFLEXplus. We've also heard that one of your customers' customers moving to ARM-based
CPUs for their notebooks. And those CPUs have much larger die size than the apps processor using
smartphones. So how do you look at your computing share gain opportunity over the next 12 to 18
months?

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

It's Sanjay here. So the compute market is roughly annually $500 million to $600 million, and our share
has been roughly 30%, give or take, historically. Our new UltraFLEXplus product will help us grow that
share and this initial design win will help along that journey. So that's how we're thinking about it in the
near term.

Next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. Mark, I wanted to ask about your System Test business, both on the HDD
side as well as the SLT side. In terms of your HDD business, you've been speaking to this business and
the strength there for a couple of quarters now. How are you thinking about sustainability of that strength
into, I guess, Q4 since you're guiding up Q3? And on the SLT side, your nearest competitor here, I guess,
they've been pretty vocal about this specific application as well over the past couple of quarters. How are
you sizing the opportunity in SLT? And how should we think about your competitive position relative to not
just Advantest, but also some of the other players that play here? And then I have a follow-up.

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

The whole storage test business, whether it's HDD or SLT, has been a tremendous story and it surprised
us, and it seems as though the sustainability of it is pretty robust. It doesn't mean it's not volatile. Even
in this year, you can see that quarter-to-quarter, we can swing on shipments 20%, 30% a quarter. So
it's quarter-to-quarter volatile. But the overall underlying demand is very strong for both HDD and SLT.
The SLT side of it, as we described before, it's still somewhat of a nascent market. This is an additional
test step that some high-volume -- manufacturers of some high-volume digital-centric devices are using
to further reduce defects, defects per million. And the economics of this insertion are something that
both customers and equipment suppliers, like ourselves and others, are working to try to make more
attractive for other classes of devices, lower volume devices, more mixed-signal with RF and analog
content and such. So how -- the rate of adoption of SLT is just a big unknown in this. But even with the
limited adoption that exists today, you can see that from last year when the early adoption occurred
outside of compute, which it's been doing this for quite some time, it's grown to be pretty significant.
It might be a $300 million tester market, something like that this year. And we're probably splitting it
roughly 50-50 or so with Advantest in just sort of the test area. So I do think it's got legs. I do think that
the underlying complexity issues we're talking about compel these additional test steps in the very high
end of complex devices. And so it's going to be a growth industry. It's going to be volatile though. And
until we get a dozen customers adopting this wildly, you're likely to see these quarter-to-quarter and year-
to-year fluctuations that we've seen up till now.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the Industrial Automation business and how you're
thinking about the long-term growth profile there? I think in your prepared remarks, you reiterated your
long-term growth target. But curious, just given COVID-19 and the potential impact it could have on how
your customers and customers' customers think about their factory footprint, I guess, could this drive a

significant increase in adoption rates of things like UR cobots and MiR robots or is it a little early to make
that call?

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

Yes. It's Sanjay here. So I think over -- since 2015, we have experienced significant growth in UR than
adding MiR in 2018 and then as well as AutoGuide in 2019. And that growth we expected to continue in
2020. Obviously, COVID hit. And we're looking at potentially a contraction year depending on how the
market shakes out in the second half. However, our belief is that we're going to continue over the long
run to grow at the 20% to 35%, as Mark stated in his prepared remarks. And really, I think that you
consider over the short term, I think, there's going to need to be a balance of getting people back to
work versus Industrial Automation. However, in the business development activities, we're seeing a lot
of activity in this -- plant managers and decision-makers are looking to harden their production lines and
social business. So we are seeing activity even in the short term. I think in the long term, it will provide
a tailwind. However, we're still in the mid-term, around the 20% to 35% growth, and we still continue to
invest in product differentiation and application differentiation in those businesses.

Next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess first question in your prepared remarks, I just want to double check here. I think I heard you say
that System Test would double from $72 million in Q2 into Q3, is that correct? And as part of that, can
you give us an idea of where we should be thinking about the growth balancing Storage versus traditional
System Test?

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

Yes. You're right. I did say that we would double and more than doubled in Q3, but it was off a baseline of
$36 million in Storage.

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Storage.

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

Yes, in Storage.

Sanjay Mehta

Correct.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then I guess as my follow-up question, thinking through the SOC market, it looks like
your share is probably going from 40% to low 50s year-on-year. And I guess I was hoping for you to
parse through the drivers there. Obviously, mix plays a role. And you do have your largest customer

turning on. They're also bringing on ARM-based processors, I believe, embedded AI that really helps you
guys. You have new UltraFLEXplus. And then you talked 5G being only a minimal driver. So amidst that
backdrop, what are the key drivers of that share shift? And more importantly, how should we think about
the sustainability of that share looking into 2021?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

So you're right. We think probably our share in SOC moves up around 50% this year. And much of it, the
majority of it, is due to the shift of who's buying. So in the last couple of years, our share kind of came
down. It wasn't customers defecting. It was who was buying. And this year, the biggest piece of the 10-
point-or-so share gain in SOC will be opposite effect of our customers are buying more. However, there's
also this component. We've talked about the UltraFLEXplus and the design wins we've had in mobility and
compute. Those are going to in the back half of the year and add additional new revenue streams for us.
And so we are picking up real customers, too, on this. So that's not insignificant and that won't completely
mature in 2020. It's going to be more of the beginning. And so that will grow throughout 2021 and 2022.

So we do have a lot of headroom to continue to move our share north of 50% based on those design
wins, other ones in the pipeline. But as you know, the underlying sort of core buying will fluctuate year-
to-year. So if you go back to '16 and '17, we had some very big years of tooling for our customers around
smartphone silicon. '18 and '19 was a bit down. We picked up new business in infrastructure to sort of
offset part of that. Now we come back. It's gangbusters. And that could persist for a while. But it's going
to still be volatile, I'm sure. But riding on top of that is this little new wedge of new revenue streams in
SOC based on real design wins that gives us that ability to keep, on average, moving our share north. And
we've talked about long term, getting to 60% share of this market is reasonable. Once you're past 60%,
that will be a little bit more difficult, perhaps, but 60% is certainly within a line of sight.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

First of all, I wanted to get what the 5G portion of the SOC TAM is this year? Let's say, you're saying $3.1
billion to $3.4 billion, I'm just wondering how much of that is 5G? And then I have another one.

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we struggle to estimate that one precisely. But again, what I -- I'll just give you the context and
give you my best guess of the numbers. So we've said that, at peak, 5G should represent about a $400
million adder to SOC test and about $100 million adder to LitePoint test. So of that SOC $400 million max
envelope, this year, 5G is probably somewhere in the $200-ish-million range for a TAM.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. And for Wireless, Mark, there's -- I mean, how much of the Wireless piece is coming in?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Yes. In Wireless, the $100 million -- and we've actually seen that Wireless may grow to be a bit bigger
than $100 million adder. It could be $150 million adder or so. But this year, the Wireless is probably in that
-- this is production test, not R&D test, but it's probably in that $70 million -- $60 million to $70 million
range for the market.

TERADYNE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2020

Got it. Okay. Awesome. And then I just wanted to follow-up on the last question. So I mean there's a lot of
stuff going on beyond your big customer, and certainly, you have the UltraFLEXplus ramping. But usually,
I mean, a significant portion will -- say, of your share gain this year, you're going to gain 13, 14 points a
share, is because your big customers are having an on year. And usually, they don't have 2 straight on
years. So I'm just sort of wondering, if you strip away all the other stuff going on and you look at how
sustainable that low 50% shares into next year? Why would it be different this time where they would
have 2 straight big on years versus history where they'd had one on year and then they've had an off
year?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think history is interesting in this. If you look at 2016 and '17, actually, our smartphone-related
business was pretty flat and consistent and high. Those were peak years in the past, and it was 2
successive years. So I think the on/off, on/off pattern goes back to the earlier part of the decade. But I
think '16 and '17 are equally valid thoughts and models around that. So that's one thought. It doesn't
necessarily mean up and down. But at some point, it's not going to be -- what's norm in baseline, I think,
is a judgment. But I'd go back to that sort of trend line of the market. We expect to grow 6% to 7%. So
if the SOC market this year is, again, let's say, $3.3 billion, nominally, we're talking about a market that
should be $3.4 billion, $3.5 billion, everything else being equal next year. So I do think we can have 2
sequential strong years because we've had them in the past, and there's nothing wrong with that. Plus, we
have these new design wins coming online that haven't matured yet.

And then the thing we haven't talked about that's out there is memory. Memory is having a pretty strong
year this year. And if you look into 2021, the 2021 era is going to see this large shift from DDR4 to DDR5.
This year, we're at the very early innings of the LPDDR5 shift for more mobile devices. But the DDR5 shift
is coming. And as we've said, that obsoletes the installed base of DRAM test equipment for final test. So
there's a big retooling coming there as well.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I had 2 of them. First one, Mark, to just follow-up on your comments from the previous question. You said
a couple of sequential growth years. It looks like you had like from an SOC test market standpoint, they're
like 5 years of continuous growth. So I'm kind of curious. I understand the test intensity is going up and
5G seems to be a longer and a stronger cycle. So if going forward, should a $3-plus billion be a decent
bogey to use for the SOC market size? And I have a follow-up.

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Bogey, I think, is a -- so let me just add a few more comments about where we are. So you're right. We've
seen the market show sequential annual growth for quite some length of time here. This year, it's maybe
going to be about flat, but it may show a 4% or 5% growth as well by the time the year is over. And that's
absent any real interesting participation of automotive and industrial buying. This is heavy, heavy mobility.
And it's also in the midst of a pandemic, and it's also in the midst of all the regulations coming in around
China. So I'll go back and say, I would model in a 6% to 8% TAM growth rate for SOC over the midterm, 4
to 5 years. That is what we should be tracking at.

Krish Sankar
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, Mark, can you just tell us how much of your revenue
was from LPDDR5? And when I look at your memory market side, you're talking about $800 million to
$850 million. 6 months ago, it's more like $650 million to $750 million. Clearly, the upside is coming

from DRAM. So I'm just trying to figure out, on the market size, how much of the upside is coming from
LPDDR5? And within that, how much of your revenue is coming from LPDDR5?

Mark E. Jagiela
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'm not going to break out our LPDDR5 revenue. But I will say that the increase in the market size is
both flash and DRAM. It's about 2/3 DRAM and 1/3 flash, compared to our estimate in January. So we are
seeing upside on flash, too. And much of the upside in DRAM is related to LPDDR5. So you would expect
-- and because our share is kind of going to be flat, you can derive a close estimate of maybe how much
revenue is coming out of that for us this year. And we're working on design wins to hopefully capture more
of the DRAM market. We just introduced that product in Q4 last year, and we're ramping it this year. So
that's what gives us upside going into next year, we think, around DDR5. And we talked in earlier calls
about our sort of 40% to 45% market share that we have. Should -- with the products we have today and
the competitive position we have today, we should be able to move that into the 50%, low 50% range
here in the next couple of years, if we really execute well. So that's what we're focused on and planning.

Operator

Next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Just a couple of questions. I'm just going to kind of focus for a second or 2 on the IA business. Could you
talk about how the business progressed? You talked perhaps a little bit about some upside in the quarter
here relative to your expectations. But could you talk maybe geographically what you're seeing in IA
around Universal Robots? And maybe just discuss any successes you might have. You talked about some
self-help initiatives around distribution and around some new product applications coming to market. So
maybe just provide a little bit of color on there because it seems like that business has at least stabilized if
not maybe getting back to its growth mode.

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

It's Sanjay here. So I'll talk a little bit about kind of the geo and kind of monthly profile. So for UR, when
I take a look at China, first to go into COVID and first to kind of come out. And when we take a look at
kind of the monthly profile, we saw improvement in March. And then sequentially, we saw improvement
throughout the quarter. And really kind of coming back strong. And when we take a look at not back
to last year's levels, but improving Q2 over Q1 and based on the forecast, we see that improvement
continuing. But when we take that recipe of opening up and we look at the data and look at the U.S. and
Europe, which is over 70% of the historical UR business, we're very encouraged. And so we are seeing
business development activities. We are seeing growth coming. But really, the baseline is China and the
business activity in the U.S. as well as Europe.

And from a product perspective, from the applications, we're continuing to invest. We recently have
launched in April our ActiNav for bin picking, and we continue to drive for ease of implementation activities
and really growing the ecosystem.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And at that -- just as a follow-up, at that $59 million revenue for IA in the quarter, how did you manage --
again, if I do the math quickly, and your gross margin is still hanging out in the high 50s, maybe to 60%,
how did you manage the OpEx in the quarter for IA? And was that -- how far from profitability were we in
the quarter?

Yes. So I think I mentioned earlier in 2019, we were profitable. And our full year plan in 2020 pre-COVID
was a heavy investment year in IA, both on the engineering side as well as the go-to-market side. And
we still plan an IA to be profitable at similar levels in 2020. COVID hits, and then you -- we're faced with
the situation of not having the revenue growth. So we metered down a lot of the go-to-market spends.
And that was a significant reduction. However, we continued forward with the engineering and application
spends significantly. So what you're seeing in the immediate short term, aside from kind of the revectoring
that we did in metering down kind of the selling and marketing or go-to-market spending is you're seeing
more and more online marketing, more and more virtual trade shows, et cetera, and kind of restricted
travel, obviously. So you're seeing a short-term reduction in selling and marketing spends. However, you
are seeing a little bit of travel and those types of costs within the engineering ranks, but we're continuing
to significantly invest on that front.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And as far as that's close to profitability?

Sanjay Mehta
CFO, VP & Treasurer

We are -- I don't believe in 2020, we will -- it's very uncertain depending on the revenue levels in the back
half of the year, but we're teetering on it. It just really depends on the top line. But we are -- I want to
reiterate that we are encouraged by the activity of Q3 and as well as the ramp-up of China for UR in Q2,
and we expect that to continue.
