Thank you Tim and good morning everyone
Today, I’ll cover a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance
We’re committed to transform our Company to a brand-centric organization, leading a great franchise system
This journey began back in late 2014 when we got behind a set of strategic actions design to invigorate growth and increase profitability
Since then, we’ve been advancing on our path to deliver greater long-term sustainable value to our shareowners, associates, partners and stakeholders
We simplified our organizational structure for speed and flexibility
We’re driving aggressive productivity
We're redeploying more and better marketing
We're driving revenues through segmented growth strategies, and embarking also on the biggest refranchising in bottler restructuring in our history
2016 was a critical year as we continue to make strong progress in transforming our Company while keeping focus on our consumers
We continued to gain momentum in building revenue growth through segmented market roles and disciplined brand investments
Since launching our incremental media investment plan in early 2014, our core business has accelerated top-line performance even with slowing macroeconomic growth
We strengthened our brands and portfolios through better and more marketing innovation and targeted acquisitions
We brought to market more than 500 new products, nearly 400 of which were tea, juices, coffees, waters or other still beverages
We generated over $600 million in productivity for a three-year total of over $1.7 billion, taking a balanced approach in investing in our brands, while leveraging our P&L in 2016. Finally, we continued to strengthen our bottling system
The world's largely independent Coca-Cola bottler based on revenue, Coca-Cola European partners began operations in a market that represents one of our most valuable profit centers
We signed definitive agreements to sell our bottling businesses in China, and we expect to close these transactions during the first half of 2017. Our two largest bottlers in Japan and Greek emerged, which will create a single bottler covering roughly 85% of our system's volume in Japan that’s a very important profit tool again
We successfully helped to create Cola-Cola Beverages Africa, and we're now working to transition ownership to ABI to a strong partner of our choice
Finally, we've made substantial progress refranchising our North America bottling operations
At the same time, the North America business has flourished throughout this process, delivering top-tier FMCG performance with mid-single digit organic revenue growth in each of the past two years
Taking together, half of our system revenue has been in motion through these actions
We accomplished a lot and built a very strong and purposeful foundation for the future
Now, it's time to write the next chapter in our growth story with the appointment of James Quincey as our next CEO
I have every confidence in James and our management team
And throughout his career, James has shown insightful leadership in addressing the changing consumer environment by expanding product offerings, and most recently, driving systematic portfolio reformulation through reduced added sugar with hundreds of initiatives in progress
He's absolutely the right leader at the right time
James is well prepared to deliver the next level value creation
He knows that in order to deliver robust and sustainable value creation for shareowners will also need to create value for all of our stakeholders
I'm excited about what's ahead for our Company and for our system, and James will have my full and vigorous support as I continue to serve as Chairman of the Board
Now, I’ll hand over the call to James who will take you through our operating performance in 2016, as well as provide thoughts on our performance this coming year
A - James Quincey Thank you
Good morning everyone
Thanks Muthar
And it will be an honor and a privilege to succeed you as Chief Executive
This is the pivotal time of change by Company, our system and our industry
We’re seeing consumer preferences evolve, technology and ecommerce transform the retail landscape, and of course, ongoing volatile global economic conditions
And the actions we’ve taken over the past few years have set a strong foundation for our Company, and I look forward to steering us through our next phase of growth
I will take you through some of the house when we present at CAGNY in a couple of weeks
So today, let me just cover a few topics; our top line performance for the quarter; a summary of our actions and performance for the whole year; and a little on our expectations for 2017. Then I’ll hand the call to Kathy to walk you through some additional financial details
So, let's start with our top line performance in the fourth quarter
Here, we delivered good organic revenue growth, even allowing for the fact that quarter had two extra days
Clearly, this was driven by 6% price mix, while volume didn’t grow
Mostly, this is a result of what we plan for and expected with a couple of twists
Firstly, those things we expected included our continuing focus on momentum in our developed country markets; for example, North America, which had another very strong quarter; and also, we expected to cycle negative price mix from last year in Asia Pacific, producing a strong number this year
Things we saw occur in the quarter and responded to included; for example, India, where demonetization impacted the whole CTG landscape; our system responded quickly by facilitating digital payments; extending credit to mitigate destocking; and increasing our emphasis on the modern trade
Also, macro conditions worsened in Brazil
Here we chose not to drive poor value promotions to over-protect volume, but focus instead on more fundamentally resetting the price package architecture to support affordability, and this will take some time to fully implement
These not only hit our consolidated volume but in curious way mechanically improved our price mix as well
Now, clearly 6 points of price mix is a one-off and it's not our destination, nor is a 1% decline in volume
So, rather than focus just on the quarter, let's look at the full year results, which I believe are better indicator of how we think about the full year success in '16 and going forward into '17. For the full year 2016, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, a mixed more challenging macro conditions than we expected
At core being the Company that will exist after the refranchising, our core business grew organic revenue by 4%, and we gained NARTD value share
Given the refranchising of our Company-owned bottling businesses, we look at this core business as an important indicator of the longer term trajectory of our top line, and remained encourage that we are growing the core in line with our long-term revenue target, even if at the bottom end
Finally, we expanded our operating margin through strong price mix and by balancing over $600 million in productivity with disciplined investments given the overall macro-environment in 2016. These actions enabled us to grow comparable currency neutral structural income before tax by 8% at the high-end of the target range we laid out at the beginning of the year
Now, I for some texture on 2016, I’ll touch on a few of our operations around the world
We performed well in certain key markets
We took action in others those needed, and managed through some other difficult operating conditions
Our developed country markets performed well as we continue to execute against that strategy of transforming the system, investing in good marketing and better execution
In North America, we saw all elements of this strategy come together, resulting in 4% revenue growth; Japan and Mexico, both performed well; and in Western Europe, increased investments coupled with a new reinvigorated bottling partner brought good results there
Our developing and emerging markets saw more of a mix bag of performance
Markets like Nigeria and Pakistan performed very strongly
China, which began the year with a pretty challenging situation, but through a combination of adjusted strategies focused on the consumer, our performance is improved as we moved into the back half of the year
A few markets face significant challenges; Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and they impacted our overall results
There, we focused on the basics like the example I gave on packaging in Brazil
Turning and looking forward to 2017. We expect another year of volatility around the world
I don't need to tell you about the rapid changes taking place at geopolitical and macro level, and how this will bring continued challenges and yet also opportunities across the portfolio
Some markets will get better and some will get worse
But net-net, we see the overall environment to be similar as we did to 2016. Historically, our approach has been to grow the consumer franchise in each local market by driving consumer incidence; effectively the number of consumers enjoying our grounds; value share and transactions; and to deliver locally, against our comparable currency neutral profit targets
So, while we are pleased with our underlying trajectory, our comparable EPS has not grown over last several years
So, going forward, if currency swings, our balancing out overtime currency neutral result to be a proxy to U.S
dollar growth, then we must adapt
So, importantly, we are intensifying our focus on delivering comparable EPS growth each year
We won't sacrifice the long-term health of the business, but we need to better balance investing to grow the business with delivering earnings growth in an environment like this
So starting with 2017, even in the face of strengthening dollar, higher tax and interest rates, we expect to grow comparable EPS before the impact of our M&A transactions; 2017 particularly those due to refranchising
So, while the refranchising effect in 2017 is meaningful, it ultimately has laid the foundation for accelerated growth
And as you read in our release, this becomes a much less significant factor to overall growth as we move into 2018 and beyond
Now, to deliver all that, it starts with revenue growth and then getting the operating leverage rise
Revenue growth will be built through a consumer-centric ground portfolio; by scaling in regions where we have leadership positions, like U.S
and Japan; expanding successful brands globally; and continuing to execute bolt-on M&A and partnerships
So, for example, we launched smartwater and Honest Tea in Western Europe in the past year, and plan to further expand in 2017. In the U.S
, our investment in fairlife milk is paying-off
It captured over one-third of the retail bottler growth in value-added dairy during second year on the markets
And of course, sparkling soft drinks remain a key focus, as well in the principle categories in which we compete
Within our sparkling soft drink portfolio, we are reshaping our growth equations to continue to drive revenue growth, building over the revenue growth we delivered in 2017. We'll do this through a continued mix of great marketing, great execution combined with helping reducing over-consumption of added sugar
This includes the reformulated products to reduce content, leveraging our one-brand strategy to expand zero sugar products, and driving the availability of small packs
All of this we’re approaching with a mindset of test and learn, knowing that not every strategy will work in every market but the speed, flexibility and adaptation are paramount to success
I look forward to sharing more of what we’re doing at CAGNY
So, in summary; we’re going to make the right decisions for the business and for our shareholders; looking out for the consumer franchise; tasking the local operations to grow locally; and managing across the portfolio and the levers of our business to deliver comparable EPS growth
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Kathy to take you through our outlook
Couple of thoughts there, I mean, over the long-term we said we’re looking for a balance between price and volume, well price mix and volume
And that’s certainly our long-term objective
Now, given what’s happening, I think it's almost as we said it's easier to divide the world into the developed and the emerging market
In the developed countries, we’re looking to drive probably a little more price than volume, and you can see that happening in the U.S
marketplace as we focus on smaller packages, as we focus on higher value categories or sub categories
So you see that across North America, Western Europe is a little more balanced, and similarly into Japan
So, that’s our approach for the developed market
In the emerging markets, obviously over the long-term, we expect them to be a bigger source of underlying volume growth, and that will bring the total Company equation into balance
So they would be more volume driven and less price-driven
Now, what’s happening is in some of the markets, say for example Brazil where the micros are really under pressure, I mean, GDP over the last three years in Brazil has probably declined by more than it did in the great recession over the last decade of the 80s
So, there what we focus on is in any moment that we will do those promotional things that make sense and return
So, we don’t over-protect volume, we do what make sense on a quarterly or a monthly basis
And the principle access we act on is trying to reform the packaging strategy to make it more affordable
Whether that’d be small or one-way packaging or more returnable packages backed up by good marketing that really emphasizes with the economic situation, the consumers that are in and obviously great execution by the bottling system
So net-net, likely overtime, developed markets will push, will get more price mix and slightly less volume
And in emerging markets, more volume and slightly price mix with that caveat that those markets that struggled, we have a game plan that we’ve developed over the years and that we find helps us really build a good strong consumer franchise going forward and balances the short-term
Well, I think you saw lots of flow-through actually in the fourth quarter
Operating income currency neutral structure was up 18% after gross profit of 8, so there was 10 points of leverage
So, we got a lot of leverage coming through
The reason I didn't translate from operating income to PBT is more about other factors, like interest or other corporate items
So, the underlying operation, actually when I talk about PBT growing at 8% in '16 and what we've guided in '17, actually the underlying operating income performance is actually even better than that
And then we've got a bit of a headwind in interest in some of those other items
So, there’s actually a lot of leverage coming through from the operation as we focus on segmented revenue, as we focus on higher value category, as we focus on smaller packages, we're getting a lot of operating leverage between that revenue line and the operating income line
Some of it's getting that is often a headwind
So it is there, in the fourth quarter
Just to make the point, 6% is not projectable going forward
You will see in the numbers, for example, we were recycling a big negative in Asia Pacific from last year, so we've got big positive this year
We have some very good results and improvements where we own bottling operations, like China, which was very much richer in the first half
So there is some oddities in the fourth quarter
I would encourage everyone to look at maybe the full year '16, look through to the core operation where we were growing 4%, 8% PBT, bear in mind the interest headwinds at the higher operating income growth, lots of leverage
This is the game plan for 2017.
I’ll start, may be and then Kathy, if you feel like jumping in it, let me know
The 2017, 3%, I think we see a similar year in 2017 in terms of micros that we did in '16. And I think we’re making a prudent call that given everything that’s going on in the world, on a consolidated basis, we’re expecting a similar outlook and a similar number for the total Company
Obviously, as Kathy said, we’d like to see the core business grow above that as we did in 2016, where the consolidated was 3% and the core was 4%, which is the bottom end of our range and then that obviously lots of operating leverage
So, that’s how we’re seeing, and we just see the way the world is going
In terms of 2018, obviously, we’re not providing guidance on 2018. We’re just providing some of the elements that we know are important from a modeling perspective
So, obviously, 2018 conversation will have to wait
But we wanted people to understand the structural pace, because obviously the timing of when we sell those transactions makes a big difference
And so as timing varies, the structural adjustment can move backwards and forwards between 2018. So we just wanted to give people a total perspective
I don’t know Kathy about number three
I am not sure we have the thing in front of us, Ali
So, firstly, the aggregate amount of marketing spend is slightly below gross profit, you are correct
Now, what is super important to know within that is we will continue to increase what we would call working spend of the marketing ahead of revenue, but we are driving material productivity in the way we organize and produce the marketing to become much more efficient
So, we are able to grow media, if you like, in all its different forms ahead of revenue
But with the extra productivity initiatives, we are actually growing total spend less than revenue, that's how that dynamic is working
So, we'll be out to do much more in the marketplace in a more efficient way
And then secondly on Coke Zero Sugar, absolutely you should expect this to move around the world things that are successful, and that had a great start in GB in the backend of 2016 was growing double-digits, very good start
We're rolling out in Europe
It just launched in Australia
So, you can absolutely expect this to push it into those markets where we think it can be really effective, including Latin America soon, so absolutely
And I think that is part of why you're now seeing the continued acceleration of Coke Zero Sugar each year
We grew several points faster in volume in '15 than '14, and we grew several points faster in '16 than with the rate we were growing in '15. And as I said, aggregate no calorie colas, is in good mid-single digits growth as we exited the year
Thanks James, Kathy and Tim
Last year, we made significant progress as we accelerated the transformation of our Company into a higher margin business, while keeping focus on consumers
With the strong foundation set now is a time for a seamless leadership transition
And I have every confidence that James is the best person to take us through the next phase of our sustainable growth
There is no question that this phase will look different than the past driven by a broad consumer-centric portfolio across all categories, while enabling consumers to control their intakes of added sugar
And this is going to require a change to some of our strategies, many of which have already begun and now need further scale in regions all around the world
As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our Company and for joining us this morning
