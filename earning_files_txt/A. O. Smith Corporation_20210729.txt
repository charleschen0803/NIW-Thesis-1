Presentation

Operator

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 A. O. Smith Earnings Call.
[Operator Instructions]

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Patricia Ackerman. Thank you.
Please go ahead, ma'am.

Patricia K. Ackerman
Senior VP of Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability and Treasurer

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the A.O. Smith Second Quarter Results Conference
Call. I am Pat Ackerman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Responsibility and
Sustainability and Treasurer.

Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief
Financial Officer.

Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will
be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be
materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's
press release. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on Slide 3.

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everybody. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered second quarter
EPS of $0.73 on a 30% increase in sales, demonstrating solid execution and operational agility despite
supply chain and logistic challenges, along with rapidly rising material costs. I am thankful for my fellow
A.O. Smith employees who tirelessly navigated through the pandemic, followed by weather-related
production disruptions and continue to navigate supply chain constraints. I appreciate the creativity and
the collaboration of our team to find solutions to keep our customers supply with water heating and water
treatment products.

Boiler sales grew 35%, driven by strong demand as a result of completed projects carried over from
2020 as well as an active education end market. For reference, our boiler sales were down 15% in the
second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. North America water treatment
grew 17%, driven by continued consumer demand for home improvement products which provide safe
drinking water in the home. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well in the quarter and online
promotional shopping days also boosted sales.

Consistent with our strategy to build out distribution for North America water treatment, we acquired
Master Water Conditioning Corporation. The acquisition supplements our presence in the Northeast, and
we are excited to add expertise in local water condition and solutions in this region to our family. Our
North America water treatment sales, including this acquisition are expected to be over $200 million in
2021.

Our volumes of U.S. tank residential water heaters increased in the second quarter. We believe the strong
demand is a continued result of extended lead times caused by production constraints due to strain in the
supply chain, buying in advance of price increases and incremental new home construction.

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

After our weather-related disruptions in production, which we talked about on our first quarter call, we
have seen month-over-month sequential improvement, and certain of our suppliers recently noted they
see moderation of demand and supply imbalances. But we remain vigilant as the imbalances are spotty,
and we expect supply chain challenges to be with us through the remainder of the year.

In response to continued material and logistic cost increases, we recently announced a fourth price
increase of between 10% and 12% effective August 1. In China, sales increased over 26% in local
currency, driven by growth in each of our major product categories, including electric and gas tankless
water heaters and water treatment products, including commercial and replacement filters.

I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the second quarter beginning on
Slide 4.

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Kevin. Record second quarter sales of $860 million increased 30% compared with 2020, which
was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second quarter net earnings increased 74% to $118 million or
$0.73 per share compared with $68 million or $0.42 per share in 2020.

Please turn to Slide 5. Sales in the North America segment of $604 million increased 26% compared
with the second quarter of 2020, driven by higher volumes of water heaters, boilers and water treatment
products and inflation-related price increases. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased
39% from the second quarter of 2020. Growth in each of our major product categories in China
contributed to local currency growth of 26% in the quarter. Currency translation of China sales favorably
impacted sales by approximately $20 million.

India sales more than doubled in the second quarter despite the recent surge in cases of the virus in that
region. North America segment earnings of $142 million increased 34% compared with the second quarter
of 2020. The impact to earnings from higher volumes and inflation-related price increases was partially
offset by higher material and freight costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating margin of
23.5% improved compared with the second quarter of 2020 segment margin of 21.9%.

Rest of the World segment earnings of $22 million increased significantly compared with the loss of
$5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by shutdowns and reduced
consumer spending resulting from the pandemic. In China, higher volumes and lower selling and
administrative costs were partially offset by the absence of social insurance waivers, which were received
in 2020. As a result, segment operating margin of 8.5% improved from a negative 3% in the second
quarter of 2020.

Our corporate expenses of $12 million were higher than last year largely due to management incentives.
Our effective tax rate of 21.9% was essentially the same as last year.

Please turn to Slide 7. Cash provided by operations of $196 million during the first half was higher than
during the first half of 2020. Higher earnings in 2021 compared with the prior year were partially offset
by a larger investment in working capital during the first half of 2021 compared with the same period
in 2020. Our cash balances totaled $582 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $476
million. Our leverage ratio was 5.5%, as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of June.
Through June 30, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of common stock for a total of $198
million.

Please turn to Slide 8. We upgraded our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.70
and $2.76 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 5% compared with our prior
quarter full year guidance. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $500 million and
$525 million compared with $560 million in 2020. We expect higher earnings in 2021 will be more than
offset by higher investments in working capital than in the prior year. Our 2021 capital spending plans
are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to
be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50
million, similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be approximately 23% in 2021.

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumed $400 million worth of shares are repurchased
in 2021.

I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 9.
Kevin?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Our businesses continue to navigate through supply chain and logistic challenges. That being said, we
raised our 2021 top line growth expectation and now project an increase of between 17% and 18%, driven
by strong demand and price increases implemented in response to rising material and transportation
costs.

Our revenue outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. With 7 months of visibility, we've
upgraded our U.S. residential water heater industry volume forecast to increase approximately 3%
compared with last year. We expect continued resilient replacement demand and growth in new home
construction. With our fourth price increase in the market and continued consumer demand, we no longer
believe there will be channel inventory destocking in the back half of the year. We expect commercial
industry water heater volumes will increase approximately 2% as pandemic-impacted businesses reopen
and new production and replacement installations come back online. We believe the demand we saw in the
last few months was partially driven by a pre-buy activity in advance of the price increases.

In China, it is encouraging to see sales of our products continue to remain strong. Our strategy to continue
to expand distribution to Tier 4 through 6 cities is on track. We see improvement in consumer trends
towards trading up for higher-priced products across all of our product categories driven by differentiated
new products launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency
sales between 20% and 22% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels,
adding approximately $51 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively.

Boiler sales grew 24% in the first half of 2021. The comparison will be tougher in the back half of the year,
and we expect boiler sales will grow by low double digits for the full year compared with last year. We
project 13% to 14% full year sales growth in North America water treatment. We believe the megatrends
of healthy and safe drinking water as well as reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive
consumer demand for our point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems. We project margins in
this business to grow by 100 basis points, above the nearly 10% achieved in 2020.

We continue to experience inflation across our supply channel, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel
has increased 23% since our third water heater price increase became effective on June 1. We announced
a fourth price increase in late June on water heaters effective August 1 at the rate between 10% and 12%.
We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.75% and 23%. And Rest of World segment
margins to be approximately 8%.

Our procurement and operation team faced continued challenges in the second quarter. And while we
expect continued headwinds in supply chain and logistics throughout the remainder of the year, these
challenges are moderating, and I have confidence in our team to continue to navigate through this difficult
environment.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer.

Bryan Francis Blair
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

The momentum in your boiler sales is very encouraging. You called out strong trends in the education
vertical. I was wondering if there's any concern about the sustainability of project activity there. Counter
our read on the incremental funding that's coming through. Just looking at the 12% growth in Q1,
mid-30s lift Q2, the full year guide implies quite a bit of moderation in the back half.

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Well, I think we had a very strong first half of the year. And again, as we mentioned, the back half is a bit
tougher comp. There's always challenges with COVID-19 and the variance out there and, of course, labor
and so forth. But overall, again, job activity has remained healthy. Recent nonresidential ABI data was
positive in June, up I think 57% from 50%. And our July had -- we had a solid July. We don't see really
anything becoming an issue. But again, in this environment, there's all those things that could pop up and
be a bit spotty for us.

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean I guess the only other thing I would add is that it was an easy comp in Q2 last year, and we
did do a residential early buy program that we pushed back because of the pandemic last year into Q3
that got pulled into Q2, which is normal. That's the normal cadence of when we do that. And that helped a
little bit on the volume.

Bryan Francis Blair
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I appreciate the color there. And to clarify, does the outlook for 13%, 14% North American water
treatment growth include Master Water contribution?

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

No, it's organic growth of 13% to 14%. We framed kind of the North America water treatment at around
$200 million, I think before we were talking about approaching $200 million. So with the acquisition at the
half year, it gets just over $200 million.

Bryan Francis Blair
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Excellent. Anything you can offer on margin contribution from that business, and importantly, additional
color on what the asset adds to technology footprint, channel presence? You mentioned expanding into the
Northeast, which is important. But any other color you can offer on strategic impact would be great.

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Yes, I'll take the strategic impact. This is part of our strategy to improve our footprint across North
America and build up that distribution. The water quality dealer is a bit different than, say, our wholesale
business that buys truckloads of 200 water heaters that are -- on a regular basis. Water quality dealers
will buy pallets for and get couple of palletable product. It's really important that we have these

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

distribution points, and this is a start with Master Water, so that we can improve our service levels,
delivering 24 hours of smaller clients, and do them in an effective and productive way. So this is an
important first step in kind of building out that framework that we need to be successful in the water
quality side of our business.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

So I have a couple of questions. Hopefully, you can answer them all. I know of each of the price increases.
Would you say that you're trending toward the middle, higher end of the ranges that you've given in the
past?

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

I guess, Scott, we just kind of look at the 4 together. And when we accumulate the 4 and get to the fourth
quarter, the fourth one will be effective. We'll start seeing that in the fourth quarter. We're at about a 40%
increase -- price increase on the water heating side.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then are we looking at similar type of price increases for boilers?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Not similar. Boilers are, for the most part -- a lot of our projects are quoted. And we are taking steps to
adjust our quotes to adjust for the cost. So we have taken steps, but it's not as formal as our residential
that of commercial business. But we are taking steps, and quite frankly, we're taking steps across globally
of all of our businesses to adjust for the inflationary cost that we've been impacted by and continue to be
impacted by.

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean let me just add a little color to the water heating side because that 40% is specific to water
heating. And as you know, steel is the major part of water heating cost for us. There's other costs,
including freight and filament and so forth, but steel is the largest part. So when we kind of look at the
cadence of the cost through the year, into the fourth quarter, we're going to be -- and we have good
visibility into the fourth quarter because, as you know, we've got 90- to 100-day visibility forward on what
we're going to be paying for steel. Our cost Q4 year-over-year is going to be 2.5 to 3x higher on just steel
alone. So I just want to kind of frame that. The other businesses outside of water heating certainly have
seen some cost increases, and we've got price increases at various points, but certainly, the water heater
side bears the brunt of that steel increase.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ethan Buchbinder with Citi.

Eitan Eliyahu Buchbinder
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

So Q1 had weather issues in Ashland and Juárez on top of supply chain constraints, which limited
North America water heater production, and supply chain constraints lingering into Q2. How much of
production levels improved? And can you quantify the percent utilization within North America water
heater production capacity during the quarter?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

No, not specific. I would tell you that we had month-on-month improvement. And again, we have terrific
suppliers that are also working very hard to raise their capacity. And the important note is we believe
that's going to carry on into Q3 and the Q4. So we certainly have plenty of demand. Our orders are
mirroring the industry. It's just a matter of us being able to work those overtime hours and Saturdays, and
we've been a bit constrained with some of the supply chain issues that we talked about. And of course,
there's port issues, there's trucking issues that we're working through. But the takeaway is that sequential
improvement, and that should carry over into the back half of the year.

Eitan Eliyahu Buchbinder
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

That's helpful. In 2020, the cadence of social insurance was heavy in Q2 and Q3. Understanding that Q4
is normally the highest margin quarter for the Rest of World segment. And last year it was 11.2% margin
with minimal impact from social insurance. What are the potential factors that could keep margin down
year-over-year?

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. This is Chuck. I mean it's really mostly volume. We really had a strong Q4 last year, and that volume
really matters on the incremental base of the business. It really drops nicely to the bottom line. So last
year, we had a very strong fourth quarter. And we called it out on our call last year. And it could have
been some pent-up demand from the pandemic, not exactly sure all the drivers, but that's probably the
major difference. There was some social insurance last year, and I want to say that it's small. Like you
said, it's probably $12 million for the year, and the bulk of that fell into Q2 and Q3. And we'll see a similar
headwind in Q3 that we saw in Q2.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Damian Karas with UBS.

Damian Karas
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So a pretty notable change in your view on the water heater shipments from down 2%, now up 3%
for the year. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on your earlier comments about the inventory
destocking, you're not expecting that anymore and really just elaborate on what's changed since last
quarter?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Well, I'll start with that and Chuck can jump in. We don't move our forecast very often as we see some
clear line of sight. What's really changed is, one, we didn't plan on four price increases this year, and that
makes a big difference in pre-buys and buy ahead. And quite frankly, the market's been -- continues to be
stronger than we anticipated, and new home construction continues to do very well. So as we were putting
this all together and coming to the second half of the year, those are -- there's been multiple changes that
have changed our opinion for this year to move it up that 3%.

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We don't expect inventories to come down based on the order rates that we've seen. When we looked
at the full year outlook for the industry, I mean, last year it was basically a record year on residential
water heaters. And to be 3% up over a record year is pretty meaningful. But when we kind of look at the
first half of the year and then look at the second half of the year, historically, those volume percentages
kind of break down 52% in the first half of the year, 48% in the back half of the year. So last year, it was

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

exactly opposite. It was 48% because of all the headwinds that the industry had in production in Q2, but
it was 48% front half and 52% back half. And when we looked at the full year, we went back to kind of the
normal cadence, too. So we looked at that and said, let's go back to that 52-48, thinking about what kind
of demand we're seeing and again, with four price increases, it's a little bit difficult to read out the total
demand, but being -- and decided to go up 3% with the assumption inventories would not decrease.

Damian Karas
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then I was curious if you've seen any market share jostling going
on, just as a result of the current environment with the supply chain issues and some of the capacity
constraints you and the other competitors of yours have had to deal with? Maybe you could just talk about
kind of at -- through your channels and at the regional level, if there's what's happening with market
share?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Well, you're right, market share is a bit messy right now because of different price increases in the supply
chain. I would tell you right now, A. O. Smith is lagging a bit, not because we don't have the orders in-
house and not because our customers -- we have a solid customer base with no change there. It's really
been just more of various constraints on what we can produce out of our factories. And of course, as we
mentioned in the first quarter, the Gulf freeze did not help. But when it's all said and done with no major
changes in customers, and we'll get our fair share of orders that over time, this is probably all going to
work itself out. But right now, A. O. Smith is lagging a bit, and we anticipate that will be minimized by the
time we get through the rest of the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

A couple of questions. First, on China. I was hoping you could comment on what sell-in versus sell-through
looks like? And how you're feeling about your inventory position there?

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, sure. We feel very, very good about our inventory position there. We felt good about it a year ago,
and it significantly improved. It's at its lowest point in 5 years. And I would say that it's probably it's as
fresh as it's been. So we're in a great inventory position in the channel in China. Let me help frame kind
of the sales growth for the quarter. So we're up 26% in organic local currency. But if you kind of take a
look at that, last year, we did have some headwind on channel inventories coming down. When we look at
sellout and demand for this quarter, we're probably up about mid-single digits. We're right in that range.
And it's across our whole portfolio of products. So we're pleased with the 26% growth. You got to recall
last year; China came out of the pandemic earlier than North America. It got gutted too and it came out
of it a little sooner, but that was a quarter that was building from April, May and June. So mid-single digits
up for the quarter, and we kind of -- when we think about the rest of the year, we're kind of looking at
something roughly in that same range through the back half of the year.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And then just sticking with China. Can you speak to kind of -- I'm thinking about the pricing spectrum
right and how things trended a few years ago, kind of up in that high end, then things trended more into
the mid-price point range. Where are you relative to the historical peak? And maybe the recent trough
there with respect to your product set and realization there?

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Let me just frame it kind of quarter-over-quarter comparison because it's very similar to where we've
been in the last couple of quarters. I would say what we've seen is a little bit of improvement in the higher
end price on the gas tankless. And on electric heating and water treatment, it's roughly the same. So
it hasn't changed a great deal. We see some indications of the higher-end premium part of the market
growing, but we have not seen a great deal of change pleased, though, that we've seen a little bit of
movement on the gas tankless side.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.

Saree Emily Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

You originally talked about some inventory coming out of the channel this year. Now with residential
heaters expect to be up 3%, you're no longer talking about that. So just how are you thinking about
ending inventory for the industry? And then how does that set up for demand in 2022?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

You're talking North America?

Saree Emily Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes, North America.

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

North America residential. Well, again, we'll have to see how things play out. There's still 5 months left
in the year. And so we've reached it, as we've talked about. And we'll have to get a better view as the
next few months depending on how we're producing, how people are consuming, how the economy is
doing. It's hard to look into 2022 when we're in July right now. So we'll look at it closer. We'll talk more
as we get closer to the end of the year. But right now, as we said, demand is up, and there's a lot of good
momentum in new construction. And so that plays well for the balance of the year.

Saree Emily Boroditsky
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And so with higher North America volumes, you obviously implemented a number of price
increases, the margin expectations are a little bit lower. So how are you thinking about matching price cost
in the second half of the year? And then how are you thinking about margin improvement in 2022, just as
some of these costs hopefully become less of a headwind?

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean we -- since our first price increase was announced in November last year, we have just
seen costs continue to rise. Every price increase that we have launched into the marketplace has been
consistently followed by higher steel costs and higher costs. So as we go into the back half of this year
and get to the fourth quarter where our fourth price increase starts coming into the market and we start
seeing it, we're basically matching costs. So we're not covering our margin in the fourth quarter. That's a
bit of the headwind that we see in the back half. It's too early for us to be kind of speculating I think on
2022 on what we're going to see on cost. Certainly, we've not seen these types of cost increases in the
market. But it's hard to speculate how long they'll be there, whether they'll come back out. Obviously,

there's a lot of discussion on transitory inflation, but we're not yet ready to kind of predict when we're
going to see any relief.

Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

In your prepared remarks, you talked about water treatment and seeing more promotional days. And so
I wonder if we could just circle back to that for a moment and just talk about the extent to which you're
seeing, maybe a little more in the way of expectations from some of your channel partners with respect to
your level of promotional channel support?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

No. I would tell you our -- the promotional channel days that we talked about were pretty much normal.
And there wasn't an increase in it, but it's pretty effective. Water treatment -- our close rates have been
high as people continue to look at water treatment as a health issue for their family. But I don't want to
mislead. Those were normal days that just performed at a higher level for us. And I think it comes down
to the whole megatrend that we're seeing with water quality and the safety part, that continues, and it
continued into the second quarter.

I mean water treatment has performed well. I mean, it's 17% increase quarter-over-quarter. But I just
want to remind us that last year it grew by 19%. So as a part of our business last year that actually grew
in 2020 in Q2 and grew again this year. So pretty resilient, still performing well.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

And how much just were on water treatment, how much of that growth would be attributed to expanded
distribution as opposed to just greater pull?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

That's one I probably can't give you any specific. If you break down our business, it has to do with -- we
have direct-to-consumer with, of course, that's just an ongoing business. We have a marketplace. We've
done a fairly nice job expanding our dealer network. I can't give you specifics, but that area, and we called
it out in our remarks, has grown substantially and doing a really nice job. It has a nice backlog. But I can't
give you specifics about really the number of new dealers, but going in the right direction and performing
very, very well.

Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the channel inventory to beat a dead horse here. You guys had expected a
destock in the second half. You're now not expecting a destock in the second half. Can you talk about the
inputs that go into that in terms of are you expecting higher demand, customers ordering ahead of price
increases and because of supply chain challenges? And do you think the channel inventories end the year
at an appropriate level or under or overstocked?

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. I think you framed the pieces for us a bit. I mean there is higher demand on the price increase for
sure, that always is there. We manage that working with our customers. The constraints we see on supply
chain, I think, encourage people to make sure they have product on hand. This will be -- our projection on
3% up will be another record year back-to-back. Where we end up on the channel inventory, I think, is a
little hard to say. And I think it will play out a bit on what happens in new construction and what we see as
far as the supply chain getting a little more normal.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Fair enough. And then just a follow-up on India. You've said it doubled year-over-year. Obviously, India
has had its issues with COVID. Can you just give us a number relative to where it was in 2019?

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

In 2019, I mean it's -- gosh, I don't have that in front of us right now. I'd say I'm pretty confident it's
higher than 2019. But I do want to frame it a bit because typically, 35% to 40% of our sales are in Q4.
But we're really pleased with how the team has performed for the quarter in a really tough environment.

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Yes, I would just want to add on to it. I mean, India was savaged by COVID. And our team did what they
needed to do to protect our employees, but more importantly, really developed a strong relationship on
the online segment of the business, which helped drive some of the sales we're talking about. Even in
the pandemic, we introduced new products, both in water treatment and in water heating that have done
exceptionally well. So we're calling it out because quite frankly, it's a phenomenal job by a team that really
had severe headwinds throughout the second quarter and throughout the first part of the year. And we're
looking for the back half to get a bit better. And again, as Chuck said, that's where we get about 50% of
our sales over the last 4 months.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is around the boiler business. You guided -- or you held your guide of a low double-digit
increase this year. And yet, you said you saw the sales up about 35% in the quarter. Can you just talk to
how you're thinking about the back half of this year, some of the orders that are coming through and how
we should be thinking about that deceleration on a relative basis that you're expecting in there?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Again, as we've talked about, the back half is a more difficult comp. And as we look forward, we talked
about bringing forward the early buy, which was a record early buy for us from the third quarter. So
there's a few items that are a headwind as we get into the second half of the year. So that's the primary
reason behind it. Order bookings are good. Still seems to be pretty healthy with regards to our quoting
activity. But when we put the numbers together and Chuck will maybe elaborate on them a bit more,
that's how we feel it's going to play out in the second half of the year.

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. The only thing I would add is I'm trying to think about kind of the benchmark for 2019. And I believe
when you kind of look at 2019, we're up high single digits compared to 2019, which is confirming that
number, just to help kind of frame where we are because 2020 had quite a bit of disruption in Q2. There's

13

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

a lot of jobs that were closed and a lot of production that was disrupted. So I'm trying to help with the
2019 framing and that's roughly -- it's up about 6% in 2019.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess building on that, too, can you talk a little bit about what you're
seeing on the commercial water heater side? That had obviously been a bit weaker compared to boilers.
Any updates on how that's trending? Obviously, the comps are a bit easier in the back half, how should we
be thinking about it?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Well, commercial water heater, it's nice when you reopen the economy. And we're seeing -- I think we've
talked about this in the past. We do have some IoT on our water heaters, and we can see how it's being
used and so forth. It's not a broad view, but it's a snapshot. And we're just seeing activity grow. We're
seeing restaurants open up. We're seeing people invest back in their business. So overall, it's nice to see
the economy or the commercial side of the business starting to reopen and get back to -- we're not there
yet, but back to kind of a normal replacement cycle and maintenance cycle. So that's where we raised our
guidance up by a couple of points. And it's based on those early trends continuing into the back half of the
year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Follow-up here, had gotten cut off in the middle of my next question for you. But I maybe just wanted to
go back to the pricing, guys. And I have tracked with August four price increases this year. I don't quite
recall the amount of the one from last year in November. Can you remind me of that one?

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

I think it was approaching 10%. When you get all 3 together, we've been kind of accumulating them as we
go along. Pat will take a quick look here. But the first one was roughly that amount, I believe.

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Yes, Scott, I'd tell you that's a long time ago. Well, if you look back at it because we've been chasing these
costs for a while.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. And so the other question I had was, Kevin, around your comments with the supply chain. And I
know that water heater volumes were up. But I'm assuming they were up sort of double digit. And the
reason I'm asking that is that the first 2 months of the quarter, trade data is sort of up and over 20%.
Now that's only the first 2 months, but it would just seem like that should be a -- did you keep pace with
the industry in the second quarter, I guess, would be the simplest question.

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

No. As I mentioned, we lagged a bit in the industry. And you look at the industry, it's up through May,
11%, 12% total. Again, quite a bit of that has been driven by price increases and those type of activities
along with the new construction and so forth. So we have been lagging. And again, it's our order entry is

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

right in line with the industry. However, some of the constraints that we talked about has caused a few
issues for us.

But again, I look at this, we have great operating people. And in the back half of the year, we'll have to
work through that. But I wanted to make sure you understand where we were and where we're going. And
we don't see fundamentally anything changing with regards to our customers, our market share as we
finally get through this -- these difficult times and finish up 2021.

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

And Scott, just to follow up that first price increase was up to 9%. So pretty close to that 10 that I
mentioned, but up to 9 is what we went out with.

Operator

And your final question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast.

Kevin William Hocevar
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Wondering if -- to that point on the supply chain issues, expectation of 3% volume growth for the year,
do you think, with all the actions you're taking, it sounds like things are getting better. Do you think you'll
be able to grow in line with the industry and maybe make up for that in the back half of the year? Or does
that perhaps defer some shipments for you guys to 2022?

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Yes. I would tell you, our expectation is to certainly keep up with the industry and to close that gap by
year-end. Again, the orders are there. It's just a matter -- and our customers are. Just a matter of --
working, like I said, go back to working those 9 hours, working that occasional Saturdays to close that
gap. And that's going to be all predicated on our supply chain, which again -- and I've talked to many
of our key suppliers. They're all getting better at it. They're all coming online a bit more. And we're
anticipating that's going to carry over to the back half of the year, and we'll be able to ramp up production
at a much higher rate than we had in the first half.

Kevin William Hocevar
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Okay. Great. And then on the water heater side, so if you -- if I back into the numbers, it seems like
water heater sales probably grew 25%, 26% in that -- in the second quarter. So wondering if you can
just -- is that -- I don't think you historically give price volume or anything, but is that mostly price or
fairly split between price, volume? And I think you guys made a comment that 40% pricing will be kind of
once everything is going to affect in the fourth quarter, that will be what pricing is. So does that mean we
should be thinking water heater sales up 40% in the fourth quarter, plus or minus whatever our volume
expectation is?

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Well, let me just go back to kind of the price, volume portion of Q2. And we typically don't, but I think
it's very helpful in the environment that, again that we give a little more data. So in Q2, when we kind of
look at the amount that we were up in North America, I'll frame this North America, 40% of that roughly
was price and the rest was basically volume. So the bulk of it was volume, but there was a percentage
of about 40% of that increase that was price. On the fourth quarter -- could you frame that again on the
fourth quarter question, please?

A. O. SMITH CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

I think you mentioned that -- just for modeling purposes, as we -- I think you had mentioned that
when all four price increases are in effect, it would be 40% cumulative. So does that mean that, that
water heater portion of North America sales should be up 40% in the fourth quarter once all those are
implemented, plus or minus whatever we think volume and mix does.

Charles T. Lauber
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, that's roughly right. I mean the fourth price increase comes into the fourth quarter, and it's early on
in the fourth quarter, but that's a good way to look at it.

Kevin J. Wheeler
Chairman, President, & CEO

Yes, I would say that plus or minus though, there's going to be some drag probably with that pricing in the
fourth quarter.
