WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Wabtec Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristine Kubacki, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Kristine Elizabeth Kubacki
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Wabtec's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings
Call. With us today are President and CEO, Rafael Santana; CFO, Pat Dugan; President of Freight Services,
Pascal Schweitzer; Senior VP of Finance, John Mastalerz.

Today's slide presentation, along with our earnings release and financial disclosures, were posted on our
website earlier today and can be accessed on our Investor Relations tab on wabteccorp.com.

Some statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our
business today. For more detailed risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our forward-looking
statements, please see the disclosures in our earnings release and presentations. We will also discuss non-
GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures and reconciliation tables carefully as you
consider these metrics.

And now I will turn over the call to Rafael.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Kristine, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today, and I hope you and
your families remain healthy and safe.

Before we get started, I'd like to once again thank our employees out in the field, in our factories and
those working from remote locations for continuing to keep our facilities safe and operational through this
pandemic. I'm very proud of how our teams has responded to the challenging environment, delivered for
our customers and supported one another during a time when health care, economic and social tensions
run high. And you see that reflected in our second quarter results and long-term focus.

Turning to Slide 3. We had a strong execution in the second quarter despite a difficult environment. Total
sales for the quarter were $1.7 billion, driven largely by the international freight market and services,
but offset by disruptions due to COVID in both the freight and transit end markets. Adjusted operating
income was $262 million, resulting in an adjusted margin of 15.1%, which was impacted by the drop in
sales across Freight and Transit, but somewhat offset by synergies.

Cash flow from operations of $311 million was driven by strong cash conversion and good working capital
performance. This allowed us to further strengthen our financial position, pay down debt during the
quarter by $300 million and increase our liquidity position by $700 million. Total multiyear backlog was
over $21 billion, providing us continued visibility across Freight and Transit despite market conditions.
And finally, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.87, demonstrating that we're taking the steps
necessary to control what we can, protect the long-term viability of the company and deliver shareholder
value. With that, let's dive into some actions underway.

As you know, we remain committed to our synergy targets, and we're accelerating our efforts here. We
have $150 million of net synergies planned for 2020. Year-to-date, we are on plan with over $70 million
in net synergies realized, and we remain confident that we will deliver on the full run rate of $250 million
in synergies ahead of schedule. Of particular note, we continued the aggressive action on structural costs

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

and lowered the SG&A expense by 26% year-over-year. During second quarter, we reduced head count by
5% and were down more than 10% year-over-year. We have also reduced our operational footprint year-
over-year, and we're actively driving cost reductions through lean initiatives. To date, we have exited more
than 60% of the shared service agreements from GE Transportation merger ahead of schedule.

Looking ahead, the rail transportation market and impacts from the pandemic remain challenged and fluid.
While we anticipate market conditions to remain somewhat mixed, as I'll share with you in a moment, we
believe volumes largely bottomed in the second quarter, and we will see a gradual recovery.

With this in mind, and based on our first half results, as well as based on the backlog coverage for the
rest of the year, we are issuing a new outlook for the 2020 year. Pending no further lockdowns due to
COVID-19 pandemic or resulting negative impacts on our business, we expect revenues in the range of
$7.3 billion to $7.6 billion for the year. We will continue to adjust our variable and fixed costs to align with
volume realities, and we are committed to improving segment margins. We anticipate adjusted EPS to be
in the range of $3.50 to $3.80 and cash conversions to be greater than 90% for the full year. This includes
roughly $130 million from prior restructuring and transactions cash outflows. Cash conversion within the
company's core business is expected to be over 100%.

Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to discuss the market conditions and drivers we are seeing across the sector.
Pascal Schweitzer, President of Freight Services, will also hit on some of this in a few minutes. In both
Freight and Transit, we are experiencing mixed conditions as economic recovery begins and commuter
travel resumes, and we're carefully monitoring the ongoing impact of the virus in some regions. In North
America, rail volumes had a record decline, down roughly 20% year-over-year in the second quarter.
However, we have seen rail volume improve since bottoming in the second quarter. Likewise, locomotive
parkings, after peaking to a record high in the second quarter, have also shown gradual improvements and
we remain positive on the aftermarket sector.

In terms of the North American railcar build, a record 1/3 of the North America railcar fleet is in storage,
and builders are taking continued steps to slow down production lines in 2020. Industry forecasts currently
indicate that the railcar build for the year will be less than 30,000 cars.

Reflecting on the quarter, I want to share a couple of highlights. Internationally, rail volumes were more
resilient, driven largely by agriculture and mining tailwinds. International locomotive shipments were
up versus last year and helped to offset North American locomotive and freight car build declines, as
expected. We continue to see demand for new locomotives in Russia, CIS, Brazil and Australia. Some
tenders have pushed to the right due to COVID-19, but we expect this to resolve as economies stabilize.
New growth opportunities for next-gen sustainable solutions also remain strong, especially for hybrids and
fuel-saving technology. We are doing some really innovative work in reducing fuel consumptions by 5%
through our engine overhaul process. Pascal will share more on this in a moment.

We're also currently field testing our FLXdrive locomotive, the first 100% heavy haul battery-powered
locomotive in the world, operating in a hybrid consist. So far, we are seeing an opportunity to reduce fuel
consumption for our customers by 10% to 30%.

We are extending battery technology to passenger transit as well and just closed a significant deal with
New York City Transit to drive down the overall carbon footprint.

Finally, we continue to see our Digital Electronics product line provides significant productivity and improve
safety for our customers. Sales for the quarter were up 4% versus the prior year.

Transitioning to the Transit sector. The COVID-19 crisis has had a significant impact on ridership and
service levels in early second quarter. Since then, particularly in Europe and Asia, ridership trends are
showing a slow recovery as economies reopen. This has resulted in some positive activity internationally
with new brake, new doors and HVAC contracts in regions like Australia, Canada, India and the U.K.
Overall, we believe the long-term market drivers for passenger transport remain intact, especially as
governments look to rail as the cleanest, safest and the most efficient mode to address the world's public
transportation challenges.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Across the segment, we also continue to drive costs down. We continue to improve project execution and
profitability. Lilian and the team are on track to expand margins over time, while delivering over 100 basis
points of improvement in 2020.

With that, let's flip to Slide 5, and I'll turn things over to Pascal.

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

Thanks, Rafael. Good morning, everyone. It is good to be with all of you today.

I am Pascal Schweitzer, and I am the group President of Wabtec Freight Services. This is a roughly $2.2
billion business with operations in around 40 countries and approximately $12 billion in backlog. Roughly
80% of our revenues are generated through multiyear contracts, including long-term service agreements,
parts contracts as well as multiyear modernization agreement. So in short, we are with our customers for
the long haul, helping them pull freight in some of the most important logistics corridors around the world.

As I've shared before, we are executing on a focused strategy to create value for our customers. This
includes ensuring that our fleet is performing well and running hard, that we are capturing the aftermarket
with a superior product and delivering outcomes for our customers through technology upgrades and new
tools, all this while constantly improving our fleet total life cycle cost.

Today, as railroads continue to enhance for productivity and efficiency gains through initiatives like
precision schedule railroading, for instance, and in the mixed challenges brought on by the pandemic, this
strategy is more relevant than ever.

In the second quarter, as Rafael explained, we saw significant disruption in many of the regions where we
operate. Government shutdowns had an impact on our customer operations and freight volumes globally.
As a result, a record number of locomotives were parked in North America. However, despite this, we
continue to have a leading and increasing share of the total active fleet. And our customers continue to
increasingly prioritize the dispatch of our locomotive due in large part to the performance and reliability of
the fleet.

I would also like to point out that in the second quarter, we did hit record performance for on-time parts
delivery. And despite regional disruptions and shutdowns from COVID, each of our more than 100 service
locations remained open and fully operational, a huge testament to the team in the field, and this is a
strong illustration that we do so much more than sell parts. You see that reflected in the resiliency of our
second quarter top line.

So while the uncertainty related to the crisis has led some railroads to delay certain investment decisions,
the value of our portfolio remains. We have worked with our customers to align scheduled maintenance
plans to the new market realities and, as a result, we have leveraged the full power of Wabtec to increase
the scope of our work and to unlock new growth in R&D.

Now looking ahead, as railroads enter into recovery and the growing level of freight relying on a smaller
number of locomotive, we expect demand for reliability to be even greater. This will translate into more
comprehensive work scopes, into more comprehensive fleet strategies, into modernization opportunities.
Currently, we have more than 1,000 modernized locomotives in operation, delivering improved reliability,
better fuel efficiency and overall economic performance for our customers.

As our customers strategically consider their investment plans over the long term, the value of
modernization remains very compelling. The second quarter, mods delivery showed good momentum and
we continued to have visibility via our multiyear backlog.

Now on a broader international case, where economies have started to reopen, we are also seeing
encouraging improvement in parkings and operational fleet performance. Just to give you a few examples.
In Australia, rail activity has shown good momentum throughout the quarter as China resumed the
business following the COVID lockdown. In Kazakhstan, year-to-date, car volumes are up compared
with 2019. In Brazil, we see a strong demand with greater dependency on agriculture products following

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

a record harvest. In India, while there were a significant number of locomotives parked due to the
pandemic, this ultimately had little impact to our business as we shifted focus to maintenance. And as of
July, all of these locomotives are back in operation. Finally, in North America, as discussed, we do expect
carload volumes to continue to gradually improve and parking to progressively recover.

In terms of commercial activity for the quarter, the team closed some significant long-term service
agreements with Class Is in North America as well as in Brazil, and won a key order for our FDL Advantage
product. Going into this product a little bit more specifically, as Rafael described. We have around 10,000
FDL locomotives running globally. Many of these locomotives are approaching their second or third engine
overhauls. So with these next-gen solutions, we are able to reduce the fuel consumptions by up to 5%.
That means, for a single locomotive burning around 200,000 gallons of fuel a year, around $25,000 in
savings per year. This is an exciting first win that is opening up a multimillion-dollar pipeline of opportunity
for Wabtec, fully in line with our strategy of technology differentiation for the installed base.

Finally, I'll share a few thoughts on cost management. So last year, we have reduced our headcount by
roughly 10%, ahead of our synergy commitments and in line with market realities. We have undertaken
lean initiatives to drive cost out of the business while still being able to deliver for our customers and scale
up as market recovers.

So to conclude, while the market remained fluid and carload volumes and parking drew significant
headwinds, the Freight Services team had a strong operational quarter, giving us confidence that our
broad international portfolio, our $12 billion multiyear backlog and our strong aftermarket rate will position
us well into the future.

Looking forward, you will see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonality of maintenance
activity due to our engine overhaul profiles and mods delivery schedules. However, the fundamentals of
this business and its ability to recover post COVID remains strong.

I will now turn things over to Pat to provide more color on the company's overall second quarter
performance. Pat?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Pascal. Turning to Slide 6. Sales for the second quarter were $1.7 billion, which reflects a 22%
decrease versus the prior year. The decline in year-over-year sales was mainly due to disruption across
our Freight and Transit segments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the quarter, operating income
was $159 million and adjusted operating income was $262 million. That's down 32% year-over-year,
mainly driven by the lower sales and the disruption in our operations as a result of the pandemic, offset
somewhat by variable cost actions and the realization of our synergies. For the quarter, adjusted operating
income excluded pretax expense of $103 million, of which, $72 million was for noncash amortization, $31
million of restructuring and transaction costs. Take a look at the Appendix D to our press release for the
reconciliation of these details.

Now looking at some of the detailed line items. SG&A declined 26% year-over-year to $217 million,
excluding $13 million of the restructuring and transaction expenses. SG&A expense benefited from
structural cost actions across the business as well as the realization of synergies. Engineering expense
decreased to $38 million or down 33% from last year. Engineering expense moved down with the lower
volume outlook as well as some changes in project timing. And amortization expenses were $72 million.
In 2020, we expect noncash amortization expense to be about $290 million, and depreciation expense of
about $180 million.

Second quarter, we had GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.46 and adjusted earnings per diluted share
of $0.87. Details that bridge the GAAP earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 can be
found attached to our press release.

As of June 30, our multiyear backlog was $21.4 billion. Excluding the impact of FX, backlog is flat quarter-
over-quarter, a rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multiyear backlog, $5.3 billion. Our
backlog continues to give us and provide good visibility across both the Freight and Transit segments.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Now let's take a look at those segments, the results on Slide 7. Across the Freight segment, total sales
decreased 21% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. FX negatively impacted sales by about $26 million
during the quarter.

In terms of product lines, equipment sales were down 37% year-over-year as a result of lower North
America locomotive deliveries, which, as we have discussed, often can vary quarter-to-quarter due to
timing. And that was offset somewhat in the second quarter by higher year-over-year international
locomotive deliveries and increased mining sales. In the second half of the year, we expect locomotive
deliveries to be slightly higher when compared to the first half of this year.

And as you heard Pascal discuss, our Services portfolio continues to show resiliency despite the OE
headwinds. Despite a nearly 18% drop in North America freight volumes for the quarter, Services
revenues were down 8% year-over-year, a result of lower parts sales due to record locomotive parkings,
but that was offset by double-digit growth in mods deliveries. We expect our parts sales to improve with
the gradual recovery in freight volumes, [ see ] timing of maintenance and overhaul work edging into the
fourth quarter.

Digital Electronics sales were up 4% year-over-year on higher sales of distributed power products and
signaling projects. Components sales were down 30% year-over-year on lower year-over-year railcar build
and declines in key industrial end markets such as oil and gas and power generation.

Despite the top line headwinds, evidence of our synergies coming through as segment adjusted operating
income was $229 million for an adjusted margin of 19%.

Finally, the Freight segment backlog was $18 billion, about flat with the prior quarter. I would note again
that FX negatively impacted that backlog by about $58 million.

Turning to Slide 8. Across our Transit segment, sales decreased to 25% year-over-year to $533 million,
driven largely by disruption stemming from the COVID-19 virus but were also impacted by FX, which
reduced sales by an additional $18 million.

OE sales were down 32% year-over-year on disruptions caused by the pandemic. During the quarter,
our operations and our customers' operations, which are primarily in Europe and Asia, were negatively
impacted by government shutdowns.

Aftermarket sales, which were down 18% from last year, were impacted by reduced capacity at many
transit systems around the globe. However, as economies have opened up, we have seen a resumption in
service, increased equipment deployed, gradual recovery and ridership in most markets.

Our adjusted segment operating income was $51 million for an adjusted operating margin of 9.6%. The
margin performance was impacted by the lower absorption of fixed costs in the first half of the quarter.
However, we are continuing to drive improvements in the Transit business and expect Transit margins to
increase 100 basis points for the year.

Finally, the segment backlog was $3.4 billion, also about flat with last quarter. FX negatively impacted the
backlog by $79 million versus the end of the first quarter.

Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow on Slide 9. Cash flow generation during the quarter
was strong at $311 million. I would note that we had about $40 million of onetime impacts due to prior
year restructuring and transaction charges we had identified on our last earnings call. Our leverage ratio
at the end of the second quarter was 2.7x, about flat with the last quarter. But our total liquidity at the
end of the second quarter was $1.9 billion, up solidly from the $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter,
and total net debt is down about $282 million. Also, in July, we took proactive steps to restore a more
balanced maturity profile of our debt with a successful 5-year $500 million bond offering that retired $500
million in floating rate notes due in September of 2021.

In summary, our balance sheet is strong, and we are confident in our ability to generate cash flow, giving
us the liquidity and flexibility to execute our strategic [indiscernible].

With that, let's move to Slide 10, and I'll turn the call back over to Rafael.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Thanks, Pat. So as you heard throughout the morning, and you see on this page, Wabtec had
a solid performance in the second quarter despite a weakened fluid environment. A reminder that in
difficult times, strong companies must learn how to adapt, find a better way and lead through change. We
could not have imagined a greater stress test for our company and how we would perform in a difficult
environment than the one we're seeing it today.

Over the last 17 months, we have successfully managed a massive merger that doubled the size of this
company. We've faced into the global pandemic in an industrial recession in one of the most difficult
business cycles ever seen. Yet, despite all the odds, we are performing strong, and we have delivered.
A true testament to the team and their commitment to position this company as a stronger and more
resilient Wabtec.

Heading to the second half of the year, we fully expect to see continued headwinds, especially given the
uncertainties of COVID-19. Our leadership team remain confident and committed to manage costs and to
drive profitable growth that will help us navigate these challenges. I want to personally thank each and
every member of the Wabtec team again for all that they are doing in the face of change. Your efforts are
reflected in the results we shared today.

With that, I'll turn the call back to Kristine to begin the Q&A portion of the discussion.

Kristine Elizabeth Kubacki
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Rafael. We will now move on to questions. [Operator Instructions]
With that, operator, I think we're ready to take our first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Justin Long with Stephens.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. So maybe to start with the 2020 guidance. So if I look at the revenue guidance,
it implies that sequentially, in the second half of the year, revenue should get better relative to the second
quarter. As we think about just the mix implications, can you give us some color on how much of that
sequential improvement in revenue you anticipate to come from Freight versus Transit? And then anything
just on a quarterly basis that you can provide to help us think about the cadence of revenue or earnings in
the back half?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Justin, let me start first with -- well, as we look at the backlog coverage for the ranges we've
provided, we feel strong about that. I think we also feel strong about the strength in the execution. We've
got, I'll say, a strong momentum in terms of both synergies and cost actions that we're taking. I think in
the second quarter, we certainly saw volumes bottoming for our customers. We think it was also, when
we think from operational disruptions, I think, we also, to some extent, have seen the worst. I don't think
we're through that. I think we have seen improvement in the trends towards the end of the quarter. I
point out to that with unparkings of locomotives. Ridership levels on the Transit side have improved a bit.
But I think the better news there, you've got a large number of trains still operating.

So I think we're continuing to see those trends. There is, of course, some volatility as we see and as
we look into the recovery. But we're seeing trends up starting at end of the second quarter, and we're
continuing to see that through this month of July as well.

Pat, I don't know if you want to add any more specifics into that?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

No. I think the one thing I would point out is that when you kind of look at our information as it becomes
available, the mix of aftermarket versus OE, the decline is much more significant in the OE side kind of
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. You see that it's really being impacted by the disruption in the
industry and the market. And so I think to get to your question of where and how those recoveries, I think
the recovery is going to be in both segments, and I think you're going to see it coming back to a more
typical mix of business as the year goes along.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think one of the things we'll be watching for is really any push-outs on decisions with regards to new
projects. And I think that's something for us to continue to monitor here as we continue to build backlog.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then maybe, Pat, on the cadence part of that question for third and fourth quarter, do
you feel like third quarter is maybe a little bit worse and then we kind of build off of that into the end of
the year? Any color on that front?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Yes. I just want to be careful about guidance this quarter and everything. But I think you see sort of a
kind of a steady sequential improvement as we go through the rest of the year.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Helpful. And as my second question, I wanted to ask about free cash flow. I know you made the
comment about the cash conversion percentage this year. But any more specific thoughts around free cash
flow in 2020 and how that cash could be allocated between debt paydown and maybe potentially even
buybacks? I don't know if that's something you're considering at this point.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Well, a couple of points. I think we've given clear guidance to cash conversion being above 90%. I think
we remain committed to that, and I think we have areas of opportunities here to act, if you look into areas
like inventory, for instance. So we'll continue to have a strong rigor around that. And we feel strong about
delivering above 90% cash conversion here.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And as for the allocation, I think it's obviously one of the most challenging times, and we want to
make sure that we focus on debt repayment and then get into other uses of capital. I don't think -- I think
it's too early to really be talking about anything aggressive or -- but we want to remain opportunistic. And
that's the way we've approached this. We're generating cash, we're meeting our goals, and then we're
using it to get our debt in the right kind of ratio range, as we've always talked about, and be opportunistic
for all the other things we can do.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

We remain committed to the framework we presented during the Investor Day, and there is a commitment
to continue to pay debt down, but we're going to be looking at opportunities here and especially we can
see bolt-on acquisitions being, I'll call, more available than they were maybe 6 months ago. And we'll
make sure to evaluate that against the different options. So we're committed to that framework we
presented back at Investor Day.

Operator

The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Maybe if you could -- I was curious if you could provide a little bit more sort of color on the outlook for the
second half on Freight segment. So looking through sort of equipment and components and kind of giving
a sense of how we should be thinking about that revenue rebound relative to what we see in the Freight
market. Services and Digital obviously held up fairly well. But when you think about those 2 pieces, do
those kind of move linearly with a recovery in volume? Or how are you guys expecting that to play out in
the second half?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think I'll purely point out to 3 things to be really watching. Of course, the impact for both customers
and operations was very significant in the second quarter. As we go into the second half, I think, first,
really watching closely on the Freight side, the unparking of locomotives. What I feel is North America or
international, I mean, we have seen the impact in the second quarter. And as those unparking occurs, I

think we have seen that trend. It's not linear, but I think there are some brighter spots than one places
versus others.

Especially internationally, I'd say we see some of those brighter spots. We see them across some
geographies and driven by, well, either agriculture or specific mining. There's still some markets we are
heavily underpenetrated. So I think we see good dynamics coming from some of these markets. And
it's reflected also in the pipeline of what I call opportunities for equipment deals. So that if I talk about
agriculture in Brazil or mining in Australia. We're also continuing to deliver on our contracts in India. You
pick a country like Kazakhstan's volumes, carloads are actually up year-over-year, year-to-date. And that's
also, I think, a significant opportunity for us.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that color.

And then, just a detailed question about the 12-month backlog. I just want to make sure I understand
sort of what the progression has been over the last couple of quarters. So that's come down a bit, and
I know FX is probably some of it. I'm just kind of curious, have we seen any of the sort of 12-month
outlook get pushed out into the right? I think there were some comments about that maybe on -- in the
prepared remarks. I just want to make sure I'm understanding sort of what the 12-month view is because
obviously, the long term is very stable. I just want to make sure how we're seeing that kind of play out
over the course of the sort of more immediate term.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I'd say, certainly, when I look at second quarter or even first quarter, I mean, I can't say those were
necessarily great in terms of while favoring a dynamic of order intake. I think when you compare our
first quarter against second quarter, and if you were to exclude FX, you will see backlog remains flattish
quarter-over-quarter. I think as we look out ahead, I mean, we're really in the business of looking for
business. We're chasing every piece of opportunity that we can go after. Our strategy here is to grow the
business profitably. And I'd say we're continuing to act to have a more competitive cost structure than
ever before.

I think, yes, we are seeing some of the decisions moving to the right. And I think, especially if you think
about some of the dynamics in the Transit side with really, despite of the fact that ridership is low, I think
we're seeing a number of trains in operations. So operators are really reevaluating some of these.

But we think the long-term fundamentals, whether if I look at Transit or Freight, remains strong, and we
are seeing a commitment to actually be investing in those mods. And this is part of the solution. As we
look at the world ahead, in terms of while driving more efficient, more productive, less emissions and I
think we sit in a good place in terms of the long-term fundamentals for the business.

Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I just want to delve into Chris' question a little bit more on the Freight aftermarket piece, particularly as
it relates to North America. I guess just given the focus on the rails and in terms of increasing utilization
versus bringing equipment back, I would have thought your freight aftermarket, I think you said it
wouldn't recover 1:1, but I would think it would actually recover a little faster as a result of that. Any
thoughts there? Or am I thinking about that wrong?

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Well, a couple of comments there. Number one, I mean, we felt the impact in the second quarter in North
America. I mean it's brutal, right? I mean as you look into the numbers, you've heard from the Class Is,
I mean, we've seen volume reduction pretty close to those numbers that you have heard. If you think of
transactional parts and I think some of the Class Is alluded to like 20% down, yes. I mean we did feel that
directly. I think what we've also seen is from the bottoming of the volume, which fundamentally happened
in the first 2 months of the quarter, we've seen that improvement come through.

That's also been true, not just for North America. We've also seen that in the international markets. And
we do expect recovery to happen there faster, especially as the fleets are unparked. It's all dependent on
the pace in which those fleets gets unparked. I think we're seeing a faster rate of recovery on international
markets. I think I mentioned here earlier, some of the dynamics on agribusiness, mining across some of
the geographies that we serve, and we're certainly seeing, I'd say, a much faster recovery. In fact, some
customers actually up year-over-year in terms of carloads in some of these geographies.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then just want to turn to Transit in terms of the recovery in terms of U.S. versus global.
I know global is a much bigger impact for you on Transit. Any differences that you're seeing in those
markets in terms of how they're recovering or interest in investing in infrastructure going forward?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think the recovery in terms of, number one, ridership has been a little bit better in Europe, if you were
to compare against the U.S. But reality is it remains well below what, I'll call, the pre-COVID levels. I
think the better side of it is we've seen, I think, the number of trains in service and operations are very
significant despite of the ridership being down. So I think we can also be looking at service despite of
maybe a lower decline going into a faster recovery.

And I think the other element is I think as far as project scales, we haven't seen any, again, cancellations
or anything with regards to the impact to this year. There could be an element of things pushing to the
right in terms of just project delays when customers might want equipment. I think that's one of the
elements that we're going to keep monitoring.

Operator

Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

You talked a little bit about kind of the bottoming in volumes and in ridership in Transit, and I appreciate
kind of a lot of questions on kind of the aftermarket. But could you kind of clarify what the exit rate
trends that you're seeing kind of that improvement off of the down 18% in Transit aftermarket? And then
similarly, in the Freight Services side, kind of how you've seen that recovery progress so far kind of as
you've gone through the quarter and the exit trends?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So I think in terms of the exit trends, I mean, again, we saw it going back up some of the demand in both
-- in terms of orders, but in terms of sales versus the first 2 months of the quarter. I think in specific, say
in Transit, I think beyond that, I think we've taken significant actions in the business. Lilian and the team
is really committed to continue to take the necessary cost actions, and I look at year-to-date, we're 110
basis points margin improvement versus the first half of last year. I think we've talked to you about being
at least 100 basis points improvement year-over-year. So despite of what I'll call a really unprecedented
quarter in many ways, we're very much on track to deliver on that promise. So still a lot of work to do.
Still subject to a lot of disruptions, but we feel like the team is heading the right direction here.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just on the synergy targets. Obviously, you mentioned that you feel confident that you can
get over the $150 million, net, by the end of this year. I think you've talked about some of those synergies
being volume-related. So maybe can you just comment on your confidence? Is that because you're seeing
that volume improve? Or are you seeing maybe faster footprint reduction than you were anticipating? And
then if you can talk at all about maybe the upside to that $250 million since you've mentioned that you'll
achieve that earlier than you had previously anticipated?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We're certainly, I'd say, number one reason for that is we do have a pipeline of synergies that's
greater than the one that we've provided. So we're continuing to work on those. And they're critical
in order to offset any, I'll call, downside that we could experience along the way. So we are not giving
necessarily any considerations on volume growth at this point as being able to accelerate that. But I think
we've got good momentum there, and I think we continue to have opportunity here to provide, I'll call,
better news in terms of accelerating synergies as we progress this year and into next year.

Operator

The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Pat, maybe just continuing on the margin commentary there. What are your thoughts on Freight margins
now that you've fully integrated with GE and lapping year-over-year? You're in the upper teens, but maybe
just help us think about what happens as asset sales come back online. Should we see a mix change? Do
you expect that to move back in the 20s? Should it stay at this level? Maybe just your general thoughts as
the mix shifts with the business mix.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I mean when you kind of look at the impacts, you have Freight car builds that are really at a very
historically low levels. You have North America locos and the impacts of that markets on our business. As
those volumes come back on, we have -- we obviously get really good margins on the Freight car build,
and we get good margins in the locomotive builds, on OE and the absorption that comes along with that.
So I think that you could see the business and the margins for that Freight segment improve with the
higher volume. It certainly makes sense.

The other aspect to this will be Digital Electronics and the investment that our customers will make, and
the growth in that revenue area will also provide really good margins for the segment.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So it's not like Digital has higher margins because of less asset intensity. So therefore, it's peakish now
and with more assets, it would be pressured. Do you see as the physical assets come back and improving
in that margin just as you get more fixed cost coverage, just to clarify that.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, exactly. I think the fixed cost coverage is a big part of it, but I think it's also -- those are good
product lines for us. And they deliver a lot of value for our customers. And I think that as the overall
volumes recover and we get -- the industry improve, I think that you'll see the margins get back to more
historical than typical levels.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then for my follow-up, Pascal, you say obviously Freight did well in holding up in the backlog.
Can you talk about the mix of contract services versus equipment in the backlog itself in terms of what
was added? And maybe your thoughts on domestic versus international as well?

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

Look -- you want to take the...

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I just want to be a little careful. I don't think we've kind of broken out, like each of the
component, the product line revenue into its backlog and everything. Obviously, we talk in general about
the revenue mix in Services as about half of it comes under the MSA agreements, which is an element of
both kind of labor service and parts and other activity. You have mods in there and you have parts sales
in there. So those are basically the rule of thumb that we've been talking about in terms of how to look
at that product line revenue. And I think the orders that have come in kind of hold with that mix. It's not
absolute every quarter. But when you look over a longer period, a year or more, you're going to see your
order intake be pretty consistent with that mix of revenue.

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

And maybe to your question about...

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Go ahead.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

Go ahead.

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

No, to finish on your question about North America versus international. I mean what we see is that in
North America, we've seen this big impact from parking. Now if you look at the active fleet today, Wabtec
locomotives really represent the majority of the fleet that is running today. So this is an effect that is
mitigating this high parking number. And the locomotives that are running are running really hard. So
in terms of megawatt hour, miles per locomotive, we've really seen a strong increase, together with the
implementation of precision scheduled railroading. So this is one thing that is accelerating scheduled
maintenance, that is putting more focus on reliability, and this is good for Services.

International, Rafael discussed it. I mean Australia is strong. Brazil is strong, Kazakhstan, Egypt. Many of
our big international markets have remained strong.

And in terms of mods, with the great work that our supply chain team has been doing to keep our
factories open, we've been able to stick to our delivery schedule and to have a strong quarter as well. So
these are really the 3 building blocks that can explain this performance, I would say.

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

I think if you look at the last 2 years, we've continued to see an increase in terms of the percent of our
fleets running when compared to our competitors, whether if I look at North America or global markets.
So I think that's an ongoing trend.

Operator

Our next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So back at the Analyst Day, you guys provided a chart showing the installed base distribution for
locomotives. And based on the age profile of the T4 locomotives, it would appear that some of them may
be rolling off warranty in the next couple of years. First of all, is that -- does that make sense? And if so,
would that be a positive for aftermarket revenue on those locomotives?

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

Yes. Yes, that's true. Now keep in mind, I mean, this is a big fleet, right? We are talking about 23,000
assets as we presented. I think we have a favorable age distribution. The average age of this fleet is only
13 years. So this is a pretty young fleet that is going to keep running for a number of years. You have
some of the older fleets that are running less. You have some of fleets that are coming off -- that are
coming off warranty, especially internationally. And so you have a number of effects coming together.
But true, we have some locomotives coming up warranty and these locomotives start generating service
revenue.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And then service revenue is -- that doesn't make it into the backlog number, does it, that you published at
$12 billion?

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

Not necessarily. It depends on the contractual coverage that we have for these units.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean you can't -- you have MSAs that are out there, depending on the customer and the fleet
and their own decision, there might be a contract agreement that's in place. But you could also have
customers be doing some of the maintenance on their own, whether it's just our parts or somewhere in
the middle. It's really -- it's not something that you can kind of paint a broad brush over everybody. It can
be a little bit different. And that's why I always go back to the kind of the mix of the service revenue for
the product line.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So there's about, what, $600 million, which is more transactional, which is orders you get on the Gulf. So
you might not be seeing those in the backlog, to your point, out of the total $2.2 billion that make up the
[ total ].

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That makes sense. And speaking of a question that may be in a gray area and it's somewhat hard
to answer. I was just wondering, if we can gauge what percentage of your international backlog may be
for customers that are government-backed entities, federal government-backed entities versus state level

versus private companies. I know that you probably don't have that specific breakout, but any color would
be helpful.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I mean, exactly. We don't really have that breakdown, like you described. But I mean, we can certainly
look into that and try to get back to you with at least some color around it.

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would just add, I mean, just as like a rule of thumb or something that just to consider. I mean a lot
of our -- especially in the Freight side, our contracts are backed with bank guarantees and other financing
that's in place. And when you get on the Transit side, especially on the OE markets where you have the
big backlog, those are typically supported with government funding. And often, that funding has been
in place for years, and because the contract was awarded years ago. So that's just the kind of a thing to
consider.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So that's one side on the equipment. And maybe on the service side, they will very often be sold with
a Services contract on the top of that because they want to make sure, ultimately, they maintain the
locomotives running, and there's an element of continued training to the operators. And what we often see
is our fleets running, especially in those remote locations as we support the customer throughout the life
of the locomotives.

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

Yes, absolutely. I mean, internationally, we can, pretty often, without the proper service support, end up
with a brand-new fleet of locomotive that is stranded after a few years only. We really try to stay close
with our customers over the entire life of -- over the entire life of the locomotive. We have more than
160 service locations all around the world. So having local presence and being able to bring engineering
support whether physically or with remote diagnostics is having -- keeping part locally is really important
for us internationally.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

So we're very interconnected with our customers to the point that in a lot of places, we manage the
inventory associated with parts coming in and, ultimately, making sure we guarantee the availability and
reliability of those assets. So we feel very much upfront in any of those changes.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Rafael, I'm wondering if you could talk about how your MSAs performed in the quarter. Obviously,
really strong Services result, sounds like mods helped. But can you talk about the MSA performance in
particular? And I believe you get higher revenue opportunities post PSR adoption. And I'm wondering, are
you starting to see that hitting the sweet spot, if you will? Can you just expand around those points?

WABTEC CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Okay. So I'll just start with the second quarter. I mean, of course, the trends were not great there. I
mean we saw a decline in some of these items. And I think I mentioned about parts. I mean we also saw
pressure on MSA. I mean units not -- just not running as much as they were. But once again, I think
as you start seeing the unparking take place, I think we're seeing those trends as early as of June and
continuing to July to move in right direction. And I think we're seeing a good pattern from this point of
view.

But I think the one thing that I want to highlight to you here is we're working with customers to make
sure that they've got ultimately, I think, the most efficient, the most reliable locomotives out there. And
this presents to us opportunities to overhaul, to modernize and to, ultimately, also equip them so they can
run a lot of the things you've heard from the Class Is. How do I run longer trains, how do I get to a more
fuel efficiency for those locomotives. And we got to make sure that we're competitive as we do that.

But things like distributed power with LOCOTROL, LXA, Trip Optimizer, these are some of the technologies
that will enable that. And these are, in fact, proven technologies that are aligned very well with PSR and
all the efficiency railroads want to drive. And I think, again, very much connected with a lot of the story
you hear from Pascal on the Services side and one area that we continue to see opportunity here to grow
our installed base and to help customers with great paybacks.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then a follow-up on mods. Pat, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you had
double-digit growth. To hit the type of outperformance that you had in Services versus Freight volumes in
the quarter, it would seem mods shipments would have to be up 30% to 40% year-over-year to drive the
level of outperformance that we saw for you folks in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you could comment
on what's the inquiry level like for adding mods to backlog? Are you able to essentially maintain the mods
backlog as we hopefully see improving Freight conditions entering '21?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, so the mods are -- they're in the backlog year-over-year. Essentially, we continue to execute on
orders received and it would have been in 2019 and according to the schedule that our customers have
worked with us on establishing. So there's a certain amount of quarter-to-quarter variability that will
come with those mods orders and as we execute. Sometimes, it's -- to look at it and say that it's going to
be linear or have a trend there, you really have to look at a bigger picture, a bigger number of quarters
or a year-to-date kind of number. So it just so happens that in the second quarter, that backlog is more
staggered compared to last year.

When you talk about order intake for mods going forward, I mean, it's -- I think that there's a lot of
interest in our customers to continue to use this mod approach to leverage, especially in their PSR
strategy and their fleet strategy.

Pascal, if there's anything you want to add to that?

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

No. I mean, number one, I think if you look at the service numbers for the quarter, it was not 100% a
mod story, right? As we explained, we had a difficult situation in North America due to parking. However, a
big portion of our fleet kept running. Internationally, we saw some strong performance. And then we had a
strong mod quarter in terms of deliveries.

Now looking forward for mods, I mean, we believe that this is a big opportunity for the railroad, which is
fully in line with their strategy, as Rafael said, around longer trains, more reliable trains, better economic
performance. We have analyzed the fleet in a lot of details, and we have the opportunity to deliver
big outcomes to our customers. So we are talking about 50% increase in power eligibility, reliability
improvement by more than 50%, 10% fuel efficiency improvement. The addition of all our suite of digital

solutions, Trip Optimizer, LOCOTROL, LXA. And all this, when you combine it together, we believe that
this is turning into a very attractive investment proposition for the railroad. Now for them, in the end,
it's a question of capital allocation, and they decide. I mean we work hard to show them the value of our
product and we believe that there is a big opportunity to create value for the railroads and for Wabtec at
the same time.

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

You can, and you will see big swings between mods and what I'll call new locomotive volumes quarter-
over-quarter. Just keep in mind, the same facilities they're doing the mods or doing the new units. And of
course, we tend to profile those to make sure we're driving good productivity at our plants. So there could
be some significant changes on quarter-over-quarter numbers.

Pascal Schweitzer
President of Global Freight Services

I think the seasonality effect is important, and you have mods, you have service, you have scheduled, you
have unscheduled maintenance, you have the overall profile. There is a seasonality impact, and then you
will see some ups and downs there.

Operator

The next question will be from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Robert Stephen Barger
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just a couple of quick ones. For the Digital business increase of 4%, was more of that recurring revenue
from existing customers? Or have you been able to convert new customers looking for efficiency in 2Q?

Can you repeat that?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

You broke up a little bit. Steve, can you say it again?

Robert Stephen Barger
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes, sorry. The Digital business increase of 4%. More recurring customers? Or were you converting new
customers?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think we've -- a lot of it associated with, I'll call, existing customers. We have the opportunity here to
grow our installed base on some products that are still underpenetrated. I think I mentioned here LXA as
a product that -- I mean, we still have an installed base that's relatively small when I look at the potential
of this product. And it's a key product, especially as railroads look at making longer trains. I think there's
some elements here of auto products, like Smart HPT that will also enable customers to get significant fuel
savings as they run those longer trains.

So more with existing products and existing customers. And I think one of the big opportunities we
have is to expand that share growth and really into the international market. I think we've got some
earlier adopters in places like Brazil, in places Kazakhstan. But we can still be doing a lot into some other
geographies.

Exactly.

Robert Stephen Barger

through the rest of the year. Does that mean sequential improvement by quarter? Or is that relative to
what you put up last year?

Rafael O. Santana
CEO, President & Director

I think, again, what I said last year was we were going to drive at least 100 basis points margin
improvement year-over-year, and we certainly have actions that support more than that. And I think my
commentary earlier was, if you look at the first half of the year, we're very much on track to do so. And
actions will continue. It's less about, even, I'll call, the improvement year-over-year, but making sure that
we continue to drive momentum to, well, get to our entitlement. So I want to see continued momentum
there.

Operator

The next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

A couple of quick ones for you first, Pat. So typically, third quarter, just normal seasonality, is lower than
third -- than second quarter. Does that sort of normal seasonality apply this year?

And then maybe just bigger picture, when I look at the guidance, sort of a faster improvement in revenue
growth off the bottom than earnings growth. Maybe just some thoughts there on sort of the mix or
margins as revenue starts recovering?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the seasonality, we kind of find that to be a little bit challenging and a little bit not typical year-
to-year when you would consider all that we've gone through. The easy one to point to is the timing of
some of our Freight Services business. We would see a lot of strength of that in the third quarter. And in
my earlier remarks, prepared remarks, we -- I kind of mentioned that we see some of that edging out into
the fourth quarter. And I think that that's -- from what we can tell with our customers, we think that that's
going to have an impact. I think you also look at the -- that was always kind of a positive seasonality in
Q3. You also had some negative impact of shutdowns and plant slowdowns in the summer months in Q3.
We're seeing that being a little bit moderated. So I think that, that's the expectation for us in the -- with
getting back to normal next year.

And I -- your point about kind of revenue growth outpacing the earnings growth. I think that that's a little
bit related to the sales mix, the timing. We certainly will see some kind of return to normal in some of our
engineering costs and SG&A being more consistent with the higher revenues, and I think that will have an
impact on our margins a little bit in the second half of the year.

Okay. And just last one. If I go back to the beginning of the year, Pat, you were talking about $900 million
of cash from ops. It looks like the net income guidance is down around $200 million from January. So
should we assume a similar sort of $200 million decline in cash flow from operations? Or is there reasons
why it can be better than that?

Patrick D. Dugan
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think you've got to obviously consider the impact of net income and the lower volumes on the cash
flow. But the areas of confidence in cash flow and opportunities to do better really starts with the ability
to work with our working capital, to reduce our working capital with the lower volumes, turn that into a
source of cash. Obviously, the cash -- the cost savings initiatives that we put in place. And we continue
to execute on some of the tools, the balance sheet tools and the supply chain tools that we replaced
from exiting the GE transaction. So all those things, I think, lead to a lot of confidence in our cash flow
generation for the rest of the year.
