Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Quarter 2 2021 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is
Sanera, and I'll be the operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis. Ellen, you may begin.

Ellen R. DeSanctis
Senior Vice President of Corporate Relations

Thanks, Sanera. Good morning, and welcome to our listeners. We have the following executives on today's
call: Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer; Tim Leach, Executive Vice President of the Lower 48; and Dominic Macklon, our Senior Vice
President of Strategy and Technology; and Nick Olds, our Senior Vice President of Global Operations.

Given our recent June 30 market update, we plan to keep our prepared remarks very short this morning
and then, as Sanera mentioned, we'll begin our Q&A session. Two correlated logistics. Some of today's
speakers are participating virtually. We've done our best to ensure everything runs smoothly on the
technology front. Also because we want to give as many people as possible a chance to ask questions
during today's call, please don't get offended if you get cut off. You can jump back into the queue where
you can reach out to Investor Relations any time after the call.

Finally, a few reminders. In conjunction with this morning's press release, we posted a short deck of
supplemental material that includes second quarter earnings and cash flow summaries, some guidance
items and our cash flow sensitivities. And then finally, in today's call, we'll make some forward-looking
statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ due to the factors described in
today's press release and in our periodic SEC filings. I'll also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures
today. And as usual, reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found again in this
morning's press release and on our website. Thanks, and now I'll turn the call over to Ryan.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Ellen. Today's quarterly results come right on the heels of our June 30 market update, during
which we again laid out a compelling multiyear outlook for the company. The update was widely followed
and we received some pretty positive feedback. As you'd expect, given the recency of our update, there
isn't much incremental news to share at this time, except to say we remain convinced it was timely and
relevant, given the ongoing volatility we're seeing in the sector. And today, we're pleased to follow it up
with the very strong quarterly results we announced this morning.

As you'll recall, we kicked off our update by declaring that we believe we're at a defining moment for
the E&P sector and that persists today. Oil equities have been especially volatile recently, in part due to
uncertainties in the macro and because we know investors need to see evidence that sector discipline will
hold and returns on and of capital will follow. It's clear to us that long-term sector sponsorship requires
leadership on the part of companies as well as conviction on the part of investors.

Of course, for investors, the case for these equities requires a reasonably constructive macro view. The
case for equities also requires conviction around a micro view. in other words, who is best positioned
for the cyclical business realities and who has a track record of execution and performance and who can
truly lead in ESG. Most companies are espousing the virtues of discipline, and everyone now looks better
coming out of the 2020 downturn.

The questions investors need to consider is, who can deliver consistent returns-focused performance
through thick and thin? That's where leadership matters. In June, we met this defining moment with
a credible and highly investable plan that generates massive free cash flow and returns of capital with
financial returns that are competitive with the S&P. The leadership requires more than setting expectations

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

and plans. It also requires successfully executing them. Execution is where the rubber meets the
road. ConocoPhillips offers a unique combination of a credible and compelling investment plan with a
commitment to strong ongoing execution.

You saw that -- you saw the plan in June, and today, you see the execution. In other words, you're seeing
the June plan at work. This morning's release and supplementary information provided details on this
quarter's performance so I won't restate them. But here are a few key takeaways and themes that I
want to underscore. During the second quarter, the business ran extremely well. Our planned turnaround
activity went smoothly, as did our ongoing core programs across the company. These include activities
in the North American channel plays as well as in the multiple programs in our Alaska and international
regions.

While we're talking about execution, I'll also mention that we continue to make good progress on more
than 50 emission reduction projects that we have underway this year. Every part of our business has a
role in delivering our results, and I'm proud of our team for their accomplishments during a very busy
year. Overall, this quarter's financial results were really quite straightforward. The noise of 2020's market
upheavals and most of the Concho transaction adjustments are behind us. And the known deal integration
synergies and streamlining impacts we discussed in June are showing up in our performance.

We're on track to meet the updated 2021 guidance we issued a month ago, but we're not done, not done
with our efforts to continue driving the operational and underlying efficiencies the team has described
in our June material. We can't ignore that higher benchmark prices were a factor in this quarter's sector
performance broadly and certainly, ConocoPhillips specifically. However, what is somewhat unique to
ConocoPhillips is that our results demonstrate the capacity of our company to capture the benefit of higher
prices when they do occur. That's because we're unhedged, we're diversified and we're almost entirely
intact in royalty regimes.

Now a year ago, we demonstrated just how resilient we are to low prices. 12 months later and post-
Concho transaction, this quarter gives you a sense for the upside toward we can realize when prices
exceed the reference prices we showed you just 1 month ago. The clear bottom line, ConocoPhillips works
differentially through the cycles.

Cash from operations of $4 billion more than covered our capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and
distributions of $1.2 billion in the quarter. And importantly, we continue to meet and exceed our target
of returning greater than 30% of our CFO to our shareholders. We announced another increase to our
2021 distributions in June, bringing our total planned returns of capital to about $6 billion for the year,
representing almost 8% of our market cap today, while other companies are only announcing or just
reactivating such programs.

And of course, as Bill described in our market update, if prices continue at current levels, we would expect
to have additional cash that could go towards greater distributions. And for reference, we estimate full
year 2021 CFO at $50 per barrel WTI would be about $11 billion after adjusting for the onetime Concho
transaction-related impacts. And you can do the math on our sensitivities at roughly $300 million per $1
per barrel change in prices.

At this time, we still believe our distribution allocation of nearly 3% yielding ordinary dividend and share
repurchases is a very sound mix, but we continue to evaluate the issue and we want to engage with the
market on alternative allocations. We know there isn't a perfect answer but we know what matters, and
that's a credible commitment to return capital and a solid track record of reliable performance, which
we've certainly delivered now for multiple years.

So to summarize, we have a great shareholder-friendly business model and plan. We're hitting our stride
after a busy time and putting the execution runs on the board. We're maintaining our discipline. The
company is running extremely well, and we're not done with our work to improve underlying financial
returns on capital employed. That's the goal. That's how we enlist long-term market sponsorship and
that's what ConocoPhillips is all about.
We're pleased to be where we're at here at midyear but we recognize the year is still young. Looking
forward to the second half of 2021, our priorities are squarely focused on executing our remaining plans

and programs for this year. Meanwhile, we're closely watching how the macro evolves and beginning our
internal process of setting our 2022 budget and capital plan. We'll stay actively engaged with the market
and look forward to ongoing discussions about how our plans are progressing. So let me turn the call over
to the operator and we'll begin the Q&A portion of the call.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Two quick questions for me. First 1 for you, Ryan, just your perspective on M&A in this current market.
You did a terrific transaction last year. But how do you think about the opportunity set that's out there for
either buying and selling? And the other one, this might be for Bill, it's just related to the quarter itself.
Was it a relatively clean quarter? Can we just simply say $4 billion of cash flow minus CapEx and then
annualize that free cash flow implies about a mid-teens type of free cash flow yield? But want to make
sure that we weren't missing any pieces here to the positive or negative, that would be more onetime in
nature.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Well, thanks, Neil. I'll start on the M&A side, I'll let Bill chime in on your second question. When we think
about the market, our approach is to constantly know what assets that we like, and we constantly are
reviewing the portfolio to look at the pieces inside the portfolio that are uncompetitive. So we're constantly
screening opportunities to both buy and sell assets and we're constantly trying to high-grade the portfolio.

I think the environment that we see today, certainly, it feels like more assets tend to come to the market.
But I don't think that makes it necessarily a buyer's or a seller's market today. I think what matters to
us is just to keep at the rigor and the discipline that we've described back in 2019. We continue through
today and continue through the Concho transaction that we did earlier back in January. And that's just the
rigor of our disciplined framework around cost of supply and value and simply being patient, Neil. I think
the market may require that even now more than ever. So I think that's a bit about how we think about
the inorganic side of the business. Now maybe turn it over to Bill and he can comment on the cash flow.

William L. Bullock
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Neil, this is Bill. It was a very clean quarter on a cash basis. It was clean for both cash and it was
clean for both earnings. As you're looking at your run rate, I'd point you to just 2 items to consider
though. The first one, and we mentioned this in the press release is that we did make a $200 million
discretionary pension plan contribution in the second quarter. That reduced our second quarter CFO, and
the contribution increased the pension plan's funding status above 90% and that eliminated the need to
pay the PBGC premium payments. It also leads to reduced financial statement volatility for the pension
and reduces some of our go-forward funding requirements. So that really did make good sense for use of
cash to us in the quarter. And so I draw that to your attention as a reduction in run rate.

And the other 1 that I point out as you're thinking about run rates would be our APLNG distributions. We
received distributions of $250 million from APLNG in the second quarter. That brings year-to-date about
$350 million. And we anticipate about $100 million in the third quarter and $700 million for the year.

So just as a reminder, we typically receive lower distributions in the first and third quarters and higher
distribution in the second and fourth quarters as you're thinking about the run rates on that. And that --
those APLNG distributions are pretty locked in for the year because of long-term LNG sales, LNG are price
lagged and so there's very little sensitivity to that for the remainder of the year.

And so as you're thinking about how to look at run rates for the rest of the year, I direct you to our
sensitivities that we provide, those still hold. And a good rule of thumb is about $300 million annualized
cash flow for every $1 million change in WTI. And with those, you ought to be pretty bang on with CFO
sensitivities.

Our next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on the quarter. It's interesting, Ryan, you kind of mentioned looking across at the industry
overall, an easier quarter for companies to do well. So let's maybe ask the question, what are some of
the things that may become headwinds as we think about some of the inflationary issues that may be
creeping up out there? What you would do to offset that and what you think maybe will allow you to
continue to separate from some of those companies we look over the next several quarters?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Roger. I can provide some comments. Maybe Dominic can add a little bit of color to that as
well. I think if you're a pure-play 1-basin kind of operator, you're probably going to experience certain
categories of spend that are inflating. I think the advantage that ConocoPhillips has right now is we're still
capturing a lot of the best practices and the synergies from the Concho transaction plus the fact that we're
a global diversified company. So other areas around the world are not inflating maybe like some of the
economies that are leading the recovery from the COVID pandemic.

So I think we're able to differentiate ourselves in that regard pretty clearly. We think it's imminently
manageable this year and as we go into next year. And I would add 1 other thing that seems to be missing
a little bit from the conversation, and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, and that's the unhedged
nature of our portfolio. I'm just surprised to hear the analysts aren't asking the question to the E&Ps that
are hedged, what happened. You could -- there could even be more cash flow if you hadn't hedged your
position. You shouldn't expect that from ConocoPhillips. We'll get the torque from the upside on the prices
as we described in my opening comments. But Dominic, I don't know if you have any more you can add to
the inflation part of Roger's question.

Dominic E. Macklon
Senior Vice President of Strategy & Technology

Thanks, Ryan. Yes, Roger, I think Ryan's covered it very well. I mean, I think the important point is that
we still have wind in our sails from the transaction. I mean, we did give our last synergy update on at
-- the market update of over $1 billion, and we said, well, that would be the last time we will give that
scorecard. But that does not mean we are done with sourcing supply chain efficiencies and operational
efficiencies. So we really still have wind in our sails on that.

I mean, we -- of course, we are seeing some inflation in tubulars, cement in the Lower 48, some pressure
on frac crews. But like Ryan said, being a global company really helps because we're still seeing deflation
in certain categories internationally. So I think that's an interesting question. And I think it really is
because we still have the momentum coming out of the transaction. We do think we're well placed to
manage inflationary effects.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I appreciate that, and I imagine the hedging and the unhedging comes back to the balance sheet strength
that you've been able to maintain. So congratulations on that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler.

Simmons & Company International, Research Division

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Maybe a couple ones here. I know that we've discussed this frequently in past quarters and on the recent
Analyst Day. But obviously, you continue to generate far more free cash than you're targeting to return to
shareholders via dividends and buyback. Should the environment remain supportive, can you talk a little
bit about the potential impact to pace of debt reduction versus share buybacks as you look forward? Would
you pay down debt just far more quickly than the 5-year original target that you had given or ramp up the
buyback more aggressively? Any thoughts there?

And then maybe a second follow-up. This is the first quarter that we saw the combined performance of
the legacy Conoco portfolio and the acquired Concho assets without some of the one-off noise that we saw
during the first quarter. And the outcome was outstanding, and I think your Lower 48 business certainly
exceeded our estimates quite materially. I know maybe hard at this point, but can you talk through
some of the things that may be exceeding expectations, either in terms of cost, well performance, capital
efficiencies or marketing efforts?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Thanks, Ryan. I'll -- maybe some comments. I can let Bill, and Tim obviously can chime in on the
Lower 48 a little bit. I'd say at a high level, the debt reduction plan that we announced in our June market
update, trying to take the gross debt off over the next 5 years. That still remains our target and our goal.
Shouldn't -- we're not right at this point, trying to increase that or necessarily accelerate that. We're going
to have some natural maturities that will retire and then we'll do some optimization of the debt. Bill can
provide a few more details about that.

But I think as we think through the commodity tailwinds that are in there right now, beyond the plans
that we talked about to the balance sheet, we feel pretty comfortable that those are in place, so any
incremental ought to be returns of capital back to the shareholder. Maybe Bill, if you want to add anything
to that and then I can let Tim chime in about the performance in the Lower 48.

William L. Bullock
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Ryan. So we do have about $1 billion in debt maturities that will be coming due before the
end of 2022. You should expect us to retire that debt as it comes due. And as we've previously said, any
potential debt refinancing and reduction will depend on multiple factors, including cost to retire debt, cost
to issue debt and how we decide to approach that broader debt reduction target. But we're in a really
strong position with the balance sheet right now. And so I think you should expect us to be patient in
evaluating market conditions as we continue to consider transactions to reduce our debt portfolio.

Timothy A. Leach
Executive VP of Lower 48 & Director

Yes. I think the only thing I'd have to add to that is as we've communicated in the market update, my
excitement about the performance of the Lower 48 couldn't be higher. When you take the different levels
of technology that we're applying to a broader set of really, really good assets, my expectation is that the
efficiencies we're getting out of our business, the performance of our business would just continue. So it's
a real driver of cash flow and value creation.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine
BofA Securities, Research Division

This is Kalei on for Doug. A couple of questions for me, maybe first off on M&A. Evident by the Concho
acquisition, obviously, Conoco has an affection for Permian assets at the right price, in the right locations,
et cetera. So there are no holes in Conoco's Permian position today. So there's no need to fill. But the
question is whether you would consider a large bolt-on acquisition at the right price. And if you would,
what would that bring to the table for ConocoPhillips?

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes, thanks. So I think as we, I think, I answered earlier, we have a pretty rigorous discipline kind of
framework for how we think about acquisitions. We know the assets in the areas that we really like. And
you shouldn't be surprised if we're looking at opportunities that are consistent with that framework and
contiguous to where we operate, but they have to compete within our cost of supply framework and the
discipline that we've brought to that and the patience that we've done, both on the buying and the selling
side.

So I would look at our history, our performance, what we've done not just in the Permian but Alaska,
Canada and elsewhere around the portfolio. So we're pretty -- we think about it pretty consistently, and
that's how we look at those kinds of inorganic opportunities.

Operator

Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Two questions for me. One, I guess, a bit of a follow-up just on uses of cash. You have nearly $9 billion of
cash and short-term equivalents on the balance sheet right now. As you said to Ryan's answer, you aren't
really looking to reduce debt at this point in time. So how do you think about this optionality? Is there a
trigger you're looking for to return even more cash back to shareholders? Or would you rather be linear
and just have the optionality of the cash on the balance sheet? And then the second question, just on Big
3, could you give us your latest update of where you stand with rig counts and frac crews by basin and
how you're thinking about activity levels for the second half of the year?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

All right. Thanks, Phil. I'll let Tim kind of chime in on the Big 3. Yes, as far as uses of cash, we've
communicated before and broadly, we like to carry some of the cash on the balance sheet for strategic
and reserve and operating purposes, and we've described that in quite a lot of detail in the past. I think
with the commodity price environment that we're seeing today, the balance sheet's in great shape, as Bill
described earlier on the last question. So I think as we get incremental free cash flow above and beyond
our means, we're not necessarily looking to continue to build a lot of cash on the balance sheet.

Shareholders should expect that they start getting incremental returns, if the -- if our view of the
commodity prices continues to hold. We've seen how volatile that can be and the fact that the market is
still pretty imbalanced. Demand is yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, and you got arguably 5 million or
more barrels a day of spare supply sitting in the market. So we still expect quite a lot of volatility, which is
why we like the strength of the balance sheet that we have today and holding some cash on that balance
sheet. And we'll continue to watch that macro market, which will inform our distribution strategy going
forward. Maybe, Tim, you could comment on the details around the Lower 48 rigs and frac spreads.

Timothy A. Leach
Executive VP of Lower 48 & Director

Sure. Just as a reminder, in the Lower 48, we invested about $1.5 billion so far in the first half of the
year. We expect that investment rate to stay steady throughout the remainder of the year. We're currently
running 15 rigs in the Lower 48, 11 in the Permian, 4 in the Eagle Ford. And we're running 7 frac spreads,
4 in the Permian and 3 in the Eagle Ford. And we expect those levels of activity to remain pretty constant
throughout the rest of the year, one of the big benefits of the size and scope that we have. We also have
various rigs running with our other operating partners in the Big 3, and we're keeping a close eye on that
to see and try to model what that activity is doing.

Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Two questions. First, deferred tax, can you discuss about how that as a potential source of fund in your
cash flow statement over the next several years? How is that progression is going to look like, given the
current commodity price environment? The second question is why I don't know if you can give us some
-- maybe share some market insight that what you see from the private producer, the operator there. I
think the publicly traded company, the capital discipline are pretty good, but we are concerned about the
activity level in the private side. What are you seeing there?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Let me -- you broke up there a little bit, Paul. I think your first question was around debt and the last
question around private operators. I think...

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

The first question is relate to the deferred tax and how that, as a source of cash, source of cash flow for
you guys over the next several years, given the current commodity prices.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes, okay. Thank you. Sorry. Thanks for the clarification, Paul. I can let Bill talk about the way we view
deferred taxes over the course of the plan that you're referring to. And I guess in general, to your second
one, on the private side, they are representing about 45-or-so percent of the rigs that are running in the
tight oil plays in the Lower 48 today. But they only account for about 22% of the current production of
about roughly 7 million barrels a day, probably increases the bid because they are pretty active, to your
point.

I think generally, as we think about it going forward, they run out of some of their best acreage over
the next couple of years. So we don't see them having an outsized impact on the growth coming from
the tight oil and being a dominant driver to U.S. production growth. That's really going to depend on the
strong public companies like ConocoPhillips that have the best rocks and the higher-quality rock versus the
private companies. So I think that's really the area to continue to focus on. Although we see, as well as
you do, in the short term, some of the incremental production that's coming out of the private operators.

We're certainly taking advantage of the commodity price environment that don't have maybe the investor
pressure on discipline and returns of capital back to their shareholders while they're trying to increase the
value of their properties as they go forward. So while a short-term thing, we don't think it will be a long-
term driver to what the U.S. tight oil play looks like. So let me ask Bill to chime in on the deferred tax
question.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Yes. Before that, one, can I just ask that there's some industry consultants forecasting the private
operator, they may be able to grow production by 0.5 million barrels per day next year or the next year --
the next couple of years. Do you believe that?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

That would probably be way at the upper end of our estimate, Paul. I don't think we would view that
much. We would probably be half or so of that kind of an estimate at their current kind of rig load.

Executive VP & CFO

Paul, it's Bill. On deferred taxes, if you look at -- for this quarter, we had about $360 million of deferred
taxes as a source of cash this quarter. That's primarily due to utilizing our U.S. tax loss carryforwards this
quarter. But if you look back to what we showed at the market update in June, the deferred taxes really
are not a material component of that $70 billion worth of free cash flow we showed at reference prices at
$50 WTI.

And we would expect that all of our significant businesses would be in a tax-paying position at that
reference price by about 2024. Now should the current prices continue, we'd expect to move into a tax-
paying position a bit earlier, maybe late 2022 or 2023 at current prices compared to 2024. But under
normalized $50 barrel prices, deferred taxes really aren't a source of tailwinds for us.

Thank you, Sanera. Now we go to Neal. Sorry, Neal. Thank you.

My apologies. Neal, please go ahead.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

The two I had was just first on in the marketing, you guys have done a great job continuing the
marketing. Just wondering the opportunities you see there either to export oil or other market
opportunities you would see to potentially see higher differentials. And then just as a second, a lot's
been talked about, obviously, your great debt repayment. I'm sorry, your debt -- I would say, your share
repurchase. Is that the primary sort of free cash flow now item over debt repayment or they sort of
coexist? Those are the 2 I have.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Neal. I think, yes, on your first one, we've got export capacity for some of our oil coming out
of the U.S. Lower 48. And in fact, we're doing some direct marketing with our commercial organization
that has been an uplift to our margins and netback prices. So we continue to see that as an opportunity
and have a longer-term goal to continue to grow that capacity and to be able to access some of those
unique opportunities in the export market. And in fact, not even going to traders, they pick it up at the
short line but going direct customer to customer, given some of our relations primarily in Asia and in
southern South America as well. So that's an opportunity for us as well.

On your second question, we announced our gross debt reduction plan, and that's consistent and equally
important to the share repurchases that we're doing today. Once we obviously get through that debt
optimization plan that we're doing, then returns of capital back to the shareholder would dominate. But

right now, it's -- we are in a dual track of looking at, as Bill described, retiring some of our near-term
debt maturities and then doing some optimization of our debt in the balance sheet as market conditions
continue to provide the right opportunity to do that.

Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.

Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just 1 for me on return of capital, which you've been very clear about in terms of plans and very
consistent about in terms of exceeding those plans. As we think about the multiyear outlook and the
target that you put out for aggregate cash returns, can you just remind us what some of the guideposts
are as you think internally about nailing down forms for that capital return in a given year?

Whether that's an optimal level for the dividend that you and the Board consider or if it's free cash flow
metrics above a certain threshold that keep buybacks even further front and center over any consideration
of a variable? Just trying to look for any parameters that can help us understand the thought process and
how discussions have been with shareholders.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I think I go back to our original sideboards of the fairway that we've described to the --
to our shareholders to our owners is that you should expect greater than 30% of our cash returning back
to our shareholders. That's on a quarterly and an annual basis. And if you look back at our history in the
last 5 years, that's averaged over 40%.

So I think -- and that's really the differentiation between our model for return of capital back to
shareholders and maybe some of the others that we've been reading about and that we've been hearing
about because it's not free cash flow-based. It is CFO-based. So as CFO grows because commodity prices
are up, the shareholders should expect to get more distribution. Now we've chosen the -- in our ordinary
dividend, we've said we want to be competitive. We want to grow that competitively with the S&P. That's
how we're measuring ourselves. That's how we're measuring our performance of return on capital, and
that's how we're measuring our performance of return of capital with respect to the ordinary dividend.

And then -- but we want that ordinary dividend to be resilient through the cycles. So we don't want to
-- we want to be able to afford it at the low end of the cycle, which we demonstrated last year through
the pandemic. And then we recognize, as we get additional torque that we described with higher prices,
because our cash flow is going to grow and our returns to our shareholders should grow as well. You
should expect that to come. And at a minimum, it's going to be 30%. So it's not a free cash flow-based
model. We think about it as a CFO-based model.

And as I said in my opening remarks, we continue to watch what the best distribution channel, maybe it's
a combination, maybe it's a hybrid down the road. We'll continue to watch that. But today, we feel like
our shares are a great buy in the market. So the channel that we've chosen right now at this 10 seconds
is to the strong ordinary dividend. It's yielding what it is today, combined with returning -- meeting our
threshold of greater than 30% through the share buyback channel.

We have another question from Doug Leggate.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

The real Doug.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

There's a number of calls I'm following, Ryan.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

I understand, Doug.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

I hate -- we need to get you guys to coordinate a little better. I'm kidding. Their fault, not yours. So joking
aside, Ryan, forgive me, I'm going to hit on the dividend question again. I want to preface couple of
examples. So BP announced the dividend increase. Their shares are up 6%. Shell announced the dividend
increase. Their shares on the day were up fairly significantly. I guess my point is that it seems, to us at
least, that market recognition of value tends to be through the dividend channel more than the buyback
channel.

You guys have done a phenomenal job of resetting your portfolio. You were spending $15 billion prior to
the dividend cut. And today, you've got better free cash flow power on 1/3 of the spending. Why not go
back to a bigger dividend that the market will pay you for?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Well, Doug, I think we've learned through the past history and you referenced the reductions that we
made coming out of the downturn in 2014 and 2015, that experience is there. And we got to make sure
the ordinary dividend is reliable, it's consistent, it's predictable, it's transparent, it's global over time
and it works through the cycles. And through the cycles is an important distinction here. So a lot of the
people that you've talked about raising the dividend have come out of the period where they cut it pretty
dramatically and maybe growing it back to a place that works through the cycles.

We feel like we've done that heavy lifting over the course of the last 4 to 5 years. And we're in a place now
where we're comfortable with the ordinary dividend. And like I said, we want to be competitive with the
S&P 500 as we go forward. But I pivot back to what's important is the shareholders are going to get 30%
of our cash flow or more on an ongoing basis. So you will get it. And maybe today, cash return is, to your
point, a little bit more in favor than buybacks. I could point to a couple of years ago where that wasn't the
case. I don't know what that case will be 6 or 12 months from now, but we're open to it. We're looking at
it, we're evaluating it. And you'll hear more from us about that particular piece of it as well. But today, I
think our shares are a pretty good buy.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Well, forgive me if I keep pounding on this issue, but I think your portfolio capital efficiency can support it,
in our view, and I don't think you're getting rewarded for it. So I'll keep pounding on that, Ryan, if that's
okay. Thanks so much for taking my question.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

I hear you, Doug.
