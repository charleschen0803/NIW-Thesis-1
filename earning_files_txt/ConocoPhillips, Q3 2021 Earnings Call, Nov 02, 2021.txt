Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Q3 2021 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sanera,
and I'll be the operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis. Ellen, you may begin.

Ellen R. DeSanctis
Senior Vice President of Corporate Relations

Thank you, Sanera, and welcome, everyone, to the third quarter earnings call. In the room with me today
are Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer; Tim Leach, our Executive Vice President of the Lower 48; Dominic Macklon, our Executive Vice
President of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology; Nick Olds, our Executive Vice President of Global
Operations. Mark Keener, our Vice President of Investor Relations, is also in the room today.

The format of our call will consist of some very brief prepared remarks, and then, as Sanera mentioned,
we'll go to Q&A. A few reminders. In conjunction with today's earnings release, we posted a deck of
supplemental material addressing third quarter earnings and cash flow results as well as some fourth
quarter full year 2021 guidance updates.

Today, we will make some forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could
differ due to the factors described in today's press release and in our periodic filings. And we'll mention
some non-GAAP financial measures this morning. You can find reconciliations to the nearest corresponding
GAAP measure in this morning's press release and on our website.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Ryan.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Ellen. As Ellen mentioned, I'll make a few opening comments, and then Bill will address a few
details about this quarter's results. And then we'll begin the Q&A session.

In this morning's release, I referred to the quarter's results as notable. Obviously, financial and operating
results were outstanding, but the context for describing them as notable meant something different.
For the past year, we've been integrating Concho, improving underlying metrics across the business and
creating the most competitive E&P for the energy transition. The significance of this quarter's performance
is that it represents the post-Concho go-forward baseline for the company.

On a run rate basis, the integration is essentially complete. We've captured the announced $1 billion of
synergies and savings from actions the company took in connection with the transaction, all ahead of
schedule. We're unhedged, but even more importantly, our torque to upside is helped by having high
conversion of revenue to income and cash flow. The core executables of our global operating plan are
delivering as expected.

We'll close out 2021 as a stronger company compared to any time in the past decade. Every aspect of our
triple mandate is moving in the right direction. Our underlying portfolio cost to supply is improving. Our
overall GHG intensity is lower. Our emissions intensity reduction targets are more stringent. Underlying
margins are expanding, and our trailing 12-month return on capital employed is headed toward an
estimated 14% by year-end, reflecting the benefit of more than just stronger commodity prices.

Between now and year-end, our top priority is closing the Shell transaction, which we expect to occur in
the fourth quarter. Once we close, we will be working diligently to integrate these properties and capture
efficiencies in a similar fashion to what we've achieved through the Concho integration. In addition to

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

layering in these properties on top of our existing high-performing platform, we're continuing to high-
grade our portfolio and optimize the business drivers everywhere. The setup for next year is, well, notable.

We're now in the process of setting our 2022 capital plans, which we expect to announce in early
December. Directionally, we don't anticipate a significant departure on CapEx from what we included in our
June update excluding Shell. In June, we provided an outlook based on a roughly $50 per barrel price that
included a modest ramp in the Lower 48 to reactivate our optimized plateau plans, some incremental base
Alaska investment and some longer-cycle low cost of supply investments in Canada, the Montney and in
Norway.

Since June, we see some inflation pressures, especially in the Lower 48. However, at this point, we'd
expect to adjust scope modestly in order -- in response to maintain our base capital at a level that is
roughly consistent with our June update. And then, of course, we'll add CapEx for the Shell properties
once we've brought them into the portfolio.

As we finalize our 2022 plans, we're watching the macro closely, keeping an eye on inflation and potential
OBO pressures and undertaking our typical capital high-grading processes. It goes without saying the
market certainly appears to be more constructive, but we must always remember that this is an incredibly
volatile business. But there's more to come on that in December.

It's certainly been a busy year for the company but an incredibly successful one so far, and that's thanks
to our dedicated and talented ConocoPhillips workforce. We believe we're entering a very constructive
time for the sector, but even so, we know that there will be relative winners. The relative winners will
be companies with the lowest cost of supply investment options, peer-leading delivery of returns on and
of capital and visible progress on lowering emissions intensity. That's what we offer. Our third quarter
represents a glimpse and a strong jumping-off point to what you can expect from ConocoPhillips going
forward.

So now let me turn it over to Bill, who will cover some of the key items from this quarter.

William L. Bullock
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Ryan. To begin, adjusted earnings were $1.77 per share for the quarter. Relative to consensus,
this performance reflects production volumes that were slightly above the midpoint of guidance, better-
than-expected price realizations and lower-than-expected DD&A.

As for the better realizations, we captured a higher percentage of Brent pricing in our overall realized
prices. We've provided supplementary information in this morning's material to address the realizations
variance. And as Ryan mentioned, we're unhedged so we're getting full exposure to the current higher
prices. As for DD&A, we're trending lower compared to the previous guidance as a result of positive
reserve revisions due to higher prices. You saw in today's release that we lowered full year 2021 DD&A
guidance from $7.4 billion to $7.1 billion.

Excluding Libya, production for the quarter was 1,507,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which
represents about 2% underlying growth. Lower 48 production averaged 790,000 barrels a day, including
about 445,000 from the Permian, 217,000 from the Eagle Ford and 95,000 from the Bakken. At the end
of the quarter, we had 15 operated drilling rigs and 7 frac crews working in the Lower 48. Across the rest
of our operations, the business ran extremely well. In particular, our planned seasonal turnaround activity
across several regions went safely and smoothly.

You will have noticed that we provided production guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year
2021 in this morning's release. This reflects the impact of a decision we're making to convert Concho
2-stream contracted volumes to a 3-stream reporting basis as part of our ongoing efforts to create
marketing optionality across the Lower 48. We expect to convert the majority of our contracts in the
fourth quarter. Reported production is expected to increase by approximately 40,000 barrels a day, and
both revenue and operating costs will increase by roughly $70 million. In other words, this conversion is
earnings neutral.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Besides DD&A and production, there were no other changes to 2021 guidance items. Now once we've
closed the Shell acquisition and can see where the ongoing U.S. tax legislation conversation lands, we'll
provide an updated earnings and cash flow sensitivities that consider such factors as projected 2022 price
ranges and how those ranges might impact our cash taxpaying position in various jurisdictions around the
globe.

Coming back to third quarter results. Cash from operations was $4.1 billion, which was reduced by
about $200 million for nonrecurring items, so a bit higher than the average of external estimates on an
underlying basis. Free cash flow was almost $3 billion this quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, this is
about $6.5 billion.

Through the first 9 months of the year, we've returned $4 billion to shareholders, and we're on track to
meet our target of returning nearly $6 billion by the end of 2021. This is through a combination of our
ordinary dividend and buybacks.

So to summarize, as Ryan said, it was a notable quarter. The company is running exceptionally well, and
we've achieved a significant reset of the base business post Concho. That creates a powerful platform for
entering next year.

We're focused on closing the Shell Permian acquisition so that we can begin the work of getting those
properties fully integrated into the business, setting our capital plans for 2022, maintaining a leading
position of returns on and of capital and lowering our emissions intensity. That's the triple mandate. That's
what ConocoPhillips is all about. And we look forward to providing additional information in December.
I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of today's call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Hopefully you can hear me.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, we can.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Sorry, just it was like really quiet there. Anyway, I just want to come back to the inflation question. I know
you'll talk more about CapEx in December, but maybe an idea of what you have seen to date and where
you think the bigger inflation headwinds may arise.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Sure, Roger. As we're kind of in the middle of -- like I said in our opening comments, in the middle
of putting all our plans together. Right now, the supply chain organization tells me that globally, we're
thinking about mid-single-digit kind of inflation rates as we go into 2022. But it's bifurcated into 2 pieces:
the U.S. being, depending where you're at geographically in the U.S., anywhere from kind of the low
double digits to the higher single digits, the Permian being the area probably that's most influenced or
most experiencing inflation right now and as we go into 2022; and then the rest of the world though still
at about 2% to 3% inflation rates kind of globally. So the categories that you can imagine are inflating
right now certainly are those that are in need here in the U.S. as we start to recover out of the low point,
things like OTCG (sic) [ OCTG ], labor, sand, pressure pumping and the likes.

I think as we think about it going forward, it's an opportunity for us to try to offset as much of that
through some modest scope reduction and efficiencies, which I think is where Tim is focused in the Lower
48. I can ask -- Tim, if you want to add anything to that relative to the Lower 48, in the Permian.

Timothy A. Leach
Executive VP of Lower 48 & Director

No, I think that covered most of it. But I would say that where we are seeing inflation on those items, we
have size and scale advantages of our combined organizations. And the operations continue to improve in
the Lower 48, so I think there's many ways that we can mitigate those inflation factors.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just since it's been in the news quite a bit, what's been going on in Alaska, I was
just curious. While it can't go forward, what do we think about in terms of other opportunities in Alaska?
And have you noticed any meaningful changes since Hilcorp became the other partner in Prudhoe Bay?

Nicholas G. Olds
Executive VP of Global Operations

Yes. Roger, this is Nick. Just maybe a quick update on Willow. As you've probably seen in the press, both
the Department of Justice and ourselves decided not to appeal the Alaska District Court decision. We
feel the best and most efficient approach there is to really work through the 3 substantive issues that

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

7

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

were identified in the district court ruling. We'll do that through additional NEPA analysis. We're currently
engaged with the BLM and the cooperating agencies up there, just working through those 3 particular
issues.

As you look forward, as we've mentioned, we continue to work through our detailed engineering in service
of continued refinement of our cost and schedule and any development modifications, all in service of
doing an FID. If you look at 2022, our capital program, that will reflect the continued engineering work.
And then from a shareholder standpoint, we still see significant support from the Alaska delegation, the
State of Alaska as well as the North Slope Borough. So we remain committed on this front.

As far as other projects, we spoke about in the June 30 market update, in part, as an example, we've
got Nuna, we've got Coyote. These will leverage existing infrastructure, so existing pads, facilities and
pipelines, very low cost of supply opportunities that we're progressing. And then on the Prudhoe front,
we're seeing great efficiency improvements and safety performance. They continue to reduce costs across
the board. So our teams are heavily engaged. So all 3 legacy assets are performing well.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Our first question is on Scope 3. In conjunction with the Shell Permian acquisition, you announced an
improvement in your Scope 1 and 2 emission intensity targets, which is great. At this year's meeting, I
believe shareholders voted in favor of the company setting Scope 3 reduction targets as well. So could you
maybe update us on the company's strategy for addressing that vote? And perhaps any color on feedback
that you've received from your shareholders regarding Scope 3 reduction targets for Conoco.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Sure, Jeanine. I'll -- let me make a few comments, and I'll turn it over to Dominic, who's been
involved at all our shareholder engagement activity that's a normal part of our process this time of year.
But yes, you saw consistent or coincident with the Shell acquisition announcement that we increased our
targets related to Scope 1 and Scope 2. And not -- maybe hopefully not missed in that, we went from a
gross operated to a net equity, which we think the industry needs to move to as well. So it's not only what
you operate, it's what you are involved in from a net equity perspective. So yes, pretty focused on our
commitment to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2.

And then as you state, we did get a resolution. It got 50-some percent of the vote, not binding but
one that we have to engage with our shareholders on. So we've been doing that on the Scope 3 side
specifically. And I can get Dominic maybe to comment on what that looks like and what we've heard so far
from shareholders.

Dominic E. Macklon
Executive VP of Strategy, Sustainability & Technology

Well, thanks, Jeanine, for the question. We are continuing in dialogue with shareholders. This is an
ongoing process on this very important matter. I think to share some key elements of that dialogue, as an
E&P company, we continue to believe our Paris-aligned climate risk framework that we launched about a
year ago is both credible and ambitious and addresses the realities of our triple mandate that you often
hear us talking about. So that's responsibly meet transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns
and achieve net zero emissions on the emissions we control, and that's Scope 1 and Scope 2.

And we have established just earlier this year a dedicated low-carbon technology group, and they are
supporting our business units in their ongoing progress to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 targets and our net
zero ambition. But we are not ignoring Scope 3 end-use emissions. So our new low-carbon group are
also working to develop new opportunities in low-carbon businesses with a focus on carbon capture and

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

storage and hydrogen, both of which have a strong adjacency to our core business and our competencies.
But those opportunities must, of course, deliver competitive returns for shareholders.

And on the policy side, we continue to advocate for a well-designed economy-wide price on carbon, and
we see that as the most viable solution for addressing demand and actually reducing Scope 3 end-use
emissions. But we don't believe a Scope 3 target for a Paris-aligned E&P company like ConocoPhillips
makes sense as it wouldn't address consumer demand and it would shift supply away from top-tier ESG
producers to less accountable producers and jurisdictions.

And we believe, in fact, that a Paris-aligned E&P company with a focus on low GHG intensity and low cost
of supply of production has a valuable and crucial role actually to play in the energy transition. So now
of course, we take our stakeholder -- our shareholders' views very seriously, and we're continuing our
engagement to understand their perspectives. It's an ongoing process. We'll continue that through the
next couple of months here. But that perhaps gives you a flavor of the nature of the dialogue.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's really helpful. We look forward to the carbon capture and hydrogen development.

So I guess our second question, maybe a little housekeeping item here, is on the affiliate distributions. So
the distributions, they were slightly below what we think was implied by prior commentary on the 2Q call,
and it was a little bit below our forecast. So we're just wondering if there was anything unexpected related
to the timing of distributions, we understand there's seasonality for the quarter, or if there's any change in
the full year outlook of $700 million in APLNG distributions for this year?

William L. Bullock
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Jeanine. We received distributions of $85 million from APLNG in the third quarter, and that brings
our total year-to-date to $430 million for the year. And we now expect full year distributions of around
$750 million from APLNG this year.

As you noted and as a reminder, we typically receive lower distributions in the first and third quarters and
higher distributions in the second and fourth quarters. And as you think about APLNG, due to the pricing
lag with APLNG's long-term LNG sales, there's really little sensitivity to price for the remainder of 2021
distributions as LNG pricing is essentially set. So we feel very good about $750 million for the full year.

Operator

Our next question is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And let me start by thanking Ellen for her service to the industry and to the investment community.
Congratulations on your retirement, Ellen. You are going to be sorely missed.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Neil Singhvi Mehta

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

And she's not going to escape us completely either.

Ellen R. DeSanctis
Senior Vice President of Corporate Relations

You're in great hands. It's been an honor everybody, truly an honor. And ConocoPhillips won't miss a beat.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's great. Well, you've left it in great shape.

Ryan, I want to kick off on a big-picture question for you. And then Tim, I had a follow-up for you on
the Permian. But the big-picture question is, Ryan, do you think we're at the beginning of a structural
up cycle here, which is we've been through 7 years of a very dark period of oversupply in the industry?
Underinvestment might be kicking in here. Do you see multiple years ahead of a potential recovery?

And to the extent we actually are at the beginning of a structural up cycle, the last time we had one,
the industry destroyed a lot of value over the long term by not seizing the opportunity appropriately.
And so as a leader of the E&P industry, what is the message you're telling your folks about how you do it
differently this time to create structural value to the extent you have a period of excess cash flow?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No. Thanks, Neil. Certainly, pretty constructive for a number of reasons. We're seeing the demand
recovery post pandemic. And for all the reasons you stated, this becomes a -- turns into a supply problem.
And I think that's going to be some pretty constructive tailwinds for the industry.

So yes, you asked a bit of a provocative question there. So what would I say? Maybe a few things. For
my peers, I would say we've got to restore sector sponsorship. And that's only going to happen through
consistent returns on capital employed, and they have to be competitive with the market. I think that's the
opposite of what we saw in this boom/bust industry. So I think investors need to have us on a short lease
and -- short leash, and I think that would be good for this sector. So that's kind of what I would tell my
peers.

What would I tell investors? It is different right now because I think shale industry is being run as a free
cash flow business. And so now we have short-cycle inventory that can be managed for returns of and
returns on capital. But I think you have to remember one thing in that shale business, that inventory
quality really does matter.

Because the ones with the best inventory like ConocoPhillips, we're going to be able to make market-
competitive returns, and we can do that without having -- blowing through the roof on growth. So with
modest growth, you can deliver those kinds of market-competitive returns for people that have the top-
quality shale inventory. And I think that's a pretty big paradigm shift. So that discipline on growth and
returns on and of capital really, really matters.

Lastly, and this would be for investors and my peers, for everyone really, is the energy transition is
happening. We are going through a transition today, but I think that's a new lens that we have to look at
this business through, and it requires a bit of new thinking. And I think Dominic just referred to that in the
last question that Jeanine had, which is our triple mandate. We must do those 3 things simultaneously,
and we've got to do them really, really well.

So we have to meet the transition demand. Whatever slope that demand going on, we've got to be there
to supply it with low cost of supplies barrels because we've got to deliver on our returns. And we've got
to meet our net zero ambition ultimately by 2050 in this business. So I guess that would be the few

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

things that I would offer, Neil. And really, shame on us if this industry can't do it, and I can guarantee you
ConocoPhillips will.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes, you guys absolutely have delivered the playbook. And that's a good dovetail into you, Tim. And just
your perspective on the Permian position at this point, and specifically talk about where we are in terms of
integration of the Concho assets. And you've probably gotten more time to take a look under the hood of
the Shell assets. How do you feel about what you've acquired?

Timothy A. Leach
Executive VP of Lower 48 & Director

Yes. It's pretty exciting that -- first of all, I'm really proud of our team of being able to integrate this
Concho acquisition and deliver on all the production and cash flow and get the wells drilled and not miss
a beat on execution and so -- and deliver all the synergies that we've talked about. That's an important
concept as well.

So things -- the blocking and tackling of our business is going really well in the Permian. But in addition
to that, ConocoPhillips has 4 really great shale basins in the U.S. And watching how information is
being transferred, how much teamwork is going on between those groups, they're continuing to make
everything better. The wells are getting better. We're delivering more efficiency all the time. So that's
exciting for the future.

And then when you look at the opportunity with the Shell acquisition, what we can do with those assets
and how we can create value with them -- and that's kind of what our teams live and die for, is the
opportunity to go get something like that and make it better. So I'm pretty excited, and I'm proud of the
work that's being done right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Stephen Richardson from Evercore.

Stephen I. Richardson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I was wondering if I could follow up on that last question with Tim. Tim, I appreciate that you haven't
closed the Shell transaction yet and haven't got your hands on the assets, but it seems to us one of the
big areas of upside could come from equalizing working interest and some swaps and trades and blocking
up your total position, including Shell. Could you just talk a little bit about that opportunity as you see it?
And have you had incomings from industry knowing that you will be the holder of those assets in short
order?

Timothy A. Leach
Executive VP of Lower 48 & Director

Yes. Managing assets like that is kind of what I think we do best. And there are so many different ways
that we can create value, from the way the wells are drilled, the way the wells are completed, the
marketing arrangements. And it also gives us the opportunity with those additional assets coming in. We
have way more flexibility on what we can dispose of and how we can high-grade our portfolio.

So it's -- it gives us the opportunity to do what I think we're really good at from an operation standpoint
but also from property management. And the swaps and trades, we have a dedicated group around that,
and they can create a lot of value in the basin. All the operators are trying to get out of each other's way
and not have so much outside operated and create longer lateral drilling opportunities, all kind of things
like that.

If I could just follow up with Bill on Cenovus specifically. It looks -- from what we can glean from the
public filings, it looks like that sell-down is happening kind of in a pretty orderly way in terms of pace. But
I was wondering if you could talk about experience so far executing on that. And also, noted a nice uptick
in the contingent payment associated with that Western Canadian sale a number of years back at these
oil prices. And maybe you could remind us all of the quantum of that and where that will stand and the
duration of that as well, please.

William L. Bullock
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Happy to. So first, starting with the CVE monetization program. We've sold about 67 million
shares year-to-date. That's about 30% of our original balance. And so we reduced our equity stake in
Cenovus from about 10% to about 7%. And those proceeds have been used to buy back about $600
million of Conoco bulk shares through the third quarter. And you'll note on our slides for cash that, that
was about $400 million for the third quarter.

We have accelerated our sales. We expect to exit our position sometime early part of next year, and we're
executing those sales in a thoughtful and measured way. We continue to monitor market conditions as we
move forward. Assuming that they remain supportive, we'll be out early part of next year.

You also asked about the contingent payments from Cenovus. During the quarter, we recognized about
$100 million in pretax earnings, bringing our year-to-date total to about $200 million so far in Cenovus
contingent payments. And at current pricing, we'd expect to recognize another $100 million in the fourth
quarter. Now the contingent term expires at the end of the second quarter 2022. But at current strip
prices, we'd expect to continue to accrue contingent payments in the first and second quarter of next year.

It's probably also worth mentioning that we are still continuing to receive contingent payments also from
our San Juan sale. Just would throw that in there a bit. We've accumulated so far $30 million in pretax this
year with $21 million in the third quarter and expect to accrue another $21 million on that in the fourth
quarter. And at current prices, that should continue through calendar year next year.

Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Let me add my congratulations to Ellen. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be on the call list, Ellen, but good
luck and thanks for all your help over the years. Really, we're going to miss you.

A couple of things, if I may. Ryan, I know we get to the cash return question a lot when I come to
question you on this. But I just wonder if I could pick your brain on whether your thinking is evolving. And
what I'm looking at is you're pretty much bigger than BP at this point. You're knocking on the door of both
Total and Shell in terms of scale. And on average, your yield is about -- running about 60% of those peers.
You could easily step that dividend up and get greater recognition for the value proposition, in my opinion.
Why not?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think I tried to be pretty clear, Doug. I appreciate the question and the push. I think what I tried to
be pretty clear about is our 30% of CFO is going back to the shareholders. So that's a commitment you
can take to the bank as an investor in ConocoPhillips. And with this run-up in the prices that we've seen
here lately, you should expect to get 30% of our cash coming from our operations as a result.

You asked, "What about the channel?" I'd say maybe before the channel conversation, too, the Shell
acquisition will probably look to try to put some more money onto the balance sheet as we go through the
course of this. But more directly to your question about the channel, I've been comfortable, based on our

outlook and our view of the macro, where things are going right now, to split the distribution between the
ordinary dividend and share repurchase.

So how do I think about the ordinary dividend? For me, it needs to be something that's incredibly reliable.
It's transparent. It's global. It's reliable. You can count on it. You can take it to the bank. And it works at
the downside of this sector in the -- whenever we go through those downturns. That's how I think about
the dividend.

And I think you can get your fork when these times are pretty good, but I think you got to think about
the dividend being commitment, reliable, always there and it's growable. And so that's how I think about
the dividend. But more importantly, you should expect to get 30% of our cash coming back from our
operations. That's our commitment. That's what we've done for a number of years, and that's what we're
going to continue to go do. So as that CFO goes up, you're going to get those dollars.

And we've been pretty open to the channel. We've had this conversation with the market and with our
investors. And as we see circumstances changing, we're not locked into a specific channel to go do that.
But -- so I take your point, Doug. I think -- I probably think about the ordinary dividend just a little bit
differently.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

I appreciate the answer. I guess it's more about trying to figure out what the market is best prepared to
recognize, is kind of what's behind my question. But I appreciate the answer.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And that recognition, Doug, needs to be over the long term, not just over a month or a quarter. But
well, what builds value? What's the right model over the long haul in a very volatile business?

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Sure. Very different capital structure today for you guys than a few years ago.

My follow-up is very quickly -- you touched on high-grading the portfolio. I don't think we've heard you
say that in a little while, and obviously, you've now got a very large slug of production coming in. I just
wonder if I could push you a little bit to touch on some of the things you were thinking there to flesh that
out. And I'll leave it there.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, thanks, Doug. I think we've sold through this quarter a couple of hundred million dollars worth of
assets. Those are largely in the Lower 48. We've got another couple of large packages in the Lower 48 on
the market today that are significantly larger than what we've talked about closing today and a couple of
other things.

But we're pretty committed. We announced at the -- after the Shell transaction that we would sell $4
billion to $5 billion. We had $2 billion to $3 billion out in the market from the June market update. We're
well on the road to delivering that $2 billion to $3 billion.

We upped that to $4 billion to $5 billion as a result of the Shell transaction just because, when we get
the first look at the portfolio, primarily in the Permian, we think there's going to be some cleanup that
we can do with Tim's team and the trading and the swapping that he described earlier and some outright
sales. So feel pretty comfortable with that $4 billion to $5 billion target. Obviously, takes us into 2023, but
making probably a lot of progress through the first half of next year in delivering those targets.

Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My first question is just on the prior guidance around the ending 4Q cash balances post the Shell
acquisition of about $4 billion in cash. Any updated thoughts there now that we've gone through 3Q? And
any other moving pieces that you talked about on the call here today?

William L. Bullock
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Phil. We still feel very good about that $4 billion of ending cash. The Shell transaction headline
price is $9.5 billion, but the effective date is July 1 of this year. And so as we go through the year, we
would expect to end up with a little over $4 billion of cash by the end of this year.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then second question, Bill, for you would be -- you gave a little teaser in your prepared remarks
around cash taxes. Do you have any updated thoughts around when you would become a cash taxpayer,
kind of factoring in the impacts of the Shell acquisition, the higher oil prices, et cetera?

William L. Bullock
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Phil. So at current pricing, if current pricing continues into 2022, we would expect to move into
a significant taxpaying position in the U.S. by early to mid-2022.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And how about just for the overall company?

William L. Bullock
Executive VP & CFO

Well -- so the overall company would be similar. So if you look across our international assets, many of
them are already in a cash taxpaying position, so the main change is in the U.S.

Our question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.

Let me add first my congratulations to Ellen, and wish you a wonderful and healthy retirement. So thank
you for your help.

Ellen R. DeSanctis
Senior Vice President of Corporate Relations

Thank you.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Two questions. Maybe this is for Tim. Maybe we read too much. In the third quarter, Eagle Ford production
actually is sequentially down. I think in your previous 10-year strategic long term, the target is Eagle Ford
may be reaching, say, close to about 300 in the longer term and stay there for a long period of time.

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

So wondering, with the asset -- Permian asset, is that still the game plan and what we've seen in the third
quarter is just the timing of the well coming onstream or we should read more on that? So that's the first
question. And maybe I will ask the second question maybe later.

Timothy A. Leach
Executive VP of Lower 48 & Director

Good. Thank you. Yes. The way we think about managing the Eagle Ford and the Bakken and the Permian
is one asset that we can allocate capital around. But we've said on this call before that the Eagle Ford and
the Bakken are much closer to being at their optimal plateau than the Permian is. The Permian doesn't get
there for a long time.

But we are increasing activity in the Eagle Ford. It will be at that optimal plateau rate that you referenced.
And the sequential quarter-over-quarter is more about timing and things like that of wells coming online.
But I'm very pleased with the performance of that asset. And there have been things like refracs and other
things that we've talked about that have continued to improve the performance of the Eagle Ford.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Tim, when do you think Eagle Ford will reach that plateau kind of production rate, in 2024, 2025 or maybe
sooner? So in other words, how aggressive are you going to ramp that up?

Timothy A. Leach
Executive VP of Lower 48 & Director

Yes. Well, it's -- we haven't given guidance on things like that. But generally, it reaches its plateau much
sooner.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And the second question maybe is for Bill or for Ryan. I think when you set up the $6 billion on the
cash return, that's based on the $60 WTI for this year. Obviously, the price is much stronger. So should
we assume that you're going to return more than that or because of the Shell transaction, you're going to
stick to that and just have the additional cash to strengthen the balance sheet?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, at this point, we're -- our guidance is the $6 billion of return this year. And stay tuned for what
that looks like for next year. But yes, we're sticking to the plans we have in place for 2021 that gets us
pretty close to $6 billion total return. That's through the ordinary dividend and through our -- the shares
that we're buying and the shares that we're swapping with CVE or Cenovus.

Operator

Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Ryan, just a quick follow-up on what you just said. I just want to make sure I was clear on the shareholder
return, on the $6 billion. It looked like the bulk -- a good size of that, I think 1/3 of it is coming this
quarter. Is that just the result of how it played out from the cash flow -- the stated cash flow payout?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think you probably saw some ramp-up in the swap with the Cenovus shares. The dividend is
obviously ratable across the 4 quarters other than the raise that we announced here recently. And we had
-- we restarted our share buybacks outside of the Cenovus swap after the first quarter. So yes, they're

15

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

not quite ratable. And you saw the ramp-up there in the third quarter if you look at our results, and you
should assume that, that continues into the fourth quarter.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. Great clarification. And my second, probably for Tim. Tim, you just mentioned earlier on the
activity. My question is more on Permian activity that you were talking about. I know one of your peers
suggested kind of a notable increase in Permian activity for remainder of this year and into '22. And I'm
just wondering, post the Shell deal, would we continue to see a ramp in that?

I just want to see if that's what you were indicating on the last -- given you mentioned the plateau on the
other 2 plays. Could we see some ramp there? Or is it still in the works to hold things steady? Obviously
knowing you don't have '22, '23 guidance out yet.

Timothy A. Leach
Executive VP of Lower 48 & Director

Yes. We haven't completed all our planning for next year. That's what Ryan referred to that we're still
going through. But I would tell you that as we're planning for Shell, until we get our hands on the steering
wheel, that's kind of just continuing the level of activity that they currently have going on there.

I would tell you that we really believe strongly in the steady as she goes. And as we add activity, it will be
ratable and kind of a -- I wouldn't call it a ramp. I would call it slow steady growth because I think that
will build the most efficiency in our operations.

Operator

Our next question comes from John Freeman from Raymond James.

John Christopher Freeman
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I just -- I wanted to revisit the 10-year plan, which obviously got enhanced after the Shell transaction.
And just when I'm thinking about the different sort of, I guess we'll call them, toggles that you have,
obviously, given the unhedged nature of the portfolio, you've talked about if you do have a $10 higher oil
price, then your oil assumption there, it's an incremental $35 billion. And I'm just trying to make sure that
I'm on the same page with how you all are thinking about that.

The last time that the free cash flow got enhanced from a Shell transaction with the incremental,
let's call it, $10 billion over that 10-year plan, that full $10 billion basically went to the incremental
shareholder distributions. So I'm just trying to -- I guess, Ryan, just how do you think about what it would
theoretically take for you ought to look at something other than that kind of 3% kind of production CAGR?
Is it just it doesn't really matter what the oil price is, the incremental goes to the shareholder distribution?
Or just how you think about it, Ryan, would be helpful.

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, thanks, John. I think -- yes, I think you should think about it on top -- again, the market update
plan was at a $50 a barrel price deck. So our commitment to our investors is that 30% of the cash will
go back to the shareholders. As prices increase and our cash flows increase, you should expect the
distribution to the shareholders to increase.

We're still going to maintain a very strong balance sheet, and having some cash on the balance sheet is
important to the company. And then we'll deliver modest growth. That's always been kind of an output
out of our plans. We want to make sure that we have a good idea of where the macro is going to go for
the next year. We're going to set our capital budget plans to deliver the strongest returns on that capital
that we can manage. We don't want to blow into the face of really high super inflation. We've seen what

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

CONOCOPHILLIPS FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

that's done before to return, so we'll be very conscious of that as we go into what we think is a pretty
constructive view of the macro going for the next 2 to 3 years.

So you ought to expect us to act like we've done in the past. We'll be really judicious how we spend our
capital, make sure we're getting the most out of every capital dollar we can. Shareholders are going to get
30% of their cash back. They'll get that through the dividend and through some share buyback, maybe
another channel. We'll see if that's the right thing to do for the company with where we're at, and we're
going to maintain a very strong balance sheet as we go through this process.

But adding the Shell just made the company better, made it more resilient and made more cash flow and
more -- so that means there'll be more returns of capital back to the shareholder. And then remember
we're running the Shell assets just like we're running our own Lower 40 asset -- or Lower 48 assets at
about a 50% to 60% reinvestment rate. We're -- again, that's what I tried to say at the beginning. We're
executing the Shell differently than what this industry did a number of years ago.

Ellen R. DeSanctis
Senior Vice President of Corporate Relations

This is Ellen. We'll take John's second question and then wrap it up.

John Christopher Freeman
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just my follow-up question. Ryan, you talked about the inflationary pressure you're seeing
in the Lower 48 with that kind of high single-digit to low double-digit inflation versus the international part
of your portfolio, which is still rather modest at kind of 2% to 3% inflation. Obviously, Tim and his team
have done a great job on the efficiency gain side on the Lower 48.

But it doesn't sound like, at least for the 2022 plan, that we should anticipate any material shift in sort
of that, I guess, international versus Lower 48 sort of mix. But just -- I realize this is oversimplifying it.
But like how wide would that spread have to be from a service concentration perspective, Lower 48 versus
international, where we might see you lean a little bit more on the international portfolio?

Ryan M. Lance
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I don't think we'll probably allocate capital based on how we see those different inflation rates going.
So I think we just want to be clear about how we kind of see it developing in the significant categories of
spend that we have in the company and try to give you an idea of what we're seeing today. We'll continue
to watch it.

I think it probably more goes to our Lower 48 business. If we see hyperinflation and start seeing it running
away from us, we might adjust our scope modestly. So we're not going to try to go into that. So again,
it's with a, really, focus on making sure the returns are adequate for the capital that we're investing. And I
think Tim said in one of his responses we're a large company. We've got a very sophisticated supply chain
organization, very sophisticated commercial organization, and the efficiencies that we're bringing out of
the business are still there. So we think we have a way to mitigate quite a lot of it, and we'll just adjust
our plans if it gets out of control as an example.

So that's where we stand out as an E&P company. We're global. We're big. And that's a huge advantage to
us when we think about the impacts of these kinds of things on our business.
