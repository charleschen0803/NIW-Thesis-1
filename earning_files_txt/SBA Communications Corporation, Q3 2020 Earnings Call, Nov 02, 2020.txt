Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please
go ahead.

Mark DeRussy
Vice President of Finance

Thank you, Rich. Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and
Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.

Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward looking, including, but not limited to, any
guidance for 2020 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that
may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, November 2,
and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make.

In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The
reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial
data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.

With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA once again had very strong results in the third quarter, exceeding our
expectations in all key financial metrics.

Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $486.8 million, and cash site leasing revenues
were $486.1 million. Foreign exchange rates were a $1 million tailwind to revenues when compared with
our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the third quarter. They were again, however, a significant
headwind on comparisons to the third quarter of 2019, negatively impacting revenues by $20.1 million on
a year-over-year basis.

Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant
currency basis, was 4.1% over the third quarter of 2019, including the impact of the 1.9% of churn. On a
gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.0%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth
over the third quarter of last year was 5.7% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 2.2% of
churn.

Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during
the third quarter, increased over the first half of 2020 levels, but remains below levels we were seeing in
a year-ago period. The sequential increase in domestic new bookings was driven primarily by increased
activity with T-Mobile. Based on conversations with our customers and continued growth in our domestic
application backlog, we anticipate seeing this activity continue to increase in the fourth quarter and into
2021.

During the third quarter, amendment activity remained the large majority of our domestic bookings, with
newly signed up domestic leasing revenue coming 80% from amendments and 20% from new leases.
The big 3 carriers represented 83% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the
quarter.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7.1%,
including 0.4% of churn or 7.5% on a gross basis. Our international leasing activity was up modestly
over first half 2020 levels, but still remains impacted by continued COVID-related spending reductions
by our customers in a number of our markets. This quarter, Brazil was again the largest contributor to
international lease-up. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 9.0% on a constant currency basis.

During the third quarter, 86% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars.
The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 10.8% of
all cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues
from pass-through expenses.

Tower cash flow for the third quarter was $396.8 million. Our tower cash flow margins continue to lead the
industry, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.3% and the international tower cash
flow margin of 71.0% or 19.1% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $373.3 million. Our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin
was 71.5% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of revenues
from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.8%. Approximately 98% of our total
adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter.

AFFO in the third quarter was $270.1 million. AFFO per share was $2.38, an increase of 10.7% over the
third quarter of 2019 and a 15.3% increase on a constant currency basis. Our outperformance in AFFO
was partially attributable to reduced net cash interest expense resulting from the termination of the
company's $1.95 billion notional value interest rate hedge on a portion of our 2018 term loan in exchange
for a one-time cash payment of $176.2 million.

This termination, in combination with the new interest rate swap entered into by the company on the
same day, fixing the interest rate of 1.87% on $1.95 billion of our 2018 term loan, will result in annualized
cash interest expense savings of $37.2 million. The impact to 2020 net cash interest expense is a
reduction of $16.3 million.

During the third quarter, we also continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 44 communication sites and
1 data center for total cash consideration of $73.5 million and building a total of 75 sites in the quarter.
Subsequent to quarter-end, we have purchased 54 communication sites for an aggregate price of $14.6
million. And we have agreed to purchase 132 additional sites for an aggregate price of $85 million. We
anticipate closing on a majority of these sites by the end of the first quarter of 2021.

We also continue to invest in the land under our sites, which provides both strategic and financial benefits.
During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $7.2 million to buy land and easements and to extend
ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land
underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases,
including renewal options under our control, is approximately 35 years.

In our earnings press release this afternoon, we included an update to our outlook for full year
2020, providing increases in all key metrics. Strong leasing revenue and services results in the third
quarter were drivers of these increases in our outlook in addition to lower SG&A projections, lower
nondiscretionary capital expenditures and lower net cash interest expense. These results and adjusted
forecasts, along with the impact of our recent share buybacks, which Mark will discuss in a moment, have
allowed us to increase our full year 2020 outlook for AFFO per share by $0.25.

I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.

Mark DeRussy
Vice President of Finance

Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of total debt and $10.5 billion net debt. Our net
debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0x, at the low end of our target range. Our third
quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 4.2x.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

On July 14, through a trust, we issued $750 million of 1.884% Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which
have an anticipated repayment date of January 29, 2026, as well as $600 million of 2.328% Secured
Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11, 2028. The aggregate
$1.35 billion of Tower Securities have a blended interest rate of 2.081% and a weighted average life
through the anticipated repayment dates of 6.4 years. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay
the entire $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2015-1C and 2016-1C Tower Securities, with the
remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.

As a result of this financing, our next debt maturity is not until April 2022. As of today, we have no
outstanding balance under our revolver, and the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt is
3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.2 years.

During the third quarter, we repurchased 580,000 shares of our common stock for $175.6 million or an
average price of $302.63 per share. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have repurchased 415,000 shares for
$124.4 million or an average price per share of $299.54. Today, our Board of Directors approved a new $1
billion stock repurchase plan effective immediately, replacing the previous $1 billion plan, which had $124
million of repurchase authorization remaining.

The company shares outstanding as of September 30, 2020, are 111.4 million compared to 112.6 million
at September 30, 2019, a reduction of 1.1%. In addition, during the third quarter, we declared and paid
a cash dividend of $52 million or $0.465 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors
declared an equivalent fourth quarter dividend of $0.465 per share payable on December 17, 2020, to
shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 19, 2020.

And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had another strong financial performance in the third
quarter. We produced leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share that
were all ahead of both our expectations and consensus expectations.

The year has developed almost exactly as we predicted it would on our last earnings call. U.S. customer
activity has increased due to T-Mobile activity increasing post-merger. International business remained
stable to improving, but still challenged due to the continued impact of COVID-19 in those markets. And
the capital markets remain very friendly to our company.

Because we see further increased U.S. leasing activity in the future over 2020 levels at a time where our
international markets recover from today's COVID-19 challenges, we continue to invest capital in both
portfolio growth and by repurchasing our stock, which investments we believe will help fuel future growth
in AFFO per share and dividends per share.

We're very pleased with our results, particularly against the backdrop of continuing COVID-19 conditions
in all of our markets. The majority of our employees and our customers' employees are still working
remotely, but yet continue to work efficiently and effectively to produce these positive results. We also
have a number of essential field personnel working every day out of tower sites to meet our customers'
needs.

We greatly appreciate the efforts of all of these frontline folks who have not only had to adjust to working
in the new COVID world, but also have been there to get hurricane- and fire-impacted sites back up and
running for our customers and, ultimately, for their customers. They've done a great job, and I thank
them for all they have done and will continue to do.

From a leasing activity standpoint, in the U.S., we saw an increase in new bookings during the third
quarter to a higher level than we saw throughout the first 2 quarters of the year. This increase relates
directly to T-Mobile activity post-merger. This increased activity as well as our strong services results and
our growing application backlog are positive signs for increase or for continued increases in the pace of
domestic organic leasing activity for the fourth quarter and into 2021.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

These third quarter levels, while trending up, are still below the levels of activity we saw in the year earlier
period. We believe that there are opportunities to see growing levels of new bookings on a quarter-to-
quarter basis for the next several quarters. There are several drivers behind this anticipated trend. First,
we expect T-Mobile to continue to accelerate their focus toward meeting their stated 5G coverage goals,
including upgrading the majority of their sites in either 2.5 gigahertz or 600 megahertz spectrum or both.

Second, the upcoming C-band auction should see significant participation and we expect will be a driver
of increased activity starting sometime next year with both Verizon and AT&T, as the deployment of this
spectrum will require new equipment at many of their existing macro sites.

And third, we continue our constructive discussions with DISH, and we anticipate that they will be actively
engaged in building out a nationwide 5G network over a multiyear period. All these factors should create
an increasing domestic leasing environment as we move through next year, which will bode well for
domestic organic growth for the following several years.

Internationally, we saw slightly higher leasing activity levels than we saw in the first half of the year,
signing up 47% of international revenue under new leases and 53% under amendments. Notwithstanding
a slight increase in activity levels, we're continuing to see impacts on our Latin American and South
African markets from the COVID-19 crisis.

On the positive side, most of our international wireless customers have reported improved third quarter
financial results sequentially compared to the second quarter, as lockdowns in their markets have started
to lift. However, they've also reported material year-over-year CapEx reductions in the order of 10% to
25%, as lockdowns have made network deployment difficult and they have prioritized cash.

As a result, we expect international bookings may remain pressured in the fourth quarter and into early
next year. On the bright side, some of our customers, such as América Móvil, have discussed in their third
quarter calls their future plans for increased, more normalized capital spending, which we believe will be a
positive for us.

Wireless continues to be critical. The access to the Internet in all of our international markets and
significant network investment is still needed throughout all of these markets. None, with the possible
exception of certain parts of Canada, have as yet embarked on the type of 5G upgrade that we are
starting to see here in the U.S. As COVID-19 conditions improve, we expect wireless capital spending in
our international markets will improve considerably.

Consistent with the uptick in our U.S. leasing activity, our services business had a strong quarter, seeing
a material pickup in construction activity, particularly with T-Mobile. We also continue to control our cash
SG&A costs very well. As a result, we again reported the highest tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA
margins in the industry, including an 84.3% domestic tower cash flow margin. We also were able to
control our nondiscretionary capital expenditures for the quarter, allowing us to again reduce our full year
outlook for this CapEx.

And we were able to use available cash on hand to pay off and reset an out-of-the-money interest rate
hedge, significantly reducing our future cash interest expense obligations for nearly the next 5 years. Our
solid performance up and down the lines of the P&L allowed us to produce our highest quarterly AFFO
per share ever. And while I'm hesitant to bring up this oldie but goldie, we will end 2020 just short of an
annualized fourth quarter AFFO per share of $10.

If not for the significant negative FX movements experienced this year, which we believe were largely due
to the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar and Federal Reserve Bank policy in response to COVID, we
actually would have made that 10x20 target we set out almost 5 years ago. If nothing else, I think this is
really indicative of the strength and predictability of our business and our ability to manage it.

In addition to our operating and financial results, we also had a solid quarter allocated capital. We
purchased or put under contract a number of very high-quality tower assets. We've built a number of
towers across our international markets. We invested in the JaxNAP data center, as we discussed on our
last earnings call, a step in our long-term edge data center strategy focused on being ready to monetize
and capitalize on eventual data center demand at our tower sites.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

We spent $300 million in the third and fourth quarters, opportunistically repurchasing our stock, which will
positively contribute to AFFO per share growth going forward, including this quarter.

And we announced today our dividend, an amount which represents less than 20% of our third quarter
and the midpoint of our projected fourth quarter AFFO per share. We anticipate that our expected
increased AFFO generation will give us ample ability for material future increases in dividends while
maintaining plenty of capital for continued portfolio growth and stock repurchases.

Next quarter, in conjunction with the preparation of our 2021 outlook, we anticipate that our Board of
Directors will be declaring a materially increased quarterly dividend, which, as is becoming our practice,
will remain the same on a quarterly basis through the course of the year.

From a balance sheet perspective, we've been able to continue to manage our leverage effectively, ending
the third quarter at 7.0x, a level I'm very comfortable with. As I mentioned earlier, the debt capital
markets have been very accommodative, and we've taken advantage of these opportunities several times
this year. In the third quarter, we were able to refinance $1.2 billion of securitization notes, reducing our
overall cost of debt, which today averages 3.1%.

We have achieved an investment-grade cost of debt on a levered balance sheet, which of course, when
properly managed, greatly benefits our shareholders. We currently have no debt maturities until 2022, and
we continue to have very high liquidity, including our fully available undrawn $1.25 billion revolver. The
strength of our balance sheet continues to provide us with the flexibility and confidence to be opportunistic
around investment opportunities and share repurchases, while still being able to comfortably support and
materially grow our dividend.

We had another solid quarter in the third quarter. I want to again thank our team members and our
customers for their contributions to our success, particularly during these challenging times. We look
forward to a strong end to the year and sharing our results with you next quarter.
And with that, Rich, we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We will begin with the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.

Philip A. Cusick
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Jeff, you discussed T-Mobile ramping and probably ramps further from the fourth quarter. Do you see
signs that other carriers could be slowing down in the next year that would sort of net some of that growth
out?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

I don't think materially. I think we will see a period of time, though, in 2021 before we will see the highest
levels of activity we expect, particularly with respect to the C-band, because that's going to take a little bit
of time. But I don't know -- I mean, of course, anything can happen. But I don't see signs today that T-
Mobile is going one way and the other 2 are going in the opposite direction.

Philip A. Cusick
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's great. And then what momentum do you see in the deployment of MIMO antennas? This is
something we've been talking about for a couple of years. Does that wait for C-band to be deployed as
well? Or are you seeing that happen today?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're seeing it happen today, because we're seeing 2.5 gigahertz spectrum being deployed today.
And I mean that is the preferred way, my understanding, that is the preferred way and the most efficient
way to get the most out of the mid-band spectrum for 5G.

Philip A. Cusick
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That makes sense. And one more, if I can. What do you see in activity levels in Brazil? And how does that
compare to what you expected when you bought more sites in December?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, we didn't see COVID. And we didn't see the level of the FX adjustment, which I think is in large part
due. But what we have seen is a steady currency, constant currency adjusted, very good demand, Phil, for
those assets. And we think over time and with some improvement in those COVID conditions, we're going
to see tremendous improvement in the numbers coming out of Brazil. But I would certainly be telling you
a fib if we foresaw everything that has gone on in Brazil this year back in December.

Philip A. Cusick
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I don't think anybody could say that. But it does sound like there's still good demand in that market
despite COVID?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Yes, there is. I mean if you were to strip back -- I mean if you look at the demand and the growth rates
that Brendan talked about and you see in our numbers on a constant currency basis, we're very pleased
with where things are. And that's still on a year and in an environment where these customers have pulled
back materially in their CapEx in response to COVID. And they basically said that, "Look, this is temporary,
and we're going to need to spend more money coming out of this." So we're very -- we continue to be
very, very happy with our Brazilian operations.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.

Simon William Flannery
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. You talked about DISH and T-Mobile. You didn't talk about -- much about cable. We're very active
in the CBRS. So I wonder, Jeff, do you think cable can be a contributor in '21 and beyond? How are those
conversations going? And on T-mobile, they have a real interest in reducing some of the old iDEN Sprint
sites. Is there an opportunity, you think, to work with them to come up with some structure to allow them
to take down some of those sites quicker than the current contracts allow?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, we don't really have any of the iDEN left. So what we have are just straight Sprint leases that are
of a more regular Sprint network deployment that have various termination dates over time. And we're
always open to discussions. In terms of cable, we do have cable or demand for some of our tower space.
I don't know that cable will ever have a desire to map a -- or the spectrum ability to map a greenfield
nationwide build-out the way the other 4 will have. But we certainly do see some incremental demand and
benefit from their spectrum holdings.

Simon William Flannery
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And then just quick one from Brendan on the leverage. You're at the low end of leverage of 7x. Is
that -- are you going to keep that there with the buybacks? How should we think about your desire to stay
at that 7x versus coming down lower depending on where the stock price is, if you don't have other M&A
opportunities?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's our desire to stay within that target range. We're at the low end of it now. In terms of the share
buybacks and the asset acquisition, it's really a matter of being opportunistic around what's available to
us at a given time. So we're there today largely through share buybacks in the third quarter, and we've
done some already in the fourth quarter. So you should expect we'll be somewhere around the same range
going forward.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Batya Levi with UBS.

Batya Levi
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Can you remind us how we should think about the pacing of the T-Mobile churn? I think this year, churn
is coming in a little less than 2%. Maybe some early color for next year, if there's anything that we should
look forward to and when you would think T wants to ramp up.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Yes. We -- so we have seen a little bit of churn notifications from T-Mobile thus far around 100 leases or
so. That is relatively small, probably in the $4 million to $5 million range in terms of its impact for next
year. When you look at our overall term end dates, though, in terms of the overlap in particular, we have
almost 4 years left on average for the Sprint leases that are on site where T-Mobile is. And when you look
at the specific dates, most of it is out about 5 to 6 years. So we expect that we're going to start seeing
that stuff heavily weighted towards the back-end.

Operator

And we'll now go to the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen.

Colby Alexander Synesael
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. Maybe just a follow-up on that. There's a lot of talk, obviously, about leasing increasing the next
2 quarters, including in the fourth quarter and then, I guess, you mentioned further into 2021. But when
you think about the net same-store growth rate, '21 versus 2020, is there a risk that the churn could step
up to such a level that it effectively offsets the increase in new demand that you're anticipating to a point
where the same-store growth rate in 2021 would actually be below that of 2020, despite this increase in
new activity that you're seeing? I appreciate you don't want to get too much on '21 just yet, but as you
might appreciate that, that's a big focus for investors right now.

And then secondly, I was just wondering about the capital allocation. You talked about that 5% to 10%
portfolio growth over a long period of time. It sounds like there's perhaps less to do internationally right
now, just given the economic situation down there. Should we anticipate that you just continue to step up
the buyback in the interim?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

You take the first one, I'll take the second one.

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Okay.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Colby. So on the churn question, most -- based on the way that it works and we give those same
tower growth rates, it's usually driven mostly by stuff that's happening this year and into the first part of
next year. So a lot of that is known. So I don't expect the churn to be materially higher, although there is
some potential for some additional notices. We're not ready to give '21 numbers yet. And I think when we
give them, we'll have a little bit better view on whether there's certain plans from T-Mobile around some
of that churn.

The overall growth rate will also be influenced by the activity levels in terms of new leasing activity this
year as well. So you have to stay tuned till next quarter to get the actual numbers. But what's happening
today and the slowdown we saw in the first part of the year, this year will have some impact on next
year's same tower growth numbers, because it is a trailing indicator.

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And how soon we start seeing next year, which frankly, we just don't know yet today, the benefits
that will come from DISH really digging in and starting to deploy and the C-band deployments. So on the
-- no, Colby, the 5% to 10%, that continues to be the deployed. We're not going to hit it this year. If you
add this year and last year, we will have averaged greater than 5%, but that's not going to be how we

target things. We just didn't see the number of opportunities this year that we thought made sense from a
pricing perspective.

There were enough opportunities out there to hit those numbers. So I believe there will continue to be
enough opportunities out there. But for us, it's not only the number, it's the price and it's the quality.
Unless it all comes together in the right way, we're not going to buy stuff just to buy stuff. And that's
where we are this year. But I don't think this is indicative that there's not going to be 5% to 10% next
year.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.

Michael Ian Rollins
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just a couple of questions. One follow-up to begin with. You mentioned there's a delay between the
booking and the billings. And so that lag effect has impact going into '21. Can you share with us what
that current book-to-bill duration is and maybe how that compares to the historical kind of range? And
then just taking a step back with the data center purchase this past quarter, curious if you could share
your learnings and what you're getting from the data center model and how you see this edge opportunity
playing out for SBA over time.

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

On the book-to-billing lag, it's typically 6 to 12 months. It can vary a little bit depending on a mix of
amendments and the type of activity that's being done by the carriers. But I would say we're seeing it
stretch out a little bit longer than it has in the past. I think there's so many major projects going on, in
particular with T-Mobile, that the delayed commencements are a little bit longer than they have been in
the past. But 6 to 12 months is the typical range.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And on the data center, Mike, we've now got 2. And the purpose is to understand the data center
business, data center models so that we can be in a position when the opportunity is right to know
whether we're going to be operators of many data centers on our cell sites or something less, landlords or
maybe something in between.

What we've learned so far is that it is definitely a different sales business, different customers, but that
there are a number of different applications and needs where, by having a larger regional data center that
is well connected with fiber, a lot of interconnect, a lot of meet-meet type rooms there, that's an attractive
offering to folks who may want to also have smaller installations at the tower site. And we call that the
hub-and-spoke theory.

At the end of the day, for all this to make sense, it has to be on our land at the tower site. That's what this
is all about. It's not separately getting into an unconnected data center business. But for us to understand
how to maximize that, we thought that some experience with and kind of experimentation with these 2
data centers, one in Chicago, one in Jacksonville, and the Jacksonville one has also some undersea cable
connections, will give us the right experience and skill set.

So more on that as it comes. It's not going to be material to our financial results anytime for the next
several years. But it could be a key to really unlocking some value in, frankly, land that we've already
kind of got the soft cost and some investment in. So it's something that we're excited about over the long
term.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

And just with respect to that, is there any sense of how many of these hubs that you may need? Like does
the hub need to be in the biggest NFL, NBA type cities? Or do you think that the hubs need to actually be
much closer to the eyeballs and the use cases? And so you might have many hubs and spokes. Like how
do you think about that, at least from your initial learnings?

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So far, it doesn't -- it's more of a regional Tier 2, Tier 3 markets for the hubs. So it could be more
rather than less. But you've got to have the spoke side of things more developed out for this to -- for
me to be able to sit and tell you that there's going to be more than 2 hubs. That's why we have the 2 to
prove out now the spoke side of things. And these are both areas where we have a fair number of tower
sites to do all kinds of different types of business models. But if there are enough tower sites that connect
and make sense, then you've got the creation of another hub opportunity. And whether that needs to be
owned or partnered, it doesn't have to be one or the other.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.

Brett Joseph Feldman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Jeff, during your prepared remarks, you mentioned the C-band and you acknowledged that it could take a
little bit of time for that to fully benefit the company. One of the questions we've been getting is, how do
we think about the factors that actually determine what that time line or trajectory is? Because it seems
like there's 2 considerations, and I'm not sure how to weigh them against you, one of which is just where
your towers are relative to the clearing time line, because there's going to be a couple of tranches there,
which is clear. The other is just which of your [indiscernible] end up buying a lot of C-band?

And so I was hoping really, you could just expand for us, as best you can, your thought process around
when you think your assets are actually going to be positioned to start to benefit from that leasing
activity?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, I mean, you kind of answered it for me, you really won't know until the auctions are done and what
got taken by who and where. And one the benefits of giving the 2020 outlook when we give it is we hope
to have some of that information by then. So we will look at that and glean whatever we can from the
results and be able to factor that into our outlook. I do believe a large part of, at least the early feelings,
will be based on the dollars spent and the belief that the folks who spend the large dollars, and folks have
indicated that they're looking to do that, they'll be looking to deploy as quickly as they could.

So that's kind of how we're going to triangulate things. But it's not going to be -- it's hard for me to say
with specificity now without knowing the first thing about who won what and where.

Brett Joseph Feldman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Do you have enough towers in the market that are kind of in tranche 1 such that it actually could be a
meaningful catalyst for you over the next the 12 or 18 months? Or do you really need to wait until the
majority of that spectrum is cleared? Are you just on that yet?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

I think the spectrum clearing is going to go faster than folks think, just like it did on the TV spectrum.
Some of it's going to go faster, some of it may not. There is every incentive for the folks who win that
spectrum or purchasing, I guess, because they are purchasing it, in some cases, arguably to stay

competitive with a rapidly deploying T-Mobile to get things done very quickly. And I think that is going to
bode well for us and our industry.

Operator

We will now go to the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.

Nicholas Ralph Del Deo
MoffettNathanson LLC

Just following up on Brett's C-band question. There are presumably a smaller share of towers on which
the carriers can economically deploy C-bands, especially in rural areas, just given the propagation
attributes versus traditional mid-band. How would you dimension the share of towers that might not be
well positioned to host C-band? Or do you not think that's the right way to think about it?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I suspect there will be some. But I think in large part, where they have -- I mean anything except the
absolute most rural towers, which I don't think -- I think you're talking about areas where you really don't
have the same amount, you don't have the coverage today. These are the areas that the government is
actually incentivizing through the RDOF and these large amounts of money to bring to these underserved
areas. I think for the most part, where most of the carriers are today where they have existing 3G and 4G
coverage, we believe you're going to see 5G brought in the form of an advanced spectrum.

Nicholas Ralph Del Deo
MoffettNathanson LLC

Okay. And then the other one on margins, which has obviously been very strong. Anything that's going to
revert post-COVID? Or do you see kind of COVID-related extra costs about equal to any COVID-related
savings?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

No. We haven't really had any type of -- I mean our travel and entertainment expenses have been down.
But I mean when you look at the margins in the business, that's still such a small overall amount for that
to come back, I just don't see it, Nick. I don't think you're going to see anything material.

Nicholas Ralph Del Deo
MoffettNathanson LLC

Okay. That's good to hear. And if I can just squeeze in one housekeeping item. Are you disclosing the PCS,
Leap [indiscernible] churn impact this quarter? Or are you stopping that?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

We basically stopped it, because it's become largely immaterial. I believe that less than 0.3% of that
same-tower churn number that we gave, that's on the domestic side. It's even lower than that on a
consolidated basis.

Operator

Next we'll go to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.

David William Barden
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I guess the first one would be for Jeff. Is there any part of you that wonders if the American Tower MOA
will affect the kind of cadence and tempo of the T-Mobile spend that you're anticipating can come in
2021? And I guess my second question is for Brendan. Obviously, great deleveraging over the last year. I

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

remember when you guys instituted the dividend that we were talking about as the fixed kind of dividend
cost, there was an inclination to bring leverage down below the historical targets, maybe even closer to
6%. Is that now no longer the game plan?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. On the MOA, given what T-Mobile has committed to accomplish under the terms of the approval, I
don't really think so, David. I don't think there's anything that is going to impact SBA.

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

David, on the leverage plan, I mean, right now, given how low a percentage of our AFFO the dividend
represents, we don't think that it calls for any material reductions in leverage. I mean we're naturally
just organically delevering a turn to 1.5 turns every year just for EBITDA growth and the cash that we
generate. So that -- to keep it up requires us to be continuing to significantly invest in the business.

So our goal would be to keep it up and continue to see opportunities to invest, whether in new assets or
share buybacks. But right now, we don't have any intention to lower it materially. But I think over time, as
the dividend grows, if it becomes a much larger percentage of our free cash flow, then we would naturally
see the leverage start to come down.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And keep in mind, we started that conversation when we were more regularly running at 7.5x
[indiscernible].

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll next go to the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions, if I could. Can you update us on the status of the FirstNet project in U.S.?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

We continue to be active, and we still have...

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

We're probably about 50% to 55% of our sites have been with AT&T and have been upgraded for FirstNet,
Rick. So still ways to go.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Do you expect to get to 100%?

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Yes. Okay. And are you having any discussions with potential C-band winners, so they could run faster
than the clearing process might suggest?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

We have had general conversations, which give basically for us and our customers, they know that they
can access their gear on our sites relatively quickly. So -- and the parameters are in place to allow them
to do that. So we're the shortest pole in the tent and not the longest pole in the tent, Rick. So -- I mean
there's just not a lot of need for that. I mean we're here and ready to go, and they all know that.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Makes sense. Last one for you, and you might not have gotten this one before. You get any questions
about the new LEOs and RDOF auction. Does that affect your customers at all, either new LEOs or fiber
deeper?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, the -- yes, we had a fair amount of leasing that occurred from the last auction that went out to try
and bring service to the rural areas. So we're hopeful that the RDOF will have similar impact. But when
you -- what do you mean by impact? Mean it's going to be generally, we believe, positive for incremental
leasing.

Richard Hamilton Prentiss
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Yes. We get the question on wireless operators maybe being impacted by LEOs coming out or fiber going
deeper into the network.

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think it's around the edges. If it were that material, they'd be up, doing it themselves.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of David Guarino with Green Street.

David Anthony Guarino
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

I was wondering if you can talk about general industry expectations for '21, not SBAC-specific? And
the reason I ask is your -- one of your peers provided a guidance range for new leasing activity next
year that's essentially going to be flat versus your, which was somewhat disappointing, I thought if T-
Mobile was going to be returning. So I just want to get your take if that was a company-specific issue or
reflective of maybe a broader industry trend for next year?

Mark DeRussy
Vice President of Finance

Well, they actually gave out guidance for next year, which we're not going to do. But basically, T-Mobile
is going to be busy, we believe. And the real issue as to what will ultimately drive the financial results as
opposed to the activity levels, but the financial results will be how early in the year DISH and the C-band
really starts to get going. And that's about all we're going to say about 2021.

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Okay. Fair enough. And then switching gears maybe on the transaction market. I just want to get your
thoughts on how that's evolved since the start of the year. It certainly feels like there's more eyeballs
looking at the tower sector relative to a lot of other property types. Have you seen that translate into
higher prices for towers that are being paid and maybe something that exceeds even what you guys are
willing to pay for assets?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Well, it clearly has, which is why we won't be expanding our portfolio by 5%, which would be the first time
in many, many, many years. There is a degree of interest in communications infrastructure, particularly
towers, a lot of new players. And that has pushed pricing up to too high levels, levels such that we've
taken a pass on a number of transactions.

David Anthony Guarino
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Would that be something you guys could quantify possibly in terms of just how much higher multiples are
on specific deals and which you're comfortable with? Nothing specific, but...

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

No, no. I'm not sure that's productive for our ability to compete and for others' ability to take notes and
compete against us.

Operator

We'll now go to the line of Walter Piecyk with LightShed.

Walter Paul Piecyk
LightShed Partners

I'm getting feedback on this line, hold on. I might have to just try and go through it. So you basically
indicated that there wasn't -- I can't do this. You've got to read to me, because I'm getting too much
feedback on the line.

Operator

We'll go to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Brandon Lee Nispel
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. One for Jeff, one for Brendan, if I could. Jeff, you mentioned in your remarks, fourth quarter,
you're going to be pretty close to your long-term AFFO per share guide of $10. Is there any interest in
outlining longer-term targets for investors at some point in the near future? And if so, what might that
look like?

And then, Brendan, you brought up the T-Mobile cancellations. When specifically will those start to go
into the run rate? And then as you think about churn for next year, you're at a 2% level and you're not
breaking out sort of onetime churn. So maybe can you help us understand where you are from like a run
rate churn perspective annually?

SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Brandon, we feel really good about where things came out on that old 10x20, with the exception that
the FX proved to be off much more than the guide that we put out in 2016 anticipated. So we probably
won't be doing that on a multiple year basis -- based on that experience. But everything else actually
was extremely close. And in many respects, we beat it quite handily. We'll think about maybe some
subcomponents of that for maybe longer-term guidance. But to get right down to the AFFO per share, I
think there are parts of the, particularly FX, that might make that not such a great idea. Obviously, not
something we can control. Brendan?

Brendan Thomas Cavanagh
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Brandon, so on the churn, as it relates to the T-Mobile churn that I mentioned earlier, which is
basically Sprint churn, what we've received notifications on, as I mentioned, is about $4 million to $4.5
million, maybe $5 million of impact. And that would be the impact pretty much for next year. Beyond
that, we haven't received any notifications. If we were to look at that and incorporate what might happen,
we're still looking at a relatively small amount for next year, only about 7% of the revenue in total, which
includes the amount that I just mentioned from Sprint, is at risk of churn for next year. And that's highly
unlikely to be at that full amount.

So we don't expect -- we'll give you, obviously, more detail when we get to giving guidance next quarter.
We'll have a lot more information at that point. But that's the impact of that. As it relates to the churn
as a whole from a run rate standpoint, we were at -- from a domestic level, this quarter, we reported
same-tower churn of 2.2%. I mentioned earlier that about 0.3% or so of that, which is of Metro leasing
Clearwire. So just under 2%. That's probably about the range that we will see over the course of the next
year. There's a variety of things in there.

We've talked about it in the past on a couple of calls a lot of miscellaneous items, including some never-
on-air stuff that some of our customers have cleaned up, some smaller customers that have modified
some of their older technologies. And based on what we've seen already this year, its impact to next year
should keep us somewhere in that 1.5% to 2% range on a normal basis. And then we'll see what happens
with Sprint.

Jeffrey A. Stoops

Rick, we have time for one more call.

We'll go to the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research.

Spencer Harris Kurn
New Street Research LLP

Wanted to just revisit amendment pricing. Historically, I had always thought of higher frequency spectrum
having smaller antennas, which would typically command the lower amendment rate, but at the same
time, MIMO antennas, I've heard, are a lot bigger. So I just want to get your thoughts on how amendment
pricing is sort of trending as you're seeing more MIMO antennas being deployed?

Mark DeRussy
Vice President of Finance

Yes. I mean it's trending higher, but not trending differently than it has historically based on changes in
weight and size. So it has been basically logical in terms of the way it has progressed, which is good,
because it's expected and it's consistent with at least the way we have conducted ourselves with our
customers over time.

Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, as we've seen CRAN being deployed and base stations being pulled
into data centers, it doesn't seem like we've seen a big impact on pricing at towers. But I was just curious
to get your thoughts on how big of an impact you've actually seen and whether that's going to be entirely
offset by new antennas going up on towers as the CRAN transition, how it's played out?

Jeffrey A. Stoops
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We've not really seen much impact at all. And I really don't think we will, because at the end of the
day, we are a radio and antenna location business, Spencer. And that's where we've got the -- we provide
the height and the location and the entitlements. And whether the computer is there at the bottom of the
tower or somewhere else, it doesn't really matter as much as the ability to host the radio [ in EFS ].
