Presentation

Operator

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Mettler-Toledo Quarterly Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator
Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Mary Finnegan. Please go ahead.

Mary T. Finnegan
Head of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, and good evening, everyone. I'm Mary Finnegan. I'm responsible for Investor Relations at
Mettler-Toledo and happy to welcome you to the call. I'm joined on the call today with Patrick Kaltenbach,
our CEO; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer.

Let me cover just a couple of administrative matters. This call is being webcast and is available for replay
on our website. A copy of the press release and the presentation that we will refer to on today's call is also
available on the website.

Let me summarize the safe harbor language, which is outlined on Page 2 of the presentation. Statements

I will now turn the call over to Patrick.

Patrick K. Kaltenbach
President & CEO

Thanks, Mary, and good evening, everyone. I am pleased to host the call tonight, which we are doing from
Switzerland as Shawn and Mary are here with me, too. I'm excited to report another quarter of excellent
results. Several factors contributed to these results. First, demand in our markets was very strong and
broad-based. Second, we were able to capture these growth opportunities as a key priority since the
onset of the pandemic was to stay close -- in close contact with our customers and be strongly positioned
once customer demand recovered. And finally, the teams around the world have done an excellent job
in execution and customer support. Our supply chain team has had more than the share of challenges
due to part availability and logistics complications while our market organizations have executed well to
meet increasing customer demands. Our teams have shown resiliency and agility in an environment where
conditions change rapidly.

Now let me turn to our financial results. The highlights are on Page 3 of the presentation and you can
see we had a great quarter. Local currency sales growth was 27%, and we had very strong broad-based
growth in all regions and most product lines. With the exception with this exceptional sales growth
and combined with focused execution of our margin initiatives, we achieved a 45% growth in adjusted
operating income and 53% increase in adjusted EPS. Cash flow generation was excellent in the quarter.
Demand in our end markets remains positive, although our growth for the remainder of the year will

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

reflect more challenging comparisons than we had in the first half of the year. We are making incremental
investments, which will position us very well for future growth. We remain confident that we can continue
to gain market share and deliver strong results in 2021 and beyond.

Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financials and guidance details, and then I will come back with
some additional commentary on the business. Shawn?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Patrick, and good evening, everybody. Sales were $924.4 million in the quarter, an increase of
27% in local currency. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 34% as currency benefited sales growth
by 7% in the quarter. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to sales growth in the
quarter.

On Slide #4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales increased 29% in the Americas, 23% in
Europe and 28% in Asia/Rest of World. Local currency sales increased 35% in China in the quarter.

The next slide shows sales growth by region for the first half of the year. Local currency sales grew 23%
for the first 6 months with a 22% increase in the Americas, 18% in Europe and 28% growth in Asia/Rest
of World.

On Slide #6, we summarized local currency sales growth by product area. For the second quarter,
laboratory sales increased 35%, industrial increased 20%, with core industrial up 27% and product
inspection up 9%. Food retail increased 9% in the quarter.

The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area for the first half. Laboratory sales
increased 27% and industrial increased 19% with core industrial up 27% and product inspection up 7%.
Food Retail increased 11% for the first 6 months.

Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide #8. Gross margin in the quarter
was 58.1%, a 50 basis point increase over the prior year level of 57.6%. We benefited from volume and
pricing, which was offset in part by challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher transportation,
logistics and raw material costs. These items are even more challenging than we had expected the last
time we spoke. One additional factor, as you compare to the prior year, we now have in our cost structure,
the impact of the temporary cost actions we undertook in 2020.

R&D amounted to $42.6 million in the quarter, which is a 28% increase in local currency over the prior
period. The impact of the temporary cost reductions undertaken last year as well as the timing of project
activity contributed to this increase.

SG&A amounted to $239 million, a 20% increase in local currency over the prior year. The impact of
the temporary cost savings that we undertook last year, higher variable compensation and increased
investments in sales and marketing were the principal factors driving the increase.

Adjusted operating profit amounted to $255.3 million in the quarter, a 45% increase over the prior year
amount of $176.6 million. Adjusted operating margins increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 27.6%.
We are pleased with this margin growth, which reflects excellent sales growth, combined with focused
execution on our margin initiatives. Currency benefited operating profit growth by approximately 7%, but
had little impact on operating margins.

A couple of final comments on the P&L. Operating -- I'm sorry, amortization amounted to $16.2 million in
the quarter. Interest expense was $10.4 million in the quarter and other income in the quarter amounted
to $2.7 million primarily reflecting non-service-related pension income.

Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was
19.5%. Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.5 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the
prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.10, a 53% increase over the prior year amount of $5.29.
Currency benefited adjusted EPS growth by approximately 7% in the quarter. On a reported basis in the
quarter, EPS was $7.85 as compared to $5.22 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter includes $0.19

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

of purchased intangible amortization, $0.03 of restructuring and $0.03 due to the difference between our
quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises.

The next slide shows our P&L for the first half. Local currency sales grew 23% for the 6 months. Adjusted
operating income increased 47% with margins up 330 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 58% on a year-
to-date basis. That covers the P&L, and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free
cash flow amounted to $233.3 million, which is an increase of 41% on a per share basis as compared to
the prior year. We are very happy with our cash flow generation.

DSO was 36 days, which is 4 days less than the prior year. ITO came in at 4.6x, which is slightly better
than last year. For the first half, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $372.2 million, an increase of 75%
on a per share basis as compared to the prior year.

Let me now turn to guidance. Forecasting continues to be challenging. Market conditions are very dynamic
and changes to the business environment can happen quickly. Uncertainty remains surrounding COVID-19,
in particular, the impact of the latest variance, the worldwide pace of vaccinations and related potential
shutdowns and/or restrictions. The ultimate impact on the global economy is also still uncertain. In
addition, we are monitoring our supply chain very closely and recognize we must remain very agile
in order to adapt to unexpected material shortages, inflationary pressures and unforeseen logistic
challenges, which can create unexpected volatility. As we enter the second half of the year, demand in our
end markets is positive, although we face more challenging comparisons for the remainder of the year as
compared to the first half of this year. The organization continues to execute well and has demonstrated
a high level of resilience and agility and adapting to rapidly changing market conditions. We are making
incremental investments for future growth and continue to feel confident in our ability to gain market
share and drive earnings growth in 2021 and beyond.

Now let me cover the specifics. For the full year 2021, with the benefit of our strong Q2 results and
improved outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect local currency sales growth for the full
year to be approximately 15%. This compares to our previous guidance range of 10% to 12%. We expect
full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $32.60 to $32.90, which is a growth rate of 27% to 28%.
This compares to previous guidance of adjusted EPS in the range of $31.45 to $31.90. With respect to
the third quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be in the range of 11% to 13% and
expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.12 to $8.27, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. In terms of free
cash flow for the year, we now expect it to be in the range of $770 million. We expect to repurchase in
total 1 billion in shares in 2021, which should put us in the range of a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of
approximately 1.5x at the end of the year.

Some final details on guidance. With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect
currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3% in 2021 and 2% in the third quarter. In terms of
adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 3% in the quarter and approximately 3.5%
for the full year 2021.

That is it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick.

Patrick K. Kaltenbach
President & CEO

Thanks, Shawn. Let me make some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab, which
had an outstanding growth of 35% in the quarter. Pipettes had excellent growth. all other major product
categories also had robust sales growth and growth in all regions was very strong. Biopharma continues
to be very favorable and continuing the trend we saw in the first quarter, we see strong customer demand
in other segments such as chemical. We expect demand for our laboratory products to continue to be
positive due to favorable biopharma trends, vaccine research and bioproduction scale-up and production.
While we faced tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, we remain confident we can continue
to capture share, given the strength of our product portfolio and continued execution of our Spinnaker
sales and marketing initiatives. In terms of our industrial business, core industrial did very well in the
quarter with a 27% increase in sales. All 3 regions of the world had robust core industrial growth.
Improving market conditions, including some benefit from pent-up demand, combined with the strength

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

and diversity of our product portfolio and our focus on attractive market segments contributed to the
strong results. Similar to my comments on laboratory, we will face tougher comparisons for the second
half of the year, but our outlook and our confidence in gaining market share remains positive for this
business. Product Inspection had increased momentum and solid sales growth of 9% in the quarter. We
saw good growth in all regions. We expect good growth in product inspection for the remainder of the year
as we are gaining better access to our customer facilities and believe we will benefit from some pent-up
demand in the business. Food retailing grew 9% in the quarter.

Let me make some additional comments by geography. Sales in Europe increased 23% in the quarter
with excellent growth in lab, core industrial and food retail. Americas increased 29% in the quarter with
excellent growth in lab and core industrial. Product Inspection did well in the Americas, while food retail
declined. Finally, Asia and the rest of the world grew 28% in the quarter with outstanding growth in
Laboratory and Industrial. As you hear from Shawn, China had another quarter of stellar growth. We
would expect another good quarter of growth in Q3 in China, although not at the same level of the first
half as China faces more challenging comparisons. We are strongly positioned in China, and the team is
executing very well.

One final comment on the business. Service and consumables performed very well and were up 23% in
the quarter. We are very happy with the growth in this important and profitable part of the business.

That concludes my comments on the business. With our better-than-expected sales growth in the first
half, we are making incremental investments for future growth. These investments are centered on
innovation and operational excellence. In product development, in our manufacturing facilities and in
our corporate programs such as Spinnaker sales and marketing. Let me give you some recent examples,
starting with product development, where we have a proven track record of launching market-leading
technologies. It all stems from our deep knowledge of customer processes and what our solutions can
do to enhance or improve these processes. We think of innovation in product development as customer-
centric rather than technology-centric. We are focused on the specific value of our solutions can provide
to customers, for example, in terms of productivity, compliance-related matters, safety or data integrity.
On the website, we have recently launched our newest version of our LabX instrument control and
data management software. This latest vision fully supports the lab digitalization, and with the strong
adoption of our customer base, we have doubled the number of instruments that can be networked.
LabX increases our customers' productivity by speeding up daily work through the management of data
and development of workflows. It enhances security and compliance, ensuring data quality and full
data traceability. Finally, LabX helps reduce complexity in asset managers data, assets and workflow
centrally and seamlessly integrates into laboratory data management systems such as LIMS. Software is
progressively becoming a deciding factor for customers in choosing a supplier for Benchtop lab solutions.
With the increasing importance of software, LabX is helping to position us as a trusted adviser for certain
global pharma customers as we meet their demands for instruments, service and software. While lab
receives the greater share of R&D investments, we also have some great examples of new products on
the industrial side, including a best-in-class industrial terminal, which provides fully integrated weighing
applications for -- with the industry's fastest processing speed. Similarly, we launched new load cell
technology in our product inspection business, which provides industry-leading checkweighing throughputs
with maximum precision. Both of these products provide value by increasing customers' productivity.
New products highlight our deep and great knowledge of our customers' processes and pain points
and allow us to lead the market with technology to provide specific value to customers. We are also
investing in our manufacturing facilities to boost productivity. Last quarter, we rolled out significant
automation in our pipette and tip harvesting process, resulting in a meaningful increase in yield per
molding machine. This quarter, we are unveiling a new expanded clean room for our pipette manufacturing
as well as inaugurating a new facility for our secondary brand, Biotix, that will expand our pipette and
tip manufacturing capacity and efficiency. We are also launching a project for our Process Analytics
business in the U.S. to optimize production and its warehouse layout, which will yield improvements
in material flow, in productivity and production capacity. We also continue to invest in innovation in
our corporate programs. You have seen over many years for tremendous innovation in our Spinnaker
sales and marketing programs. A current priority area for us is maximizing our cross-selling capabilities.
Because we utilize a specialized sales force, cross-selling techniques are different than what you might

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

hear from companies that have -- that use a more generalist sales force approach. Our goal is to use
data analytics to identify customer sites in which we have low cross-selling penetration. We then use
contacts and references to develop warm and hot leads to other product categories. It involves data and
qualification analytics, and these leads have proven to be very effective in converting to sales. Another
innovative techniques we are using to stay fully engaged with customer is greater use of webinars. In
the past, we would conduct a few hundred webinars annually. While our goal this year is to launch 2,000
webinars in local languages, which helps to overcome the limitations we face with customer interactions
due to the pandemic. We have professionalized the delivery of the webinars and have expanded our topics
to include items such as compliance, productivity, Industry 4.0 and data integrity. From a customer's
perspective, webinars are very cost and time-efficient while still allowing for interactions with experts
from various businesses. Our supply chain team and pricing team are also demonstrating a high level
of innovation. For our supply chain team, agility continues to be a necessity in overcoming the many
challenges of the current environment. At the same time, they also continue to make excellent progress
on Stern Drive, our corporate initiative to continuously improve and drive world-class operations and
supply chain. Stern Drive comprises several hundred projects throughout manufacturing and back-office
operations, focused on material cost reductions, shop floor productivity and back office productivity.

Finally, the pricing team also shown great resilience and agility in reacting to inflationary pressures. They
moved quickly earlier this year to implement certain midyear price changes and at the same time, they
continue to work strategically on some pricing initiatives to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of life quotes to customers. Incorporating data analytics into upfront processes will make quoting more
effective and easier and more efficient for our salespeople. These are just a few of many examples
we have internally in which we continue to move our initiatives to another level. We recently held a
virtual leadership meeting with senior leaders from around the world with the theme of doubling down
to drive growth. What we emphasize to our senior leaders and to you today is we have a great strategy
in place, and we'll execute on it in an even more determined way than before. We will continue to invest
in innovation to double down on enhancing our initiatives that are the foundation of our future growth.
We remain confident that our strategies are effective in capturing market share and driving sales and
operating profit.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I want to ask the operator to open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel.

Daniel Anthony Arias
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Patrick or Shawn, pretty major growth you're seeing in China right now. What are you guys thinking about
for the back half of the year? And I know we're a quarter away from the '22 guide, but is there anything
you can sort of offer when it comes to just thinking about sort of the multiyear growth rate that makes the
most sense as a forecast for China when you think about the strength of life sciences, the moving parts in
industrial and just pent-up demand versus sustainable demand?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Dan, I'll take that one. This is Shawn. So why don't I -- I'll talk about maybe Q3 specifically, and then
I'll talk about the full year and then you can kind of like back into what that implies for maybe Q4. But
for Q3 right now, we're looking at high teens growth for Q3, and then for the full year, we're looking at
mid-20s. But we fully agree. We enter the second half of the year with extremely strong momentum in
China. Also very strong execution from our team there. There's very -- there's many favorable dynamics
in China at the moment, whether it's life sciences, whether it's investments in industrial, whether it's
trends towards automation and digitalization, many strategic investments in different subsegments like
microelectronics or lithium batteries. And I feel like our team continues to do an excellent job of capturing
these opportunities. One of the challenges we start to have in the second half, though, of course, is that
we start to lap some pretty significant comparisons to the previous year. And as you said, too, like there
is a topic of pent-up demand and when the recovery started in Q3 of last year, that was very much a local
recovery. And then as kind of we started to progress through 2021, it became -- China was benefiting
much more from the global recovery. And what's always hard to tell is how much are we benefiting from
pent up. And there also is an element of stimulus in China. We talked a lot about this last quarter as well.
But clearly, the government is investing very heavily in many different sectors, whether it's programs
related to the 5-year plan, or whether it's investments in the industrial sector further developing the
economic zone going out to the western part of the country. And it's always difficult to tell how much we're
benefiting from these trends as well.

Daniel Anthony Arias
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes, okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on product inspection. It seems like things are picking up
there as well. I mean you have favorable comps in the back half of the year, I think, like the average over
the 2 quarters is something like down 7%. So I'm just curious, when we think about regional dynamics,
are there any things in the key geographies that make you think that the different regions are going to
sort of move at different paces, or there's a trajectory for one that might be different together. I guess I'm
just sort of asking for a little bit of detail on how we should chart the course for PI over the next, call it,
couple of quarters?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean right now, we were -- we're definitely encouraged with some increased momentum. I think we
started to talk about some improvement in the pipeline last quarter. We were pleased with how we landed
on we ended Q2. And if we kind of like look at guidance for Q3, we're looking at low double digit in Q3 and
high single digit for the year. So we're starting to see definitely some improvement there. If we start to
think about it more geographically, I think we're going to see higher growth in the Americas right now.
But I think there's still this pent-up opportunity for all geographies as we go forward. I think there will be

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

an element, and I think we're well positioned for it. I mean -- but there's also going to be an element of
the COVID variance, and how that could potentially impact access to plans and timing of projects and that
creates a little bit of uncertainty. But we definitely enter Q3 feeling encouraged by increased momentum
from what we were seeing last quarter.

Patrick K. Kaltenbach
President & CEO

Shawn, if I might add. Sorry there, actually wanted to add to Shawn's comments here about the regions. I
think we have definitely good opportunities across around the world. But we also just recently launched a
new mid-range version for the X-ray detection in China, which was actually specifically initially developed
for the Chinese market to be very competitive in the midrange market. So we are looking also with quite
some optimism on that development in China as well.

Daniel Anthony Arias
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Shawn, just to finish the thought on the comment you made on the Delta variant or any other
variant for that matter. Are you starting to see any skittishness on the part of customers that are maybe, I
don't want to say closing their doors, but just getting a little bit more nervous about access? Or is that just
sort of the natural fear that you might have before we head in the direction that it feels like we're heading
in?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

No, we're not. I mean I'd say that we continue to see really -- I mean the variant, of course, impacts
social activities, I think, around the world. There's still lockdowns in certain countries, but that's more of
a social perspective. From a business perspective, we don't see really any impact on our business at the
moment. The reason why I mentioned it with product inspection, though, is if you just think back from
the beginning of the pandemic, product inspection has been the one business that's arguably been the
most impacted just from some of the dynamics in the food manufacturing sector. We're not -- we've seen
improvement in those dynamics over the course of this quarter, things are starting to, I'd say, reopen
more so. We have more access to plants and facilities to work on projects than we did a quarter ago. But I
just mentioned it because those things -- dynamics can also change quickly if the variant start to create a
situation where packaged food companies start to prohibit access to their facilities.

Operator

Your next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore.

Unknown Analyst

This is [ Paul ] on for Vijay. Just a quick 2-parter. So the 15% annual guide sort of implies mid-single-
digit growth in the fourth quarter. Given the 3Q guide of 11% to 13%, somewhat similar comps, what's
causing the 4Q step down? And then I guess what is the new guide contemplating for segment growth?
What changed from the prior? I know you already talked about product inspection, but what about lab and
industrial?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. So we're, of course, very pleased with our year-to-date results. We're also pleased with our
outlook. As I kind of mentioned on the China comment, it's always difficult to assess how much we've
been benefiting from topics like pent-up demand stimulus. And as we kind of look towards Q4, there's
always the topic of budget flush as well. And as you all know, it's -- we never have a significant number of
months of backlog. We're typically at 1.5 or a little bit more than 1.5 months of backlog. So it's always a
little bit more difficult for us to forecast beyond the current quarter that we're in. So right now, kind of our
planning assumption is to look at more normalized growth rates for Q4, but acknowledge there's always
going to be upsides or downsides to our guidance. Maybe I can answer the second part of your question

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

and just kind of like walk down the different businesses and geographies just to kind of get that out there
as well, too. So if we kind of start with the lab business, we're looking at mid-teens growth in Q3. And
then we're looking at high teens for the full year. If we look at product inspection, I think I already said
this, low double digit in Q3 and high single digit for the full year. If we look at core industrial, we're looking
at low double digit for Q3 and mid-teens for the full year. And then if we look at food retailing, we're
looking to be down low to mid-teens in Q3 and flattish for the full year. And then by geography, we're
looking to be high single digit for Q3 and low double digit for the full year. For the Americas, we're looking
to be low to mid-teens in Q3 and mid-teens for the full year. And then for China, we already mentioned
high teens for Q3 and mid-20s for the full year.

Your next question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

I wanted to dig a little bit more into the lab acceleration in the quarter. Even if you look at it on a
compounded basis, I think it went from something like 10%, 13% or so in the second quarter. How much
of this do you think is funding versus mix shift in the portfolio and due to first half pretty much COVID
may have added in the quarter?

Patrick K. Kaltenbach
President & CEO

Well, I'll start, and I'll let Shawn also chime in here. So again, we're very pleased, of course, with the
momentum in lab. I think a lot of it is based on our outstanding portfolio that we have that we continue
to improve. And you hear in my comments as well about the new products we just recently launched.
There is very strong demand across all regions in the lab business. As you know, over time, we have
increased our share in lab as a total part of the business significantly over the last years, and that will
most likely continue as the underlying momentum in the end markets is also very strong. I mean a lot
of it is driven by the life sciences market where we see a lot of adoption of our products. Our AutoChem
business is doing extremely well and is adopted also in new segments like battery manufacturing and
better development for e-mobility. So we are very confident in our lab growth, and that will probably
moving forward, given also the strong link to biopharma, be the 1 segment that will continue to lead the
growth for all of the businesses. Shawn, anything you want to add?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Maybe a couple of additional comments, Jack. I think our results were just very broad-based across
most product categories and regions. But lab really does stand out a little bit above some of the other
divisions this quarter. And what was kind of interesting is that the results were very strong in each
region of the world. And as Patrick mentioned that the trends in biopharma just continue to be very, very
favorable. And then we started to -- we continue to also see strong growth in end markets outside of
biopharma. And we don't have a significant exposure to academia, but that was certainly an end market
that we saw improved as well during the quarter.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Great. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could parse out how much pricing might have
contributed in the quarter? I know you talked about the agility of the team there. Do you think -- just
curious how you see the landscape? Is it changing? Do you think there could be even more pricing
opportunities in the back half

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Can you -- Jack, can you repeat the first part of the question? I didn't hear the word you used.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

How much pricing added in the COVID during and whether you think there could be more opportunity in
the back half?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Yes, yes. No, thank you. Yes, so we were very pleased with our pricing results in the quarter. And
we -- if you think about at last quarter, we were kind of guiding 2% to 2.5% in Q2, and then we were
looking at more like 2.5% in the back half of the year. We ended up finishing Q2 at 2.5%. And at this
point, we expect to do between 2.5% and 3% for the back half of the year, and I would expect to be at
the high end of that range by the time we get into Q4. The team and the global organization continue
to execute really well on our various midyear price increase topics. It's also, as Patrick mentioned in the
prepared remarks, we're also very agile in this area. The cost inputs are also dynamic as well, and we're
constantly looking for ways to optimize the situation and differentiate our approach to the market.

Operator

Your next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I want to start with maybe earnings on the quarter. You'd be consensus 5%, 6%, that's a lot less than the
typical 20% to 30% B. Can you maybe just talk to some of the dynamics there? Was that inflation? Was it
the supply chain challenges you talked about. Can you maybe touch on those?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

In terms of the Q2B, Tycho?

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Correct, correct. Yes, and it was less of an earnings peak than we've seen in prior quarters. And I'm just
curious whether there are inflationary pressures or that was supply chain pressures?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, absolutely. That's what it was. I mean we, of course, had the benefit from higher sales volume. The
primary -- there was maybe 2 things that was offsetting that a little bit. But the primary thing was higher
costs associated with transportation and material costs. And if you kind of like look at our gross margin for
the quarter, it was down a little bit from what we were guiding initially at the beginning of the quarter, and
it was very much related to higher transportation costs and material costs.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And there was a lot more commentary in the prepared comments around supply chain. If I go back to last
quarter, you had a question, and I think you talked about building some safety stock, but it seems like
things have maybe intensified on the supply chain side. Can you maybe talk to some of the steps you've
taken there to alleviate some of the pressures?

Patrick K. Kaltenbach
President & CEO

Yes. Let me talk to that, Tycho. So on the supply chain, supply chain side is just -- I would say the supplier
situation is particularly challenging with respect to electronics. That's probably the most concerning part

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

for us right now, and you hear it also from a different part of industries. In that regard, we are also facing
longer lead times. We are starting to battle obsolescence issues. We have short-term notices from our
suppliers which then will require also R&D teams to jump in and to redesign some of the products. On
top of that, transportation and logistics, as Shawn said, are also challenging for our team. We do see
bottlenecks and delays there. However, we are really diligently working on these topics to help offset.
In terms of mitigation strategies, again, on material shortages, what we do for electronic components,
some of it is redesigning short term our products to make sure that we can deliver. We have been very
successful so far. I would say we have been very successful fulfilling our customer demand this quarter.
But it's definitely locking in more resources than we initially thought. And we also, of course, as Shawn
said, we are facing some price increases on components -- electronic components, for example, which
go now through prorate situations, where you just have to pay much higher prices than you used to. And
that impacts us a little bit on the gross margin side as well. Moving forward, we are closely monitoring
the situation. Again, we have team prepared with mitigation strategies in case situations get more tricky,
but it's hard to predict where it might hit you next. Again, we are most exposed currently on some of the
electronic parts. Some of it will more impact retail for Q3 as well as retailers leveraging also components
that are used in consumer electronics and those are under most pressure right now. So again, there are
several areas where we have to tackle these issues. We have the right teams in place. And of course, we
are also trying different ways to supply material for Q3, I think it will not be so far, but we see not be a
major one, but we are on our toes to make sure that we can react as quickly as possible if the situation
gets more intense.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one last one. I know it's a little bit early, you're not going to guide until
next quarter, but any kind of higher level thoughts as we think ahead to next year. The Street has had
about 5% revenues, 9% EPS. Obviously, a lot of variables around the pandemic, but I'm just curious if you
have any high-level thoughts for next year at this point?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, it's still a bit early, Tycho. I mean there's a lot of moving parts. And Patrick and I are actually
about to kick off our annual budget tour here in a few weeks, and then we'll be doing that for about a
month and like we do with our normal cadence every single year, and I think we'll have a much better
perspective in feeling once we wrap up that tour, and we'll definitely provide an update during our next
call.

Operator

Your next question will come from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Securities, Research Division

So a couple of questions. I guess the first one is talk a little bit about gross margin progression in the back
half?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So you wanted me to start there? Did you want to ask a second part for this?

Derik De Bruin
BofA Securities, Research Division

I'll start there as opposed to bombarding you with the whole s***loads of stuff.

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Okay. All right. So our gross margin was up 50 basis points in Q2, as you saw, we're going to be flattish
for the second half of the year. So as I kind of mentioned in the pricing question, we expect the benefits
from pricing to slightly increase in the second half. But of course, going the other side of that is these
increased material costs that Patrick was just speaking to. The other thing that we see in the back half
is that we will not have the same level of benefit that we've had in the first half of the year regarding
volume. And so that's probably the other thing that kind of stands out in terms of comparing the first half
versus the second half. So if you kind of like put that together, the full year is probably up in the whatever,
20 to 30 basis point kind of a range.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. So the implied local currency growth in the fourth quarter looks to be in the mid-single-digit range,
and yet you're talking about potentially getting 3% pricing tailwind. So that's complying like 2% volume
growth. That seems a little draconian of the drop off like that. I mean what's sort of embedded in that?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean I don't know if I'd consider it draconian. I mean I think we're just kind of like looking at the
limited visibility that we had and not to repeat all the things that I mentioned before about how much
have we been benefiting from pent-up and stimulus and things like that. But yes, I recognize that there's
an upside to it if conditions continue to be favorable.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And just a little bit of a -- just going back, I mean, the last time Mettler guided to 15%, or
something in the mid-teens local currency growth was actually back in 2010 coming off of the financial
crisis. And I think you did 14% in 2010 local currency growth, and that was off of a negative 10% comp,
and now you're doing 15% off of a positive 1.8% comp. I'm just sort of curious on market dynamics than
now? And -- because then in 2011, you did 12% local currency growth the following year off of that. So
it sort of follows on to Tycho's question of why is 5%? Or why wouldn't we see sort of like a similar levels
there? And what's sort of like different about the market?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean, hey, I think we're very pleased with our 2-year growth this year, very different situation, as
you can appreciate, versus 2010. And fully acknowledge that our end markets are coming out of this. At
least we expect them to come out stronger. We feel like we're coming out of this stronger. We feel like
there's market trends towards automation and digitalization that benefit us. So when we think over the
medium term, we feel very positive. To be specific about what it all means for 2022. Like I said, there's --
we kind of need to go through our normal process here to have a better view on that more specifically.

Operator

Your next question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Maybe just one on the industrial strength. It's far more durable than maybe I expected among others. It
sounds like the guidance is calling for a continuation in the back half a little bit softer. But can you just talk
through, I guess, what you're seeing in that market? Obviously, China is an area of strength, but maybe
on a geographical basis as well? Just trying to get a better feel for the industrial piece.

Patrick K. Kaltenbach

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Sure. Thanks, Patrick. I'll take that. We are extremely pleased with another quarter of very strong growth
for industrial. China has a big impact on core industrial, but we also have seen very strong growth in
Europe, in Americas as well. I think Shawn mentioned the fact already that we are not only benefiting
from a strong recovery in our end markets, including some pent-up demand here. But we are also
capitalizing on the growth with our specific sales and marketing tools around Spinnaker. And we also
benefit from our diversity of our product portfolio in our end markets. We see also in China, I would say,
particularly in China, some investments, benefits from government investments and our customers,
as Shawn said, demand for automation, for connectivity, for digitalization, which plays really well in
our product portfolio that we have. So I think this also has clearly lagged. So I think the advantage of
our product portfolio is the underlying momentum and the focus on automation and productivity gains
will continue -- will help us to continue to drive this momentum. We are extremely pleased with core
industrial, especially. And we see some slowdown, of course, in Q4 based on the difficult compares, but we
are also looking clearly account are still for us as a continued opportunity to take market share.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe just one on kind of the emerging markets outside of China. It seemed to
be coming back a little slower with low vaccination rates. And just -- can you just give us a feel for what
you're seeing in terms of trends there as we work through the year?

Patrick K. Kaltenbach
President & CEO

Outside of China, look, if you look at Asia Pacific on a broader range, I think we are still in the 20% range
in the quarter. So if you would point to some specific countries, we have, for example, Thailand and
Malaysia were weaker this quarter. And -- but the rest of it is in a broader base also had pretty healthy
growth.

Operator

Your next question will come from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs.

Matthew Carlisle Sykes
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Just one for me, and it's more focused on costs, and you guys have invested
a lot in digital engagement, both in the sales and the service side. And COVID was a unique period of
time where your customers are forced to engage with you digitally. I'm just wondering, as you've had
conversations in the last month or 2, and maybe these will fade away if due to the variants. But as you've
had conversations with customers and getting back engaging in person, have you seen that customers are
more -- have a greater desire to actually continue that digital engagement, and therefore, on the SG&A
side, there might actually be some cost savings that are more durable than you might have thought? Or
do you feel that customers just want to get back to the way it was before?

Patrick K. Kaltenbach
President & CEO

I'll take that. And look, what we're hearing from our customers, they actually love the new ways of -- that
we have engaging with them. I mentioned in my remarks upfront, webinars, where we really scaled up
significantly. Last year, we did a couple of hundreds of webinars, and we are now digitally going to 2,000
because we see such a strong resonance from our customers on having that information and interaction
channel. That on top with a really specialized sales force, which is also fully back in action. It gives us an
opportunity to, again, to use our direct sales force to really go also after competitive accounts and new
accounts, approaching these with our solutions and their deep knowledge about our product portfolio,
but use the broader digital channel also for existing customers and again, broadcasting solutions in a
much better way than we could in the past. Our customers, I think, at the moment, if you look at the
amount of trade shows that are, for example, available still limited. So they're really looking also to us to
say, give us different ways of how you can demonstrate your products in -- if you're not at trade shows,

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

if you cannot attend trade shows so we use digital demos. We have studios and every major site to do
virtual product demos, and that has been very well received by our customers. And I trust that it will
continue that way. We will have a very complementary setup where our direct sales force will be in terms
of consultative selling and product solutions will be on customer sites, but we will use the broader channel
and e-commerce channel, also to digitally interface with customers. It will be -- it will drive efficiency
gains. Is it cost saving, I would say, it's an efficiency gain for us moving forward. We do not think about
this that it's necessarily an opportunity to scale back our sales force. It's again an additional channel
and a competitive advantage for us to engage with customers on many different levels, face-to-face
interaction as well as digital interaction. By the way, we also scaled up telesales over the last several
years, significantly to back up our direct sales force and that has been proven to be very effective as well.

Operator

Your next question will come from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research.

Joshua Paul Waldman
Cleveland Research Company

Maybe following up on Matt's question. A couple of questions on op expenses. Wonder if you could provide
additional color on the magnitude and timing of the incremental investments you spoke of. I guess,
what level of step-up should we pencil in for the second half? And any additional color on what these
incremental investments are being targeted towards would be helpful as well. And then second, as we
look to 2022 and potentially revenue growth maybe starts to normalize from a higher level this year. Any
concern in your ability to pull in cost commensurate to any slowing revenue? Or is there maybe some pull
forward going on here in 2021 that derisk 2022?

Shawn P. Vadala
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. So Josh, I'll take this one. This is Shawn. So of course, there's a lot of different moving pieces with
our expense growth. I think one of the big piece to not lose sight of is that we had prior year cost savings.
And of course, that optically affects this year's number as we kind of bring back the workforce and things
like that where we had some workforce savings from last year. We still have an element -- And we also
had some discretionary topics last year as well where we had savings. The one area where we have not
brought things back 100% would be in the area of travel, and I think that one will play out over time. And
then -- but then kind of another factor, of course, is variable compensation. And so if you think about like
last year, we had much lower variable compensation. This year, we're going to have much higher variable
compensation. And then the third piece I would say is kind of this element of the investments. And the
investments are very much a sign of the strength of the organization in terms of our end markets and
trying to pursue growth opportunities for the future and really take advantage of the situation. So I'd say
these are certainly incremental investments. There are a wide range of different types of investments.
We talked about field turbo resources during our last call. That program is going to be a little bit more
disproportionately invested towards China versus the rest of the world, but it is a very global program.
We're doing other things that are more sales and marketing in nature that we do on an ongoing basis, but
we're going to do a little bit more than we normally do during the second half of the year. And then we're
investing in other things in terms of -- from a product perspective. But I wouldn't say we're necessarily
accelerating things, but we certainly are working on our priority list. And so I think every company has a
priority list, and we're able to work down that list at a more accelerated rate, just given the strong results
that we see in the business.

Joshua Paul Waldman
Cleveland Research Company

Got it. And then how should we think about the magnitude of the capacity investments you're making?
And are those expected to hit more in 2022, or could it be partially seen in 2021 as well?

In terms of manufacturing capacity, you're speaking specifically to? I wouldn't say -- I'd say there's
different investments in different parts of the business. I mean I think it's going to be nothing that will
be coming all at once. I think you'll see gradual improvements, nothing significant or material to any one
quarter, but certainly things that will benefit each quarter kind of going forward, and then some stuff will
kind of kick in a little bit next year. So...

Your final question will come from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Patrick, you talked about sort of using Spinnaker in terms of cross-selling initiatives that could be wrong.
I don't recall Mettler talking much about that historically. Is that a new aspect of Spinnaker that you're
looking to capitalize on? And what segments or what areas of the business would be most impacted by
that?

Patrick K. Kaltenbach
President & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Brandon. That's an excellent question, yes. And it's not totally new, but we're definitely
emphasizing it more because look, our product portfolio is broad, it goes across a broader part of the
value chain of our customers, all the way from R&D, QC into production scale up and manufacturing. And
with Spinnaker, historically, we have been more focused on a very dedicated and prioritized sales force
along the different product lines. We are now looking at -- more intensely at cross-selling opportunities in
the -- on the customer side and also starting from one existing sales contact on, let's say, a specific R&D
contact to make sure that we understand better the customer side in terms of what other opportunities
are for us to penetrate in other parts of the customer organization, maybe QC, maybe -- it may be
manufacturing, maybe in production scale-up. And we're using then these leads to send basically other
dedicated sales team members with the right background and know-how to these other accounts within
a customer account. Again, we don't use channel list. We have specialized workforces. And this is where
it's now, I would say, different or enhanced from what we have done before. We are -- we have more
dedicated initiatives. And actually, as part of the recent leadership team meeting we have, we had this one
of the topic across all of the divisional leaders and all of the business and market organization leaders of
how we can do this more effectively moving forward to make sure that we capture all of the opportunities
that we have at any given customer site.
