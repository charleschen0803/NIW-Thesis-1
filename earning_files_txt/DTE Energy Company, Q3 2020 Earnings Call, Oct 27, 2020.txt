DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the DTE Energy Third Quarter Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to
hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Barbara Tuckfield, Director of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Barbara Tuckfield
Director - Investor Relations

Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to read
the safe harbor statement on Page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking
statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the
appendix of today's presentation.

With us this morning are Jerry Norcia, President and CEO, who will discuss the transaction we announced
this morning that transitions DTE into a predominantly pure-play utility. We also have David Slater,
President and COO of DTE Midstream and President and CEO-elect of the new Midstream company, who
will take you through the benefits of an independent midstream company; Bob Skaggs, a member of our
Board of Directors and Executive Chairman-elect of the new Midstream company, will say a few words
on the transaction; and finally, Dave Ruud, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide an update on the
quarter, our increased 2020 earnings guidance and our 2021 early outlook. And now I'll turn it over to
Jerry to start the call this morning.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, thanks, Barb, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I hope everyone is
staying healthy and safe.

So I'll start on Slide 4. This morning, DTE announced that our Board of Directors has authorized
management to pursue a plan for the spin-off of Midstream from DTE Energy. On this call, we'll discuss
the spin-off and demonstrate how it will unlock significant shareholder value by positioning DTE as a
predominantly pure-play utility with visible and superior growth and creating an independent, well-
positioned midstream company with excellent growth potential. Then we will provide you with an update
on our 2020 results, which continue to be very strong, giving us confidence to increase operating EPS
guidance for the year. This positions us to exceed original guidance for the 12th year in a row.

I want to thank all the leaders and our 10,000 employees at DTE for creating this tremendous success in a
year of great turmoil and uncertainty. We are firing on all cylinders, keeping our people safe and delivering
for our customers, communities and investors. It is truly remarkable and certainly a reflection of the grit
and determination of the great people of DTE, a big thank you.

We're also providing an early outlook for 2021 and announcing that our Board approved a 7% dividend
increase for 2021, continuing our history of providing strong dividend growth. Now onto Slide 6 for an
overview of the spin transaction. This decision to separate the 2 companies follows a thorough review with
our Board to identify opportunities to optimize our portfolio and maximize shareholder value. And in the
end, after the evaluation of various alternatives, we determined that our strategic spin of the midstream
business was the best way to create value.

We recognize that this decision comes down long after our significant acquisition of assets in the
Haynesville basin. Our decision to spin Midstream is a result of a series of discussions with our Board that

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

began in the summer of 2019, prior to the acquisition, when we started talking about a portfolio pivot to a
predominantly pure-play regulated utility.

Through 2019, while business mix discussions were still ongoing, we continue to pursue an aggressive
value-creation agenda for Midstream, which yielded the Haynesville acquisition. This was a great
acquisition that pull forward growth and value. Because this acquisition and the balance of the Midstream
portfolio continues to perform exceedingly well, provide better-than-expected growth opportunities and
has scaled and thrived on its own, it crystallized our path to pivot to high-growth, pure-play utility with the
spin of a well-run midstream company.

We believe this strategy will unlock significant value for our shareholders. The spin is expected to unlock
the full potential of our premier regulated utilities and premium natural gas midstream assets, align
DTE's business mix with investor preferences and overall market trends and create 2 entities, each with
experienced leadership and proven track records. We expect the entities to pay combined dividends higher
than the current dividend with an 8% to 10% post-spin increase from 21% to 22% versus 6% we had
planned pre spin.

For well over a decade, our midstream business has created significant growth through greenfield
development and strategic acquisitions and has become an industry leader with solid cash flows and
tremendous opportunities for continued growth. We believe this separation positions DTE Midstream with
enhanced flexibility and provides shareholders an opportunity for investment and a high-quality midstream
company with assets strategically located in premium basins and connected to major demand markets.

As most of you know, my background includes a substantial amount of time in the gas industry, including
my involvement and development of our midstream business. The team and I have dedicated a significant
amount of time and energy creating a midstream business at DTE that is recognized as one of the best
in the country. So you can imagine how important this decision is to our team and me. After careful
consideration and review with our Board, I am confident that this separation is the best way to allow
the midstream business and its team to achieve their full potential and to enhance overall value for our
shareholders.

As I said, this positions DTE into a nearly fully regulated utility, with 90% of our operating earnings
and an even higher percentage of future capital investments going into our 2 premium utilities. Our 5-
year plan will hold this 90-10 mix. About 10% of DTE's operating earnings will be from our remaining
nonutility businesses. The separation of DTE and the Midstream company is truly beneficial for both
entities, positioning them well for the future.

Turning to Slide 7. I'll provide details on the structure of the transaction. DTE and the new Midstream
company will have distinct corporate structures. DTE shareholders will retain their shares of DTE stock and
receive pro rata shares of the new Midstream company. We expect to complete the spin by midyear 2021,
subject to final Board approval, the Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the SEC
and other regulatory approvals.

I will remain the CEO of DTE Energy, with Gerry Anderson continuing as Executive Chairman and Ruth
Shaw as Lead Independent Board Director. David Slater, current President and COO of GSP, is the CEO-
elect of the new Midstream company. Most of you are familiar with David, who is well-respected in the
industry. Bob Skaggs is Executive Chairman-elect of the new Midstream company and will continue to
serve on DTE's Board. As many of you know, Bob served as Chairman and CEO of NiSource, where he
executed the company's successful spin of the Columbia Pipeline Group and went on to become its CEO.
David and Bob each have 30 years of experience in the energy industry. The Midstream company is
extremely fortunate to have these 2 seasoned leaders, along with a really strong team to support them.

Let's move on and discuss the strong growth profile at DTE Energy on Slide 9. This transaction positions
DTE in a predominantly pure-play electric and gas utility. About 90% of DTE will be regulated by the
Michigan Public Service Commission. We will invest significant capital over the next 5 years to support
utility growth. We are substantially growing our utility rate base with a 5-year capital investment plan of
$17 billion, an increase of $2 billion over our previous 5-year plan. This capital plan is strategically aligned
with our aggressive ESG targets. DTE's EPS growth rate have been among the best in the industry over

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

the past decade and is maintaining its long-term 5% to 7% growth target. At DTE Electric, we anticipate
long-term operating earnings growth of 7% to 8% and about 9% at DTE Gas. Our full separation profile
will better align DTE with investors' preferences for high-performing regulated utilities.

We will continue our strong record of providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our
customers and being a force for growth in the communities where we live and serve. DTE will continue to
offer competitive dividends our investors expect. We have paid a dividend for more than 100 consecutive
years and have increased our dividend each year since 2010. We will target dividend growth and a payout
ratio that remains consistent with our pure-play utility peers. All in all, this transaction offers greater
appeal to investor focused on the strategic and financial characteristics of a pure-play utility.

Let's move on to Slide 10. The separation will highlight the strengths of our core electric and gas utility
businesses. Michigan has one of the best regulatory environments in the nation. We continue to work very
closely with the Michigan Public Service Commission to support the people of Michigan, particularly this
year during the pandemic.

DTE continues to have a distinctive continuous improvement culture, enabling us to continue our superior
track record of cost management. We also have a strong commitment to service excellence. DTE Energy
ranks in the top 10 of energy companies with energy efficiency programs, and I'm proud to say both
utilities are in the top quartile for residential customer satisfaction with DTE Gas recently earning the top
ranking in the Midwest by J.D. Power.

Moving on to the next slide, I'll discuss our capital plan, beginning with DTE Electric. We expect to invest
about $14 billion in the electric company over the next 5 years. This is 17% higher than our previous
plan. About $2 billion of the total electric investments will be in renewables. That will support our plan
to reduce 80% of our carbon emissions by 2040 and be net zero by 2050. We are also focusing our
investment on modernizing an aging distribution system with significant investments in hardening,
automation and technology in our distribution business. We are building a flawless grid-of-the-future for
our customers. Our capital plan supports a robust near-term outlook for DTE Electric with a 7% to 8%
long-term operating earnings growth rate.

On the next slide, I will discuss capital investment opportunities at DTE Gas. Over the next 5 years, DTE
Gas plans to invest over $3 billion to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure with potential upside to
the 5-year plan. Along with our pipeline integrity and main replacement investment, we are investing in
innovative technology and products that will reduce methane emissions and reduce the carbon footprint
of our gas company. Overall, our capital plan supports a strong near-term outlook for DTE Gas and a 9%
long-term operating earnings growth rate.

On the next slide, I will discuss our plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions to further
strengthen our ESG stewardship. As I mentioned, at DTE Electric, we are committed to achieving net-
zero carbon emissions by 2050 with a 50% reduction by 2030. To meet these targets, we plan to double
our renewable energy by 2024 and quadruple it by 2040. We are also progressing on our voluntary
renewables program. This program enables customers to invest in renewable energy and drive Michigan
to a cleaner energy future. We have more than 17,000 business and residential customers enrolled, with
large industrial customers including GM, Ford and University of Michigan. We have one of the largest
voluntary renewable programs in the country, with 750 megawatts of demand commitments from our
customers.

DTE Gas announced its unique and comprehensive plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by
2050. This plan includes working with our suppliers and customers to enable further reductions across the
value chain. So as you can see, our strong utility investment profile positions DTE for continued growth
and a strong environmental leadership role.

Now I'll turn it over to David Slater to discuss the new and exciting opportunity with the Midstream
company. David, over to you.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. I know I've met most of you over the past few years, and
we've had many discussions on our midstream business. Let me just say that I'm excited about the
opportunity this transaction provides. We have achieved solid growth for over a decade, and establishing
our business as an independent midstream company will really benefit shareholders by unlocking
significant value. We will also continue our commitment to provide excellent service to our customers,
develop growth opportunities and reaffirm our strong relationships with our partners.

As you know, we have been expanding the midstream business through greenfield projects and strategic
acquisitions to become the premier company we are today. This combination of success has enabled
the creation of an independent gas-focused midstream company in the most prolific natural gas basins
connected to key demand centers. The Midstream company has an experienced leadership team that
will continue to focus on organic growth and value creation from our well-positioned platforms. We
have a strong long-term contracted asset portfolio with a diverse customer base, including electric and
gas utilities, power generators, industrials, national marketers and producers. This portfolio generates
significant cash flow and is well positioned to create value and growth for our shareholders.

The new Midstream company will enable better investor alignment and offer the only independent mid-
cap gas-focused C-corp investment in the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville basins. We will have a strong
capital structure and attractive dividend policy associated with high-quality midstream companies. With
an initial balance sheet target of 4x debt-to-EBITDA and 2x dividend coverage ratio, our balance sheet will
support the ability to make value-accretive investments and pay a competitive dividend.

And let's turn to Slide 16 and talk about Midstream's platforms. As many of you know, the midstream
business is comprised of 3 platforms: regulated pipelines, regulated storage and gathering. Our footprint
is extensive and has been developed through highly accretive organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
Also, our assets connect the most economic basins with key demand centers in the U.S. Along with our
footprint, the business is underpinned by the strength of our contracts and our counterparties, which I'll
go over in more detail in the next few slides.

Future growth is driven by platforms in the early development phase, which include Blue Union, LEAP,
NEXUS, Link and Generation Pipeline. Additional opportunities include economic compression expansions
of pipeline systems, additional market laterals and continued gathering build-outs. Our other platforms
like Bluestone, Millennium, Vector and Gas Storage are in a more advanced development phase but still
provide a stable and high-quality stream of cash flows. So Midstream's platforms position us nicely going
forward to deploy organic development capital and pay a competitive and growing dividend, together,
adding value for shareholders focused on Gas Midstream businesses.

Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss Midstream's track record. The Midstream business has consistently
achieved strong financial results, delivering 18% average annual operating earnings growth since 2008
and 20% annual growth and adjusted EBITDA over that same time period. The business has contributed
significant cash flow, over $3 billion since 2008. And Midstream is producing strong adjusted EBITDA in
2020, which is expected to be about $700 million. You can see that these are a unique set of assets for
investors who are looking for superior value creation from the Midstream company.

Now let's move to Slide 18. As we have highlighted, Midstream's assets are located in the most attractive
dry gas basins: Marcellus, Utica and the Haynesville and are connected to key demand centers, which
provide a great opportunity to continue DTE's history of success. Midstream's counterparties continue
to perform according to the plans they have shared with us earlier in the year. Our pipeline and storage
portfolios are well contracted, on average, for 10 years. Our major producers are in solid positions, hedged
over 70% in 2021 at $2.70, connected to premium markets and have minimal near-term maturities. Over
90% of our revenue is from demand-based contracts, MVCs and flowing gas.

With the position of our assets and the strength of our counterparties and contracts, the company has
highly visible cash flows and a solid long-term growth outlook. The creation of an independent Midstream
company provides the opportunity to continue our record of success and create value for our shareholders.

Before I turn it over to Dave Ruud, who will discuss DTE's financial performance, Bob Skaggs would like to
say a few words.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Robert C. Skaggs
Independent Director

Thanks, David. I'm grateful and honored to be working with you and the team. Also, thanks to everyone
for joining us today. I'm glad to reconnect with the investment community.

To say the least, we are very excited about this morning's announcement. As Jerry and David mentioned,
this spin creates a compelling opportunity for both DTE Energy and the new Midstream company to unlock
their full potential, benefiting customers and employees of both companies and delivering immediate
and long-term value for investors. As I said, I'm thrilled to be part of this new independent midstream
company and excited to partner with David Slater and his great team.

With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave Ruud, who will discuss DTE's financial performance for the quarter.

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, DTE delivered solid performances across
all of our businesses. As you remember, at the end of the second quarter, we expected to be at the higher
end of our earnings guidance at DTE Electric, GSP and Energy Trading. We've accomplished that and more,
so we are now raising our 2020 operating EPS guidance midpoint from $6.61 per share to $7 per share.
We are confident of this increase based on the strong progress we are making on our economic response
plan and the solid performance we are seeing this year in our utility businesses and at our nonutilities,
which are continuing to perform ahead of plan.

We've made great progress at our utilities, working with the Michigan Public Service Commission to
continue supporting our customers. Earlier this year, DTE Electric received approval in our rate plan that
would delay the effective date of our next rate case until 2022, which would keep rates steady during this
challenging economic time for our customers. Yesterday, DTE Electric also filed an innovative onetime
plan with the MPSC to refund our nonweather-related sales increases. This increase was a result of the
unprecedented residential electricity usage patterns driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. If approved, the
onetime accounting treatment will not impact customer rates and will position DTE Electric to further defer
its next rate case filing and keep customer rates steady even longer.

In the third quarter, we also received approval for our amended renewable energy plan, and we recently
filed for the approval of additional voluntary renewables. At DTE Gas, we received MPSC approval for our
rate case settlement in August. The rate increase of $110 million supports our capital investment plan
that includes an ROE of 9.9%. And as Jerry mentioned, DTE Gas ranked first in Midwest for residential gas
customer satisfaction. It's one of a few times in our recent history where we have no major regulatory
outcomes in our forward year, and these regulatory successes have helped solidify our 2021 plan.

Our GSP team placed LEAP into service in the quarter ahead of schedule and under budget. With the
favorability that we are experiencing this year, we are also positioning 2021 for a strong year by pulling
some O&M work forward. This increases our confidence in achieving our results next year.

For 2021, we are providing an operating EPS early outlook midpoint of $7.07 per share that delivers 7%
growth from the 2020 original guidance midpoint. And as we mentioned, we are increasing our 2021
dividend by 7%. This outlook is supported by strong growth at each segment, which I'll explain in more
detail in a few minutes.

But first, let's move to our third quarter financial results on Slide 21. Overall, DTE had a great third
quarter. Again, this was supported by our economic response plan savings and strong performance across
our businesses. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $504 million. This translates into $2.61 per
share for the quarter. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including a reconciliation to
GAAP reported earnings in the appendix.

I will start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $91 million
higher than 2019, primarily due to higher residential sales, the implementation of new rates and warmer
weather in the quarter.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $18 million higher than last year. The earnings increase is
driven primarily by the infrastructure recovery mechanism and lower O&M costs. Let's keep moving down
the page to our Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. Operating earnings were up $29
million versus the third quarter of 2019, driven primarily by the first year of operation of the Blue Union
system and the LEAP pipeline, which went into service on August 1.

On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment. Operating earnings were $2
million lower than the third quarter of 2019. This decrease is due to lower steel-related sales, partially
offset by new RNG and on-site energy projects. On the next row, you can see our operating earnings
at our Energy Trading business were $3 million lower compared to last year, mainly due to the power
portfolio performance. Finally, Corp and Other was favorable by $20 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily
due to timing of taxes. Overall, DTE earned $2.61 per share in the third quarter of 2020, which is $0.70
higher than the third quarter of 2019.

Now let's move to Slide 22 to review our 2020 operating earnings guidance. As we said, DTE is having a
very strong 2020 so far, and we are raising our operating EPS guidance midpoint from $6.61 per share to
$7 per share. We are very proud of how our DTE team is working through the pandemic this year and how
we continue to deliver for our customers. We created and very effectively executed an economic response
plan, and our team has consistently achieved against that plan. We've also had favorability from warm
summer weather. And finally, our nonutilities continued to perform ahead of plan. All of these factors have
led us to increase 2020 operating EPS guidance. The favorability we are seeing this year is also allowing us
to pull ahead future O&M work from 2021 into 2020, which positions us well to achieve our future plans.

Let's move on to Slide 23 to discuss our 2021 early outlook. For 2021, operating EPS early outlook
midpoint of $7.07 per share provides 7% growth from 2020 original guidance. This outlook does not
reflect the strategic separation impacts and any post-transaction guidance will be provided later in the
process. In 2021, we are expecting growth in each of our businesses. At DTE Electric, growth will be
driven by distribution and cleaner generation investments. DTE Gas will see continued main renewal
and other infrastructure improvement investments. GSP will continue growth across its pipeline and
gathering platforms. And continued RNG and cogeneration project development will drive growth in P&I.
We anticipate a portion of our economic response plan savings will continue through 2021 in each of our
business areas. Additionally, we expect DTE's equity needs to remain consistent with our previous plan
even with the spin-off of Midstream.

Now I will wrap things up before we take your questions. With the transaction we described today, DTE
becomes a predominantly pure-play utility company, with over 90% of our operating earnings coming
from our 2 utilities. Our company will continue a solid track record of providing safe and reliable energy
and excellent customer service while also being a force for growth in the communities where we live
and serve. Michigan has one of the best regulatory environments in the nation, and we are committed
to continuing to deliver for our customers, communities and investors. Additionally, we believe today's
announcement puts Midstream and its talented team in a position to grow with enhanced flexibility and
provides shareholders an opportunity for investment in premier gas-focused midstream company. The new
Midstream company will be building on its history of success with the leadership of an experienced and
respected management team. In 2020, DTE is on track to exceed our original guidance midpoint for the
12th consecutive year and is positioned for a strong 2021, as evidenced by our 7% dividend increase for
next year.
With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open up the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim
Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats obviously on the quarter and the news coming out of GSP today. A couple of questions here.
Can you first -- can you comment on sort of that forward growth expectations post the spin of 5% to 7%
consolidated versus the 7% to 8% electric and 9% for gas. Is that kind of explained by some dilution
from equity issuances, especially in light of the higher CapEx outlook? Or alternatively, is there some
dis-synergies in splitting the GSP segment that could put some near term pressure? And then just, the
5% to 7%, it's off the original guidance range. Just -- can you just remind us how you're reiterating and
replacing sort of midstream earnings, what's the key drivers there?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll start, Shar, and then I'll ask Dave Ruud to add, but the 5% to 7% EPS growth is up our 2020
base, and it's pretty consistent with our growth pattern that we've described to our investors over many
years. And certainly, we always end up on the high end of that, as you've seen this year and other years.
But it's driven -- post spin, it will be driven by our capital programs at both our utilities, which are quite
robust and very visible. We see 5-plus years of really strong investment opportunities in our 2 utilities. So
that's fundamentally what's driving the 5% to 7% EPS growth for the company, post spin. Dave Ruud, do
you want to add to that?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

I think that -- I think you actually explained it very well. We have some -- the difference between what
you see at the utilities, so the 5% to 7%, is due to some of the equity coming in. But we are very
confident in the 5% to 7% growth going forward.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And is there...

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Just so we're clear...

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Sorry. Yes. Sorry, Jerry.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

I was going to say, Shar, in addition to that, we're not seeing any incremental equity needs as part of the
spin. So it will be equity as we had forecasted prior.

President, CEO & Director

Dave Ruud?

David Ruud

There will be some initial costs at the corporate that we will have to work through, but there's no long-
term dis-synergies after the first year or 2.

Okay. Perfect. And then so when we're thinking about the spin, as you contemplated, the 4x debt-to-
EBITDA sort of implies about $3 billion of debt attributed to GSP and the spin. How should we sort of think
about post-spin leverage on the holdco, right? It seems like there could be a sizable amount of debt that
remains. Are the credit metrics going to stay intact? What's sort of been the feedback with the agencies?
And any sort of guidance on pro forma credit metrics for DTE and Newco that you can kind of guide to it
today?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet at DTE and committed to maintaining
our ratings. We do expect that this separation will be credit-enhancing for us. And so that's going to
allow some flexibility for our metrics while still maintaining our solid investment-grade rating. We've --
we had initial conversations with the agencies yesterday and those were positive. And we'll be providing
them more detail in the coming months. But you were right, Shar, the way it will work is that as we spin
Midstream and they develop their own capital structure at that 4x debt-to-EBITDA, that will require them
raising debt and the proceeds will come to DTE. Our plan at DTE will be to use those proceeds to pay down
our parent debt in the same amount.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly for me is given today's announcement, curious, maybe Jerry, to get
your thoughts on sort of the remaining nonregulated businesses, really just P&I. Is there sort of any value
to having that segment now that majority of the nonreg is slated for spin? Just curious on your thoughts
here and on the remaining mix.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Shar, the way we're doing P&I is that it's actually complementary to our ESG agenda and as we invest
in RNG projects and also invest on behalf of some of our industrial customers to reduce their carbon
footprints with cogeneration projects. So it's -- we view it as a small part of our business, overall. It will be
90% utility, 10% nonutility, but complementary.

Congrats.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

First question. I want to go about the long-term EPS guidance a little bit differently. So you're continuing
to guide to 5% to 7%. That's where you pointed in the past but you've consistently delivered better
than that, more like 7% or 8%. Now it seems like a lot of that upside came from Midstream. So looking
forward, should we think about an actual EPS growth rate of 6%? Or might there be some good old-
fashioned DTE conservatism still in there that could take it more toward the higher end?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Andrew, my sense is that you'll continue to see the DTE pattern of under-promising and over-delivering.
So our 5% to 7% is the target. But of course, we target to mid, but we've always done better than that
because we have significant contingencies built for each year.

And as I look at 2021, it's looking really strong. And we're also starting to work on 2022, and that's
looking really good. So I'm confident that you'll continue to see DTE's better than you've seen in the past.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Terrific. That's great to hear. Next, on dividends, you mentioned a lot of comments about peer growth --
sorry, peer average growth rate and payout ratios. Can you maybe put some numbers on that? I mean
we've all got our own comp sheets, but what do you consider to be a utility peer average, dividend payout
ratio or growth rate?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave Ruud, do you want to take that?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. We'll remain about where we are at our payout ratio, which is right around in that 60% range,
which is kind of consistent with the best pure-play peers. And then on dividend growth, that's going to be
consistent with our earnings growth going forward.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Great. Helpful. My last question is you've invested a ton of capital into midstream in recent years,
including the Haynesville acquisition for over $3 billion about a year ago. My question is, how do you think
about regulated utility M&A now?

That hasn't really been much of your focus historically, but might you see yourselves as being potentially
acquisitive in the regulated world? And if so, what kind of targets might look the most appealing to you?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Andrew, we have a $17 billion utility capital plan right now, which is a very large organic capital program
that will create tremendous value for our investors, for our utility investors. And I'll mention again that,
that's $2 billion higher than our prior 5-year plan. So I -- we're going to remain highly focused on our

M&A.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And can you comment at all about the potential for a sale of the utility business if one were to -- if
you were to be approached, given the new pure-play look?

We've got a great growth agenda and organic platform growth at our utilities, and we're happy to pursue
that.

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Once more, congratulations. Perhaps just to follow up, a little bit more of a cleanup on the credit side.
I think a lot of folks asked me here. Just to be extra clear about this, you said, I think, to quote you,
"credit-enhancing". Do you know what your new thoughts would be around minimum FFO debt target
specifically here?

You might have been indirectly asked this earlier, but just wanted to try to come back on that because
you're at 18% now. Should we think about this being closer to some of your peers at, call it, 15%?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave Ruud?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We are -- yes, we're working through that, and we're in discussions, obviously, with the agencies.
We do think it is credit-enhancing, and so we do think we can have the opportunity to move our FFO debt
down to something that's more in line with peers, but that's yet to be defined as we work through the
details here.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And when do you think you'll provide an updated view? And maybe this is a leading question into
the 5% to 7% as well. When do you think you'll be in a position to provide an updated view on the credit
as well as how you're thinking about that baseline moving off of your current base, right? When do you
think you'll roll it forward? Once you close or more on a pro forma sort of 22 basis? And I asked this
specifically because you obviously have the P&I segment perhaps holding back that 5% to 7%, at least
given the REF step-downs coming up here.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave, so do you want to take that?

detail on how this will play out. But it will be before -- on a pro forma level, before this thing.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. So do you think -- so that wouldn't yet include the step-down on the REF for the baseline, right,
when you think about it?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, our 2022 projections when we put those forward in our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate, Julien, does
include the step-down in REF and the replacement that we've been working on at P&I. So we will -- our
5% to 7%, yes.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Sure. Absolutely. I only stressed it because the earlier questions had been fixated on the discrepancy
between your utility and your consolidated growth. So that's why I'm fixated on when you could
potentially move beyond that big item there. Okay. Excellent.

Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Could you talk a little bit about why not sell the Midstream business to another buyer like Berkshire
Hathaway similar to the way Dominion's? What about it? Why...

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, we examined -- go ahead, please.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. Why the spin? Yes, that's the other question.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We examined a series of alternatives as we were looking to make this pivot to more of a pure-play
utility model, and we -- when we looked at all those alternatives, we found that the spin, in our opinion,
created the greatest amount of shareholder value for our investors going forward.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Right. Are there any tax consequences? And also, is the 4x debt-to-EBITDA level, is that low enough to
compete with a sector that's -- a publicly traded midstream sector that's already kind of under stress?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, there are no tax consequences. This is designed to be a tax-free spin. And certainly, the debt level
of the new Midstream company will be very competitive and provide tremendous flexibility to provide a
strong dividend, a strong dividend growth as well as pursue their capital growth programs.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Right. And on that dividend issue, just to follow up on Shar's questions. Are -- how would equity needs
remain unchanged at DTE Energy after you've lost the cash flow from this business, right? I mean I know
you're -- you said it's credit-enhancing, but I'm just wondering if that's -- is that enough to not change
any equity needs going forward considering the loss of cash flows?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave Ruud, do you want to take that?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The piece you mentioned there, the credit-enhancing, it does help support the additional -- or the
lack of additional equity that we'll need. We still do have the equity converts that come in, in 2022. But we
see our plan, our equity plan being very consistent with our previous plan.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Right. And one last question. When do you think you'll file the next electric rate case? I think that's coming
up probably early next year.

obviously delay as much as possible, but that's our base plan right now.

Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

I have actually just a couple of questions. So first, I remember the previous EEI conference, so you guys
talked about how the affordability issue sort of impedes your ability to grow utility CapEx. Now you're
showing us this very sizable growth on the electric side and this potential increase on the gas side. So
what's changed since last year?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, Angie, good question. The pandemic revealed some significant opportunities for us from a cost
structure perspective at both our utilities. And as I've have mentioned in earlier calls, we had this $2
billion sitting on the sidelines looking to get in and -- but we needed to create affordability room. Well, we
have, in fact, done that and created affordability room, and the pandemic was very revealing as to what
we could do in addition to what we have been doing for many, many years. And so that's how we found
the affordability room, to bring in that capital into our plan for our key utilities.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. And this additional $0.5 billion of CapEx on the gas side, I understand that this hasn't been
approved. So what are you waiting for with that incremental spending?

Gerardo Norcia

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

The $2 billion is something that's in our plan at the electric company, the $0.5 billion at the gas company
is sort of in the same position as the $2 billion was in, which is we're looking for our affordability
initiatives to bring that into the plan. And we're trying to display that we've got a very strong inventory of
investment opportunity at both utilities.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Great. The 5% to 7% growth that you're reiterating, what's the -- I understand it's off of 2020. Is --
what's the basis? What's the starting point? So is it like $5.27 from basically stripping out the GSP
earnings from 2020?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

David Ruud, do you want to take that?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. What we're showing there now is the 5% to 7% for next year is base as if we didn't spin, but the 5%
to 7% will be based on us having GSP removed from the baseline.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. And there's not going to be any type of reallocation of parent-level expenses or something like that,
that would weigh on that 2020 number?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

We will have to work through the parent-level expenses and how we manage those internally, but they're
not expected to be material as we weigh on that.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. And my last question about the Midstream spin-off. So we have this debate about -- among
investors about what is the multiple that the several business will be trading at. And we see this big
disparity between pipeline multiples versus gathering multiples. Can you give us a sense from that EBITDA
perspective, what percentage of the 2020 EBITDA is associated with gathering assets, which seem to
trade at meaningfully lower EBITDA multiples?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

David Slater, you want to take that?

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Sure, can, Jerry. Angie, good to talk to you. And yes, that's a good question. And what we've disclosed
previously is we have about 10% in our storage business, about 40% gathering and 50% in the pipeline
segment. And those percentages are income percentages. So that's a good proxy for your question.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. Well, so with that in mind, it's like a simple math which indicates that this business would have
a relatively low market cap, like coming around $3 billion, $3.5 billion with seemingly strong technical
pressure because you've had utility investors, that based on how you're stocked, you still have performed

16

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

about 50% of midstream. So why were you so convinced that this spin will actually create value just given
the relatively potential small market cap and technical pressures that it's going to bring?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, we think that, first of all, the spin creates a premier regulated utility, 90-10 sort of structure inside
our utilities that investors will have the opportunity to invest in with a strong capital growth program for
5-plus years. Our Midstream company is going to be well capitalized when we compare it to its peers.
And they have strong dividend growth, and we think it's going to be a very attractive investment for the
stream investors and also current investors in DTE.

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Jerry, if I could add to that maybe?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Sure.

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Yes. Angie, I think it's going to be a very unique investment opportunity in the midstream space.
Predominantly, natural gas and its portfolio is really laying over the best dry gas basins in the country. And
fundamentally, there's a lot of fundamental support and growth in those areas. So I think this investment
opportunity for those investors that are looking for a really high-quality midstream investment, I think it
will be very attractive.

just comment on any involvement they might have had with this? Or how to characterize that?

Gerardo Norcia

So I'll start by saying, Steve, that we started to talk about this pivot in the summer of 2019, and we
started looking at a pivot towards a pure-play utility model. And it was a series of discussions between

lots of potential investors and analysts and get feedback, but I'm not going to comment specifically on

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then just to kind of get a sense of the kind of thought on the new company financials. So
obviously, the cash flow from the gas business will be separated, but you should have more. This 18%
FFO-to-debt target that you've had for a largely pure regulated utility, I would assume that you'll be able
to fund it with somewhat meaningfully lower FFO to debt. And what is a -- if you look at the peers for a
largely regulated utility, at your credit, like what would that range be versus the 18-plus that you've been
at?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave Ruud, do you want to take that?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. When we look at our peers, we see them down in the 14% to 16% actually in that range. We are still
committed to maintaining our ratings, and so we're going to be really careful with that, but we do expect
that this will be credit-enhancing for us.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then lastly, just on the midstream business. So you had kind of growth targets out there
together for the midstream business. I think it was like 9.5%-net-income-growth type of thing. Could you
just comment on how that business is tracking versus the prior growth target? And was it -- is it on track
with what you had said before for midstream through '20 -- I think it was through '22 or '24.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

So Steve, I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to David Slater. But I would say that nothing has changed
fundamentally from a growth perspective in our midstream business. All of the organic opportunities that
we were pursuing continue to play out. But David Slater, why don't you add some more color to that?

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Sure thing, Jerry, and it's Steve, that's a great question. And I'd just reiterate that absolutely nothing has
changed in this business between yesterday and today. We've got a great team, a great management
team that's going to be leading the new company and an excellent operating team that's coming along. As
we've progressed through this standing up of a new C-corp, we'll be putting out detailed forward guidance,
kind of best-in-class guidance as expected in the midstream sector. And certainly be able to answer the
question you're asking with a lot more granularity in detail as we move forward in the process here.

But suffice it to say, absolutely, nothing's changed in the business. If anything, the fundamentals in
the basins I described earlier are just strengthening right now. So we feel really positive about this
new company and it's going to provide an investment vehicle for some of the midstream investors that
really doesn't exist in the sector today. There's not another company, a C-corp in the midstream space,
that's positioned like this company will be positioned around those particular basins in the country, really
attached to some really strong market centers.

Thank you.

Stephen Calder Byrd

I wanted to talk about the midstream business. Would you be able to give us a sense of the maintenance
CapEx? And I'm thinking not just about physical maintenance, but the CapEx needed to keep the cash
flows flat and especially for the gathering business. How do you think about just the sort of base capital
need to keep the business running flat on EBITDA?

Gerardo Norcia

Well, I'll start just by saying, it's a relatively new system. So those maintenance CapEx dollars will be
modest at best. But David Slater, do you want to add some color to that?

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Sure, Jerry. You're exactly right, and Steve, that's a great question. And we're definitely going to be
providing more color around that as we approach spin date. But the systems are all generally new, so very
modest maintenance capital required for the foreseeable future. And that will be a very small number,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

19

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

especially as you compare this midstream company with some of the other midstream companies that
have more mature, larger networks that they're having to maintain.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. Yes, as you all think through that, I'd love to get a sense not just the physical, which I
assume is low, but the economic maintenance for gathering, just given the nature of the business.

But I guess moving on to just thinking about the gathering business and credit quality. Could you give
us a little more information on the credit quality for that particular segment in terms of sort of range of
customer ratings? Any customer notices to modify or terminate agreements and just sort of other credit
protections you have? That's a pretty common question that comes up on the gathering side, especially.
Just curious how you think about the credit quality there.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

David?

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Sure. Yes, that's another excellent question, Steve. So as we've disclosed in the past -- and we provided a
lot of detail on this when we did the Haynesville transaction last year -- in most of our agreements, we put
credit-enhancement clauses in there to really protect not only the receivables but the forward-obligations
that those customers have. So that would be sort of my first statement, and that's sort of hard coded into
our DNA to always do that.

So it has the effect of enhancing the credit profile of the counterparty. But as I kind of step back and
I know we've shared this in the past, but some of our bigger customers on the gathering side of our
business would be company names like Southwestern, Cabot, obviously, Indigo, Antero. So those are
some of the names that are in our portfolio. And again, well we've looked very closely at their credit
and monitor that with a lot of detail, have a lot of information that they shared with us like quarter-by-
quarter. So we're monitoring that closely. And all of those customers are in good positions. They have no
significant maturities before them. And their cash flows are strengthening in the current environment, with
the fundamental strengthening in dry natural gas. It's benefiting all these companies. And so we actually
see their credit profile strengthening. It's easier to see when you look at their -- just look at their long-
term debt and how it's trading, you can clearly see a strengthening credit profile across our gathering
customers.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's really helpful. And just last one for me. Just for the midstream business overall, are there or any
additional cash flow metrics beyond the EBITDA that you laid out, whether you think about distributable
cash flow, free cash flow, some definition of cash flow? Or is that something that you all are going to
provide at a later date?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Yes. You're exactly right, Stephen. Those are what I would call best-in-class midstream metrics. And with
the opportunity of standing this company up anew, we're going to make it best-in-class. So we're going to
work through those details and look forward to spending time with you down the road when you get closer
to spin date and share all that.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Most of my questions obviously have been answered, but just 2 real quick questions. I guess the first
is, as you were looking at becoming a pure-play, did you explore potentially divesting or winding down
both the P&I and/or the energy marketing business? And what was the determination to retain those
businesses?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

So James, I'll start by saying that when we looked at all our alternatives to unlock shareholder value and
create incremental value for our shareholders, the biggest mover that we saw was to really create the spin
for GSP. We saw P&I as complementary to our ESG agenda with our remaining utility platform, which will
be 90% of our business. And so we've decided to pursue this path at this point in time.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Great. And just -- I guess, could you also just remind us also the -- what was the outlook, I guess,
for equity on a going-forward basis? The question has been asked a bunch of times, but I know that you're
targeting 18%, but with a pure-play utility, you probably should be down sort of in the mid-teens. And
then on top of it, you have the conversion, I think, in '22 of the convertible that was done to finance the
midstream business. It seems like you have a lot more flexibility either not to issue equity or maybe to
use incremental debt. So could you provide some guidance, I guess, how you're thinking about how much
equity was in your plan now for the 5-year period?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave Ruud, do you want to take that?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. And in the deck, in the appendix on Slide 28, it showed our previous planned equity issuances.
And you can see in the next year, there was $100 million to $400 million, and then in '22 was the $1.3
billion of convertible equity units that come into the plan. So that was -- that is and was consistent with
what we're seeing going forward.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

But as you move, I guess, beyond 2022, should we expect any material equity or is this going to be
something that's just going to be more sort of $100 million to $150 million, so it would drip these some
type of issuances?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just to start off. [indiscernible] [ 9.5%] earnings growth through 2024, just trying to see, is there any
reason to think that EBITDA growth is that different than that trajectory that you see in the earnings

growth? Just remind us as far as how much of this growth is contractually underpinned with MVC? Just
trying to get a feeling for that.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

David, do you want to take that?

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Sure, can, Jerry. Jeremy, I had a little hard time hearing the beginning of your question. I'm just going
to repeat it. I think you're asking about EBITDA growth versus earning growth and how much of that is
kind of in-hand. So that's the question I'm going to answer, and you can change it if I got it wrong. But
-- so first off, just to reiterate, nothing's changed in the business from what we've previously disclosed.
So business is strong. It's performed incredibly well this year, been incredibly resilient to a difficult year
in this sector and a difficult year with respect to the pandemic. So that gives me lots of confidence of the
durability of the business.

In terms of the growth and would EBITDA growth be moving in tandem with income growth? I think that's
generally a true statement. And again, I think as I answered earlier, we'll be providing a lot more granular
details, sort of best-in-class guidance as we progress and get closer to spin date. So I trust that answered
the question.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. And just wanted to see -- it sounds like contracts really underpinned that growth and
it's over 90% demand contract, it seems like that's pretty unique in the midstream universe. I just want
confirmation that EBITDA was up in line with earnings there, and it sounds like it does. So that's really
helpful this year.

And then just pivoting maybe towards the midstream entity itself, I don't know what you can say looking
forward as far as the strategic outlook there. If there's anything that you can comment on that good
organic growth that's kind of unique in the space right now? I don't know if anyone else is talking about
[ 9% ] growth and that [ 4x ] leverage is surely near the low end of peers out there. So it seems like you
have some really strong flexibility there that maybe you could give details to. So I just want to get a sense
for these things. Are you guys going to stick to your base in what you're doing there? Or is anything going
to be -- anything going to change strategically?

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Yes. That's a great question.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

David?

David J. Slater
President and COO – DTE Gas Storage & Pipelines

Yes. First off, the assets are great assets, and they're positioned across. When you look at the resources
in the country right now, these are the resources that all the analysts expect are going to get attention in
the next year or 2. And the company is positioned from an investor perspective to provide an investment
vehicle for people that want to have exposure to the midstream around the best natural gas basins
in the country and attached to literally the best market centers in the country. So I think you alluded
to it, it's a very unique investment vehicle that we believe is going to be distinctive in the sector. And
we're setting it up to have a very healthy balance sheet with a healthy dividend and a lot of flexibility

going forward to continue what I'll call the strategic intent that we've had, which is continue to make
highly-accretive, value-generating investments on and around that portfolio of assets where we have a
competitive advantage and asymmetrical information.

So I don't think there's no significant strategic shift that's expected here in the near term. But again,
as we approach spin date, I'm looking forward to laying the plan out in more detail and having good
conversations with the investor base going forward. So thanks, Jeremy, for the question.

Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just a couple. Jerry, you -- in the question about REF, you mentioned the outlook off of the, I guess,
adjusted 2020 original base, it includes the replacement that you've been working on. Is that -- are
you just referring to the $15 million a year origination pathway that you've talked about? Or is there
something more significant you may be alluding to there?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

No. It's essentially that $15 million a year that we've been originating in new income. So you're correct.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. So I just want to make sure there wasn't something else that you're hinting at. And then secondly,
there was a comment made about potentially delaying the next rate case and a filing you'd recently made.
And it was a lot of material. I just wonder if you could clarify what you were saying there and maybe put it
in context of your comment about the base case timing, I think, it was early '21.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Great question. So we've had a really strong year in our electric company this year. And some
portion of that has been driven by incremental sales due to COVID and the pandemic as it relates to our
residential markets. So what we're doing, Jonathan, is essentially deferring a portion of those earnings
in 2022 to offset a potential rate increase in 2022. What that does is that it gives us the opportunity to
reconsider timing of filing the rate case. So that's really what that's about.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And just any suggestion of sort of how far you would defer it? Roughly a year, is that a good
assumption?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

It's probably too early to say, Jonathan, but we'll continue to update you as we move forward. We'd like to
see a portion of 2021 start to play out before we make that decision.

Our next question comes from David Fishman from Goldman Sachs.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Just a few questions for me. I know the spin itself is tax-free, but is there any impact on your ongoing
cash tax position post spin? Does this pull forward when you might become a cash taxpayer at the
regulated Remainco in the 5-year plan? Or is there not much of a material impact there either?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave Ruud?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We're going to -- we'll look more into that and see what the impact is there, and we'll have to get
back to you and let you know on that. You're right, we weren't cash taxpayers until 2024. We don't think
this will have much of a material impact, though.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Good to know. And then back on the post REF P&I. I know you pretty much just mentioned that
you're still shooting for, I guess, the $15 million or so a year. But could you guys maybe comment on what
you kind of broadly see as the opportunity set there for RNG and cogeneration? And do you expect P&I
really be growing enough to maintain a 90-10 regulated versus unregulated mix longer term, especially
given the elevated regulated growth rates?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, that's what we see now, David, is P&I being able to grow in the sectors that we described, which is
really to RNG and cogen, and we're still seeing good opportunities there.

We have one that's in late stages right now on the RNG front that we're feeling really good about. And
so we're continuing to see activity and really nice returns there. But it will be a very small part of our
portfolio going forward. But we do see it, that 90-10 mix over the next 5 years.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then, I guess, still on the clean energy, on the voluntary renewables. Initially, you guys have
talked about a 1.4-gigawatt target by 2030. Your updated filings looked like nearly that amount for 2025.
How have your conversations kind of gone for maybe the second half of 2020, if you even went out that
long? Because it seems that, clearly, over the next 5 years, you've had a big pull-forward. Just if you could
maybe give us a little bit more color on kind of how the whole decade is kind of shaping out a little bit
there?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

I have to tell you, this voluntary renewables program that we have has been very exciting. It's a product
that we have a hard time keeping on the shelf. We're selling it quite a bit to our residential customers and
also our large industrial customers and even smaller industrial customers want this product to really green
up their power portfolios, power usage portfolios. So look, as you've said, we've been able to pull forward
our projections as to when we will hit the 1.4 gigawatts. But we'll continue to sell into this market and
continue to update as we go forward, but we're doing much better than we had ever anticipated in that
market.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And I imagine this might -- is this something we'll get a little bit more color on at EEI or still?

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. We'll provide an update at EEI, but what we can tell you now is that we have 750 megawatts
sold, and we're going to build for that. We've got some filings in front of the commission to pursue those
bills. And as we learn more and develop more market, we'll continue to update you.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just last one for me. I know you've briefly touched upon this, but the Energy Trading
business, what would you say is kind of the strategic rationale as keeping the Energy Trading business as
a part of the ongoing kind of DTE entity?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

David, it's a very small part of our company and certainly not a business that we look to grow. And what
we use it for is to really be a market-maker. So for example, with our RNG projects, and even in our
cogen facilities, we use it to manage risk with those investments, either for ourselves or on behalf of our
customers, and that's really the primary purpose of that little business.

The final question we have time for today comes from Ryan Levine from Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So what is DTE's tax basis in the midstream portfolio today? And how long would DTE Midstream need to
remain a public company to avoid triggering a tax event for current DTE shareholders?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

David?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Well, I don't think we've -- we haven't released our tax basis or said that our tax basis is in DTE
Midstream. What was the -- excuse me, what was the second half of that question?

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Would you be willing to disclose that? And then also, how long would DTE Midstream need to remain a
public company to avoid triggering a tactical event for current DTE shareholders?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

I think we'll have to get back to you on that one at EEI, too.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Okay. And then how are you thinking about setting a new DTE dividend -- DTE Midstream dividend policy?
And how are you defining the dividend coverage ratio in the press release of 2x for '21 for this pro forma
company?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave Ruud?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. That's still to be totally nailed down as we establish the Midstream company. But we do plan to
establish one that's competitive with peers, and we talked about that being that 2x dividend coverage
ratio. And that's the distributable cash flow over the dividend is how that will be defined, consistent with
other midstream companies.

This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. And I would like to turn it back to Mr. Jerry Norcia for final
comments.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Thank you. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll close by saying we had a very solid quarter
and are well positioned for a strong finish to 2020 and a really great start to 2021. I believe the spin of
DTE Midstream will unlock significant value for our shareholders and drive future growth. I look forward
to talking to all of you in a few weeks at EEI. I hope everyone has a great morning, and stay healthy and
safe.
