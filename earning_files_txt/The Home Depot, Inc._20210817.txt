Presentation

Operator

Greetings and welcome to The Home Depot Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As
a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.

Isabel Janci
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

[Audio Gap] Quarter 2021 Earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman and CEO;
Ted Decker, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be
limited to analysts and investors. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to get to your question during
the call, please call Investor Relations at (770) 384-2387.

Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations
made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation
of these measures is provided on our website.

Now let me turn the call over to Craig.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning.
We were pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we achieved over $40 billion in quarterly
sales for the first time in our history. Sales for the second quarter were $41.1 billion, up 8.1% from last
year. Comp sales were up 4.5% from last year with U.S. comps of a positive 3.4%. Diluted earnings per
share were $4.53 in the second quarter, up from $4.02 in the second quarter last year.

The strong underlying demand across the business continues. During the second quarter, we did observe
some changing consumer patterns in the U.S. as the U.S. economy opened up. This has manifested itself
in several ways.

We have seen a shift in pattern of sales within the week as our weekday sales performance has actually
strengthened relative to the weekend. We attributed this to consumers returning to travel and other
recreational activities. And while the consumers return to pre-pandemic activities, we continue to see
them engage in home improvement projects. We also see customers more comfortable taking on larger
projects as evidenced by the continued strength with our Pro customer, which outpaced the DIY customer
for the second quarter in a row.

We remained agile and flexible, and we're pleased with our ability to respond to strong home improvement
demand and comp to comp in the second quarter. We had positive comps every week despite
unprecedented compares last year and grew sales by $3.1 billion in the second quarter and more than
$12 billion year-to-date. Over the last 6 quarters, we have grown the business by more than $34 billion, a
level unmatched in our market.

From a geographic perspective, 15 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps versus last year. On
a 2-year stack basis, all 19 regions saw strong double-digit comp growth. However, unlike the past 4
quarters, in the second quarter, we did experience some variability in performance from a geographic
perspective. The variability in our regional performance is driven by our Northern division, where we saw a

more pronounced shift in sales with stronger sales in outdoor seasonal categories during the first quarter.
Mexico posted double-digit positive comps. And despite significant customer restrictions during the quarter
due to COVID-19, Canada posted comps that were essentially flat in local currency.

We continue to effectively manage the strong demand for home improvement products despite significant
industry disruptions in supply chains. We are leveraging the scale of our supply chain and partnership with
our vendors to prioritize key SKUs in high-demand categories. And while our in-stocks are not where we
want them to be, they have improved from where they were a year ago, and our network continues to
flow goods remarkably well, thanks to the investments we have made in our supply chain over a number
of years.

The team continues to make progress on building out our One Home Depot supply chain vision. We remain
largely on track with our plans with the critical mass of buildings scheduled to come online this year and
next. We believe that the network we are building is unique to the market. It will not only enhance the
customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the breadth and depth of our current
opportunity set, drive efficiency end-to-end and leverage our scale to further extend our low-cost position
in home improvement.

In the near term, we remain focused on being flexible and agile as we navigate this dynamic environment.
But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance
interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals: to drive growth faster than the market in
any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider in home improvement with a
relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, and deliver exceptional shareholder value.

Throughout all the events of the past 18 months, our cultures remain our North Star. In fact, I recently
spent time with a number of new associates that we have hired in the past year and was struck by how
engaged and connected these associates were to The Home Depot culture. They were onboarded during
a time when our stores and teams were busier than ever. But our associates took the time to get to know
these new folks and share what it means to be part of the Orange-Blooded family. Our ability to invest for
the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our company history is a direct result of our
associates and their extraordinary efforts.

I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our
customers, communities and each other.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and
supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities.

As you heard from Craig, during the second quarter, we continue to see strong performance in our
business, particularly as we lap the significant growth from the same period last year. We were able to
meet strong customer demand despite ongoing pressures throughout the supply chain. Raw material
shortages, production constraints and pressures across modes of transportation are creating a difficult
supply chain environment. That being said, our performance would not be possible without the cross-
functional efforts by our supply chain, merchandising, store and MET teams as we continue to flow record
volumes of goods week after week.

Over the course of the pandemic, you've heard us talk about a number of initiatives we've implemented,
many in concert with our suppliers to improve our in-stock positions and get product to our customers.
And our teams continue to use our culture and values to guide our decisions.

One of our values is entrepreneurial spirit, which is alive and well at The Home Depot. Our supply chain
teams recently leveraged our scale and flexibility to arrange for several container vessels for exclusive
use, yet another way our teams found a creative solution to better serve our customers in this dynamic
environment.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

While our in-stock levels are still not where we want them to be, we are maintaining the improvements
we made over the last few quarters in building depth in key categories as evidenced by inventory growing
faster than sales compared to the same period last year.

Turning to our comp performance. During the second quarter, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments
posted positive comps, led by kitchen and bath and lumber. During the second quarter of this year, we saw
single-digit negative comps in paint, hardware and indoor and outdoor garden. It is important to note that
these were some of our strongest-performing departments during the second quarter of last year. On a
2-year stack basis, each of our departments posted healthy double-digit comps. Our comp average ticket
increased 11.3% and comp transactions decreased 6%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven
in part by inflation in certain categories, notably lumber. On a 2-year stack basis, both comp average
ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive.

This was another historic quarter for lumber price volatility. During the first few weeks of the second
quarter, prices for both framing and panel lumber reached all-time highs before quickly falling from their
peaks. As an example, during the second quarter, framing lumber peaked at approximately $1,500 per
1,000 board feet before falling over $1,000 to approximately $500. While pricing for both framing and
panel has come down from the peaks, the average price during the second quarter was still significantly
higher than the same period last year.

Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately
420 basis points during the second quarter. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up
approximately 24% compared to the second quarter of last year. We saw big ticket strength across many
Pro-heavy categories like lumber, vinyl plank flooring, gypsum and pipe and fittings.

During the second quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY growth for the second quarter in a row. On a 2-
year stack basis, growth with our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong. We're encouraged by
the momentum we are seeing with our Pros. Growth with our larger Pros continues to outpace that of our
smaller Pros, and they tell us that their backlogs are long and growing. In fact, the National Association
of Home Builders' Remodeling Index hit all-time highs during the second quarter. And during the quarter,
we saw many of our customers turn to Pros to help them with larger renovation projects. This can be seen
in the strength of several of our kitchen and bath categories, like in-stock kitchens, tubs and showers and
vanities, all of which posted 1-year and 2-year comps above the company average.

Sales leveraging our digital platforms were essentially flat during the second quarter as we lap digital sales
growth of approximately 100% in the second quarter of last year. On a 2-year stack basis, sales from our
digital platforms increased approximately 100%.

We're thrilled with the customer engagement across our interconnected platforms. We know the vast
majority of our customers engage with us in an interconnected manner, whether it be through project
inspiration and research, transacting, fulfillment or support, our customers blend the physical and digital
worlds. And while customers have gotten more comfortable buying online, we've never been more
confident in the importance of our physical stores as they remain the center of our customer experience
due to the project nature of our business. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during
the second quarter, more than 55% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to
the power of our interconnected retail strategy.

As we look forward to the back half of the year, we know our Pros are busy and we are working hard
to secure the best products to help our Pros get their jobs done. Last quarter, we highlighted several
exclusive products for our Pro customers. This quarter, we're excited to announce a new big-box home
improvement exclusive relationship with LP Building Solutions, a top provider of OSB panel boards.

In addition, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with our Pro Extra loyalty program.
Several quarters ago, we relaunched Pro Extra, and we've been thrilled with the membership take-up and
engagement we are seeing. Pro Extra offers more frequent touch points with our Pros and convenient
services like purchase tracking and volume pricing along with other benefits. In addition, all Pro Extra
members are now able to access our B2B Pro online experience, offering Pros more personalization on
homedepot.com.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

During the third quarter, we are also thrilled to announce the rollout of what we believe is the most
innovative paint offering in years through our exclusive relationship with Behr. BEHR DYNASTY is a brand-
new 4-in-1 interior paint that offers DIY-ers, Pro painters and design professionals a unique product
exclusively from The Home Depot. It is our most stain-repellent, scuff-resistant, fast-growing 1-coat
coverage paint, all in one can.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $41.1 billion, an
increase of $3.1 billion or 8.1% from last year. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted total sales
growth by approximately $385 million.

During the second quarter, our total company comps were positive 4.5%, with positive comps in all 3
months. During the quarter, we saw total company comps of 4.7% in May, 3.9% in June and 4.9% in July.
Comps in the U.S. were positive 3.4% for the quarter with comps of 3.1% in May, 2.7% in June and 4.3%
in July.

In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.2%, a decrease of approximately 80 basis points from the
same period last year. While there are many factors that impact gross margin, the year-over-year change
during the second quarter was primarily driven by lumber, which accounted for approximately 60 basis
points of pressure. In addition, several other factors negatively impacted our gross margin, including rising
transportation costs, One Supply Chain investments and lapping a benefit from canceled events in the
second quarter of last year.

During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 100 basis
points to 17.1%. Our operating leverage during the second quarter reflects significant COVID-related
expenses that we incurred in the second quarter of 2020 to support our associates. These expenses were
partially offset by underspend in other expense items in the second quarter of last year, most notably
payroll, as we staffed up to meet strong demand. Our operating expenses during the second quarter of
this year also include wage investments that we made at the end of 2020.

Our operating margin for the second quarter was 16.1%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points
from the second quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the second quarter decreased by $16
million to $321 million. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, down from 24.4% in
the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.53, an
increase of 12.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020.

At the end of the quarter, inventories were $18.9 billion, up $5.4 billion from last year, and inventory turns
were 5.7x compared with 6.1x this time last year.

Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business, it is our intent to return excess cash to
shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested
approximately $520 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during
the quarter, we paid approximately $1.75 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned
approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of
beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was
approximately 44.7%, up from 41.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.

As you heard from Craig, we are very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the second
quarter, particularly as we lap the unprecedented growth we saw this time last year. And while these
challenging compares continue through the back half of the year, we are encouraged by what we are
seeing. During the first 2 weeks of August, we've seen comps in the U.S. consistent with the second
quarter. Customer engagement and demand for home improvement is healthy. Housing remains strong,
and we see a supportive environment for home improvement spending as we look out over the next
several years.

That said, there is still a significant amount of uncertainty in the broader environment as it relates to the
evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new and spreading variants. As we've previously shared,
we do not believe we can accurately predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will
ultimately impact consumer spending. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has
driven our successful performance. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning
formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.

We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our
position as the low-cost provider, and we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home
improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will continue to grow faster than our market and we
will deliver exceptional value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we will now open the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Craig and Richard, I wanted to ask -- maybe I'll ask this every quarter for now. I wanted to ask
about home improvement demand, whether it has to digest the next couple of years or we can keep
compounding. And I think Richard just mentioned in his comments, like expecting several years of healthy
demand ahead. So curious if your thoughts have evolved on the next couple of years given the massive
growth we've had over the past 2.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Simeon, when we look at the overall backdrop for support in home improvement from a housing
perspective, from the Remodeling Index, we feel pretty good about the long-term outlook for home
improvement. Hard to predict the short term, but the longer-term outlook looks solid.

Richard, I don't know if you want to add to that.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

If you just -- if you look at the -- we believe that home price appreciation is a fundamental support of
home improvement activity and demand. As your home becomes more valuable, you are more likely to
spend more on it. We are at a point now where the housing stock of the United States is over 20% more
valuable than it was 2 years ago.

And so as we look forward, not only have we seen that home price appreciation, but the homeowner
balance sheet is incredibly healthy. The state of mortgage finance is incredibly healthy. And so that's why
-- some of the reasons why we're optimistic.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's helpful. And then one near-term question. The second half outlook for gross margin, does the
dynamic that occurred in the second quarter, does it ease allowing the gross margin to improve in the
back half -- or not improve, but at least the rate of change improved from what happened in the second
quarter?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

I'd say we're focused on executing week-to-week here. There are certainly cost pressures in the
environment, and I think we're all dealing with that. But we've dealt with that throughout our history, and
we're comfortable with our ability to manage through the cost environment effectively.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Simeon, I think there are some very unique scenarios, obviously, in the quarter. Lumber being the one, as
Richard called out, unprecedented level of drop and unprecedented speed with which it drops. Normally,
the only impact you have is from mix. But with the rapid decline and the extent of the decline, we always
have a philosophy that we want to lead the market down and lag going up to remain as competitive as

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

possible for our customers. And that actually created an impact which in this quarter was unique that we
normally don't see.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

And I'd make another comment, which is the shape of the business given the volume that is coming
through our system is not predictable. But we know, we're confident that we are taking share, and we're
there to meet the demand that we see from our customer. That mix may have an impact, but when we
look at the operating profit dollar growth we're generating as a company, we feel great about it. So we're
looking more at driving market share capture and driving that operating profit dollar growth.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

How should the trends that you outlined with diverging performance on the weekdays versus the
weekends inform how we think about the DIY business moving forward? Do you attribute that to more
of a temporary condition, where consumers had pent-up demand to go on vacation this summer and
they return to the projects in the fall? Or alternatively, as families return to traditional activities like your
sports, watching college and pro sports, and gradually returning to the office, it's going to put accelerating
pressure on the DIY business. And do you think there's enough strength in pent-up demand for the Pro
segment that it can offset that?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Michael, it's a great question. It's something we're watching carefully as the consumer gets back to more
normal environment. What we did see is -- the consumers in our research would suggest this as well --
consumers are taking on more projects. They are larger projects and have a tendency to hire a pro to do
them. And as a result, we've seen our Pro business strengthen for several quarters in a row, with the last
2 quarters where the Pro outperformed the DIY customers for the first time since the pandemic started.

And so we're very optimistic about where the Pro business goes and the strength of that Pro business,
and we're focused on making sure that we can take care of those Pros along with our DIY customers but
feel like there's solid opportunity to continue to grow. Pros tell us their backlogs are bigger than ever.
Consumers continue to tell us the home is more important than ever and that they have a longer list of
projects.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

That's all helpful, Craig. And you're going to have this funky dynamic where maybe the Pro business is
good, maybe the DIY business decelerates from here. And how is that going to impact your labor model,
which is activity-based? So if comps do turn negative in the back half, how quickly can you flex that? And
how well is it fine-tuned for this dynamic, where you might have a decline in DIY transactions, you may
actually not need as much labor, so you can save some SG&A dollars on that.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Michael, you hit it on the head in terms of our labor model is an activity-based model, which has a
component in there of transaction. So we can adjust relatively quickly. It's a short-cycle model, and we'll
make the appropriate adjustments as we go. It's -- we plan out a few weeks in advance.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.

10

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

I was just wondering if you guys could elaborate a little bit more on some of the benefits you expect to
see once the one HD Supply chain gets built out sometime in 2022.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Sure. The whole purpose of the supply chain is really our ability to deliver all of our products, parcel and
big and bulky, to 90% of the U.S. population, same and next day. And we're 3-plus years into this build-
out. We have multiple facilities up of each type that we're building. They're all performing well and fulfilling
that expectation of being able to deliver and satisfy the customer. Speed and reliability is what's required,
particularly with our Pro customers.

In addition, it's allowing us to expand our assortments from what we carry in our stores. So not only can
we get the product in a quicker, more reliable fashion to our customers, we can get a broader assortment
to our customers.

And lastly, we're up to $660 a square foot of sales this past quarter in our stores. And it's just a
tremendous amount of activity in cube in that building. So to be able to get deliveries, particularly the big
and bulky deliveries out of the store, that helps our customer flow and our associate activities in the store.
And we're just thrilled with that in particular as our FDCs have opened up, we're relieving tremendous
amount of delivery activity in cube flow out of our stores and delivering directly out of the new facilities,
exactly the way the supply chain team had planned it.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

That's great. And then just on lumber. I'm curious what you're seeing from a unit volume perspective as
prices dropped throughout the quarter.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Well, clearly, when we hit $1,500 plus, 1,000 board feet, people backed out of the market, for sure, and
waited. And it wasn't that we got a tremendous amount of new supply in the marketplace. I think once
you hit that tipping point where people backed off on the margin and prices started to fall -- and as Craig
said, it was falling so quickly, $100, $150 even $200 1,000 board feet per week -- people just stepped
back even further. That's now settled at about $430 for framing lumber.

And for sure, at those high levels, we saw an impact to units. Our units had turned negative. And as prices
have come down, units are still negative, but on a sequential basis, improving in responding to that lower
price. So we're very pleased. Supply and demand dynamics worked as expected.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wondering with respect to inventory, obviously, you're up against your comparisons from last year.
But looking at overall areas of inventory, is there any area where you think you're still lacking product?
And then how to think about inventory growth in the second half of the year?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

Yes. First of all, Karen, I'd say we're super pleased that we've been able to continue to build depth but
yet, at the same time, have incredible inventory productivity at 5.7 turns. So we're very, very pleased with
that.

There's still -- we're in a situation still where we're not exactly where we want to be from an in-stock
perspective. Our suppliers are working hard, but our merchants have worked with our suppliers to kind
of narrow the focus on key SKUs. And so there's opportunities still to continue to bring more product in
across the breadth of the assortment. But right now, we're trying to stay focused on the things that really,
really matter.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

And I'd say it's been a category by category story. And as Craig said, we're trying to build depth in our
highest-velocity SKUs. We're trying to build depth in job lot quantities for our Pro customers, and that
tends to be heavy on the building materials side of the business, so lumber and building materials and
electrical and plumbing fixtures. And we've recovered nicely in all of those departments. But again, it can
be category by category.

There's a COVID outbreak in a factory. There's a shipping constraint. There's a domestic transportation
capacity constraint. So it's been a story of 2 steps forward, 1 step back. But we are making progress,
and that's why we're happy to lean into inventory. We're blessed with the financial strength and liquidity.
Our goods tend to be nonperishable, not a lot of obsolescence, particularly in our core product. So if --
a lot of this is who has the product, who's going to sell the product. And I think our supply chain and
merchants responding as well as they have is one of the reasons we've taken so much market share in
this environment.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And I just was wondering, on the Pro Extra loyalty, I was wondering if you'd be
willing to give a little update on the number of members in the program. And then any color, if you can
provide, on average spend of members versus the nonmember Pro or just any metrics that you could
provide?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Yes. I won't get into details, but you know our rough dynamic, about 4%, 5% of our customer base being
the Pro makes up 45% of our sales. So this is a number in the mid-millions of our core Pros. Very strong
number of those, percentage of those, are in the Pro Extra program.

And now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are building a B2B website, and all of our Pro
Extra members now have been transferred over to that B2B experience. So with the combination of the
benefits that you're getting with Pro Extra -- we've stood up a separate Pro Extra app that those Pros
are using -- and the ability to engage on the B2B website, which has all sorts of functionality built out
specifically for the Pro, so think of bills of material for jobs, tracking jobs, quotes, building quotes, reorder
capability, tracking all receipts, preferred pricing in certain instances, all of that is coming together as well
as personalization and building relevance on that Pro B2B website.

So think of something like search results, if you or I would put in pliers, we have thousand suppliers
that could be returned in that search result. We're getting to the point now that we know an electrician
is performing that search. So we're going to provide relevance and we're going to provide our electrical
pliers as the first results in that search query. So this is just another great add to our Pro ecosystem and
just been tremendous engagement with the Pro loyalty app, the Pro Extra program and now the B2B
website.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions with regard to sales and pretty quick ones. But first off, just with respect to lumber,
I know you talked about it in your prepared comments and in response to the questions. But did you say
just to what extent lumber was a benefit to comps this quarter?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

About $1.3 billion.

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And that was weighted more towards the first -- the way you've laid it out, I'd assume that was
weighted much more towards the first half of the quarter -- or early in the quarter, I guess you'd better
say that better?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Brian, for sure. It was an unbelievable fast fall. But yes, it was -- that was heavily geared towards the
first part of the quarter.

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then the second question I have, and I know this is awful nuance. But as you talk about the
strength in the Pro business, in your conversations, your connections with your Pro customers, do you
think that the jobs are being taken on now? Were those jobs that were started during the pandemic and
are only now being able to be fulfilled because the Pros have -- Pros are available to work? Or these
projects are actually seriously starting right now?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

I think you probably have a combination would be my best guess. Don't know that for sure. But we know,
for example, when we talk to Pros that they've had a backlog for some time. And so I think, clearly,
there's probably some that have been in the works where they've been waiting to -- customers have been
waiting for Pro to start a job. And then I think there's probably scenarios where it's a quicker cycle. But we
don't really have a way of knowing that.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

The National Association of Home Builders index has a lot of interesting survey data within it. One of the
survey components is consumer optimism and intent around projects. And we have actually seen intent
tick up for small projects, medium-sized projects and large projects really surge sequentially through the
year.

So I think if you kind of take the question off of the backlog and you say, what's the intent, it does
seem like that homeowners are leaning into projects. And whether it's a Pro or consumer customer, it all
eventually is the same customer demand. So it looks like the trend is strengthening in project demand.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

And I think if you look at our services business as a proxy, we're certainly seeing that as well. As our
service business, think of -- these are large projects, carpet installation, cabinet installation, refacing,
bath, HVAC, those all are strong and accelerating.

Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So you're lapping a period of very low promotional activity, as you know. And given the 3 major holiday
events in Q2 with Memorial Day, Father's Day, July 4th, could you talk about to what extent these events
were a material top line driver in the quarter? And then with respect to gross margin, to what extent did
this have an impact in Q2? And how should we think about the promotional impact as that mixes into the
gross margin line in the second half?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

I would say our promotions were up from last year, but only because we canceled so many last year. We
were on the margin less promotional, say, than going back to '19. So while we're very happy with our
events and our sell-through, we had record sell-through in virtually all of our programs, the events were
not a huge driver of our comp, and it wasn't -- the things Richard called out on our margin impact, it
wasn't particularly meaningful.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

It wasn't meaningful.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then, Richard, could you talk about how your Pro versus DIY trends performed
through the quarter and if there was any variability in trend from one versus the other? And then for Q3,
does the commentary that trends are in line during the first 2 weeks of August, does that also hold for
both Pro versus DIY?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, so we're not going to break out intra-quarter. It was the second quarter where we saw our Pro
customer grow faster than our DIY customer. I'd say, in the first 2 weeks of the quarter, not much has
changed with respect to the direction of our business.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki
BofA Securities, Research Division

Could you just give an update on the MRO market and the trends you're seeing there? I mean you
mentioned that your big Pros were outpacing small Pros. So was MRO growth even above that of those big
Pros given relatively easier comparisons against last year?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Liz, we're very pleased actually with our MRO business and the acquisition of HD Supply. The business
there is very, very solid.

What we're excited about, candidly, with that business is the opportunity to much better serve 50 million
households in the multifamily space. Not only can we serve them with MRO products, but obviously, as we
have relationships and build that through our MRO business, the opportunity to then participate in capital

refreshes for those property owners, on those 50 million households that are in the multifamily is a huge
opportunity for Home Depot going forward. So we're super pleased with the business and the progress
that we're making there.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And I'm just tacking on to Zach's question a little bit. I mean it may be early to be thinking about
this, but how are you approaching the holiday season this year from a procurement standpoint and a
promotional standpoint? Should we expect it to look more like last year, where marketing started early and
extended longer, but the promotions were a bit shallower than a normal year? Or do you think it will go
back to kind of the shorter and deeper promotional cadence like pre-pandemic season?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Well, Liz, as you can imagine, the -- with the international supply chain involved in those type of events,
the merchants and supply chain teams made the bulk of those buy decisions some time ago. So it's a fixed
buy. We're not expecting huge growth in those programs. But to your point, it's deeper buys, stronger
values, fewer items, and we think we have great programs.

In terms of marketing early, I think we're going to follow all our normal trends. We had a sneak peek
with opening up Halloween online and just sold out our sort of pre-released Halloween product almost
immediately. So that's a very strong indication that people are still going to engage in decorating, and we
look forward to setting our decorative holiday later in October.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's been a long time since the weather was a potential question. But during the second quarter, do
you think it was in that headwind? The major DIY holidays had record rain in some of the northern
geographies, and so was it beyond just the bathtub effect of 1Q versus 2Q?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

I wouldn't say it was beyond it, but we certainly saw it. So we think that it may have accounted for low
single-digit comp impact, call it 100 to 200 basis points of comp pull-forward from Q1 -- sorry, from Q2
into Q1, particularly in the Northern division. So as Craig called out, while we did see a difference in
divisional performance, that really was the primary driver in our view.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then on the lumber side, as prices stand now, would lumber be a modest headwind comp for
the balance of the year? And is that reflected in the quarter-to-date commentary?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

So yes, lumber, just the market pricing of lumber, Chris, right now, framing is approaching 40% under
LY, and panel is 10% under LY. So with neutral units, there would be a negative comp impact. As I said,
unit progression is going in the right direction with these lower prices, and that all speaks to the project
nature. But from a price perspective, not expecting any tailwind in lumber.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

Got it. And then the last question, Richard, as you think about how transportation costs, I assume some
of that gets hung up in inventory. So do you think the transportation cost pressure actually gets worse as
you look in the back half? So as much as the rate pressure from lumber doesn't repeat itself, you could
have higher transportation cost pressures on gross margin.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

The back half is a long period of time. I'm not going to speculate on what transportation costs might look
like. I'll just tell you that I would bet on our team every single day to be able to manage through that
dynamic. Our supply chain team is exceptional and creative and I think that they have reinforced our
position as a low-cost provider in the market. So regardless of where the market goes, I think we'll be in
an advantaged position.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'm sorry, one last quick one. In July, how would you characterize sort of the competitive promotional
environment? There are some questions out there that maybe some of your competitors got more
promotional, although it was for you just more of a comparison to a low level last year.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Didn't see anything majorly different.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Didn't notice that much, Chris.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.

Katharine Amanda McShane
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just a couple of housekeeping type questions. I wondered if you could address at all the trend of trading
up by the customer, if that was something you continue to see during the quarter. And any commentary
you can give specifically around appliances and what you saw in Q2?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

I would say, yes, we continue to see the trading up. It's not as clear as I used to report on it just because
of the inventory situation, and we're seeing lots of substitution of goods, depending on what's in stock on
the shelf that particular day.

But if you look at power tools, for example, outdoor power equipment, the appliance category, grill
category, riding lawnmower and zero-turn category, just as a few examples, Kate, people are trading up
to innovation in all those categories. So just more powerful, longer run time on batteries, that's moving
over to outdoor power equipment. The design aesthetic and the features of modern appliances, people are
happily trading up to quite strong price points in appliances. LED lighting that's going through, not just
light bulbs but integrated in ceiling fans and fixtures, that trade-up is innovation- and newness-driven, and
we are seeing that as strong as ever.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I have a follow-up on comps and then SG&A. I guess I'd start with SG&A. So you had 100 bps of leverage
in the first half, and you guys have talked about getting back to leveraging the way that Home Depot did
in the past. Should we expect the second half to have similar-type leverage? Or is there something unique
about what happened last year that means it would be less?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Greg, 2020 was such a unique year, and comparisons from 2021 to 2020 are difficult for a number
of factors. You think about the amount of COVID expense that we put in place in support of our associates
last year, you think about expense underspend as we worked to bring staffing up to levels to meet
demand, and then you think about the wage investment that we made towards the end of 2020, all these
make comparisons difficult.

We are committed to generating operating expense leverage over the long term. We feel great about the
operating expense leverage that we've delivered in Q2 and in the first half. You're always going to see
fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. Leverage is a function of top line sales, it can be a function of seasonality
and other factors. So in any given quarter, you may see volatility. But over a period of quarters, you're
going to see from us operating expense leverage. And again, we're very happy with how the quarter and
the half played out.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And my follow-up, maybe linked to that, is on comps. So if the trend -- I just want to make sure I
got it right. If the trend is similar to the second quarter, but there's no inflation in lumber, is it fair to say
that, that 2-year comp is stable in the mid-20s without inflation? Am I interpreting that correct?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

Well, 2-year comp is sort of similar in its consistency to 1-year comp in the first couple of weeks of the
month.

Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research.

David Leonard Bellinger
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to ask in regard to supply chain. So you alluded in the prepared comments working through
a difficult environment. So are you seeing incremental pressures now versus just a few months ago? Is
there some level of sales that you missed out on in the Q2 period?

And maybe a bigger-picture question. Through all the recent supply chain issues across the industry, is
there anything now that you're reevaluating or making some type of change within the One Home Depot
build-out?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'd say the first comment that I'd have is as it relates to the potential sales impact really, really hard
to tell. And the reason it's so hard to get a gauge on that is the fact that there is a high level of willingness
of substitution on the customer's part since this pandemic began, much more so than prepandemic.

Is there some level of impact? The logic tells you there probably was, but it's really hard to gauge. And we
think we captured most as a result of substitution.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

No. Not at all. No. We're -- that build-out -- I'm sorry, that build-out is focused on where the customer has
taken us and how they want to engage with The Home Depot. So it has no impact at all.

David Leonard Bellinger
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. And just my follow-up here. You mentioned a new exclusive relationship with LP Building Solutions.
Can you expand upon that any further? Does that reflect some type of shift in the business, where maybe
you lean more into Pros tied to more new home construction as the next level of Pro sales growth and just
give the company more exposure on the new home construction side. Can you just expand upon that any
further?

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

No. I mean the intent was not to be any different position in regards to new home construction. It's not
a market we play in or consciously go after. LP is similar to what we did last quarter with Carlon electrical
boxes. There's -- as Carlon is the largest provider, particularly for the Pro in PVC electrical boxes, LP is
one of the top couple OSB providers, very strong brand. And this is a matter of The Home Depot making
arrangements with top suppliers so that they can focus their supply chain into serving us, and we can
focus on having that depth of inventory in these critical Pro categories on our shelves. So the likes of
exclusives with Carlon and LP is all about taking care of our Pro customer.

Our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital.

Laura Allyson Champine
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

I just wanted to get some context around the commentary that you should be able to lap the difficult
comparisons given the strong macro drivers and home prices and comparing that to the outcome in Q2
of transactions that were down. Is the thought there that the transactions were down largely because of
lumber inflation and other sort of onetime issues and that transaction should tick back up as we move
through the rest of this year and next?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Laura, first comment would be we didn't really provide any outlook going forward. We don't believe we
can take past performance and project that forward due to the uncertainty in the environment that exists
today.

As it relates to the transactions, I mean, huge transactions last year as a result of PPE. Ted, I don't know if
you want to comment.

Edward P. Decker
President & COO

Yes. I mean that was one of our single biggest drivers of the falloff is people coming in for masks and hand
sanitizers. The 4 departments that we did see negative sales, hardware, outdoor and indoor garden and
paint, those are -- can tend to be more consumer-oriented, lots of units in mulch, in soil and things and

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

paint is -- that DIY-er was home, not doing other activities on the weekend. So we're not alarmed by that
falloff at all. We'll get through that.

I'd say that -- take a category like paint. I mean paint had been a 1- or 2-unit grower for several years up
until the pandemic. And painting is one of the initial home improvement projects that a customer engages
in and starts to build confidence in home improvement. And while we saw a dip in Q2, the levels in unit
volume that we're seeing in paint is well above 2019. And I've talked about the millennials before, and
the millennials are engaged in housing. They're engaging in home improvement. They've done that first
project, which is painting and some gardening work generally. So we're just thrilled that they're engaged
in the category and moving on to bigger projects.

Laura Allyson Champine
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then as a follow-on, do we have a better sense now on where digital should be in terms of a
longer-term sustainable growth rate and/or as a percentage of sales, hopefully, things are settling out
there?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

I mean we really look at this as an interconnected experience. Our customers are clearly blending the
physical and digital worlds together. Because of the project nature of our business, certainly, from pre-
pandemic levels, we've seen an accelerated rate of engagement in terms of sales through our digital
channels. But that's not how we focus on it or look at it. We view it as a capability for our customer to
engage with The Home Depot.

Operator

Our final question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

Two things. First of all, perhaps for Richard, some clarity on lumber. You talked about leading on the way
down with price to do what's best for the customer. Does that necessitate more gross margin pressure
from lumber in 3Q? Or am I thinking about that wrong?

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

By and large, the pressure from lumber, at least what the prices we've seen in the market, have been
recognized to date, so no. And now it depends on future lumber price, right? But at the moment, the
precipitous decline had its impact in Q2 for the most part.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Eric, the key for that -- normally, you don't see any pressure from gross margin as a result of lumber.
It's all because of mix. The reason that we saw it this time was the steep decline that happened in price in
a very compressed time frame.

And again, we weren't going to change our approach to the market. We want to be incredibly focused on
driving the best value for our customers. So we always try to lag the market when it's going up and lead it
when it's coming down.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

Perfect. That makes sense. And then secondly, the sales growth over the last couple of years now is
exceptional, as you pointed out. You've obviously invested to take care of your associates and take

19

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 17, 2021

care of your customers. The margin leverage has been less than what we would have expected with
nearly a $50 billion, 50% increase in sales in the last 3 years. Is there some embedded operating margin
improvement that can get released over the next couple of years if things return to normal? Or is the cost
of doing business and other investments you've made taken some of that away? Trying to figure out if the
operating margin of the enterprise can lift incrementally in the next couple of years or if more of the focus
is on sales growth and a little bit less on releasing operating margin.

Richard V. McPhail
Executive VP & CFO

I think so -- I think that we have to go back to the central focus that we have from a financial
performance perspective, which is growing operating profit dollars as fast as possible and generating an
exceptional return on investment on those dollars. And so we feel very pleased with the market share that
we've captured over the last 3 to 4 years. And we feel exceptionally pleased with the shareholder value
that we've created as well. We think that the formula of having the best experience in home improvement
retail, being the lowest-cost provider and being the best investor of capital in the market is a formula that
can't be beat, and that's what we're going to continue to do.
