Thanks, Brian; and good morning, everybody
Let's start on slide 4. So as Brian just said, we delivered very strong second quarter results
On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 9.8%, adjusted EBITDA grew 10%, earnings per share increased 26.8% to $0.52 a share, and we generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter
Now, let's go deeper into the businesses, starting with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable Communications revenues increased 5.5% to $13.1 billion, driven by growth in residential high-speed Internet and Video as well as Business Services
In our Residential business, we added 77,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter, a 6.4% increase over last year, with both Video and high-speed data churn remaining at the lowest levels in over 10 years
We are pleased with these results and our ability to weather the more competitive environment this quarter
There have been several new entrants in the over-the-top video space, prompting existing competitors to respond with aggressive price points that have cut across multiple products
We continue to believe in our ability to compete effectively
First, we have innovative products, including best-in-class broadband and a great video experience with X1. Second, we successfully bundle our services together, with 70% of our residential customer base taking at least two products
In addition, we focus on market segmentation, packaging our products to be competitive to multiple customer segments, and, importantly, we are making continuous improvements to our customer service
High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall cable revenue growth
Revenue increased 9.2% to $3.7 billion in the quarter, driven by an increase in our residential customer base and rate adjustments
We added 140,000 residential high-speed Internet customers in the quarter and we remain focused on adding value and further enhancing our competitive differentiation through improvement to capacity, coverage and capabilities
We consistently increase our speeds and nearly 55% of our residential customers take speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher
We're offering gigabit speeds with our deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 and plan to have this technology available to the majority of our homes passed by year-end
And in addition, we recently launched xFi, a new home WiFi platform that gives customers the fastest speeds, the best WiFi coverage and ultimate control in their homes, making WiFi an even better experience
As Brian mentioned, we have a long runway for growth in adding broadband customers
Video revenue increased 3.9% to $5.8 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services
We had 45,000 residential video customer net losses in the quarter, reflecting both typical second quarter seasonality as well as the competitive dynamics I mentioned earlier
We continue to drive X1 deeper into our base, ending the quarter with 55% of residential video customers having X1, compared to about 40% a year ago
Business Services delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth as revenue increased 12.6% to $1.5 billion during the quarter, primarily driven by customer growth
We added 37,000 business customer relationships, and in terms of individual products, we added 11,000 video customers, 35,000 high-speed Internet customers, and 27,000 voice customers in the quarter
In addition, we increased revenue for business customer relationship by 4%, which reflects good momentum in our Ethernet and advanced voice services
Turning to slide 6, second quarter Cable Communications EBITDA increased 5.4% to $5.3 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.5%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Programming expenses increased 12% during the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, reflecting the timing of contract renewals
Non-programming expenses increased 1.4% this quarter as we benefit from the investments we have made in customer experience initiatives, as well as overall disciplined cost management
Notably, customer service expenses declined 1.1% this quarter even as we grew customer relationships by 3.2%
Despite the higher rate of programming expense growth, our year-to-date EBITDA margin of 40.4% has improved by 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2016. The improvement was driven by growth in higher-margin services such as high-speed Internet and Business Services, as well as the lower rate of growth in non-programming expenses
As we look forward, we now expect the full year 2017 EBITDA margin to be flat compared to 2016, which was 40.2%
The improvement relative to our original guidance from earlier this year is equally split between programming and non-programming expenses
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results
On slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal's revenues increased 17% and EBITDA increased 23% in the quarter
These strong results were driven by a successful box office, healthy growth in re-trans and affiliate fees, as well as continued strong growth at Theme Parks
Cable Networks delivered another quarter of strong growth with revenue increasing 5.1% and EBITDA up 11.7% to $1.1 billion
While advertising revenue was down 1% this quarter, distribution revenue increased 8.1%, driving double-digit EBITDA growth
Recall we have successfully renewed a number of our distribution agreements and this should continue to contribute to healthy EBITDA growth for the remainder of the year
Broadcast Television also delivered a solid quarter, with revenue increasing 5.3% and EBITDA growth of 5.5% to $416 million
This growth was primarily driven by higher retransmission consent fees, which increased nearly 65% to $363 million
Partially offsetting this growth was a modest 1% decline in advertising revenue, which reflected ratings pressure during the quarter as well as higher programming expenses and increased marketing investments
Film had a phenomenal quarter with revenue increasing 60% and EBITDA growing by $229 million to $285 million
Theatrical revenue increased by $540 million to $837 million, driven by the strong box office performance of Fate of the Furious, which more than offset the underperformance of The Mummy
Home Entertainment revenue increased 43% due to the continued success of earlier titles including Fifty Shades Darker and Sing
Last, content licensing revenue grew 14%, reflecting the inclusion of DreamWorks
Theme Parks continued its momentum with revenue growth of 15.6% and EBITDA up a very healthy 17.3% to $551 million in the second quarter
These results reflect higher attendance in per capita spending as well as a favorable comparison from the timing of spring break vacations
As a reminder, spring break and the Easter holiday occurred in the second quarter this year, but occurred during the first quarter last year, creating a favorable comparison this quarter
However even if we adjust for this timing, EBITDA would have still grown double-digits this quarter as we continue to benefit from Harry Potter in Hollywood as well as our launches of new attractions Brian mentioned Volcano Bay in Orlando and Minion Park in Japan
Now let's move to slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures
Consolidated CapEx increased 2.5% to $2.3 billion in the second quarter
At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 4% to $2 billion for the quarter, resulting in capital intensity of 14.9%
For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2016 at approximately 15% of total Cable Communications revenue
For the quarter, the increase in spending reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and increased investment in line extensions partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment
At NBCUniversal, second quarter capital expenditures decreased 6.1% to $338 million, reflecting our continued investment in Theme Parks more than offset by the timing of spending on real estate and at our headquarters
For the full year, we continue to expect NBCUniversal's capital expenditures to increase approximately 10% versus 2016. And now finishing up on slide 9, as I mentioned earlier, we generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $5.3 billion on a year-to-date basis
Our return of capital to shareholders in the second quarter included dividend payments totaling $747 million, up 11.6%, and share repurchases of $1.4 billion
We continue to expect to repurchase a total of $5 billion of our common shares this year
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter at 2.2 times net leverage
During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 49% stake in Universal Studios Japan for $2.3 billion
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we received proceeds of $482 million in connection with our previously announced relinquishments of FCC licenses for spectrum in the New York, Philadelphia and Chicago designated market areas
So that concludes our summary of the quarter
We're clearly very pleased with our continued strong performance as well as our momentum
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A
Hey, Phil, it's Mike
I'll start and Dave can finish
So for 2017, as we started the year, we expected programming to be up 13%
Programming costs, we came in in the first half of the year at around 12% and I wouldn't expect it to be much different in the second half
In terms of non-programming costs, you saw the great results in the first half of the year and we think those trends are steady
So we're just revising today the guidance for the full year this year and we expect to be flat to 2016. And as you know, we don't go into a multi-year guidance
But I think what Dave and I have both said previously is that we're going to continue to drive growth in our high margin businesses, high-speed data and business services, which were obviously margin positive
We do expect programming costs as we've said to come down into the high single-digits in years after 2017. And then, finally, on the non-programming costs side, a lot of the efforts that Dave and Neil have been putting in over multiple years into customer service, in particular, are paying dividends in terms of reduced truck rolls, lower calls, on top of higher satisfaction
And that's been a tailwind to non-programming expenses
And Dave can comment further, but we're going to continue to execute against those kind of trends
But, again, we don't go beyond the year we're in in terms of guidance
So I'll leave it there
Thanks, Bryan
It's Mike
So there's just some one-time choppiness in that number
We can deal with that – give you more color offline, if you like, but nothing that would affect the go-forward trends that you've seen before this quarter
Hey, Kannan
So I'll start again on this one
So scalable infrastructure – think about it as adding capacity and speed to our network generally in things like Cloud DVRs and the like
As we see greater usage to our network, we're investing to keep the experience ahead of our customer expectations
And so that's what you would see in that CapEx line
And then we've said repeatedly we want to continue to invest in that broadband network for the future we see for the business
In terms of line extensions, that's connecting more addresses to our networks
And so that's largely led by business services
And pushing the business services is obviously high-growth business
Some of the hyper-builds we talk about – the growth in line extensions is driven by that
