CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to CenterPoint Energy's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference call with
senior management. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to David Mordy, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Mordy?

David Mordy
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Joelle. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
John Somerhalder, Interim President and CEO; and Kristie Colvin, Interim Executive Vice President and
CFO, will discuss our first quarter 2020 results and provide highlights on other key areas. Also with us this
morning are several other members of management who will be available during the Q&A portion of our
call.

In conjunction with our call, we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investors section on
our website, centerpointenergy.com. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC
filings, news releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website.

Today, management will discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking
information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available
to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results
could differ materially based upon factors, including weather, regulatory actions, the economy and
unemployment, commodity prices, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and other risk factors noted in our
SEC filings.

We will also discuss guidance for 2020. To provide greater transparency on utility earnings, 2020 guidance
will be presented in 2 components: a guidance basis utility EPS range and a midstream investments EPS
expected range. Please refer to Slide 26 in the Appendix for further detail.

Utility EPS guidance range includes net income from Houston Electric, Indiana Electric and natural gas
distribution business segments as well as after-tax operating income from the corporate and other
business segment. The 2020 utility EPS guidance range considers operations performance to date
and assumptions for certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as customer growth,
approximately 2% for electric operations and 1% for natural gas distribution, and usage, including normal
weather, throughput, recovery of capital invested through rate cases and other rate filings, effective tax
rates, financing activities and related interest rates, regulatory and judicial proceedings, anticipated cost
savings as a result of the merger and reflects dilution in earnings as if the newly issued preferred stock
were issued as common stock.

In addition, guidance incorporates the COVID-19 scenario range of $0.05 to $0.08, which assumes
reduced demand levels with April as the peak and reflects the anticipated deferral and recovery of
incremental expenses, including bad debt. The COVID-19 scenario also assumes a gradual reopening
of the economy in our service territories, leading to diminishing levels of -- demand reduction, which
would continue through August. To the extent actual recovery deviates from these COVID-19 scenario
assumptions, the 2020 utility EPS guidance range may not be met, and our projected full year guidance
range may change.

The utility EPS guidance range also assumes an allocation of corporate overhead, based upon its
relative earnings contribution. Corporate overhead consists of interest expense, preferred stock dividend
requirements income on enable preferred units and other items directly attributable to the parent, along
with associated income taxes.

Utility EPS guidance excludes midstream investments EPS range, results related to Infrastructure Services
and Energy Services and anticipated costs and impairment resulting from the sale of these businesses,

certain integration and transaction-related fees and expenses associated with the merger, severance costs,
earnings or losses from the change in the value of ZENS and related securities and changes in accounting
standards.

In providing this guidance, CenterPoint Energy uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per
share that does not consider the items noted above and other potential impacts, including unusual items,
which could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the applicable guidance period.

In providing the 2020 EPS expected range for midstream investments, the company assumes a 53.7%
limited partner ownership interest in Enable and includes the amortization of our basis differential in
Enable and assumes an allocation of CenterPoint Energy corporate overhead based upon midstream
investments' relative earnings contribution. The midstream investments' EPS expected range reflects
dilution and earnings as if the CenterPoint Energy newly issued preferred stock were issued as common
stock. The company also takes into account such factors, as Enable's most recent public outlook dated --
for 2020 dated May 6, 2020 and effective tax rates.

The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards,
impairments or Enable's unusual items. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing
earnings guidance in today's call, please refer to our earnings news release and our slides on our website.

Before John begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access
the replay can be found on our website.

I'd now like to turn the call over to John.

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Thank you, David, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We will start with Slide 4. Let me begin
by thanking our employees in the field, our linemen, service technicians and other field employees are
essential personnel, vital to supporting the communities we serve. During these unprecedented times, we
are extremely proud of the tremendous effort our employees are making every day to continue providing
safe and reliable electricity and natural gas to our customers. Thank you all for representing CenterPoint
well and living up to our brand promise of being always there.

This morning, our company announced strong first quarter results, along with several other key
announcements, highlighted on Slide 5. Over the past year, CenterPoint Energy's portfolio transformation
has shown the company's strategic commitment to increasing its focus on the regulated utility sector. This
portfolio transformation is better aligned with our investors' risk/return objectives and has earned the
support of several highly credible investors.

As a result, today, the company announced a $1.4 billion transaction, which was compromised of 700
-- comprised of $725 million of shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock and $675 million of
shares of common stock, as detailed on Slide 6. This transaction, in combination with the cash proceeds
received from the recent sale of Miller Pipeline and Minnesota Limited or our Infrastructure Services
business and the pending sale of CenterPoint Energy Services, will be used to delever CenterPoint's
balance sheet, further strengthening its investment-grade credit metrics and overall credit profile. As a
result of this action, and the measures we announced on April 1, we anticipate that the company will not
raise additional equity capital through 2022.

These equity issuances highlight the substantial value proposition of CenterPoint as a premier regulated
utility with high growth opportunity.

The company's robust 5-year $13 billion capital investment program, combined with a strong regulatory
strategy and keen O&M discipline, are anticipated to drive 5% to 7% utility earnings compounded
annual growth over the planning horizon, all while keeping customers' rates low. CenterPoint is uniquely
positioned to operate from a place of heightened strength and flexibility while remaining focused on
providing safe, reliable and affordable services to its customers and executing on a wide range of long-
term opportunities across its utility businesses.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Additionally, turning to Slide 7, the company has also appointed 2 new outside directors to serve on the
company's Board, bringing the total number of directors on the Board to 10. These directors come to the
Board with exemplary leadership experience, unique backgrounds and well-matched skill sets tailored for
the needs and opportunities ahead for CenterPoint.

In addition to the new director appointment, the Board has formed a new Advisory Business Review
and Evaluation Committee of the Board. The new committee will assist the Board in evaluating strategic
business actions and alternatives related to CenterPoint's portfolio of businesses, assets and other
ownership interests to further enhance the company's financial strength, positioning and value proposition.

I would now like to provide an update on the COVID-19 pandemic. Turning to Slide 8, safety is our top
priority, and we have implemented social distancing protocol, rotational shifts and alternative work
facilities in order to enhance the safety of our customers, employees and contractors.

The CenterPoint Energy Foundation has also created a $1.5 million relief fund to assist nonprofit
organizations within our service territories with the effects of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has
impacted almost every facet of our customers' lives, and we believe it is more important than ever to
support the communities that we serve.

We continue to deliver the same reliable service our customers rightfully expect from us. Since the start of
the pandemic, we have not experienced material interruptions in our supply chain. Our safety precautions
allow us to continue moving forward with planned capital projects, and we continue to anticipate filing an
integrated resource plan in Indiana in the second quarter.

Moving to Slide 9. We delivered first quarter guidance basis utility EPS of $0.50 per share, excluding
impairments, compared with $0.41 for the first quarter of 2019. Rate relief, customer growth, O&M
savings and favorable tax impacts associated with the CARES Act as well as having a full quarter for the
legacy Vectren utilities were the primary contributors to the improvement.

For full year 2020, we are reiterating our utility guidance basis EPS range, projected to deliver $1.10 to
$1.20 in adjusted earnings. We are projecting that earnings dilution from a higher share count attributable
to the equity issuance we announced this morning and the negative earnings impact from COVID-19 will
be offset by the previously announced O&M reductions as well as the tax benefit from the CARES Act.

Turning to Slide 10. Regulators have been broadly supportive of the recovery of increased bad debt and
other incremental COVID-19 pandemic related expenses. Nearly 70% of our jurisdictions have a form
of pandemic mechanism in place. In our largest service territory, the Public Utility Commission of Texas
approved a mechanism to assist the retail electric providers with increased bad debt expense as well as to
cover pandemic-related expenses Houston Electric will encounter. As a reminder, approximately 70 retail
electric providers make up the customer base of Houston Electric.

We will continue working with the regulators in all of the states we serve to ensure customers impacted
by the pandemic are supported. During the first quarter, we experienced very minimal demand impacts
associated with COVID-19 as the stay-at-home restrictions began to take effect across the communities
we serve towards the end of March.

On Slide 11, we have provided an early estimated demand impact for April and the anticipated impact on
our full year guidance assumption. As a result of stay-at-home practices, we estimate a modest decline
in April demand for our commercial and small industrial electric customers, partially offset by increased
residential usage due to folks staying and working from home.

Natural gas distribution, commercial and industrial demand reduction was influenced primarily by
restaurant, retail and manufacturing closures. In total, we estimate that reduced demand impacted
utility EPS by about $0.01 to $0.02 in April. Overall, based on past experience, we believe our rates have
become less sensitive to demand shock as a result of rate design efforts in recent years.

I will note that the Houston Electric sensitivities incorporate the new rates that went into effect in April.
For the purpose of our full year 2020 guidance, the range assumes April to be the peak of reduced
demand levels and reflects anticipated deferral and recovery of incremental expenses, including bad debt.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

As states are beginning to loosen stay-at-home restrictions, we assumed a gradual reopening of the
economy in our service territories, leading to diminished levels of demand reduction, which would continue
through August in our guidance. Under this scenario, we project the full year COVID-19 impact to be in
the range of $0.05 to $0.08 of utility EPS. To the extent actual recovery deviates from our COVID-19
scenario assumptions, our projected full year guidance range may change.

Turning to Slide 12. On April 9, we completed the sale of our Infrastructure Services business, providing
approximately $670 million of cash to pay down debt, net of taxes. Completing this sale, along with
the pending Energy Services sale, improves our business risk profile, strengthens our credit quality and
reduces our earnings volatility. Above all, it is aligned with our strategy to increase the contributions of
earnings from utilities. These divestitures highlight our commitment to focusing squarely on high organic
growth utilities.

Turning to Slide 13. Many shareholders have asked about Enable's overall health, especially given the
distribution cut that was announced on April 1. We are confident in Enable's ability to weather the current
downturn for a number of reasons. First and foremost, Enable has a strong balance sheet and a healthy
coverage ratio. Second, approximately 1/3 of Enable's business is associated with transportation and
storage, which we anticipate will provide earnings stability during the current commodity downturn. Third,
dry gas drilling and completions in Haynesville remain in line with expectations as oil wells and associated
gas and other shale plays are being shut in. Finally, Enable has both O&M and capital levers they can
utilize to help maintain cash flow if volumes drop lower than currently anticipated.

Let me close by summarizing our investor value proposition, as shown on Slide 14. Following our
successful Vectren merger integration and portfolio transformation, CenterPoint is committed to delivering
increased shareholder value in the coming years. Our $13 billion capital investment program, combined
with a strong regulatory strategy and O&M discipline, are anticipated to drive 5% to 7% utility EPS growth
over the [ planning ] horizon. Additionally, we are firmly committed to maintaining solid investment-
grade credit quality. We believe this framework positions CenterPoint for long-term success and provides a
compelling opportunity for shareholders.

I am very pleased to have Kristie Colvin discuss our financial results in greater detail. Kristie has been
integral to the success of our finance organization for over 30 years, and has outstanding knowledge of
every facet of our business. Over the past month, she has more than risen to the challenge of leading our
finance organization, and I am eager to have her interact more with the investment community in the
months ahead. Kristie?

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm honored to serve as the Interim Executive Vice
President and CFO of CenterPoint Energy, and I look forward to meeting many of you in the near future.

Turning to Slide 15. Let me highlight some key accomplishments within utility operations during the
first quarter. We deployed approximately $600 million of utility capital investment and achieved strong
fundamental customer growth across both our electric and gas utilities.

Additionally, to date, we have identified approximately 60% of our targeted 2020 O&M reduction. We
remain steadfast in our focus on disciplined O&M management to support long-term earnings growth and
maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. On the regulatory front, we made various rate relief filings,
including the Houston Electric transmission and Texas gas jurisdictions' capital recovery mechanisms.

Moving to Slide 16. I would like to comment on the noncash impairments recorded in continuing
operations. In the first quarter of 2020, CenterPoint recorded an after-tax noncash impairment charge of
approximately $1.2 billion related to our investment in Enable and the company's share of impairment
charges recorded by Enable for goodwill and long-lived assets and $185 million related to Indiana
Electric. It is important to note that these impairments do not affect the company's liquidity, cash flow or
compliance with debt covenants.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

The impairment charge related to our investment in Enable recognizes the severity of the decline in the
estimated fair value of our investment. The decline is primarily due to the macroeconomic conditions
related in part to COVID-19 and the excess supply and depressed prices of natural gas and oil impacting
the midstream industry, combined with Enable's announcement last month to reduce its quarterly
distributions per common unit by 50%.

With these noncash charges, we have reduced our balance sheet investment in Enable Midstream from
approximately $2.4 billion to $848 million.

Now I'll provide some context regarding the noncash impairment charge recorded at Indiana Electric of
$185 million. Upon acquisition of this business and the Vectren merger in February 2019, the carrying
value of this business unit approximated fair value. Therefore, there was minimal cushion to absorb the
significant decline in current market conditions as a result of the pandemic. We do not believe that this
impairment is indicative of the long-term value of this utility, which continues to deliver strong earnings
with continued significant capital investment needs.

I would now like to review the first quarter -- the quarter-over-quarter utility operations and Midstream
Investment guidance basis EPS drivers on Slide 17. Excluding impairment charges, utility operations
delivered $0.50 per diluted share and Midstream Investments provided $0.10 per diluted share for the first
quarter of 2020 compared to $0.41 and $0.05, respectively, in the first quarter of 2019.

Utility operations delivered a solid performance this quarter, providing $0.09 of positive variance. Rate
relief contributed $0.07 of positive variance, largely as a result of the capital recovery mechanisms in the
Indiana Electric and Texas Gas jurisdictions, along with the implementation of interim rates in Minnesota.
Additionally, the first quarter of 2020 benefited approximately $0.05 from an additional month of earnings
associated with the jurisdictions acquired through the merger in February 2019. O&M savings provided
$0.03 of favorability.

Lastly, CenterPoint Energy's continued strong customer growth, primarily along the Texas Coast and our
Minnesota service territory, provided for $0.02 of positive variance. Partially offsetting these positive
variances were higher depreciation and amortization and other tax expense, lower usage and lower equity
return, primarily due to the annual true-up of transition charges.

The lower usage experienced across our natural gas distribution and Indiana Electric service territory was
partially driven by warmer-than-normal weather, which accounted for approximately $0.01 of negative
earnings variance versus normal. Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of our utilities.

Turning to Slide 18, we discuss our continued discipline in O&M management. Last year, our company
made great strides through our diligent and keen focus on O&M management, by achieving approximately
$100 million of annualized year-over-year O&M savings through merger and other cost efficiencies.
Further building on the momentum from 2019 early last month, CenterPoint announced that we are
targeting approximately $40 million in incremental O&M savings for 2020 relative to full year 2019 levels.
We expect to achieve approximately half of the targeted incremental 2020 O&M savings from support level
functions. We will continue to look for systematic opportunities to align work activities and organizational
approaches in support of our utility-focused strategy. This comprehensive approach to O&M management
will continue to support EPS growth and maintaining investment-grade credit metrics.

On Slide 19, as John previously detailed, the equity issuances announced today demonstrate CenterPoint's
commitment to a strong balance sheet and further strengthening of our investment-grade credit metrics
and overall credit profile. Our rigorous capital allocation progress -- process and ongoing disciplined O&M
management further support this commitment. These equity issuances eliminate the anticipated equity
needs through 2022, and we will target 14% to 14.5% FFO to debt over the long-term planning period.

Turning to Slide 20. We are reiterating our 2020 utility guidance basis EPS range of $1.10 to $1.20 and a
5% to 7% 5-year EPS growth CAGR. The 2020 guidance range takes into consideration earnings dilution
as a result of the higher share count from the announced equity transaction and the potential range of
earnings impact of $0.05 to $0.08 per diluted share associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that John
previously discussed. These items are expected to be offset by strong first quarter results, the benefits

received from previously announced targeted O&M reductions as well as tax benefits from the CARES Act.
To the extent actual recovery deviate from these COVID-19 scenario functions, our projected full year
guidance range may change.

In closing, the first quarter presented new challenges for not only our business, but the entire industry
and global market. Our company was proactive in tackling the challenges presented by COVID-19.
Leadership remains focused on our core value of the safety of our employees and the communities we
serve, delivering reliable and affordable energy. CenterPoint Energy is poised to deliver 5% to 7% utility
EPS growth through execution of our utility strategy and disciplined O&M management, while remaining
firmly committed to our solid investment-grade credit policy.

I'll now turn it back to David.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Securities.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just 2 questions here. First, starting sort of with that strategic level. You have, obviously, a review
process that's in place now. And so when we think about the range of outcomes that you're foreseeing
with this, can we get a little bit of a sense of core versus noncore, stronger jurisdictions versus maybe
those that require a bit more work from your perspective? And sort of with an Analyst Day set, does this
sort of imply that an outright sale of the company is not part of this kind of internal review process? And I
have a follow-up.

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start with the last question. Yes, that's correct. This is a -- we have strong support for the business
and the model we have now. And so what we're going to do is review those businesses to see where we
can optimize those. And clearly, our focus is on our utility businesses. And we feel like all of our utility
businesses have good regulatory compacts, and we will always continue to look at how we improve those
moving forward and the mechanisms for recovery. But this will be a comprehensive view of all of our
businesses so that we can optimize those as a company moving forward.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then, just lastly, you reiterated the utility guidance for 2020 and the 5% to 7% growth, which
is very constructive. Can we get maybe a little bit more specific around the moving piece. Maintaining
these figures, there's a lot of moving pieces, i.e., you called out COVID headwinds. Is that entirely kind of
offset by corporate costs? What's implied with future cost cuts at the parent? What mitigates the dilution
in the near term?

So I'm just trying to get a bit of a sense on how all the drivers kind of net out, even as we think about
beyond 2020.

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Okay. Also, I'll start out with 2020, and then Kristie can add to it and then talk a little bit about moving
forward. I mean, we took several steps that we announced back at the beginning of April. Some of them
more driven by credit to make sure we have very solid credit metrics as we move through this year. And
so reducing capital by $300 million helped us there. But we announced $40 million of O&M cuts as well,
which we had good line of sight to, as Kristie said, about 60% of that.

So the combination of a good first quarter, those O&M savings and the CARES Act, that has the tax benefit
-- Kristie can speak more to that -- offset the impact of our expected range on COVID-19 as well as the
dilution as a result of the $1.4 billion of equity issuance. So those generally -- that group generally nets
out for 2020.

And then, as we move forward, we have the benefit of maintaining that $40 million of O&M savings as well
as the fact that we had anticipated raising about this amount of equity over the next 3-year time period,
maybe slightly more already. So that, that dilution from there is not as material as we move forward.

And then we have the announced dividend -- our dividend cut, which gives us additional retained earnings.
So it's really the combination of all of those that allow us to reiterate 2020 guidance and also reiterate rate
base growth and EPS growth of 5% to 7%.

Kristie, would you like to add anything to that?

I think you covered it well.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Terrific. Congrats on moving forward, and congrats on the deal with Jeff and team, congrats.

Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

My first question is regarding just financing. With the $1.4 billion raise that you guys did, how do
you think about the buffer that you have or maybe the potential leverage that you could pull in the
hypothetical scenario that Enable needs to cut its distribution again?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start out first on Enable, and that is for the reasons I talked about when I went through my
presentation, we've looked at a number of scenarios, and there were downside scenarios, lower oil prices
for longer. And when we made the decision to cut distribution by 50%, we felt very good that, that was
the right level. And even though we have seen, because of physical constraints, some shut-ins, we've seen
some positives too.

So we still remain confident in Enable's ability to maintain that 50% distribution and pull their own levers
related to O&M and capital. So that's the starting point. But I'll let Kristie speak to the other part of our
strengthening of our balance sheet and how we look at that.

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

Yes. I mean this transaction has strengthened our FFO-to-debt. And as John mentioned, we are not
currently anticipating a cut in the distribution from Enable.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Just in the scenario that maybe something like that does happen in a very worst-case scenario, are your --
is your -- your conversations with Moody's, do you have a little bit more room on the FFO to debt side to
absorb some of that additional impact?

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

Yes. I think we would have conversations about the increased level of regulated percentage in our
earnings and our business with the rating agencies at that point.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Understood. And just one quick follow-up. On the strategic review, from a stand-alone CenterPoint
standpoint, is the strategy, all being equal, still to try to trend towards that 90% utility earnings by 2024?

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Well, that's the foundation we start on. And that's what we have seen really aligns with what we believe
are our shareholders' interest. So that's the starting point. But we will comprehensively, with that business
review committee, evaluate the best options to further maximize shareholder value. So yes, that's the
starting point.

Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I just want to make it clear. In that FFO to debt target range for 2020, you're starting off in that range as
you go forward?

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

With the equity issuance, we're a little higher. We're expecting to be a little higher than that in 2020. And
then our long-term range is 14% to 14.5%.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And in terms of the COVID sensitivities, you had -- it starts off with a pretty bad April, but you
expect things to get better over the summer and then beyond that. Do you have any kind of a ballpark
estimate of where we're seeing. How much worse the $0.05 to $0.08 could get? Let's say, for instance, the
April downturn of 15% to 20% that you saw in the commercial and 10% to 15% industrial reductions. If
that continued at that level, for the rest of the year, for instance, where -- how much worse would it get?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean I'll give you some general ballpark, but again, our experience because of -- even though we
had reduced industrial, we're not very sensitive because of the way the rates are designed on industrial,
we're not very sensitive there.

And the commercial downturn was in line with what we had expected, and we saw positive on the
residential side, both in Houston and Indiana. So our -- what we saw in April was very much in line with
what we had estimated.

And then if you extrapolate that out for the conditions we talked about through August, it results in that
$0.05 to $0.08. But clearly, you can extrapolate that out. We don't anticipate that it will impact us through
the full year, but you can extrapolate out that $0.01 to $0.02 impact for more months, and that would be
in line with what would happen should that scenario occur.

Kristie, you want to add on that?

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. $0.01 to $0.02 per month for additional months? Is that how you're looking at it?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. Kristie, do you see it differently than that?

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And maybe just one last question. If you could just maybe comment on the status of the oil and gas
industry and your service territory, and what's going on there? What your assumptions are for oil and gas
refining and drilling part of your customer base?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean clearly, Houston's economy is tied to the oil and gas business. The good news is less tied to
that business over time. And we've seen Houston do very well through downturns in the past. I mean with
robust growth of 2% plus, customer count in good times, and we've seen it still stay positive even through
downturns. So we still expect very good market area there.

But yes, we will monitor. It's too early to tell now, but we'll monitor what impact oil and gas downturn may
have on our growth rate moving into next year and update you as we see more. At this point, as we sit
today, we saw still good growth right up through the end of March on customer counts. We still see that
we're connecting new developments in new areas. So at this point, we haven't seen, but we will monitor it
closely.

Wolfe Research, LLC

John, so just I'm curious if you had conversations on this already with the rating agencies. And did you
get any sense that it would be possible that they might remove the negative outlook? Or any color there
would be helpful.

John William Somerhalder

Yes. I'd comment first. Clearly, this is positive. But yes, Kristie, can tell you about the actual conversations
and where those could move.

Kristie L. Colvin

well and gives both parties certainty about being able to close. So right now, we feel very good about it.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then I have one other follow-up question. Just that in this business valuation review, obviously,
the one nonutility business left is Enable, and that Enable was reviewed by the company several years
ago. And in the end, nothing really happened. Is it -- is there any reason to think that there might be
more options or new options this time than 3 or 4 years ago?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Steve, I don't know at this point. Clearly, we reviewed it in great detail, looked at various options and
concluded the path forward that we took back there and made the most sense. But the business review
committee will review options related to this. So way too early to speculate, though, on whether other
options could be identified or not.

Our next question comes from Aga Zmigrodzka with UBS.

Aga Zmigrodzka
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So you talked a lot about the cost savings of $40 million. As you continue the review, what do you think
could be the potential upside to this number across your footprint?

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

We're targeting $40 million of savings.

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. And we're -- we feel very good about that number because as Kristie mentioned, we have line of sight
directly, things we'd already worked on earlier this year related to our corporate structure and support
services and some IT, IS type costs that had been identified.

Longer term, it really is a matter of looking at all types of things from how we use contractors and then
the car contractors are very important to us, but what's the right approach there; supply chain savings;
use of technologies; other technologies, work management systems. So we'll be digging into those issues
in detail now that we've made the decisions and positioned the company now with flexibility and strong
balance sheet moving forward. So it's too early to say what the potential is. Right now, we're trying to
ensure that we have certainty around the $40 million.

Aga Zmigrodzka

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Congratulations on all the progress here. I wanted to follow up on the outlook through '24 here. Can
you comment specifically about expectations for earning your optimized returns? I know that obviously,
there's some gyrations in the current year related to COVID. But as you see achieving this 5% to 7%, just
specifically within that, kind of going back to where the first questioner started. What are your embedded
earned returns? And how do you think about equity in that plan after '22 through '24?

And then maybe implicit within this, just to make sure I'm squaring this one appropriately, given that you
have this equity issuance in the first couple of years, is the plan back half-weighted? Just to kind of think
about the equity being upfront there?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. Actually, I'll start out with the equity piece, and then comment on the returns, some of those issues.
But actually, because of the dividend reduction, down to -- we're targeting 50% to 55% on our regulated
earnings, we have more retained earnings in those out-years. So we issue an amount of equity in the --
through 2022 in the range of $1.4 billion, which is pretty much in the range we had before, maybe slightly
lower.

But because of the retained earnings in the backside, the old forecast of $300 million to $500 million per
year in that time period, actually, there's lower pressure on that now. We believe it will be less in the out-
years, and we'll get the benefit of the things we've talked about, the O&M savings and the dividend cut. So
not back-end loaded at all, in fact, more modest needs in the back end of the plan, which really helps with
the 5% to 7% growth when we're issuing less equity out in those time periods and have the $40 million of
O&M savings.

And what we're targeting is very much in line with our allowed returns. If we look at Houston Electric,
we target very close to the 9.4% return on equity with that cap structure and pretty similar in the other
jurisdictions. Kristie, add to that if I have anything that I missed on that.

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

I think you covered it well.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then turning to the strategic side of things, just real quickly, perhaps clarifying your prior
comments here. What is on the table with respect to the strategic review, just to ask it more explicitly
and bluntly, if I may? You commented on Enable here. Just want to perhaps make sure we're fully
encompassing and understanding what is contemplated? And how do you think about this against the
backdrop of having had these processes in the past?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean in the past, a lot of the processes that went on were effective, and they were more led by
the management team. What we have now is a group, including 2 new Directors, 2 existing Directors
or 3 if you count me, the 5 of us will be looking at this. So it will be a Board-level with that new set of
experiences involved in at Board level. And it will be comprehensive. We'll look at our businesses in total

to make sure that we move forward in the most optimized way. So it's similar in some ways, but it has
the changes I just talked about. So we're very encouraged by that. We think it's the right time to further
optimize our business.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. Are we supposed to -- just in terms of the plan, just to clarify this. Should we expect management
updates and appointments prior to the conclusion of the process?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

The plan right now is clearly the committee, I think, will function under its charter through October. And so
a normal time that we may -- we'll talk about that would be in an Investor Day early in 2021. That would
be the base plan. But obviously, if there's something that should be communicated before that, we would
do that. But the normal schedule is what I first laid out.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Right. So no updates to management in the interim either?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Well, should anything occur that we need to update you all on and make public, we would do that. But
the base plan is to take that amount of time and then be prepared to announce changes and direction,
certainly at the conclusion of that process. But should anything happen that changes that, we would
obviously make public as appropriate.

Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Hopefully, one question, one follow-up. I think a little off to Julien's question, and more on the CEO
search. Any update on the CEO search on timing of when we may find out when the Board selects
someone?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean the very good news is that the committee has been working for a time -- well, pretty much
since we stood that committee up, and they've been very, very rigorous around that. We have a search
firm in place. They've identified a large number of candidates. They've conducted interviews with a
number of candidates. And so we're now more on the backside of that search process.

But until it's -- the absolute right person is picked, and we can make sure what the timing is on transition
period, it's not done until it's done, but I feel good that a lot of good work has been done, and we're on
the backside of getting that taken care of.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. And then, lastly, just more fine-tuning. The $40 million of additional O&M cuts the company has
identified in 2020, and I think you've answered this, maybe I missed it. Are they more at the parent
company? Are they more at the operating utility company?

support services and some of those things as we look at the new mix and more utility focused, some of
those just fit with how we looked at the support services moving forward. But there will be some, some
that each of our business units will develop as well. So there will be some, but a good percentage of them
are at corporate level.

Kristie, you add to that for me, please?

Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So I just wanted to sort of follow up on the business review process. I mean last time, on the fourth
quarter, it sounded like you guys weren't really looking at necessarily that wider range of potential
business combinations or what-have-you. With the new investors, with this investment, what-have-you,
should we think perhaps the business review is now perhaps about a wider range of potential options that
almost anything could be on the table to enhance shareholder value?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Well, the way I look at it is the business review committee will really look at the business plans across all
of our business, and think through everything from appropriate regulatory strategies and think through
best ways to optimize on how businesses fit together. So I mean, that's something you do on a normal
basis anyway.

So -- and it brings a fresh set of eyes with good experience with our new directors involved to the process.
So I think it's in line with what a company normally would do, but with really good expertise with the
opportunities we have now to really take a fresh look at it. So it is different. It's a very powerful process, I
think we can follow, and they'll make recommendations to the Board -- for the Board to act on in the time
period we talked about. So we think it's a good thing to do moving forward.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Sure. But I guess what I'm sort of wondering is, if there was the potential for a sale of the company or
what-have-you, is there -- is that off the table, I guess, is what I'm saying?

I mean in other words, would you guys be willing to look at anything that -- depending on, obviously, what
it is and obviously what the stand-alone plan is and what your outlook is, should we think of it as pretty
much anything is on the table potentially as long as you guys see it in shareholder value? Or are there
certain things that you feel, hey, that just isn't in our game plan, so to speak?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

The starting point is truly looking at how our businesses are operating, how they function optimizing
those, making the right business decisions in total around the base of this great set of utility assets. So
that's the starting point, that's the focus.

utility assets and how to optimize those and configure those correctly moving forward.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. Great. And then just finally, on Indiana Electric, the write-down, was that goodwill? It wasn't
completely clear when you said the fair value. Has that got anything to do with fair value accounting with
respect to the rate base or anything? Or is that sort of -- could you just elaborate a little bit further on
what the impact is actually at the utility in terms of -- if there is one, in terms of either equity or what-
have-you at the utility level in terms of regulatory rate-making, what-have-you?

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to kind of build on some of the points that you touched on here. With regards to the FFO to
debt trajectory, just want to see if something by chance moves against you here, like Enable's dividend
cut or something like that. Just wanted to see what levers you have left to pull at this point? Could that
include kind of like more CapEx deferrals? Or just any thoughts you have there would be helpful.

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start out. I mean one of the things we would do, especially with the strength of our balance sheet
now heading into that, a couple of things we do is work -- continue to work with the rating agencies and
talk through the fact that our regulated versus unregulated mix would be enhanced, should that occur.
Again, we feel good about Enable's distributions, but that would be where we'd start.

But clearly, we've taken some very positive steps, we believe, already. But clearly, under those
circumstances, we would look at other alternatives and the type that you mentioned would be things that
would be evaluated, whether that's a little less capital or continuing to see if we can optimize O&M. We'd
look at those as other possible ways to make sure we kept the best balance sheet moving forward.

Kristie, add to that, please?

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

clarity on COVID deferrals for the remainder of your jurisdiction?

Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar.

Charles J. Fishman
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

In the current guidance, 2020 guidance, utility contribution, 88%, Midstream 12%. John, in the April 1
news release, you anticipated utility earnings contribution increasing to nearly 100% over the next few
years. That would imply to me that your preference -- and realize you got this the review board now, but
your preference, at that time, was to probably either divest completely or partially Enable. Am I reading
more into that quote than I should? Or is there something else going on that I don't understand?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean effectively, what happened is when we looked at the Enable distribution cut of 50%, it was
based on the fact that we expect a very little drilling activity to occur this year and heading into next year
and it's lower for longer period we're in. And so the results are, we took that proactive step on distribution
cuts to really protect the liquidity of Enable as they head into lower earnings into next year and even
moving a little further than that. So just naturally, as those earnings go to where we expect under this
no significant drilling in some of those basins for the time period I talked about, that takes the earnings
contribution for midstream down just naturally there.

And then on top of that, we're continuing to invest heavily in our regulated business. So you have the
positive of the regulated coming up, and then just that normal trajectory that we anticipated when we cut
distributions to 50%. That will result in 95-plus percent, I think, regulated earnings mix. Now Kristie, there
may be a little bit more on that related to the impairment? And how that impacts that, is that correct?

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

I mean there will be basis accretion as a result of these impairments, but we do still expect that the utility
will grow to the 95% of the contribution.

focus on strong balance sheet, we want to make sure we take the time to absolutely get the right person.

Antoine Pierre Jean Aurimond
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I just wanted to be clear on equity needs. So total equity needs through 2022 are not necessarily different
from what you had previously. And you had that $300 million to $500 million in both '21 and '22, as you
had mentioned.

Is the idea that the bulk of that will now be met with new holdco debt issuance, so more of a timing shift?
Or is it the O&M savings, the dividend cut that essentially take care of that?

John William Somerhalder
Interim President, CEO & Director

Yes. If the question -- in '23 and 24, we still will have some equity needs, but I would -- based upon what
we're looking at now, anticipated plan would estimate it to be lower than the $300 million to $500 million
range we estimated before. And Kristie, can you give more information on that?

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

I mean that's correct. As you said, with the dividend cuts we did, it is lower than anticipated in those
years.

Antoine Pierre Jean Aurimond
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And to be clear, are you going to, So since today's announcement, take care of equity need through '22?
The '21 and '22 that you were going to issue, is that going to be met with new holdco debt issuance?

Kristie L. Colvin
Interim Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer??

Well, we issued $1.4 billion today. And our plan was to issue $800 million in 2020 and between $300
million and $500 million in '21 and '22. So at the midpoint of '21 and '22, that would have been $1.6
billion versus the $1.4 billion we're doing. So we satisfied our needs upfront for these 3 years.
