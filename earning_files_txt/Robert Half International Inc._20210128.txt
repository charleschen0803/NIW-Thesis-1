ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to the Robert Half Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Our host for today's call are
Mr. Keith Waddell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Robert Half; and Mr. Michael Buckley, Chief
Financial Officer. Mr. Waddell, you may begin.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you. Hello, everyone. We appreciate your time today.

Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-
looking statements, including predictions and estimates about our future performance. These statements
represent our current judgment of what the future holds. However, they are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q
filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures and reference these figures
as, as adjusted. Reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental
schedule to our earnings press release.

In addition, we'd like to remind you that beginning last quarter, we modified our presentation of revenues
and the related growth rates for Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology and Robert Half
Management Resources to include their intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in
connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions.

This is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. The combined amount of divisional
intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedules just
mentioned also include our revenue schedule showing this information back for 2018, 2019 as well as
2020. For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available at the Investor Center of
our website at roberthalf.com.

Fourth quarter results for both our Protiviti and staffing operations were very strong and exceeded the top
end of our guidance range. Protiviti reported its 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains
with particular strength in its technology consulting practice and managed solutions with staffing. Our
staffing operations reported broad-based, double-digit, quarter-on-quarter sequential revenue growth on
an as-adjusted basis. I could not be more proud of our teams have managed through this extraordinary
year. Over the past several months, they've made significant impacts, helping our clients succeed and job
candidates find meaningful work.

Company-wide revenues were $1.304 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, down 15% from last year's
fourth quarter on a reported basis and down 16% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the
fourth quarter was $0.84 compared to $0.98 in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. Cash flow before financing
activities during the quarter was $85 million. In December, we distributed a $0.34 per share cash dividend
to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $39 million. We also acquired 1.1 million Robert
Half shares during the quarter for $63 million. We have 9.9 million shares available for repurchase under
our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 31% in the
fourth quarter.

Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

Thank you, Keith, and hello, everyone. Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were
$1.304 billion in the fourth quarter. This is a decrease of 15% from the fourth quarter 1 year ago on a
reported basis and a decrease of 16% on an as-adjusted basis.

On an as-adjusted basis, fourth quarter staffing revenues were down 24% year-over-year. U.S. staffing
revenues were $723 million, down 25% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $219 million,
down 23% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 88
locations in 17 countries outside the United States.

In the fourth quarter, there were 61.7 billing days, equal to the number of billing days in the fourth
quarter 1 year ago. The current first quarter has 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first
quarter 1 year ago. The billing days for 2021 by quarter are 62.3, 63.4, 64.4 and 61.7 for a total of 251.8
days, which is approximately 1 day less than 2020 due to it being a leap year.

Currency exchange rate movements during the fourth quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-
on-year staffing revenues by $8 million. This increased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue
growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. Temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 2%
compared to a year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business. This rate for Q3
2020 was 3.1%.

Now let's take a closer look at revenues for Protiviti. Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $362
million. $294 million of that is from business within the United States, and $68 million is from operations
outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global fourth quarter Protiviti revenues were up 18%
versus the year ago period with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 23%. Non-U.S. revenues were down 2% on
an as-adjusted basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by
$3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 1 percentage point. Protiviti and its
independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.

Turning to SG&A presentation. As first noted last quarter, changes in the company's deferred
compensation obligations are now included in SG&A or in the case of Protiviti, direct cost with offsetting
changes in the investment trust assets presented separately below SG&A. As a reminder, our historical
discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of combined
segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for interest
income and amortization of intangible assets.

For your convenience, we've added another supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Pages
12 and 13 highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of
operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019. This is a non-GAAP disclosure, so we also
show a reconciliation to GAAP.

Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, fourth quarter gross
margin was 38.5% of applicable revenues compared to 38% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter 1
year ago. The year-over-year increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to lower payroll taxes,
insurance and other fringe costs.

Our permanent placement revenues in the fourth quarter were 9.7% of consolidated staffing revenues
versus 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with
temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 10 basis points compared
to the year ago fourth quarter to 44.4%.

For Protiviti, gross margin was $96 million in the fourth quarter or 26.5% of Protiviti revenues. This
includes $5 million or 1.5% of Protiviti revenues of deferred compensation expenses related to increases
in the underlying trust investment assets. 1 year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $90 million or 29.7%
of Protiviti revenues including $2 million of deferred compensation expense or 0.7% of Protiviti revenues
related to investment trust activities.

Company-wide selling, general and administrative costs were 32.6% of global revenues in the fourth
quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Deferred compensation expenses related to

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percent of revenue to
2.7% in the current third quarter and 1.2% in the same quarter 1 year ago.

Staffing SG&A costs were 39.7% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 36.7% in the fourth
quarter of 2019. Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases
in the underlying trust investment assets of 3.7% and 1.5%, respectively. We ended 2020 with 7,800 full-
time internal staff in our staffing divisions, down 32% from the prior year.

Fourth quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 14.1% of Protiviti revenues compared to 17.1% of revenues
in the year ago period. We ended 2020 with 7,300 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 34%
from the prior year.

Operating income for the quarter was $89 million. This includes $41 million of deferred compensation
expense related to increases in the underlying investment trust assets. Combined segment income
was therefore $130 million in the fourth quarter. Combined segment margin was 9.9%. Fourth quarter
segment income from our staffing divisions was $79 million with a segment margin of 8.4%. Segment
income for Protiviti in the fourth quarter was $51 million with a segment margin of 13.9%.

Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27% for both the current and prior period years. Accounts receivable at
the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable was $714 million and implied days sales outstanding, or
DSO, was 49.4 days.

Before we move on to first quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw
in the fourth quarter of 2020 and so far in January 2021, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our
temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues down
20.8% versus the prior year compared to a 23.8% decrease for the fourth -- for the full quarter. Revenues
in the first 3 weeks of January were down 23% compared to the period -- compared to the same period 1
year ago.

Permanent placement revenues in December were down 25.4% versus December of 2019. This compares
to a 28.5% decrease for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of January, permanent placement revenues
were down 20% compared to the same period in 2020. We provide this information so that you have an
insight into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and into January. But as you know, these
are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them.

With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenues, $1.29 billion to $1.37 billion;
income per share, $0.74 to $0.84. The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue decline
of 11.7% on an as-adjusted basis including Protiviti and EPS returning to prior year levels. The major
financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these assumptions are as follows. Revenue growth on a
year-over-year basis: staffing, down 19% to 21%; Protiviti, up 23% to 25%; overall, down 11% to 13%.

Gross margin percentages: temporary and consultant staffing, 37% to 38%; Protiviti, 25% to 26%;
overall, 38% to 39%. SG&A as a percentage of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment
impacts: staffing, 35% to 36%; Protiviti, 14% to 15%; overall, 29% to 30%. Segment income: staffing,
8% to 9%; Protiviti, 10% to 12%; overall, 8% to 10%.

2021 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs for the year, $85 million to $95 million
with $15 million to $20 million in the first quarter; tax rate, 27% to 28%; shares, 113 million. We limit our
guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's
press release and in our SEC filings.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Mike. We entered 2021 with renewed optimism about Robert Half's positioning for future
growth. We've retained our key staff, and they are committed to driving our success as the backbone
of the enterprise. Our aggressive go-to-market strategy during the pandemic with clients in the public

sector and financial institutions of all sizes has yielded meaningful wins and new relationships. Our
technology investments have facilitated remote working models internally and with our advanced AI-
driven capabilities are providing clients with real-time choices of candidates from outside their local market
area.

Owing to its diversified solution offerings, Protiviti continues its record of multiyear double-digit revenue
growth and very positive pipeline. The collaboration between Protiviti and staffing is at an all-time high as
evidenced by the 82% year-on-year revenue growth this quarter from the unique blend of consulting and
staffing solutions. Staffing services provided to our mid-cap clients now approaches 1/3 of our revenues
and growing, and this is incremental to our traditional focus on SMB clients and prospects.

With multiple vaccines now rolling out throughout the world and fiscal and monetary policy support
expected to continue globally, economists are increasingly expecting GDP growth to follow. GDP-driven
early cycle growth is traditionally particularly robust for SMB clients that are lean and nimble from the
downturn and have pent-up demand to restore and upskill their workforce as they return to growth. More
than ever, we believe the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business
model position us for future success in 2021 and beyond.
Now Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single
follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations. Wondering, can you talk about the opportunities that you're seeing across Protiviti?
Obviously, you're accelerating. It seems like there would be a lot of opportunities in a lot of different areas
within IT, including cybersecurity audits, particularly in the wake of SolarWinds. And you did make the
acquisition with regards to Identropy. So I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the areas
of growth that you're seeing there and kind of what inning you think Protiviti is in, and then I've got a
follow-up for the staffing side.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

So the good news for Protiviti is that its success is broad based. It's led by technology consulting and
managed solutions. On the tech side, which we've talked about for a few quarters now, it's cloud, it's
cyber, it's privacy, it's digital transformation. In the managed solutions with staffing, it's public sector led
by unemployment, housing, education, vaccine. FSI continues to lead with anti-money laundering and
consumer lending regulatory actions leading that way. Internal audits, down 8% to 10% year-on-year.
Some work got delayed. Some scopes got reduced. There's a little bit of fee pressure.

As we've talked about now for a few quarters, Protiviti's pipeline remains very strong. As to which inning
we're in, it's clearly not a late inning because not only do we have macro coming back and discretionary
spending that will benefit particularly internal audit, you've also got a new administration in the United
States that's viewed to be more regulatory friendly, which is a better thing than not as it relates to
Protiviti. So we feel great about where they are. We feel great about their prospects, and we feel like it's
early innings.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's terrific. And can you talk a little bit about the fit with the most recent acquisition and the
opportunities there? I know it's really small, just 40 people. But it seems like it would be a really good fit
in terms of any sort of IT audits that you're doing.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, sure. And identity access management is clearly an important subcomponent of cybersecurity. And
we've got a team very expert in a certain platform, a leading platform in that space. So we're happy to
have him part of the family. We feel like we can leverage our existing database while we also grow theirs,
and we feel good about that as well.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Terrific. And then can you talk a little bit about the staffing side? As we come out of this, Keith and Mike,
obviously we're just in the early stages of inflecting, and nobody knows how long the cycle is going to
be. But you're really seeing a nice improvement in terms of productivity. Your headcount was down 32%
on the staffing side, revenue down a lot less than that. You've put in place a number of different tools to
increase productivity. So how should we think about the productivity over the course of the current cycle
as we continue to come out of this? And what I'm wondering is, it looks like you've picked up your hiring
but it's not at a super robust pace yet. So just how should we think about that?

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, as we've talked for a few quarters now, we've retained our tenured staff. Their productivity is always
greater than the less experienced staff. We feel like we've got additional capacity with that group. We
think we can leverage that capacity as we grow without adding, in an outsized way, to heads. There's a
little bit of an offset in that our incentive plans, our graduated rate plans, hockey stick, if you will. So as
these more tenured people get further and further up the hockey stick, some of that leverage will go back
to them appropriately so. But we'll still benefit overall, and we expect our -- to have some profitability
upside as we continue to grow relative to where we were at same revenue points in the past.

Operator

Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Two questions. The first one is when thinking about that year ago first quarter of 2020, obviously, the
month of March was that COVID-affected quarter -- I mean, COVID affected month. How did you take
into that kind of year-over-year consideration when giving first quarter '21 staffing? And when I say
staffing, I mean, both flex and perm revenue guidance. That's my first question. I'm going to give you
my second question at the same time. And my second question is how should we think about flex staffing
revenue sequentially in the first quarter of '21, recalling that a first quarter is a slower seasonal time for
flex staffing?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

So your 2 questions are related. We effectively took our fourth quarter actual results, super imposed a
typical sequential progression into the first quarter and that was the basis for our Q1 guidance. And the
year-on-year, Andrew, fell out to whatever it was because we felt like, using where we currently are, i.e.,
fourth quarter as the baseline for our forecast rather than a year ago, which did have the impacts of that
March month in it, we felt like Q4 was a better baseline and the sequential embedded in our forecast is
typical first quarter sequential patterns, temp and perm.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Yes. No, that answers my question. Could you just give us a sense of if you think temp or perm will
do better in the first quarter?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we hope they both do better, and we're just coming off a quarter where they both did a lot better. So
we're happy about the momentum that we've had. Our people would tell you, it's one of our best restarts
to a new year in a long time. So anecdotally, I can assure you, the enthusiasm level is very high. That
said, we thought it prudent to, given the big step-up we had in Q4, to confirm that into Q1 with normal
patterns but not be more aggressive than that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Appreciate you guys giving the headcount numbers like you typically do at the end of every year. I wanted
to focus on the internal staff and staffing. It was down pretty substantially. But again, your revenues

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

weren't down as bad, so we saw some productivity there. What do you need to see to start hiring internal
staff in your staffing division? When do you think that will happen?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, as we've said, because we have a more tenured staff and because they have productivity capacity as
we speak, we're going to utilize that capacity before we aggressively add more heads. It's good for them.
It's good for their compensation. It's good for us. So we don't think certainly in the next quarter or 2 that
we'll have to add to staff in a meaningful way but can still grow nicely as we just showed we could do with
the existing staff.

I mean our staff cutbacks were primarily in the second quarter. And so the increases we saw in the third
quarter without -- were without any additional staff, and we think there's room to go with who we already
have. So I certainly wouldn't take our lack of hiring, either as evidenced by our job hostings or otherwise,
as any indication that we're not bullish and we don't think we can grow. Instead, we believe there's
significant unused capacity of our current tenured staff.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. That's really helpful. As a follow-up, Keith, you pointed out at the end of your prepared remarks
about your services to the mid-cap clients, now about 1/3 of their revenues. Can you talk about that?
What have you been doing there differently? And what do you think that could be over time?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'd say what we've done differently is a few things. One, we focused on it. We've had success with
it. Two, with Protiviti with many of those companies and even larger cap companies, we come through
the consulting door rather than the staffing door and by so doing, it's not margin dilutive than it might
otherwise be. So the combination of the focus, the success and the ability to leverage Protiviti and its
relationships and its contractual relationships all plays part.

We continue to believe there's upside there. As you know, traditionally, we've been principally SMB. And
trust me, we're not walking away from SMB. We're not deemphasizing SMB. To the contrary, we feel like
it's the perfect time in the cycle to be SMB, the last couple of quarters that they've been more impacted
than mid-cap and beyond. So we've endured the bad side of that, if you will. So now it's time to endure
the good side of SMB, and we're excited about how well we can leverage our SMB client base as we've
demonstrated in the past. That said, we do think mid-cap is incremental to that. We've done well. We've
done it without any net margin dilution, and we continue to invest in that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Appreciate the time. Maybe you can just touch on or remind
us of your exposure to the travel and leisure industry from a temp staffing perspective. And maybe you
can talk about outside of that, how you think the impact of the vaccine will have on your business.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

And so we have very little exposure to travel and leisure. Clearly, that industry is most impacted by the
shutdowns and restarts and shutdowns. And so just looking at our numbers, there's really no correlation
between geography shutdowns because we have so little exposure to travel and leisure. And clearly, the
impact of the vaccine can be nothing but positive. While on the one hand, our clients have, by and large,

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

adjusted to the current environment and had become very virtual, on the other hand, I think everybody is
excited about the possibility of not being virtual. And on that score, I thought it was interesting this week,
we were recognized as a top 20 company in the Fortune 500 for embracing remote work. So we thought
that was pretty cool.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then on gross margin, maybe you can help us understand or maybe give us a sense for
how we should think about gross margin going forward. Obviously, in the quarter, you had some fringe
benefits, insurance, things like payroll. But could you give us a sense for some of the puts and takes that
you're expecting in 2021?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Let's talk a little bit about gross margin because, first of all, if you look at prior downturns, peak to
trough, we've lost 300 basis points in gross margin. Happy to report that this time around, we lost 1/3
of that, 100 basis points. And I'm even further happy to report that we're now back, this most recent
quarter, we're now back to peak gross margins in our temp businesses.

For 2021, given that we are already back, while there might be some upside as we move through the year,
we certainly hadn't modeled a lot of upside, remembering that we have the highest gross margins in the
industry by leaps and bounds as it is. But trust me, I think one of the things we're most proud of is how
we've managed our gross margins, a, during the pandemic, the height of the pandemic, how we've gotten
them back and how we intend to sustain that into 2021.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Crédit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations. Keith, any sense of how the bill rates have been trending in the quarter versus prior
quarter and maybe year-on-year? If you could break that out maybe by segment?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we said in our prepared remarks that they were up 2% year-on-year adjusted for mix. That was
down a little bit from the prior quarter. It all starts with pay rates. And with higher unemployment, we
aren't paying quite as much. Still more than we were a year ago, but the rate of wage inflation has
subsided to some degree. But all things considered, to have -- to still have a little bit of low single-digit
wage inflation and then bill rate inflation and protect the margins for the differential is where we are and
where we're happy to be.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Understand. And then just real quick, what's the tax rate assumed in Q1 and then for the full year 2021, if
you have that?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think it's 27.5%, Mike?

Michael C. Buckley
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's going to be about the same for the full year.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So between 27% and 28%.

Operator

Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just wanted to ask another one about Protiviti. So a quarter ago, you told us your expectation was 5%
to 7% revenue growth, and it did 18%. And obviously, you're calling for even further acceleration in Q1.
What sort of happened in the last 3 months? And what is -- I understand all the areas of strength you've,
frankly, been discussing for several years now. But like what changed there? What's happening? And how
maybe durable or sustainable are the drivers of that recent acceleration?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

The thing that changed the most is we had more public sector demand right to the end of the year than
we expected. We service that primarily with contractors, which is why when you look at the supplemental
schedules where we break out the intersegment revenues, you see there was a $30 million spike between
quarters 3 and 4 and the lion's share of that was public sector related. As to sustainability, the jury is
out. That said, we have relationships we've never had before. We've certainly got a look into many local,
regional, state governments and their business processes. And we certainly are excited at the opportunity
to improve those processes, be it overpayments. A lot in the press about some fraud as it relates to
payment of unemployment claims.

And so again, there's no question that there's some spike in that as it relates to elevated unemployment
claims that the states are having to process, same for housing assistance, same for remote learning
support for school systems. That said, we do believe we're confident, and we've got teams put together
whose objective is just what you described as far as ensuring the sustainability and leveraging these new
relationships that we've never had. Traditionally, our revenues from government-related entities was less
than 1% of revenue. So it was almost nothing. So everything we're doing today is virtually incremental.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And then do you feel like either through that last discussion you gave or just more broadly how you've
gone to market and leverage the staffing businesses of Protiviti, like who are you gaining share from?
You're outgrowing almost everyone else in any kind of consultative type approach we see. Is it -- is there
a certain place you're taking that from?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think it's somewhat in -- on the staffing side and it's somewhat on the consulting side because
neither have the full picture, and there are many staffing firms that can provide customers support
people where their client manages them. There are virtually none that do that where we also provide the
management and that not only is it the management, it's with a view toward constant optimization, which
has been quite the winner.

And so -- but for us, who would have gotten that work? My guess is some of it would have gone to the
consulting firms, the accounting firm. Some of it would have gone to the staffing firms. But none of those
players have what we have, and it's actually pretty incredible how well it's done. It grew 82%, 82% this
quarter, 82%. That's a big number.

Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities.

Tobey O'Brien Sommer
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Could you tell us what you think the increased exposure to mid-cap clients does to your TAM?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, there's no question that staffing at mid- and large-cap companies is many times the size as the
opportunity with smaller businesses. Traditionally, we haven't focused there because margin pressures
were such that we felt like we were better off offering our better candidates to small businesses that would
pay us for them.

But as I said earlier, it's a whole new world when we go hand-in-hand with Protiviti, and it's -- there's the
umbrella of an honest to God consulting arrangement with honest to God deliverables such that we do
think it's a new day. And clearly, the addressable market is much larger, which is why we're investing.
Think about just during the pandemic, our exposure to mid-cap has gone from low 20% to today, it's
34%. That's huge. That's huge, and it's in a small period of time, and it was done in a period where we
didn't dilute our margins.

Tobey O'Brien Sommer
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Right. Right. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask you a question on the cost side of delivering your
service. Every call, we start with talking about the number of locations that you deliver your services
to, particularly on the staffing side but also Protiviti. Are there any meaningful opportunities from the
experience in 2020 and now into this year to adjust the cost structure so as to favorably impact margins
over the course of a whole cycle?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, our biggest cost is our internal payroll costs, and we've talked earlier about we think we've got --
with a large assist with the technology we've developed in the last 3 to 4 years, we think our internal
staff can inherently be more productive across this entire cycle. Real estate is more nuanced. On the one
hand, traditionally, our real estate is very dense. We put a lot of people in our space. There's not a lot of
square footage traditionally per person. In today's world of distancing, even post-pandemic query weather,
we'll have to relax that somewhat and offset what we'd otherwise save if we're on a hybrid model where
everybody doesn't come in every day.

So the jury is out on that. I mean our current thinking is probably more a push than anything. But it's
early days, and we don't know. We don't know ultimately how many people are going to want to work
remotely versus come in. And further, we don't know whether the density we've traditionally had, which
kind of creates an electricity, an energy level in an office, which has been helpful, we don't know whether
we're going to have to spread people out more for obvious reasons.

It's kind of interesting. Australia has some of the fewest number of cases. And so I would argue, they're
most along post-pandemic, and they've been surprised how much people want to come in and don't want
to work remotely. And in fact, they talk about it's 90% to 95% of the staff want to come back into the
office. That surprises me. Whether that's sustainable in Australia itself or whether you can replicate that in
other places, I don't know, but that's what they report.

Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Revenue trends in OfficeTeam stepped up pretty meaningfully in the quarter. What were the main drivers
of that improvement? And were there any onetime revenue benefits you'd call out in the quarter in that
particular business?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

I'd say a couple of things. So first of all, fourth quarter, George, OfficeTeam always benefits from e-
commerce customer support, and they got some fourth quarter lift from that again. They also get open
enrollment support lift in the fourth quarter. They got some of that again, traditional. But this public sector
work with Protiviti that I've been talking about, a lot of that has been customer service driven, call center
driven and OfficeTeam is the beneficiary of that. OfficeTeam's had an incredible couple 3 quarters. I mean
who would've believed that OfficeTeam and Protiviti would have gone to market together best at any time,
much less during a pandemic.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Very helpful. You mentioned that revenues in the first 3 weeks of January were down 23% year-
over-year compared to down 21% in December. In which areas did you see the most moderation in growth
moving from December to January?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, first thing, you need to zoom out from that and consider what January post quarter results mean
and what they don't mean. And in fact, if you go back in time and you compare January post quarter to
what hindsight you learn about the entire quarter, it's one of the least predictive post quarter periods
that we have because of the holiday impacts. And so I would tell you that we tend to discount January
post quarter more than most. And therefore, the fact that the year-over-year growth rates changed by
3 percentage points, we don't ascribe much importance to. As I said earlier, we're very happy with our
restart. The enthusiasm level of our people has never been higher. And we got one more week of data this
morning and frankly, it was even better yet again.

Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Crédit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. Keith and Mike, just one follow-up. When you talk about the public sector work, is that primarily
COVID-related work where you're hoping there'll be some follow-through? Or is there any way to frame
maybe how much of it is kind of COVID related that you're looking to kind of extend once things start to
normalize into more normal relationships?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well -- and so it's helping states deal with their unemployment claims, customer service, claims
processing, claims adjudication. It's housing, processing assistance claims. It's customer service, call
centers into that. Education, it's helping school systems deal with tech support for remote learning.
Vaccine, again, customer service, call center, people calling in, wanting to register. It's helping the check-
in. It's helping with the government reporting once it's done. And so it's a whole host of things that

clearly are initially related to COVID, if you will. But as I said earlier, it's given us a look into their internal
systems, and we think it's a target-rich environment to do follow-up work, which we are very focused on
doing.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And that's all state and federal or a combination of both?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

It's more state and local. More state and local.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And is there any way to maybe frame how much that was in the quarter like in terms of revenue?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we've disclosed to you the staffing, Protiviti revenue magnitude between the two this quarter going
back. We've told you there was a $30 million lift, and we've told you that a large part of that lift relates to
what I just described. So you can kind of use those puzzle pieces and come back to what you're looking
for.

Okay. Operator, I think that's our last question. Thank you very much, everyone, for participating on the
call.
