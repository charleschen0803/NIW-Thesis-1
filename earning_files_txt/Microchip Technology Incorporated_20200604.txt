Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to Microchip's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results Conference
Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's President and Chief -- excuse me, Microchip's
Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Brandon, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be
making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial
performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual
events or results may differ materially.

We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify
important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.

In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy,
Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter financial performance, and Steven and
Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well
as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.

We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-
GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of
our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and
non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and leverage metrics on our
website.

I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating
expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based
on expenses prior to the effects of acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other
adjustments as described in our press release.

Net sales in the June quarter were $1.31 billion, which was down 1.3%, sequentially and above the
midpoint of our upwardly revised guidance from June 2, 2020, when net sales were expected to be flat to
down 6% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our GAAP net sales as well as end-market demand
by product line and geography on our website for your reference.

On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were strong at 61.7%. Operating expenses were at 23.1%, and
operating income was an outstanding 38.6%, all better than the high end of our upwardly revised
guidance.

Non-GAAP net income was $401.9 million, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.56 and $0.03
above the high end of our upwardly revised guidance from June 2.

On a GAAP basis, in the June quarter, gross margins were 61% and include the impact of $6.4 million of
share-based compensation and $2.8 million of COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions on manufacturing
activities. Total operating expenses were $580 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of
$235.4 million, special charges of $0.3 million, $6 million of acquisition-related and other costs and share-
based compensation of $36 million. The GAAP net income was $123.6 million or $0.48 per diluted share.

Our June quarter GAAP tax benefit was impacted by a variety of factors, including tax reserve releases
associated with the statute of limitations expiring, deferred tax adjustments related to intercompany

movements of intellectual property rights, offset by tax reserve accruals associated with the outcome of
the Altera case during the period and other matters.

The non-GAAP cash tax rate was 6% in the June quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for
fiscal '21 to be about 6%, exclusive of the transition tax, any potential tax associated with restructuring
the Microsemi operations into Microchip global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes
accrued in prior fiscal years. We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as
well as U.S. tax interest deductions that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The cash tax
payments beyond the June 2020 quarter associated with the transition tax are expected to be about $245
million and will be paid out over the next 6 years, including a payment that we made in July 2020 of $23.2
million. We have posted a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations
page of our website.

Our inventory balance at June 30, 2020, was $657.2 million. We had 117 days of inventory at the end
of the June quarter, which was down 5 days from the prior quarter's levels and right in the middle of our
publicly-stated inventory target of 115 to 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the June quarter were
30 days compared to 29 days at the end of March. We believe distribution inventory levels for Microchip
are still low compared to the historical range we have experienced over the past 10 years, which is
between 27 and 47 days.

The cash flow from operating activities was $501.8 million in the June quarter. As of June 30, the
consolidated cash and total investment position was $380.2 million. We paid down $394 million of total
debt in the June quarter. And over the last 8 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and
incurred over $8 billion of debt to do so, we have paid down $2.62 billion of debt and continue to allocate
substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have
accomplished this despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we
feel is a testimony to the cash generation capabilities of our business as well as our ongoing operating
discipline. We continue to expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over the next several years.

Our adjusted EBITDA in the June quarter was $562.2 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA
was $2.154 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible debt that
matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.24 at the end of June 2020, down from 4.46 at
the end of March 2020.

Our dividend payment in the June quarter was $90.4 million.

Capital expenditures were $9.5 million in the June 2020 quarter. We expect about $15 million in capital
spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to be between $50
million and $70 million. We continue to add capital to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing
operations, support the production capabilities for new products and technologies as well as to selectively
bring in-house some of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect these
capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the
outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.

Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $41.1 million.

I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June
quarter. Ganesh?

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

Great. Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start by taking a closer look at
microcontrollers. In a weak macro environment, our microcontroller business performed better than
we expected. On a GAAP basis, our microcontroller revenue was sequentially down 1.3% as compared
to the March quarter, while from an end-market demand standpoint, our microcontroller business was
sequentially down 2.8%.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

On a GAAP year-over-year basis, our microcontroller business was up 1.2%. We continue to introduce a
steady stream of innovative new microcontroller solutions, including the industry's smallest automotive-
grade maxTouch controller family, the first functional safety-ready AVR microcontroller family with a
peripheral touch controller, the Switchtec advanced fabric generation -- generation 4 PCIe Switch family,
which enables complex fabric topologies with greater scalability, lower latency and higher performance
and traditional PCIe switches. And last but not least, the Adaptec SmartRAID 3100E RAID, which stands
for redundant array of inexpensive disks adapters designed to provide reliable hardware rate protection
for customer data in cost-sensitive end applications that require no power and high performance.
Microcontrollers overall represented 54.9% of our end-market demand in the June quarter.

Now moving to analog. On a GAAP basis, our analog revenue was sequentially up 0.7% as compared to
the March quarter. While from an end-market standpoint, our analog business was sequentially down
0.7%. In both scenarios, our analog business performed better than we expected in the midst of a weak
macro environment.

On a GAAP year-over-year basis, our analog business was down 4.2%. During the quarter, we continued
to announce and introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products, including an expanded portfolio
of over 25 transient voltage suppressor vertical rays and a 32 channel, high-voltage analog multiplexion,
further enabling miniaturization of medical ultrasound applications. Analog represented 28.1% of our end-
market demand in the June quarter.

Our FPGA revenue, on a GAAP basis, was down 10.3% sequentially as compared to the March quarter.
From an end-market demand standpoint, our FPGA business was sequentially down 6.5%.

Our FPGA business in the June quarter had one significant aerospace customer who were shut down hard
due to COVID-19 restrictions for pretty much the entire quarter, resulting in lower-than-expected results.
Despite this customer being unlikely to resume production in the September quarter, we are expecting the
FPGA business to sequentially grow meaningfully in the September quarter.

On a GAAP year-over-year basis, our FPGA business was down 4.6%.

During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative FPGA products, including
the vector blocks accelerator software development kit, which enables developers to take advantage of
Microchip's all fire FPGAs to easily create low-power neuro network applications. FPGA represented 6.7%
of our end-market demand in the June quarter.

Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was flat as compared to the
March quarter from an end-market demand standpoint. During the quarter, we introduced a new Phase
Noise Analyzer, designed for engineers and scientists who rely on precise and accurate measurements
of frequency signals generated for 5G networks, data centers, commercial and military aircraft systems,
space vehicle, communication satellite and metrology applications. LMO represented 10.4% of our end-
market demand in the June quarter.

An update regarding coronavirus and its impact on our operations. Most of our nonfactory employee base
continues to work from home. Our global teams have been highly engaged, collaborative and productive
under the circumstances, resulting in strong customer engagement for new designs and effectiveness
in our new product development programs. We would like to thank our teams worldwide for adapting
as needed to changing conditions while continuing to deliver results. Our manufacturing operations,
especially those in the Philippines and our outsourced partners in Malaysia, worked through various
constraints throughout the June quarter and delivered increased output as reflected in our better-than-
expected results.

By the end of the June quarter, we had dug out of most of the delinquencies in our shipments that
accumulated in April and May when unpredictable constraints from government mandates were in effect.
Our customers and our supply chain partners also endure some constraints of their factories and logistics,
primarily during the month of April and May. As we progress through May and June, we experienced many
short lead time orders from customers, some of which we could not support in the quarter, primarily
due to 3 factors: First, customers whose business has strengthened due to COVID-19 conditions like

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

from work-from-home initiatives and medical devices; second, the partial recovery in May and June of
some customers' business, which experienced a sharp decline in the March-April time frame, automotive
being the biggest example of that in some industrials; and third, an unrealistic expectations from some
customers that orders placed with short lead time can be supported by the slack in the supply chain.

We are working with our customers to improve the visibility of their backlog so that we may serve them
better. Given the current market dynamics, we are providing some qualitative insights into our principal
end markets.

Now before we provide commentary for the June quarter, we would first like to share with you our best
estimate for our fiscal year '20 revenue by end market. With over 120,000 customers served by Microchip
and given the complexity of our customer base, it is laborious to collect this data and we only do so every
few years. We remind you that this data is only estimated, and it is not something we can track with high
accuracy.

Based on our analysis done in the June quarter for the fiscal year '20 revenue, industrial remained our
largest end market of 28% of revenue. Computing and data center was next at 18% of revenue; followed
by automotive, 15% of revenue. Communications at 14% of revenue, consumer at 13%; and finally,
aerospace and defense at 12% of revenue.

With that backdrop to provide context, here are some end-market trend insights for the June quarter
that we'd like to share with you. Data center and computing continued to show strength from the shift to
work-from-home requirements. However, we anticipate that these segments may revert to more normal
demand patterns in the coming months as the search requirements start to dissipate.

Automotive car sales and production in China recovered nicely to grow sequentially and year-over-year,
benefiting our China automotive business. Our automotive business everywhere else had a very poor
quarter as April and May were adversely impacted by widespread automotive factory shutdowns. We
began to see recovery in June and believe that the worst for automotive is behind us.

Medical devices necessary to treat COVID patients, like ventilators, respirators, oxygen monitors, portable
ultrasound machines, they were all strong. In addition to a host of other hospital equipment needed
for increased patient loads, medical devices for elective procedures such as hearing aids, pacemakers,
defibrillators, some of the large ultrasound MRI machines, those experienced a slowdown as individuals
and hospitals delayed elective procedures.

Even within the broad-based industrial and consumer markets, which were generally weak, we did see
pockets of strength related to COVID-19. In consumer, the strengths that are related to gaming, home
improvement and hobbyist projects for people shelter at home. In industrial, the strengths were related
to UV disinfection system, air filtration systems, infrared temperature scanners and a generally increasing
trend towards touch rate controllers.

Let me now pass it to Steve for comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the
fiscal first quarter of 2021, I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2021.

The June quarter demonstrated what the best of Microchip culture and its people represent. Our global
team of operations, business units, sales and marketing and support groups all came together in the
middle of a global pandemic, while working with a pay-cut and delivered a superb quarter. I'm proud of
how rapidly the Microchip team adapted to the new constraints we faced so that our employees would be
safe, our customers could be well served and our supply chain partners engaged to help ensure mutual
success despite the challenges we faced.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic challenges, we delivered net sales of $1.31 billion that was down only
1.3%, sequentially and down only 1% from the year ago quarter. Our original net sales guidance was

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

to be down 6% sequentially at the midpoint. In early June, we revised it to be down 3% sequentially at
the midpoint, and we ended at down only 1.3% sequentially. These are exceptional results against the
backdrop of simultaneous supply and demand dislocations.

We also delivered outstanding non-GAAP gross margin of 61.7%, 90 basis points above the midpoint
of our original guidance from May 7, 2020, and non-GAAP operating margin of 38.6%, 260 basis points
above the midpoint of our original guidance. And we did all this while reducing our days of inventory from
122 days to 117 days. I am particularly proud of producing 38.6% operating margin at near the bottom of
the business cycle amidst a global pandemic.

Our consolidated non-GAAP EPS was $1.56, $0.21 above the midpoint of our original guidance and $0.12
above the midpoint of our revised guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 119th consecutive
profitable quarter.

In the June quarter, we paid down $394 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of
June 2018 has been about $2.62 billion, bringing our net leverage ratio down to 4.24. The pace of debt
payments has been strong despite the weak and uncertain business conditions, underlying the strong
-- underlining the strong cash generation characteristics of our business as well as our active efforts to
continue to squeeze working capital efficiencies.

Now I will discuss our guidance for the September quarter. After a strong March and April, our bookings
were soft in May and June. But the bookings we received in May and June had a much higher mix of
near-term requirements as the customers and distributors did not have the visibility to place longer-term
orders. While the near-term aged to bookings filled up the June quarter, it left the September quarter
backlog on July 1, 2020, to be down 8% compared to the backlog for June quarter on April 1, 2020.

We also left a large amount of backlog unsupported out of the June quarter because those requirements
came inside of our lead time, and we were not able to ship them according to customer request aids. This
all prompted us to write a letter to our customers and distributors, first informing them of the business
environment and our cycle time to build their products. Then we ask them to place at least 12 weeks
of backlog for their requirements. We also informed our customers and distributors that if they ask for
expediting of an order, we would need to charge an expedite service fee given the disruptive nature of
such orders. Through the letter, we are just trying to encourage customers to give us more visibility so
that we can better meet their requirements. The expedite charges have never been material in terms of
our overall revenue.

With another month under our belt now since the letter, we have seen some of the customers and
distributors respond. The rate of bookings has increased. Our backlog for the September quarter is
still well below the backlog for June quarter at the same point in time, but we believe that the stronger
bookings now compared to weak bookings of May and June will continue to improve the September
quarter backlog compared to June quarter.

From an end market standpoint, as you heard during Ganesh's remarks, we have several cross-currents,
contributing strengths and weaknesses at the same time. The common denominator among them is
whether COVID-19 was a tailwind or a headwind during the quarter for a given end market. The diversity
of our end-market exposure, which we consider to be a strength, gives us the ability to capitalize on
whatever strength there are during challenging market conditions.

Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect our net sales for September quarter to be between
flat to down 8% sequentially. A relatively broad guidance range is to help account for the lack of visibility
and uncertainty associated with the evolving COVID-19 situation. Based on the much better-than-
expected financial results in the June quarter, we gave our employees half of their June quarter salary
sacrifice back in the form of a bonus. However, we have maintained the salary cuts in the September
quarter due to continued uncertainty.

Our inventory at 117 days is now right in the middle of our 115 to 120 days target. Hence, we are also
adjusting the factory schedules and removing the rotating time off.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

For September quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 61.2% and 62.2% of sales.
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 23.2% and 24.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP
operating profit percentage to be between 37% and 39% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per
share to be between $1.30 per share to $1.52 per share.

We also expect to pay down another approximately $300 million of our debt in the September quarter.
We believe that despite the near-term pandemic-driven challenges, we are confident in the strength
and diversity of the businesses and end markets we are in to achieve long-term growth in excess of the
average semiconductor market growth.

Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles,
restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance
and track its results on non-GAAP basis except for net sales, which will be on GAAP basis. We believe that
GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts
continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Steve, I think you mentioned bookings somewhat improved in July. Historically, what do August and
September bookings do? And what are your assumptions in giving guidance for this quarter? Are you
assuming that the bookings trend kind of stays where it is? Does it get better? Does it get worse? I'm just
trying to frame the guidance versus some historical trends and what your assumptions are for what the
environment does in the remaining months of the quarter?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So Vivek, first thing I would say is that you should not really be looking at any past trends because this
is just not a normal environment. Our bookings and backlogs and expedites and customer requests are
really all driven by end market by end market, what the effect of COVID-19 is and what the visibility of the
customers and distributors are. So really just absolutely -- bookings in a quarter would be stronger if you
go into it with a weaker backlog, and the bookings often will be -- in turns would be lower if you have a
strong backlog that all depends on lead time and visibility. So we went into the start of this quarter with
basically -- dramatically decreased visibility by our distributors and customers. Therefore, we started the
quarter with a very, very weak backlog.

If you recall, the June quarter, we started the June quarter on April 1 with a very strong backlog. From
-- coming from March and the turn of China from the new Chinese New Year and all that. And then the
bookings during the June quarter actually declined through May and June, which was a reverse of what
happens in a normal year because June is a very strong quarter and bookings accelerate from April to May
to June, it was totally different this time.

So again, in July, August and September, July bookings were up significantly from the June run rate. June
was very low. And August is just starting, but looking at just a couple of days of bookings for August,
they're also pretty good and even higher than the July average. So our expectation is that August and
September bookings would be strong. And near-term turns still from those bookings will be significant,
which will make up for how the quarter looks against the same point in time versus June. It will improve,
and that's really what is included in our guidance.

Operator

The next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Steve, you said in your prepared comments that backlog heading into September is down about 8% from
the comparable time period heading into the June quarter. But if I go back 90 days ago, you didn't believe
that backlog. And at least your initial guidance for June took a fairly significant haircut to kind of the
backlog and bookings. I'm just kind of curious, can you help us understand relative to the normal backlog
coverage you have to your guide, how does sort of the September guidance look today?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So same thing, John. I think in this pandemic-driven environment, throw all the old graphs away because
you will reach a wrong conclusion. If you recall, on April 1, our backlog was quite strong. And the guidance
we gave -- I think our backlog, Eric, was it up 9%, do I recall it correctly?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

I'd have to go back in a second. I mean our book-to-bill was like 1.17% in the March quarter. And so we
entered with very strong backlog, and then we saw weak bookings and...

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

We had a very strong backlog. And we gave guidance -- original guidance, which was actually to be down
from 2% to 10% or 2% to 12%. So we basically said that the backlog will deteriorate from being up near
9% to down 6%. This is a reverse quarter where the backlog started lower, and it started 8% lower than
April 1. And the midpoint of our guidance is really down -- is down 4%. So this time, we're improving.
We are expecting the backlog to improve in comparison to the last quarter. Why? Because last quarter
bookings declined during the quarter. This quarter, bookings are increasing during the quarter. And it's all
visibility, pandemic, end market-driven, what's happening in automotive, what's happening in data center,
what's happening in others. And there is really no correlation to what happened in the last 5 years. So
throw all seasonality of the past away.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. But Steve, if I could just add on there. We've all struggled. And I think you guys have
internally with all the acquisitions, defining what's normal seasonal. Any update on what you can give us
or what you think a normal seasonal September quarter would look like sequentially?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, first, the environment has to become normal. And we haven't seen normal in the last couple of years
with all the U.S.-China trade sanctions and then the tariffs and now global pandemic. So once we have
to have a stable environment for a year or so to figure out what the new seasonality would be with our
acquisitions. Right now, it would be anybody's guess. And whatever the seasonality would be in future
right now throw that away.

Operator

The next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Steve, I'm going to ask for a clarification as well. I just want to make sure I understand your comments
correctly. So as the last quarter progressed based on what -- how you explained it, it sounds like kind
deteriorated because you had a lot of short lead time orders that were not met. And now heading into the
September quarter, is it fair to assume that those quarters are now -- those quarter are scrub. But then
how to reconcile with the fact that you still had delinquencies that you could not meet. Should they be
coming up in this quarter? I'm just a little bit confused on trying to reconcile all your comments on the
short lead time orders and the booking trends? That made sense that as the quarter progressed, bookings
deteriorated, but then what about the shorter lead time orders that you could not meet in the last quarter?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, let me see if I can clear some of the confusion. So we started the June quarter with a fairly strong
backlog, I recall up 9% or so, and Eric correct that. And then we got reasonable bookings in April. So
April was a good month. So it was still looking good. But bookings slowed down significantly in May and
then dramatically so in June. So June was even lower than May. And the bookings were so low that if our
orders from those bookings were normally aged in terms of near term and outer term, the quarter would
have been very low. But the percentage of bookings that aged into the quarter were quite high. And even

though we were not able to meet some of the bookings, some of those orders because of shortly timed,
we still beat the quarter. From an original guidance of minus 6% at the midpoint, we came in at minus
1.3%, which means we did meet a lot of the orders, but we still left a large and delinquent. And whatever
was delinquent last quarter will get shipped this quarter. But since the bookings were so near term, we
started the quarter still very much on the whole, down 8% from last quarter.

And now the bookings are strengthening, bookings have largely -- the slope of the bookings have been
higher. Day after day bookings are increasing all through July. And therefore, the backlog versus the same
point in time has improved somewhat, but there is a lot more to go. And we think at the rate the bookings
are now and continuing to increase. The shipments will improve from the minus 8% at the start of the
quarter to minus 4% at the midpoint that we're guiding to. Does that make sense now?

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

It does, Steve. If I just could ask one more clarification. Does that mean then that the visibility as you
stand today is better than what it was at the same point in the prior quarter?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

I don't think visibility is any better. I think visibility is very low that's why it's improved from May and
June. But it isn't improved from March and April. I think March and April were very strong bookings.
People had -- China had just come back from Chinese New Year, and everybody is expecting a quick end
to the pandemic. So there were a lot of bookings. People do want to get quite short. And the pandemic
has went longer and longer and longer. And now there is no end inside, nobody knows what's happening.
In many states, it's reemerging. Some countries are still going higher every week. So now the customers
and distributors are not giving long-term orders. It's slightly better than it was in May and June. As I
described, the bookings are higher, and we believe it may continue to improve in August and September.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

I'm just going to add on to what Steve said there, just to confirm that the 9% that he is quoting in terms
of our opening backlog entering the June quarter, that is the accurate number for comparison purposes
compared to the minus 8% or down 8% heading into the September quarter.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So that's a good comparison where June quarter started up 9%, and September quarter is starting down
8%. And the June quarter deteriorated -- I'm sorry, improved from minus 9% to minus 1.3%. And we
believe that this quarter will also improve from -- this quarter will go the other way. It will go from minus
8% to minus 4% that we're guiding to.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Right. Just to clarify that statement. We entered the June quarter with backlog being up 9%, and it
deteriorated to the point where we finished the quarter and down 1.3%.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Correct.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Steve, just a question, just from a geographic perspective. The initial growth was driven by China,
and as you mentioned, coming back from China New Year. Do you think some of the China strength is
sustainable? And then also, how are you feeling about other geographies, like Europe and North America?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Ganesh, you want to take that?

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

Yes. So China was certainly stronger last quarter than we expected. But China doesn't live in isolation.
China is affected by how other parts of the world do. And so as we go into the September quarter, it is still
doing well, but we anticipate that weakness in Europe, weakness in Americas would have some impact on
China, and that's all baked into the guidance that we have built.

Operator

The next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

Harsh V. Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Steve, so I'm going to ask about what everybody else is talking about. So it sounds like there's good
demand, but sounds like towards the end of last quarter, you saw short-term demand, but now you're
seeing the customer pivot completely, and they are starting to place orders. So my question to you, as
you guys talked, you guys do a great job. You've got lots of customers. You do a good job keeping up with
them. What do you think is making the customer flip in this manner?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

I think it's all COVID-19. Customers are not sure. There is a resurgence of COVID in certain countries and
certain states in the United States. Customers and distributors have low backlog from their end customers,
and our direct customers are not really sure what the run rate would be. So we're getting frequent orders
for short-term delivery that they have the demand today, and they need to build a product to deliver to
their customer, but they do not know whether that is sustainable in September, in October, in November.
So we're getting -- we're not getting as many longer-term orders to fill the pipeline. But we're getting
enough orders to have the strong billings as we go.

As we saw last quarter, there was enough strength in short-term orders that the billings was good and
we ended fairly good and for all we know that could happen this quarter. But we can't say with certainty
today with our backlog being low compared to same point last quarter, we could get enough turn to fill the
quarter. But there is lack of visibility, therefore, we can't guide with that certainty.

Harsh V. Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Fair enough, Steve. And for my follow-up, your revenues are down quite a bit based on your guidance, but
your margin is pretty steady, pretty stable sequentially. Just curious if you have any thoughts on that?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, so you should look at the results and look at it a little bit year-over-year. So when you look at
it year-over-year, will be kind of much more in the pack overall in the semiconductors. And actually,
year-over-year guidance for September is better than really most of our microcontroller and analog

competitors. So everybody's seasonality is different. Our automotive business is only about -- Ganesh, is it
12% now?

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

It's probably 13%, 14% after the last quarter.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Yes. So our automotive business is about 13%, 14% of our business. And some of our competitors, it's
40%, 45%. So they took a much larger hit when the automotive went down. Automotive was down 40%
or so in the industry last quarter. And so they are seeing a much larger recovery. Our business, we're
seeing a similar recovery, but being only 13%, 14% of our business, this impact will be lower. So we did
better last quarter. This quarter, we're doing worse sequentially. But if you look at year-over-year, our
results are better than all of our larger competitors, TI assays and others.

And as far as the question on the margin is concerned, I mean margin, there have been a lot of moving
parts, internalization, more advanced-process technologies, some restructuring of our factories, we
have talked about before. So lots of things we have brought to bear, where there's been a tailwind on
the margins and this is really the best gross margin and operating margin performance of any cycle at
Microchip because driven by all these self-health kind of things we have done. And when this business
recovers and goes back to new record on the top line, I think you will see record growth in operating
margins.

The next question will come from Shawn Harrison with Loop Capital.

Shawn Matthew Harrison
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Just a quick clarification and then a follow-up. What was the underutilization in the charge this quarter,
Eric?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

The underutilization was about $13.9 million. That's right in line with what it was in the March quarter. So
flat sequentially.

Shawn Matthew Harrison
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

And then Steve, to kind of beat the dead horse on the demand environment. But are there end markets
where you're seeing sharper contractions in demand? We know automotive production will be up sharply
in the September quarter, but where are you seeing maybe a contraction or more volatility in kind of the
bookings rate, if you could give an end market perspective, that would be helpful.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Ganesh? I'll give it to Ganesh.

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

So in my prepared remarks, I gave you some flavor of by different end markets what are we seeing in the
June quarter. And I think as time goes on, some of these are going to start reverting to normal, which we
think, for example, data center and work-from-home-related items. You don't need to continue to be at
a high level once you've gotten past the first several months of buying which you need. And then those

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

that were below in the initial phases, like automotive and industrials, should be the ones that begin to
recover. We've already seen the automotive parts put a bottom in the June quarter. And we're expecting
September to be good, and we're expecting December to be good. And likewise, in some of the other
segments.

So medical was another example where some parts of medical did really well because of COVID-related
items. Other parts -- the elective parts got pushed out because people are not willing to go out of their
homes or go set up consults for what was elected. Elective will come back. You can't push it out forever.
And so that will be -- in general, I think the places that will recur as time goes on will be the ones that
have more strength. And some of the things that were stronger could revert back to normal in the coming
months.

The next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to start with some questions for Eric. I wanted to ask about OpEx. It looks like for your guidance
and what you deliver for the first quarter, you're somewhere just south of $300 million per quarter, that's
down, I believe, more than 10% from last year. How much of that is the salary cuts and various other
OpEx decreases like lower travel? I'm just trying to get a sense of what oral might look like for you guys
on the OpEx side once things begin to turn out?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

So the salary cuts when at the levels we implemented, we quantified those last quarter as being about a
$21 million per quarter run rate that pulled out. And Stephen talked about us giving some of that back to
employees this last quarter is because the results were really quite good.

Things like travel, we haven't quantified them, but they are pretty significant. And what I would say
with that, I think some of that is probably more permanent than temporary. I think as we've adjusted
from working from home throughout the organization in the different functions, people will become very
effective in doing that. And I think overall, travel, although it will come back to a higher level, some of that
is going to be permanent savings.

So I think we're managing the operating expenses very tightly in the environment that we're in. And the
employees are doing a good job of managing that for the environment. But overall, we've taken out a
lot of costs. But as the business improves, some of those costs in terms of the salary cuts and some of
the bonuses returning to a higher level, they absolutely will come back to the P&L, and we'll manage that
appropriately given where top line growth is.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. A follow-up I wanted to ask about the debt structure. You guys refinanced and extended the
maturity of a pretty hefty amount of your debt. It looks like as a result, your net interest expense, the
new norm might be substantially lower. Can you speak to what the new norm may look like for net
interest expense and as well, given the low interest rate environment that we're in, what the additional
opportunities might be to draw down your cost of capital?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. So we were active in the debt capital markets in the quarter. We issued $2.2 billion of senior secured
notes and paid off a bridge loan, paid off some of our converts and then use the remaining funds to pay
off amounts over a line of credit. The guidance that you'll see in our guidance table in the press release
for other expense, which is most of that is interest expense is about $78 million on a non-GAAP basis for

15

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

the quarter. And that's a pretty good run rate since all these debt transactions had occurred last quarter
and are factored into that guidance. And obviously, we're using a significant amount of the cash that we're
generating to pay down debt, everything really beyond the dividend payment.

And so as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks that in the current quarter, we expect to pay down
another $300 million of debt. So that is coming down nicely. We've done some nice things to remove some
of the dilution that comes from those convertibles that we've retired from the structure, and we're pretty
happy with the transactions that we executed both in the March quarter and the June quarter. And that
ongoing run rate is probably about $78 million, and that will reduce as the interest expense comes down
through debt repayments.

[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Just a couple of clarifications here. Your revenue guidance is suggesting about a 6% year-on-year decline
with all of the puts and takes that we've talked about. Do you think that down 6% a year is an accurate
reflection of what your customers' consumption really is? Is that sort of the baseline that we should be
using here? And as we look forward into the December quarter, based on what you're seeing in bookings,
does that provide you with any degree of confidence that we'd see a sequential increase as we go into
December? Or is that just too tough to call given the short nature of the orders that you're receiving now?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

I'll take the first part of that question. I think the revenue based on selling that we report, we also tell
you the end-market demand number, which is based on sell-through, they're not that far apart now.
Those 2 numbers have come really fairly well together. They were wide apart when we were correcting for
inventory 2 years ago. So if we're down 6% in September quarter guidance versus September quarter of
last year that basically represents the market demand today. So that was the first part of your question.

The second part was, what do we expect for September? Is that what you're trying to say?

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Yes. And given the fact it sounded like the orders improved in July, I suppose that some of that's going
into the December quarter. But you also mentioned that the order rates were -- the order -- the aging of
the orders was very short. So perhaps you're not getting the same visibility you're getting this now that
you would in a typical quarter, and perhaps that makes it more difficult to call.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So I would say, in this kind of environment, we can barely call September. We can't really call December. It
will depend on what happens on the COVID situation. Does the vaccine come out, do those fears go away,
does everybody go back to work, all factories remain open, schools open. There is a lot of ground to cover
between now and October before the December quarter starts. So I would say -- I'm not willing to say
much about December yet.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

You might have answered this in the past question, but just to kind of repeat. So as we entered into
the June quarter, we saw kind of a dramatic reversal, plus 9% going to minus 1.3%. And as we go into
September, we're seeing a reversal in the other direction, going from minus 8% to about minus 4%.
And so those reversals, either positive or negative, if you were to sum it up, it's primarily based on just
complete lack of visibility that your customers are getting and basically operating on very short lead
times?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

It's basically there. We serve 6, 7 markets. Every end market is affected differently by COVID-19.
Automotive being the worst and industrial being next. And on the other hand, the best market was a data
center and medical and some of the work-from-home computing and all that. So each market is affected
very differently by COVID-19. And backlog almost by those end markets, how the customers are behaving
is quite different. And I think it's really basically all driven by that. So what we are seeing today is the
bookings today are not bad to really what we need to ship this week and next week and next week. But
we're not getting back in May and June. We were not getting enough bookings for August and September
and October.

So today, we've seen good booking for -- in July, we got good bookings for July, August and September,
but not enough yet for the next quarter. So as we proceed in the quarter, especially when we are in
August and September, not only we need to get the bookings to fill the August and September there has
a role in it, we also got to get enough bookings. So on October 1, we start the next quarter correctly.
And December quarter is also front-end loaded usually because December is a short month because of all
the holidays. And it's really just COVID-19 is controlling the people's emotions and purchasing managers
habits and everything else.

Rajvindra S. Gill
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

And for my follow-up, in terms of the gross margin, so with revenue being down 4% sequentially, gross
margins are holding flat sequentially despite revenue declining, even though data center is appearing to
kind of revert back to normal patterns. I'll presume data center might be a higher gross margin product.
So can you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes in terms of the mix shift that's happening,
utilization rates that are happening? Why is margins being flat, which is a good thing despite revenue
coming down?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So Eric, do you want to take that one?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. I can. So just maybe start by just reiterating that, we're pretty proud about how the gross margins
have held up. And the last couple of years, we've experienced of the various things of China trade and
now COVID. And even with our $13.9 million underutilization charge, still posted 61.7% gross margin this
last quarter. So there's always things with product mix that impact gross margins, utilization levels and
all those things. But we see pretty good stability this quarter. The midpoint of guidance, as you said, is
flat sequentially. And we've given a little bit broader range of gross margin guidance than we normally
do, between 61.2% and 62.2%, so 1% range there. But we've got a pretty wide range of revenue also
that we're guiding to between flat and down 8%. So lots of puts and takes, but we're continuing to do
all the right things to keep costs under control, bring things in-house where we can to improve the cost
structure and gross margin, I think, is really kind of highlighting this cycle in terms of how well they've
been maintained.

The next question will come from William Stein with Forest Securities (sic) [ SunTrust ].

William Stein
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Steve, in the press release and in the comments that you made in your prepared remarks today, you seem
to attribute the slower pace of bookings, at least partly to resurgence in COVID. And I think what some
investors are concerned about is that instead, the slowdown may be related to customers having over
ordered in the recent past, Microchip's delivery gets that and then customers have to digest it. Meanwhile,
you seem to have had some pretty deep conversations with customers to figure out sort of end-market
expectations for the full year. So I'm wondering if perhaps do you have a sense from those discussions,
what customer inventory levels are like now? It seems to me if they're ordering on very short lead times,
they're probably ordering for production and not for safety stock, but any insight in this regard would
really helpful.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, we are -- we do business with 120,000 customers and long-tail well over 100,000 of them buy
from hundreds of our distributors around the world. We're not aware of any broad-based holding of
inventory by our customers, and our distributor inventories are still in the range of being 15-year lows.
With, again, 120,000-plus end customers, we're really not able to assess the inventory situation in each
one of our customers, but we have a generally good sense of the inventory in the market. We've done a
good job of keeping our lead time short and maintaining our delivery performance at a reasonable level.
If the customers were -- had hold inventory in the prior quarter or so, we wouldn't be getting so many
short-term requests. And in some cases, customers are paying expedite charge to get those parts. And
there's no reason customers will be paying expedite charges to get the parts if they didn't need them
for production. And in many cases, we are delivering right on the factory floor. They are short-circuiting
shipment methods and, hey, drop it on my floor because there are lines-down situation. So if anything,
inventory is not high out there, inventory is low.

that's done over the last few quarters?

Eric, do you have that?

James Eric Bjornholt

consumption and some of that comes back to the Americas or Europe for consumption, but it's in that
21%, 22% range.

Stephen Sanghi

COVID-19 situation improved in China, and business activities supporting local consumption appear to be
much more normal in China.

Harlan Sur
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

In response to the muted demand environment back in the June quarter, you guys did cut back the
number of manufacturing hours for your fab employees in your 2 U.S. fabs. I think it was -- it went
from like 11 -- it went from like a 13-week work week -- work quarter to like an 11-week work quarter.
With the demand trends being muted, are you guys continuing to drive an 11-week manufacturing work
quarter? Or are you guys taking down work hours and utilizations further here in the September quarter?
And then just as a follow-up, it looks like Philippines is reimposing some of the regional lockdowns and a
resurgence of COVID-19. Is this having an impact on the Philippines test operations?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So I'll take that first part of the question. I think you may have missed the commentary earlier, but I did
say in my remarks that actually our inventory last quarter came down to 117 days from the 120 days
before. Remember, we went into the quarter guiding to be down minus 6%. So if we were down minus
6%, our inventory would have gone up, which we did not want. So we put the rotating time off in the
factory, at least in the 2 largest fabs to really have operators take some time off. And so we did better in
revenue with only being down minus 1.3%, and we cut back on the production. So the combined effect of
that was our inventory actually came down.

So with the 117 days inventory, we have now adjusted the factory schedule where we're no longer
working the rotating time off in those 2 large fabs. There are lots of small, small plants we inherited from
Microsemi around the world, in Boston, in Ireland, in Germany and other places, those are all small labs,
and each one has their own schedule. Some of them are working short weeks because demand on certain
products is weak. But the big plants are no longer working short hours.

And second part of your question was the Philippines. Ganesh, you want to take that one?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So we did -- we are aware of the adjustments Philippines is making. What we have not given you
much color on is, at the May conference call, I mentioned that we've had people who are effectively living
in the Philippines factory, who run our operations there for a significant portion of certainly, March and
April. And at its peak, we had about 850 employees living in our factory to be able to work around the
constraints. It has come down since then. We still maintain a force of about 300 people that are there.
It gives us that strategic flexibility on any short-term constraints. And so we have planned for where this
might go and what other actions may be taken. And we are not -- unless something different happens
with what we expect is likely to happen, we feel we have the control and what we need to do for keeping
Philippines run.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

So as I mentioned, some of the segments that were strong in the June quarter were driven by the work
from home and medical type of activities, which had very short surge of demand that was acquired. That's
what had us running in the June quarter to try and catch up with a lot of new orders that came in as well.
We are anticipating and the trends we're seeing is some of that surge subsides and demand begins to
revert back to normal at that point in time. So in that sense, I wouldn't call it weak demand, but I would
call it, it doesn't have the surge that the June quarter had required as you continue to go long in time. And
likewise, on the opposite side, some of the things that were really weak, automotive being one example of
that, also begins to correct in the opposite direction where it begins to make up for some of that weakness
as factories run, as demand returns and that product business gets stronger.

Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Got it. And I know you've mentioned not able to meet all the demand coming through, given the short-
term nature of these orders, spurt of orders, I guess. Do you see any risk of losing orders or losing share?
Or just wondering if that's part of it or is it just limited visibility on the part of the customers?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

These are all proprietary products. These aren't product that you switch overnight and go between sources
and all that, so no. We don't see any risk of losing share in what's going on. And as we have said, we're
working constructively with our customers to be -- to try and get the best visibility they have to us as
well and to be able to serve them in order to meet their demand requirements. And so these are short-
term issues caused by the demand and supply shocks in the system, I don't expect these to be long-term
issues.

The next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.

Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

This one's really for Steve. Switching gears, we now have ADI acquiring Maxim. Do you see this changing
anything for the analog market? And what are your feelings generally on consolidation? Do you expect it
to continue at this pace or even accelerate during COVID? And if you had a view of valuations for targets
in the industry right now, that would be appreciated as well.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Okay. Well, thanks for the question. I mean we ourselves do not see any threat from the proposed
acquisition of Maxim by ADI. They are both strong competitors in the analog space, and we compete
against both of them on a regular basis. And when they get combined -- anytime an acquisition happens,
we always see incremental opportunities arise because sometimes the customer wants 2 defense sources
or do on all their business with ADI and Maxim as they become one. So some opportunities appear that
we'll be able to take advantage of it.

In terms of the merger environment, it really -- it looks at times that it could slow down. And if large
acquirers are digesting. At one time, look like it will be difficult to get approvals from China. But then we
got a flurry of approvals. Marvell got approved. IDT got approved. The Mellanox got approved. And now
it is Maxim, and Cyprus got approved. So if China continues to approve these deals and the still acquirers
who are willing to acquire then the consolidation in the industry would continue. I think that's really for
sure.

And the fundamental issue is, if you look at over a long period of time, over the last 20 years, the overall
growth of the semiconductor industry has been low to mid-single digits, and that's a tough environment to
operate in. Every year, people get excited about one thing or the other, but all these various trends have
come in, but a consolidated long-term industry has struggled. And any time an industry struggles on the
top line, then the stronger will acquire, the weaker and consolidation will continue. So that's really my
view on consolidation.

As far as valuation question is concerned, I mean look at the valuation Cyprus went for and Maxim went
for, it just kind of keeps going higher and higher. And I think for most targets, the remaining targets,
their stock price already reflects a significant acquisition premium. But you wouldn't convince their boards
and their management that the acquisition premium is in there, and that's what drives a very, very high
valuation. So that's a problem.

The next question will come from David O'Connor with Exane BNP Paribas.

David O'Connor
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Maybe just a quick follow-up from a previous question. Steve, can you just remind us what the order mix
is? What percentage of orders are typically short lead time versus long lead time, both historically versus
currently? And I've one quick follow-up.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

We don't have that numeric, and I don't think we would be willing to share it. It changes a lot week-
to-week and month-to-month. And it's a very fluid situation when you're working with hundreds of
distributors and 120,000-plus customers. So we wouldn't share that indicator.

David O'Connor
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And as my follow-on. Last quarter, the -- you said with the U.S. Department of
Commerce export ruling, it should be pretty much straightforward for you guys. You called out, I think,
military maybe some attention there. Was there anything that popped up from the implementation that
you went through that was unexpected?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Ganesh, do you want to take that one?

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

Yes. No, there were no issues. There was obviously administrative procedures that need to put in place or
have our partners put in place. And so all of that is done and behind us.

Next question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.

Craig Andrew Ellis
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Nice job on the execution in the quarter. Steve, I wanted to ask a question. I'll start with you and may
ultimately go to Ganesh. But clearly, the company has executed a number of things tactically with COGS
management and OpEx management to really protect margin leverage at historically high levels through
last year's and now this year's crises. The question is, as we look ahead and think about things that the
company might be doing that are those ongoing continuous efforts to drive structural improvement in

both, COGS and OpEx versus some of the things that will have some unwind employees going back to full
salaries eventually as demand normalizes. How do we think about the gives and takes there? And maybe
Ganesh, if you can just list for us what some of the key longer-term drivers for costs reduction and OpEx
optimization are, that would be helpful.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Go ahead, Ganesh, if you want to take that.

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

So obviously, there are some costs that are short-term costs that we have taken out, you've listed many
of them, Eric commented on one by one. And as we see revenue return, you should expect that some
of those costs will come back. And historically, we have been disciplined about how we bring back some
of these costs as revenue returns. And you can go back and look at other cycles in terms of how -- as a
percentage of revenue, we manage our operating expenses.

I think one thing which we will do different as we come out of this is also look at what have we learned
out of this crisis in terms of managing more effectively from an operating expense standpoint. And there,
we will get into changes in methodology, Eric mentioned to perhaps travel not being as at high rate as we
used to switching to more virtual methods for customer training and a number of other things as well.

And so we are committed to the long-term targets we have, which is to get operating expenses down
into the 23% range. That's part of our 40.5% operating margin target that we're working towards. And
every bit and every quarter, we learn things we can do more effectively, whether it's in research and
development, in sales and marketing or in the overall general and administrative areas that sequentially
brings things a bit by bit down. We have been working on the last bit of the integration for Microsemi,
which is predominantly, at this point, focused on the business process and IT-related items. We're about
9 months away from wrapping that up as the last bits of those get done. So there is constant part of our
DNA that is working on these -- in all 3 areas. And in a crisis, you take some of the best learnings and
make sure you capture them when you get past the crisis.

Operator

The next question will come from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Ganesh, you had mentioned in the prepared comments that you thought FPGAs would be up pretty
significantly in the September quarter. I'm just kind of curious, is that a business that's more exposed to
the auto market? And so what we're seeing is weak June and auto to strong June and September, and
that's driving it? Are there other drivers there? There are, can you kind of enumerate, please?

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

So exposure to automotive for the FPGA business is low at this point. It's one of the things that Microchip
brought to that business with our historical strengths in terms of how we take advantage of each other's
end-market strength. So it's other parts of the market that are responding and providing growth in the
September quarter. And even as we expect that was one large customer that created a down -- a lower
revenue in the June quarter, we don't expect they're going to recover in the September quarter. In spite of
that, we expect that the other improvements we're making in business will more than offset for that in the
September quarter. But it's not automotive.

I'll now turn the conference back over to Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So there is one other indicator I wanted to give you. We haven't planned on it, but I think with all the
questions we got in -- how the bookings happened in last quarter versus what's happening in this quarter.
I'm going to go on the little and give you this number. The July bookings were 15.5% higher than the May
bookings per day -- based on per day. Every month is not the same. There are minor differences. And July,
bookings were 36.6% higher per day than the June bookings. So you could see how last quarter, bookings
were decreasing in May and then really fell precipitously in June, but the bookings were very short-term-
oriented. So we made the code actually beat the guidance in the quarter last quarter, but it started this
quarter in a whole. But now this quarter, July bookings were 15.5% better than May and 36.6% better
than June, that's why we have a confidence that even though we started minus 8%, we're going to end up
a lot better. Hopefully, that helps a little bit.

With that, we'll be attending a number of virtual conferences in the coming days and weeks. And so we'll
talk to some of you in those conferences. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect your lines. Enjoy
