President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, John, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to report we delivered another strong quarter. Our 2
primary businesses achieved impressive top and bottom line, growth and momentum in our Intelligent
Labels platform continues. We are in a higher demand environment that comes at a time of continued and
increasing challenges. The ramping up of COVID infections and restrictions in some countries, continued
supply chain challenges and additional inflationary pressures are taxing the industry, our customers and
our teams. The biggest challenges have been in LGM North America due to raw material shortages and
labor and capacity constraints, and in RBIS Vietnam, where output was significantly constrained in the
quarter due to COVID restrictions.

While we are encouraged by recent trends in these businesses as we've been able to increase output in
recent weeks, the supply chain constraints continue. As for inflation, the pressures continue to increase.
We previously expected some abatement in raw material input costs towards the end of the year, whereas
we now expect additional inflation in Q4 as well as Q1 of next year.

Now for context on the magnitude of the inflation, in our Materials businesses alone, we will be exiting this
year with annualized inflation of more than $600 million. That's a nearly 20% increase, a rate we have
not seen in decades. We are thus in the midst of another round of price increases. Despite these hurdles,
we continue to achieve impressive results. The team is doing a tremendous job managing through these
compounding challenges, focusing on keeping our teams safe and delivering for our customers.

Now a brief recap of the segments. Label and Graphic Materials posted strong top line growth for the
quarter, overcoming the challenges I just highlighted, as demand for consumer packaged goods and e-
commerce trends continue to drive strong volume growth in our Label and Packaging Materials business,
while growth in our Graphic and Reflective Solutions business continues to rebound.

LGM's profitability remained strong, though margins were down from last year due to the increasing
inflationary headwinds and higher costs in the quarter from the supply chain constraints. Given the

increasing inflationary pressures, we have redoubled our efforts on material reengineering and, as I
mentioned previously, are raising prices again.

Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter and continued to
expand margins significantly. The segment grew 22% on a constant currency basis and 14% organically,
driven by strength in both high-value product categories as well as the core apparel business. Impressive
performance despite the significant constraint in South Asia, where we have major manufacturing hubs,
once again demonstrating the advantages of our global manufacturing network.

Intelligent Label sales enterprise-wide were up 15% in the quarter, and we are on track for approximately
30% organic growth for the year versus 2020 and 40% versus 2019, towards the higher end of our long-
term target. As expected, the continued strong growth in our RFID business was primarily driven by
apparel. Applications outside of apparel, particularly food and logistics, grew faster than the average,
though obviously off of a small base. And in Q3, we also closed the acquisition of Vestcom, a business
that further expands our position in high-value categories and has the potential to further advance our
Intelligent Label strategy.

In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales continued to rebound off prior year lows
and were up relative to 2019 by 11% on a constant currency basis. As for margins, they are down as
inflationary pressures [ dipped ] and costs from supply chain disruptions have impacted the segment to a
greater degree than LGM.

Overall, I am pleased with the progress we're making as a company on our long-term strategies while also
executing in the near term. We are providing superior service to our customers despite the challenging
environment, keeping our teams safe and engaged, ramping up investments for the long term and
ensuring we continue to deliver for our shareholders. Given our strong performance in the quarter, we
have raised our outlook for the year, now anticipating earnings growth of roughly 25% over last year's
record and are on track to achieve all of our 5-year company-wide goals that we established in early 2017.

With that, I'll now hand it over to Greg.

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

All right. Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings
per share of $2.14, up 12% over prior year and up 29% compared to 2019, driven by significant revenue
growth and strong margins. Sales were up 17% ex currency and 14% on an organic basis compared to
prior year, driven by strong volume across the portfolio and higher prices. We also delivered strong growth
compared to 2019, with organic sales up 10% versus 2 years ago.

As Mitch mentioned, our supply chains remain tight and input costs have continued to rise. Both
raw material and freight inflation were above our expectations for the quarter, and we've continued
[indiscernible] rise as we enter the fourth quarter. We continue to address the cost increases through a
combination of product reengineering and pricing and have announced additional price increases in most
of our businesses and regions across the world.

Despite the impact of inflation, supply chain disruptions and the headwind of last year's temporary cost
reduction actions, we delivered a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, down 70 basis points from
last year and up 120 basis points compared to 2019.

Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $639 million of free cash flow,
up over $251 million in the third quarter. That's up significantly compared to previous years, driven by
our strong net income growth and working capital productivity. And we closed the Vestcom acquisition in
the quarter for a total purchase price of roughly $1.45 billion. To fund the acquisition, we used the net
proceeds from an $800 million senior note offering in August, along with cash and commercial paper.

Additionally, in the first 3 quarters of the year, we returned a total of $290 million in cash to shareholders
through $164 million in dividends and the repurchase of over 700,000 shares at an aggregate cost of
$126 million. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 at

quarter end, at the bottom end of our long-term target leverage range. This gives us significant capacity
to continue the disciplined execution of our capital allocation strategy.

Now turning to the segment results. Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 15% ex currency and
14% on an organic basis, driven by strong volume and roughly 5 points from higher prices. Compared to
2019, sales were up 11% on an organic basis. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up roughly 15%
organically, with strong volume growth in both the high-value product categories and the base business.

Graphics and Reflective sales were up 11% organically. And looking at the segment's organic sales growth
in the quarter by region, North America sales were up low double digits despite raw material availability
challenges that have continued to create extended lead times. Western Europe grew more than 20%,
partially due to easier comps given the impact of the pandemic we saw in Q3 last year. With that said,
the business was still up double digits versus 2019. And overall, emerging market sales were up low
double digits in the quarter with double-digit growth in both ASEAN and Latin America and mid-single-digit
growth in China.

While LGM's profitability remained strong, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from last year to 15.9%.
This was partially driven by the increased inflationary pressures and the impact of supply constraints,
which led to some incremental costs in the quarter such as expedited freight and overtime to minimize
disruptions to customers. And as you know, our goals are to deliver GDP-plus growth and top quartile
returns on capital with a focus on driving EVA.

Our approach to price increases and material reengineering is designed to do just that as we look to offset
higher material costs on a dollar basis by the end of an inflationary cycle. However, the revenue base from
such price increases alone, especially at the magnitude we are seeing in the back half of this year, reduces
operating margin on a percentage basis with no impact to returns. This pricing impact led to a reduction in
operating margin by roughly 0.75% in the third quarter.

Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 22% ex currency and 14%
on an organic basis, as growth remains strong in both the high-value categories and the base business,
due in part to lower prior year comps. Compared to 2019, organic growth was up 9%. The apparel
business saw a particular strength in the performance and premium channels and continued double-digit
growth in external embellishments.

As Mitch mentioned, Intelligent Label sales were up organically, roughly 15%, and up about 40%
compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 13.8% as the benefits from
higher volume and productivity more than offset the headwinds from prior year temporary cost reduction
actions, higher employee-related costs and growth investments. The RBIS team is continuing to deliver in
this high-growth, high-margin business.

Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased 20% ex currency and 15%
on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in both the industrial and health care categories. Compared
to 2019, sales were up 6% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating margin decreased to roughly 10%, as
the benefit from higher volume was more than offset by the net impact of pricing, higher freight and raw
material costs and higher employee-related costs. Freight in particular had an outsized impact on IHM in
the quarter, given the significant increases in global shipping costs.

Now shifting to our outlook for 2021. We have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be
between $8.80 and $8.95, a roughly $0.08 increase to the midpoint of the range. And we now anticipate
roughly 15% organic sales growth for the full year, at the high end of our previous range, reflecting strong
volume growth and the impact from higher prices.

We've outlined some of the key -- the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 12 of our
supplemental presentation materials. In particular, the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of
2020 and the resulting calendar shift will be a headwind to reported sales growth of roughly 8 points in
the fourth quarter this year, with a roughly $0.30 EPS headwind. The anticipated tailwind from currency
translation is now $30 million in operating income for the full year based on current rates. Most of this
benefit came in the first half and will thus create a headwind as we go into 2022 if rates stay where

they are now. And we expect a modest EPS benefit from Vestcom in 2021, net of purchase accounting
amortization, which we estimate to be nearly $60 million on an annualized basis and net of financing
costs. We're to target over $700 million of free cash flow this year, up significantly from previous years.

In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in a challenging environment, and we remain on track to
deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital, which
together drives sustained growth in EVA.
We will now open up the call for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I guess starting with RBIS and some of the production issues, a lot of your customers have talked
about on the consumer side in Vietnam and just Southeast Asia more broadly. How are you sort of able
to navigate through that dynamic? Do you start to see sort of a flex across your different production
footprints, et cetera, as order flow moved? Or just more insight on that dynamic would be helpful.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Absolutely, Ghansham. So it's exactly what you just said. So it was -- Vietnam is what's getting a lot
of the press and headlines that definitely had the biggest impact. But throughout the pandemic, there's
actually been different regions that have been impacted more than others, and we've been flexing the
global manufacturing network to help offset that. And so specifically here, if you're asking about Vietnam,
we're able to leverage specifically China to be able to service that demand in Vietnam.

Still impacted growth by a couple of points overall. Question is, how much of that is just end demand
that won't happen now because the retailers and apparel brand owners won't be able to fulfill more end
consumer demand or not. But it had an impact of a couple of points is what we estimate, but we were able
to -- it would have been larger than that had we not sourced from China.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. And then just for my second question on inflation. I mean inflation has been building all year for
many different supply chains, including yours. I guess what surprised you incrementally over the past 3
months, which specific categories and which regions are you seeing the most inflation? And also, did 3Q
benefit from any sort of material prebuy as customers kind of positioned for these incremental inflation?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Ghansham. Overall, I think we've seen inflation continue to increase really across the
category. So I don't think it's mirrored in, in 1 particular place. We've seen chemicals, adhesives, and
film and resin components continue to increase. And then I think in the third quarter, as we expected, we
started to see some increase in paper, particularly in Europe. So I think we've seen the acceleration in the
third quarter and into the fourth quarter here really across the different component categories.

I think the biggest regions where we're seeing the largest inflation is probably both in North America and
Europe, and North America really started late last year. As you recall, with some of the chemical increases
and that's continued to grow as we moved through this year and then Europe continued shortly after that
with paper really kicking in here in the third quarter. It's been the biggest sequential increase.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

And as far as prebuys, on your question on that, we didn't see -- we don't really detect much prebuys in
the Q3 from Q4. We did accelerate and get a bit more benefit from pricing in the quarter purely because
we just accelerated some actions there. As we look at within Q4, it's hard to get a good read on the fourth
quarter just because of the price increases we've announced in some regions for November 1, which
is causing some prebuys here in October, but it doesn't have any inter-quarter movements, if you will,
Ghansham.

Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Is there a way to think about the time line for possibly rebalancing price/cost in LGM based on the
commodity inflation you're seeing and the pricing actions you've taken? And then just understanding the
market is extremely dynamic, and it's tough to say, is there anything that you could say about how your
LGM market share position has maybe fared in the current environment?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So on your first question, Anthony, I think when we look at a quarter ago, I think our communication
to you was that we thought, by the end of the year, we'd be looking to close the price inflation gap
essentially, and we've continued to see accelerating inflation. So we're looking at somewhere kind of low
to mid-single-digit further inflation from Q3 to Q4. And now we're implementing additional pricing actions.

So I think our view is that it takes us a few months, 3 to 4 months to pass pricing or reengineer some
materials to take cost out to manage the inflation. So when we start to see inflation stabilize 3 or 4
months after that is probably when we expect to be able to cover that on an ongoing basis.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

And from your share question, so overall, markets remain relatively strong in North America and Europe.
And from a share [indiscernible] pretty stable. We don't have share data yet on the most recent. We
think it's relatively flat in some regions and up -- maybe up sequentially, and other regions just stable.
Specifically, North America, we've called out in the past, we've seen some sequential improvement, we
believe, but we're not quite where we want to be yet. But expect we will be there in the next couple of
quarters.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. That's helpful. And then is it possible to specify either the financial or the volume impact of the
North American labor issues that you referenced? Are those primarily with a group of customers or within
Avery? And do those kind of linger in 4Q? Are they better or worse exiting October versus what you saw in
3Q?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

It's more about just the ability to meet surges in demand. And so the ability to flex when demand
suddenly you see peaks temporarily and so forth. So it's primarily impacted our service lead times,
which are consistent with what we're seeing across the industry, our lead times being longer than they
usually are, which is what the whole industry is seeing. That's what the driver is really. So it's not really a
particular number. Yes, we've got a bigger backlog. We don't know how much of that is true end demand
versus maybe inventory building or people getting in the queue just to make sure they've got an allocation
of future manufacturing.

So overall, I think the key message here is the markets remain -- good growth in the end markets,
particularly in North America and Europe. So the gains that we -- the market achieved last year when
the pandemic first hit have been held and then we're seeing incremental growth from there. And yes, it's
putting a bit of a strain on the lead times across the industry.

Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

First question I wanted to ask is around what you're doing to offset inflation. Good companies play to their
strengths and advantages during periods of stress to gain position to gain share. As you think about LGM
versus RBIS and you think about the broad buckets, reengineering and cost versus commercial and price
versus, I don't know, new products and innovation, how would you say that sort of mix varies in terms
of how you're behaving in the market, LGM versus RBIS? I know LGM is heavy on the reformulation and
pricing.

And then the second question related to it is, is there a horizon? Is there a practical limit where you really
can't do any further reformulation where certainly the incremental benefit isn't what we've been seeing
this year and in prior years, which would mean that you'd have to raise pricing further. And is there a
practical limit in terms of how much more pricing you can get before you would worry about the strong
demand?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, George. So your first question, which was talking about the relative levers within between RBIS and
LGM, as an example. I mean, first off, the inflation is much larger in LGM. Our levers within that -- all of
our businesses are, one, just our relentless focus on productivity is both focusing on variable costs, so
things like innovating material reengineering and so forth, restructuring. So touching on both of those, as
you highlighted, the material reengineering is more to do within the Materials businesses, as you'd expect.

You asked, are there limits to that within a given time period. Yes, there are some limits to that. But
over the long horizon, we continue to have a pretty consistent ability to deliver material cost out, we
call it, every single year, and we've been doing that for decades. So I don't see a long-term limit to that,
but definitely within a short cycle, there's some limits to what we can do there, which then you move to
pricing.

Within RBIS, they're having some inflation as well, not nearly the magnitude that we're seeing within
materials. And there, we've been raising prices as well. It's a little bit of a different impact because every
year, there's a different program, just the way that industry works, and so you're constantly kind of
repricing for new programs going from different designs of information and branding solutions for the
apparel and retailers out there.

And then last thing I'll say is just restructuring. That's been a consistent focus of ours. In times that are
relatively calm, that's when you want to focus on the restructuring, as we've been doing over the years.
We accelerated a lot of restructuring, as you know, into last year, and so we're in a position of strength
right now. When you're in a high-volume environment, it's -- that's when you taper back a bit of your
restructuring. So long term, that's something that's going to be a key lever for ours -- of ours across the
portfolio. But clearly, we accelerated some of our actions in the last year from what we have here on the
near horizon.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just on the pricing side, is there a point at which you'd start to worry about pressure-sensitive materials
being replaced by something else in the market. I don't know what it would be, but nonetheless, you've
had a lot of inflation. You've had to raise pricing. Does there come a point where your customers can't
bear any further pricing?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

No, the pricing is broad-based. So it's not just industry specific is my point. So regardless of what labeling
solutions you're looking at, there is just inflation that is extremely broad-based. And it's even outside,

10

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

obviously, of packaging materials. So when you think about the cost of packaging, it's pretty small relative
to overall pack -- overall cost of the packaged goods.

So I think generally, what you're seeing, we see what's going on in the macro around increasing inflation,
labor constraints, it actually further heightens the need around information solutions labels, whether that
be classic barcode labels or RFID and intelligent labels. And so we think it's just going to -- while there are
inflationary pressures, it also further increases the business case for a lot of the solutions that we've been
focusing on and investing in.

Operator

Our next question is from John McNulty with BMO.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

On the Intelligent Label front, admittedly, the 15% that you hit is kind of in your long-term range of 15%
to 20%. But admittedly, it's a bit lower than, I think, what we were expecting just based on a bunch of
channel checks throughout the industry. So I guess anything constraining your ability to deliver in terms of
the volumes throughout this quarter in the Intelligent Label side that we should be thinking about?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Thanks, John. So I mean, each quarter, you're going to have movement up and down from within that
range. Overall, if you look year-to-date and then what we're looking at for the full year, we're looking at
growth of 30% for the full year, and that's obviously with a little bit easier comp, roughly 10% last year.
So you're looking at basically compound annual growth of 18%, which is at the higher end of our range, of
our 15% to 20%. So we feel good with where we are now.

Specifically, your question about constraints, yes, we were constrained. The challenges in South Asia I
referenced, we had Vietnam. So our Intelligent Labels, a biggest portion of that, 75%, is for apparel.
With the constraints we saw in Vietnam, just as I mentioned, for RBS overall, impacted the Intelligent
Labels businesses by a couple of points, as well as Malaysia in the middle of the quarter, it was just a
couple of weeks, but Malaysia had a lot of lockdowns, and that's where we have one of our RFID inlay
manufacturing plants. So definitely a bit of a constraint, but overall, we feel good with where we are and
how we're trending and how the pipeline is developing.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. No, that's helpful color. And then I guess the other question would just be on the free cash flow
front. I mean, you already generated a huge amount so far at whatever it was, $632 million, I think it
was. 4Q normally is a windfall kind of quarter for you as well in terms of free cash. I guess, should we be
thinking about it differently just given all the raw material inflation and things like that? Or is -- can 4Q
kind of be the big acumen that it normally is? How should we be thinking about that?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I think there's a couple of things. So one is our CapEx year-to-date is a bit lower than we would have
expected coming into the year. For the full year, we're probably still around what our initial expectations
would have been. But just given supply chain challenges and some things getting delayed from an
equipment production perspective, building perspective, things like that, we expect to have more CapEx
here in Q4. And we normally do, but I think probably more relative to the first 3 quarters than what we
normally would have. So that's 1 driver.

So overall, I think our view is that we've got about $630 million, as you said, year-to-date. Our target is
to deliver over $700 million. We're very confident in that, and that's still about $150 million more than last

year, which was a record free cash flow year for us. So we feel very good about the trajectory here and
our ability to continue driving strong free cash flow.

Our next question is from Josh Spector with UBS Securities.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just -- so in the third quarter, I mean, you guys did a really good job holding margins flat sequentially in
spite of what you earlier called out as high single-digit raws inflation quarter-to-quarter. Just curious what
was the biggest factor that helped you achieve that in the third quarter? And I think your guidance for
fourth quarter reflects about a 50 basis point sequential margin decline. So what's different about what
you think you can achieve here in the fourth quarter versus last quarter?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think overall, as you said, part of what you see when you look at the segments is some
improvements in RBS, particularly sequentially Q2 to Q3. And in the materials businesses where we saw
a little bit more of the sequential inflation in the third quarter,is where we saw a little bit of sequential
decline Q2 to Q3.

So I think overall, a big part of that overall flatness was really driven by the strengthening of RBS from Q2
to Q3. So we look at Q3 to Q4, we expect to continue delivering strong margins in the RBS segment. We
did talk about having further sequential inflation that we're now working through passing prices through.
So that will be a little bit more of a gap in the fourth than what we would have expected before as well.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And just on the RFID side, UPS specifically talked about more RFID adoption in their
parcels. Just wondering if you could comment if that's a project, one, that you're involved with. And two,
can you size that opportunity, if not specifically for UPS as a customer, but maybe the North America
parcel market if adoption was taken up at the rate that UPS is discussing. And does this change any of
your view about some of the medium-term adoptions as I think you still talk about retail being the biggest
opportunity for the next few years.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we've got a number of -- I'm not going to comment on anything specific, any specific program
we're working through, but we are working with all of the major logistics players. And a lot of it is
specifically, as you normally see, starting out with targeted areas where the biggest challenge in the need
for automation are. And so we've got a number of programs, and that's part of that. And I've talked about
the revenue growth being above the average from a very small base, that relates to those programs and
logistics.

And as far as adopting across the entire network, which we see a significant opportunity just when you
think about the amount of automation required and trying to reduce costs, but also increase speed.
We see that this technology, RFID and our broader Intelligent Label solutions, as being a key enabler
to helping companies achieve that. So you ask what can the size of the market be. We shared some
information in our March Investor Day. You can look at -- but simply, you can just look at number of
parcels that are out there. So if you think about individual companies when they ultimately fully adopt
what the magnitude of that can be.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I think in your slides, you talked about $600 million of annualized inflation. But you also say that for the
year, your annual inflation is about 10%. So if $600 million is 20%, then 10% is $300 million, and $300
million would be offset by, I don't know, 4% across the board price increase, are your prices up that
much? Or are you in the whole by, I don't know, $50 million or $70 million in raw material costs this year.
Can you size that?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Sure, Jeff. So I think, in general, directionally, you're right. I think when we look at pricing, as I said here
in the third quarter in LGM specifically, and we're talking mostly LGM here when we're talking about that
$600 million and 20% LGM and IGM, I should say. We had about 5 points of price in Q3 as part of the LGM
growth rate there.

In the fourth quarter, we expect that to be a little bit higher year-over-year as we've been implementing
prices in the third quarter and some new increases that take effect at some point in Q4. So yes, we still
have a gap, as we've talked about from a margin perspective overall, between price and inflation. But
certainly, that pricing percentage continues to grow as we move through the year.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And so propylene has already fallen, and probably polyethylene is going to be down, I don't know,
a few cents a pound in October. Maybe it's going to go down $0.05 a pound for the next 3 or 4 months.
So -- but what you said is you thought that your inflation would be not only higher in the fourth quarter,
which I understand. But in the first quarter, why would it be higher in the first quarter of '22, as a base
case?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I'm talking sequentially. So I think just you've seen things progress that we exited Q3 and
entered Q4. So it will create a little bit of incremental impact in the first quarter, the first part of the first
quarter, I guess.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Part of it, Jeff, is just the first 1.5 months it stays in your inventory, and then it slowly bleeds through to
the P&L. So it's just a delayed effect of when we actually get the inflation. The other thing I'll say is, I
know there's an outlook as far as what might be happening over the coming months. I think us and the
entire industry kind of got that wrong a quarter ago, where there was an expected abatement here in Q4,
and we've been seeing incremental inflationary pressures. So we tend to just look out a few months and
look to see what's there and what do we expect and try to evaluate capacity additions and what's going on
in the macro to help shape beyond that. But I think we're in a pretty uncertain environment. So we're not
baking anything in or commenting on 2022 at large.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

What raw materials are you short? What can't you get?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think it depends on the region and the specific business. I think it's been a challenge on certain
chemicals that go into our films and our adhesives depending on the region, and it's not as though we
haven't been able to get them for an extended period of time, but it does create some challenges within

operations when you may have something that's delayed a week or a few days even. And then you end up
having to run over time or do something else to manage through those kind of situations.

I think paper liners in Europe has been a challenge more recently as well. So there's a -- really nothing
that's been long-standing, one thing, I would say, over the course of the last few quarters. It's really been
different areas that impacted us for short periods of time as we moved across the year here.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

And just to add to that, Jeff, it's not just what can be outbound from our suppliers. There are lots of delays
in the freight industry. So it's taking longer things being held up across docking facility or something
where it's just taking longer to get your materials, and that alone can cause a delay. It might be a
delay just by a day or 2 days, or it might be 1.5 weeks where you then need to shift the assets to other
products and so forth, as Greg said.

Our next question is from Paretosh Misra with Berenberg Capital.

Paretosh Misra
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

So I had a question on Slide 10, where you showed the product mix within RBIS. How should we think of
the mix within Vestcom relative to this pie chart? Is Vestcom -- will that be a totally new category? Or it
has some overlap with your existing portfolio?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We'll lay that out in the next earnings call. But overall, it's going to be a new category with both --
and the majority of it is in high-value categories, and the rest of it will be a base.

Paretosh Misra
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then any other color you could provide on your RFID pipeline, where it stands versus
the start of the year?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

I think your question -- sorry, there was a little disruption. The RFID pipeline growth, I think, is what
your question was. So yes, we continue to see good momentum overall within the RFID pipeline. I'd
say -- I think I commented on this last quarter as well, our focus is more on moving things through the
mouth of the funnel, if you will, more migrating them further down the funnel. So great progress on what
we're seeing there, a lot of -- whether you're looking at food, on quick service restaurants, a number
of pilots being initiated. A number of pilots being moving to local or regional rollouts. So there's quite a
bit of activity going on there, and we commented on logistics earlier as well. So that's generally what's
happening.

I guess beyond that is just a move into -- within some of the -- if you think about a number of retailers
that are multi-category retailers, having discussions about moving out of the apparel department and into
other departments within those larger retailers as well. So number of activities going on. Broadly, I'd say
it's the food and logistics area is the area with the greatest growth similar to what we identified in the
Investor Day in March about where the opportunity was and where our focus was.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Christopher John Kapsch
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

So focused on LGM and the comments about organic growth by region specifically. Just hoping for a
little bit more color as to why Western Europe would be up more than 20% versus the low double digits
in North America and emerging markets. I don't think it has anything to do with the more pronounced
inflation there. So just wondering if you could -- if there's some explanation for the divergence in the
trends there?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Chris. I think some of that is just based on comps. So last year, if you go back to last year, we were
declining in Europe, particularly in the third quarter after the surge we've seen in the second quarter from
the pandemic. So most of that is just comps when we look over a 2-year period. Europe is up about 10%
from 2019 Q3 to 2021 Q3.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Which is just still above the historical growth rate of that region. So the -- still healthy markets, but
definitely, we've got some gyrations quarter-to-quarter.

Christopher John Kapsch
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then you mentioned how some of the supply chain and logistical challenges have restrained
growth a little bit in RBIS. Has that been the case in any instances in different regions in LGM?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we had -- it's pretty much LGM North America is what's [indiscernible] most in LGM. And then for
RBIS, it's the constraints just around, like we talked about, Vietnam and Malaysia and so forth that are
COVID-related, and it's not just us, obviously, it's the entire -- might be a region of a country or the
entire country. And then LGM Asia is also impacted, particularly freight is a challenge globally. It's a
particular challenge in freight around Asia and just moving product between countries and so forth. So
that's obviously a challenge in LPM -- LGM as well in Asia.

Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

One is just a quick detail question. I had missed it. You said something about $60 million related to
Vestcom just for posterity. What was that related to again? And I had a question on capital allocation.

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

George, so that was specific to Vestcom, purchase accounting amortization will be somewhere in the
$55 million to $60 million range is what we expect for 2022. When we step back and look at kind of total
depreciation and amortization, including kind of their ongoing depreciation, it's probably in the $70-ish
million range for Vestcom next year overall.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then my other question, could you remind us what you said in the past and if any of this has changed
in terms of your appetite and ability to do M&A within the LGM sector. Again, in periods of stress, the big

companies usually gain capabilities, gain share. The smaller companies would tend to fall back. Are there
any companies in the pipeline that would be helpful to you from a value-add because that's one of the
components in terms of your capital allocation strategy and would be complementary to Avery. Would you
have the willingness to do anything like that? And relative to some of the experiences some of your peers
had back in early 2000s, would you have the ability to add anything in LGM?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, George. Yes, so we continue to -- we have an M&A pipeline that we've talked about. We continue
to engage and work with that with our partners in the industry. So that's something that we are definitely
continuing to work through. And as far as specifically the LGM, yes, LGM, each of our divisions have a
pipeline that we continue to work and we definitely have an appetite for areas that -- we look at M&A
as opportunities to accelerate our strategy. So we're focused on M&A that is disproportionately focused
on high-value categories and give us new capabilities that, as you mentioned, can enhance the overall
capabilities of the portfolio.

So there's a number of angles we look here, but those are the 2 broad thrust is high-value categories
emphasis and bringing on new capabilities overall, and obviously, the financial one. So we're continuing
to work it. We just spent $1.45 billion on Vestcom, and we feel good with the early results of that and the
outlook for that business and are confident we're going to achieve a good return there. And then we're
also looking to deploy our capital that we have going forward.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Securities, Research Division

Mitch, would it be fair to say that the high-value quotient would be more likely met in things that would be
in the RBIS segment more broadly? Or is that an oversimplification and incorrect?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, I think what you're seeing is it's more of -- it's more around moving higher end around information
solutions and the brand management capabilities. And so we've got our base materials, both within LGM,
but also even RBIS has a base materials business, just making the blank RFID inlaid, and then there's
working through the actual brand and information solutions. So I wouldn't say there's one business more
than the other. Overall, the focus is around high-value categories, focusing around value-add material
science product categories as well as information and branding solutions.

Operator

Mr. Butier, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you for any closing
remarks.

All right. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining. We had another strong performance in a very challenging
period. And I just once again want to thank our entire team for their ongoing efforts to keep one another
safe while continuing to deliver for our shareholders and obviously delivering for our customers. So thank
you very much.
