Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Fastenal 2020 First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ellen Stolts. Please go ahead.

Ellen Stolts
Financial Reporting & Regulatory Compliance Manager

Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2020 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted
by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer.

company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
we encourage you to review those factors carefully.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. I thought I'd start by giving a quick
recap of the quarter as it rolls out from a chronology perspective and what we learned and actions we took
at different points.

Back in January, so we have -- we operate in 25 countries. We have both a sales organization and a
sourcing organization that is based in China. And we have regular conversations with that group, and it
was back in January that we learned firsthand from our teams in China, from our leaders in China about
COVID-19. At that point in time, we started to lock down and monitor specific SKUs as we had a goal in
mind, and that was to maintain a great and reliable supply chain for our customers, particularly our repeat
customers where we had a good understanding of their normal usage and had some predictability of what
to expect. It was also at that time that we shared with several of our Board members about the potential
of a transaction with a company called Apex, who's been our partner in the vending realm for about the
last dozen years.

On February 6, we sounded the alarm internally. And what I mean by that is, in connection with our
sales release, we put a message out to all of our employees throughout the organization of what we
were learning from our team in China about COVID-19, about the fact that Chinese New Year was being
extended a second week and some of the lessons they were starting to learn in the world that was
changing in their eyes so we could start to prepare our teams as well as marshal our sourcing and supply
chain resources to stabilize supply; to better understand, talking supplier to supplier, where they were and
where they were from an operational standpoint; and to begin the process of vetting suppliers to expand
access to select products, particularly safety and janitorial.

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

It was also during the first half of February that we notified the entire Board about the potential of the
Apex transaction and signed a letter of intent with Apex later in the month. Also in the latter half of
February, we engaged with our IT folks to expand their sourcing. We don't do a lot of mobile work with our
employees other than the mobility platforms we have at our branch and Onsite locations. And we began
to expand our footprint for allowing work at home and creating whatever change we could also have for
resources to support the business.

On March 5, in connection with our February sales release, our video started -- expanded the updates to
our employees and shared again what we were seeing and the steps we were taking. It was a day later,
on Friday, March 6, that we canceled our annual customer event that was scheduled to be held in mid-
April in Denver. And it's an event that more than -- about 6,000 attend over a 3-day period. Given that the
changing environment, we saw it prudent to cancel the event as we didn't think the event would be able to
come off as planned.

On Saturday, March 7, in a little sideline here, we celebrated my mom's 90th birthday. I'm pleased

to say we were able to do that in person. Weekend of March 14, we notified approximately 300,000
customers we were locking our front door. For those of you that have never been on a Fastenal location,
it's somewhat feels like an industrial hardware store to a certain degree. Most of our revenue goes out the
back door. We delivered to our customers' location. It might be going into a vending machine. It might be
going into a bin stock. It might be strictly a delivery. A smaller piece goes out the front door. And so in --
with the thought process of protecting our employees, protecting our customer supply chain, we notified
our customers the front door was locked. However, we are open for business, and our folks really started
to learn more and more about the term critical infrastructure or critical industry and appreciated better the
role we provide in the marketplace.

We also indicated to our customers, please order ahead. If you are coming to the branch, call us on the
phone, place an order online and we'll have the product ready for you. We'll do a safe handoff at the front
door so we can keep a distance from each other and keep everybody safe but allow you to access critical
supplies to your business.

Later in the week of March 15, we sent out a message, and this was -- turned out to be the first of a
weekly video update to our teams and an expanded Fastenal business update, which is our internal
communication platform, to let folks know what's going on. And later in that week of March 15, we
expanded our employee benefits program to specifically address COVID-19 issues and expand our paid
days off. And our goal was quite simple. We believe that people make better decisions when they can
remove some worries from their life. And one of the elements we wanted to remove is to provide comfort
that "I had a job and that I would have a paycheck coming in if something happened." It might be a child
that's home from a school that's closed, it might be a situation where I contract COVID-19, but we wanted
to provide comfort to our employees because we think we make better decisions in that environment.

We also took the step of notifying our employees. Typically, benefits affect mostly full-time employees.
This was the benefit we put in place that affected both full- and part-time employees because we're
equally engaged in the supply chain to our customer. On March 25, we sent a second letter to our
customers. This one was not emailed out as the first one was. This was posted on our website. It was
really intended to provide our local teams what an update means for their customers. And we began to
limit specific safety and janitorial SKUs to critical industries.

So in that first communication, it was about limiting contact, create social distance. We also started to
talk about internally focusing on our repeat customers from the standpoint of understanding their normal
usage, so again, maintain a stable supply chain to your customer.

March 27, I'm pleased to say we celebrated my father-in-law's 89th birthday. This time, we made use of
a technology called FaceTime, first time my father-in-law have ever used it. March 30, we closed on the
Apex vending transaction that we disclosed in our release that came out earlier this morning. April 10, we
sent the third letter to our customers, again, this one was posted to our website, to reiterate the allocation
of critical inventory and the approach we're taking to support a stable supply chain in the marketplace.

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

I'll now turn over to the flip book that Holden has put out to talk about our first quarter. As I mentioned
briefly, we shared with our employees the concept of critical infrastructure, shared with our employees
about the customers they're serving and the vital role they provide in the marketplace. And I'm really
impressed with the way our team responded by setting aside personal concerns and taking prudent steps
to protect their safety and our customer supply chain. And Holden will touch on in a few minutes, you see,
I believe, the Fastenal organization shine in a period like this.

Second bullet, we have several co-equal first priorities: as I've alluded to, safety of our employees,
our suppliers, our customers and society in general is paramount in our mind, in our thought process;
understand our role as an important agile supply chain partner; remain thoughtful, disciplined and willing
to have frank and open conversations, share with your customer what you know when you know it,
manage expectations; and lastly, maintain a stable cash flow to support not just the business in the short
term but to support what we see as an economy that's going to restart at some point. We just don't know
what that point is.

The -- also, given the fact that our mix was shifting abruptly to government and safety products and our
fasteners were dropping dramatically. As customers either shut down because of shelter-in-place orders
or customers' business slowed and their demand slowed, we saw our fastener business drop off. And
gross margins in fasteners and safety products are not the same, and you see that when you look at our
financial statements this quarter.

Accordingly, we have taken steps to reduce operating costs. We have incredibly strong balance sheet.
Historically, we've operated this business with, I believe, great business discipline but also great financial
discipline, and it shines in times like this. The economics of a distribution model are -- also shine in times
like this from the standpoint of reduced activity, unlock some working capital from your balance sheet. And
you saw that in this quarter, and I suspect you'll continue to see this play out as the year progresses.

We currently have every intention of maintaining our dividend. In fact, that's one of the priorities I laid out
for our team early on. I'm very mindful of, in times like this, as we saw back in 2009, 2010 and in other
periods in our history, the ability to maintain that dividend is meaningful to our shareholders. And I'm ever
mindful of a chunk of our shareholders come to work at Fastenal every day. Approximately 4.3 million
shares are held by our 401(k) plan. And also, as I mentioned earlier, we purchased late in the quarter
certain assets, primarily intangible but also supply chain access to our vending platform that I believe will
lower our cost structure in the future but also enhance our ability to make vending ever more a part of the
Fastenal business.

With activity weakening, customers closing and our energy shifting to supplying key products to a range
of critical industries, government, health care, first responders, et cetera, our visibility to our 2020 goals
for both signing Onsites and signing vending are murky at best. The cancellation of our customer show
probably creates as much murkiness as anything because history has shown that, that customer event is a
great opportunity to unlock particularly Onsite activities.

An Onsite relationship is a very strategic relationship. It's not something that a customer enters into
without a lot of thought because it's a big change to their business, and that's why we're not providing
signing ranges at this time. Although, in all honesty, when I look at the 85 Onsites that we signed in the
first quarter, if somebody would have gone back in time and had a discussion with me and said, "Hey,
in 2020, you're just going to start this way. COVID-19 is going to become a thing globally, and you're
still going to sign 85 Onsites," I wouldn't have believed it. It's testament to the pipeline we have in place
already in that March was stronger than January in Onsite signings. But it's at a lower level, and therefore,
we've removed our signing ranges for the year.

Holden will touch on this a few minutes, but to give a proxy of where patterns are ending March and
where they're starting April. As of March 31, 121 or just over 10% of our active Onsites were closed
because the customer was closed or essentially shut down. Total in-market locations, 3,270 at the end of
first quarter 2020. From a vending perspective, vending is different than Onsite from the standpoint it's
more transactional. It's influenced by strategic decisions, but it's much more transactional. And we did see
that fall off in March in that March was about 2/3 of the signing pace of what we saw in March of 2019.

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

I will add that now when I look at vending, I feel very good about our future. And part of that is the
business that we've created over the last decade or so. Part of it is the recent Apex purchase and what it
means for us to streamline that. And a couple of things I would share, and I'll share a quick story. Sunday
night at about 11:30 in the Florness household, our smoke alarm went off. Now for those of you that don't
know this, back in January 2013, our house burned to the ground. I -- my wife and kids and dogs all got
out safely but the house was gone. This was the case of a bad battery. And so the -- at 11:30, the alarm's
gone off, the dogs are howling.

And we started replacing batteries. At 11 -- when I finished, I hopped online at fastenal.com, and I placed
an order for batteries. And it told me they'd be available on Tuesday morning because they weren't -- this
particular battery wasn't in stock at our local branch. And I'm pleased to say, at 7:26 this morning, I did
receive an email from fastenal.com that my order is ready in an outside locker, ready for pickup. And so
I'll go pick that up later today.

And then related to that, e-commerce grew 27% in the first quarter. And in the month of March, our e-
commerce in total expanded above 10% of sales for the first time ever. I believe for the quarter, we're
about 9.5%.

With that, I'll turn it over to Holden.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

Great. Thank you, Dan. I'll begin with the business cadence slide on Slide 5.

Total sales were up 4.4% and daily sales were up 2.8% in the first quarter of 2020. Daily sales in the first
2 months of the quarter were up 4.1%, with January and February both exceeding seasonal norms and
the PMI averaging 50.5%. Growth was helped by easier weather and holiday comps, with overall business
activity was still sluggish, but there were encouraging signs of things stabilizing. March began similarly,
but the final 8 business days of the month began to reflect COVID-19-related issues.

A number of parts of our business highlight that impact. One is the fastener sales, which tend to be more
cyclical. After being up 1.4% in January and February, fastener daily sales were down 10% in March.
More telling, our non-OEM, nonconstruction fasteners, which represent roughly 30% of the category, was
down nearly 20%. This group includes fasteners for amusement parks, schools, retail operations and our
cash sales and was heavily impacted by shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements as well as our
decision to restrict public access to our branches.

Another area is Onsites, where more than 120 units in North America or around 10% to 11% of our total
were closed as a result of customer facility closures. This likely resulted in more than $2.5 million in lost
sales in March, and there clearly would have been additional lost sales from key account business in our
traditional branches.

On the other hand, the unique nature of this crisis has produced opportunities. Safety, our second largest
product category, was up 31% in March as our global sourcing capabilities lined up with the needs of
the market. From a customer standpoint, our government business was up 31% in March, with sales to
health care organizations more than doubling. Sales to warehouse operations more than tripled. These
are smaller pieces of our business, and as Dan indicated earlier, our first priority is to play our role in
overcoming the societal and economic challenges presented by COVID-19. However, we also believe this
has introduced Fastenal's capabilities to new customers, which should benefit us well beyond this crisis.

These are all very early reads, but the second quarter of 2020, some regional VPs see their region down
20%-plus while others see their region being closer to flat based on the influx of government business.
But none can predict the ultimate length of this situation or the degree to which safety and government
will offset weakness elsewhere. There's an extreme lack of visibility in the marketplace currently, but the
feedback would seem to put sales in the second quarter of 2020 down 15%-plus, though it's worth noting
that, that is not the order of magnitude of decline that we have seen so far through April.

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

Now to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 46.6% in the first quarter of 2020, down 110 basis points versus
the first quarter of 2019. We did see a wider decline in March, driven by 2 things. First, our cost of
goods are heavily variable but those fixed costs that we do have, such as our truck fleet, manufacturing,
procurement operation, delevered as daily growth slowed to flattish. Second, the impact of mix widened
sharply from January to March based on the abrupt changes in our customer and product mix. This impact
was mostly offset by SG&A leverage of 100 basis points. An extra selling day was helpful, and incentive
comp is playing its usual shock absorber role as growth slows. As a result, first quarter 2020 operating
margin was 19.9%, down 10 basis points year-over-year with an incremental margin of 17%.

It's difficult to pinpoint where gross margin may settle in the near term. However, fixed cost leverage
would remain a factor if sales wind up being as weak as many RVPs currently expect. Further, if growth
gaps between safety and government relative to fasteners and higher-margin small customer sales
continue to widen, it would similarly widen the impact of mix. Once market conditions revert back to
precrisis levels, we would expect much of the current gross margin pressure to reverse.

As it relates to operating costs, we do not have a formal head count reduction initiative in place but do
expect natural attrition as the number of branches that are growing fall below 50% as occurred in March
and our field leadership manages their costs. Lower signings expectations will also likely generate reduced
need for new Onsite staffing and non-sales-related roles. We also expect a natural decline in incentive
compensation based on our variable-pay programs but have taken additional steps to reduce employee-
related costs by eliminating bonuses for all employees above a certain base earnings threshold. Certain
discretionary costs, such as sales and travel-related selling as well as branch openings and closings, will
continue to be managed tightly by field leadership.

Visibility is low even by our normal standard. The last time our sales were down 15%-plus was 2009.
Then, decremental operating margins ranged between 35% and 40%, and that would seem to be a
reasonable benchmark if conditions prove to be similar. But ultimately, what decremental margins and
earnings look like in 2020 depends greatly on what your expectations for normalization of business activity
and the volume and mix assumptions you made for the full year.

Turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow of $241 million in the first quarter of 2020 was 119% of net
income. The weakening environment moderated net working capital needs in the period. Inventories were
up 4% annually and down sequentially in the first quarter of 2020, and days on hand fell by more than 3.
Accounts receivable was up 5.2% with days outstanding being flat.

Net capital spending in the first quarter of 2020 was $47 million, down from $53 million in the first quarter
of 2019, which was expected, given reduced needs for new hub capacity after the investments made in
2019. In light of the uncertain market outlook, we have reduced our net capital spending range for 2020
to $155 million to $180 million, down from $180 million to $205 million previously.

We returned cash to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $144 million in dividends and $52 million
in share buybacks. We foresee no change to our $0.25 per share dividend in 2020 but do not currently
expect to purchase additional shares. Our purchase of Apex assets in the period also used $125 million in
cash.

From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the first quarter of 2020 with debt at 14.6% of total capital,
up versus the fourth quarter of 2019 on the Apex asset acquisition but below the year-ago level of
16.9%. At quarter's end, we had an additional $344 million available on our existing credit lines, with no
reason, after discussions with our lending partners, to believe those funds would not be available for use.
Another $465 million of capital is available under our master note agreement. We also have reviewed the
sensitivity of our model for different sales, profitability and working capital scenarios and believe the cash
our model will generate and our existing credit availability will be more than sufficient for our needs.
That's all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we'll take questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Manthey from Baird.

David John Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So you noted that there's no official reduction in force mandate, but my question is related to FTE head
count. Back in 2008, your FTEs were about 12,000, and you dropped that by about 15% or 1,800 FTEs,
with nearly 1,000 FTEs coming out in the first quarter of '08 alone. You've got about 19,000 today. I'm
just trying to gauge. Is 15% via attrition and reduction of part-time hours? If needed, is that something
that would be in the ballpark of 3,000 FTEs? And if so, I'm just trying to get a gauge on how quickly you
could move on that. Is half of the ultimate reduction or maybe 1,500 FTEs reasonable as you flex down
hire -- flex down your part-time hours and freeze hiring?

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

So I'll answer that in pieces. First off, the 2008/2009 time frame, if you recall, our business from October
to January dropped about 18%, and then we dropped another 15% between January and April. I
remember those numbers quite well. I didn't have to look those up. And the economy froze up. We took
steps to mechanically alter some of our bonus programs to conserve cash, with one goal being we wanted
to maintain as much employment as we could to maintain our talent pool, and that's true also today.

We took deeper steps because the prospect of this being longer in duration was greater. At this point,
Dave, we just don't know. The message that I've given our team is with shelter-in-place orders, you see
a bunch of customers, a bunch of businesses that are shut down. Holden touched on that in some of his
information. You also see examples where our business is operating. And I believe the bias right now
towards pieces of the economy turning back on is stronger today than it would have been a couple of
weeks ago. And I've said to our team we actually prepared for elements of the economy turning back on
as we get into May. I don't know if that's going to happen, Dave, but elements of our economy turning
back on. So I wouldn't see the drop-off being as acute as you saw back in 2009.

We do have a hiring freeze in place. We have pulled back part-time hours. We are letting attrition happen.
I don't know what attrition will look like in this environment versus 2008, 2009. And Holden, maybe you
can chime in if you have any insight.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

I mean the only thing I might add to that, Dave, is we have to remember, relative to 2009, too, there are
opportunities in this market. We touched on the opportunities to be more involved with safety and PPE and
janitorial and sanitation products. I mean demand for those is very strong. That was not the case in 2009.
So there are opportunities for us that the market is not quite as turned off as I recall 2009 being.

Having spoken to a few of the EVPs about what they expect from a head count standpoint, their
expectation is that full-time head count will decline as the field manages their P&Ls. But I would tell you
that they aren't looking for declines at this stage on the order of magnitude that you were sort of alluding
to. So I think that you'll see, in all of our regions, some decline of full-time head count. You'll certainly
see a decline in part-time head count and hours will go down. But right now, with the opportunities that
are present and with the uncertainties that are out there, it's not on an order of magnitude that you're
referring to.

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

Okay. Fair enough. And just a point of clarification. Is there anything different about the business today
that if you needed to or if this was longer than expected, that a 10% or 15% flex down just via the tools
that we mentioned in FTE specifically would be possible? Or is it different this time?

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

I don't believe it's different, Dave, the -- our head count per branch. So if you go back to that '08, '09
time frame, our average branch was doing somewhere in the $80,000 to $90,000 a month category. And
now we're in that -- I don't know what we did last month, probably in the $130,000, $140,000 category.
So there's more employees per branch, which gives you some flexibility there.

In distribution, the picking activity drives it. Our relative labor to pick is a little bit different than it was a
decade ago because there's more automation in our system. But I don't believe our business is different
now that we couldn't flex it.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Holden, by the way of -- I think yours is the last hand I shook back in early March when we were in
London to -- the last time anybody got out.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

I appreciate you not making me sick.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I guess a couple of questions. I don't think I would have been to blame at that point. You were on another
continent. I guess a couple of questions. First, appreciate the

[Audio Gap]

And I know that the last quarter, you kind of broke your track of talking about current quarter in it

[Audio Gap]

running down

[Audio Gap]

thus far in April. Would you mind kind of sharing where we're at, at this point?

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

Josh, I'm not sure if we'll be able to answer your question because, right now, we're getting about every
other word.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

I think you asked -- I think in my prepared remarks, I referred to sort of our monthly or April to date not
being down on the order of magnitude of 15%-plus. I think you're asking to give some color as to what
that order of magnitude is. Is that right?

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Correct.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

We're probably running between 10% and 15% down right now. Now the one thing to bear in mind is that
the timing of months matters, right? I mean given how much of our business is National Accounts and
Onsites and vending and things like that, that does tend to create a little bit more movement towards the
latter part of the month than the earlier part of the month.

So there's still a lot that we don't know, Josh. But based on where we are today in April, to this point,
we've been down probably between 10% and 15% as opposed to 15%-plus.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I appreciate that. Go ahead.

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

I'll add one element to that, and that is, despite the fact we weren't able to celebrate it in a way that
was maybe normal for most of us or at least for me, last weekend was Easter weekend, which meant
last Friday was Good Friday. So that does impact our business every year, the placement of Good Friday.
But as of Saturday morning, when I looked at the numbers, we were down about 10.5%. That was again
probably a little bit worse because of Good Friday, but that was looking at where we were month to date.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's really helpful color, Dan. And just one extra one. Obviously, an impact from customer
shutdowns. You called that out in Onsite. But if you had to think about the totality of customers even just
anecdotally from the regions, any sense for how much of the drag is just customers literally not having
their doors open?

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

I think the fact that a little over 10% of our Onsites were closed at the end of March is probably a good
-- a pretty good proxy from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And the only thing
that could influence that would be our Onsites tend to be more manufacturing, although there are Onsites
that are construction, there are Onsites that are education and the like. But I think that's probably a pretty
good indicator in the fact that the first week of the month or the first 1.5 weeks of the month being down
a little over 10% probably plays out intuitively that way. Where we're seeing greater drop is in some of
the industries that Holden touched on, smaller pieces of our business but they're down more. And then,
obviously, the flip side of that is government and health care and first responders, while a small piece of
our business, is up dramatically.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

And I might add a little color to that only in the sense that 9 days before the month ended, we kind of
expected our growth to be more in the 2.5% range. And so over 8 days, to go from 2.5% to flat would
imply that we probably, over the course of 8 days, lost $10 million to $11 million in revenues that we
might have otherwise expected to have gotten several days previous. And that includes, with the surge in
safety and government and things like that, which gives you a sense of sort of the manufacturing side of
things, the construction side of things, the kind of very short order of magnitude impact that we're having
in those core markets.

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Chris Dankert from Longbow Research.

Christopher M. Dankert
Longbow Research LLC

I guess first off, could we kind of dig in on Apex a little bit? Very exciting news, but I guess, is this more
about locking in a strategic technology and capability and kind of keeping it out of competitor hands? Or
is it more about vertically integrating? Or is it -- where are the real opportunities in bringing Apex kind of
into the fold here?

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So first off, we did have, from a strategic standpoint, a good block of the technology previously
because our -- when we expanded our relationship back in 2010 with this technology platform, we did
line up an exclusivity for the industrial MRO marketplace. So we did have a great spot there, which
probably drove some of our competitors crazy over the last decade, and I'm okay with that. And --
but what it really did is, over time, the technology platform became a deeper and deeper part of our
business. And so today, that vending platform represents roughly 20% of our revenue, goes through that
vending platform. And then we have another 10% of our revenue that goes to what we call our bin stock
platform. So about 30% of our business goes through some type of distribution mechanism that goes right
into the customer's facility and is a repetitive order cycle. And we see that piece, over time, expanding
dramatically as we become more supply chain linked with our customer. And with -- as a percentage of
our business, I wouldn't be surprised to see that 30% we have today more than double when we double in
size and double as a percentage of our business.

And so from that standpoint, the Apex transaction was very much about bringing the technology closer
to us so that the technology development of the platform is more aligned with where we want to take it.
Because our partner, great partner for the last 12 years, they are as much interested about expanding
outside of industrial distribution as they are within industrial distribution. And sometimes that means
what's prioritized from a technology development doesn't always harmonize with what we're thinking. And
so it provided us the ability to do that.

It also provided us the ability to blur the lines a little bit between what is vending, what is bin stock,
what is automated replenishment because it gave us more flexibility in what can go through the supply
chain. It also gives us more flexibility in how we deploy assets. And so we very much see it as making the
technology part of our umbrella. And having access to the supply chain ultimately will lower the cost for us
over time of the platform.

Christopher M. Dankert
Longbow Research LLC

Got it. That's really helpful. And optimization sounds kind of like the way forward there.

And I guess just a follow-up for me here. Safety has been a really nice offset to the slower OEM demand
in 1Q. But I guess my assumption is a lot of those products are now kind of on allocation, safety, 20%
of sales. I guess is that -- how much of that being on allocation is an impediment to sales growth as we
move into kind of 2Q here? Any comments on product availability would be really helpful.

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

We're not alone in that neighborhood, and you see it every night on the news. Demand has surged, grown
by multiples in a matter of weeks -- days and weeks. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we
put a bunch of effort in place back in February and March to expand our own supply chain to broaden our
access. We do have, which is unique for Fastenal, somewhat of a backlog, I think, right now. And they're
not all going through safety, through the vending platform. A lot of it, we're delivering pallets of product to
customers because we are a source they can rely on.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

12

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

We're also a source that they know the quality of what they're getting. Because given our history in
fasteners, one of our Achilles' heel with vetting new suppliers is we are incredibly picky when it comes to
who we do business with, not only from the standpoint of how they operate their business but their supply
chain and the quality of their own product. Because we peer beyond them when we're understanding the
vetting process and the quality of the product. It's not just testing the output, it's testing their supply
chain, too.

And so the 20% is vending. Our safety is just slightly below that historically. It's around 17% historically.
Obviously, that's grown as a percentage here in the current environment. I suspect that will continue to
hold at a higher clip as we go into second and third quarter because I personally believe there will be
changes in our customers and in the marketplace on things like safety products. And last weekend, I'm in
-- picking up some groceries and everybody in that facility -- well, 80% of the people in that facility, and I
don't mean people working there, I mean people shopping, were wearing masks. And I think that's going
to be a greater part of our world, including in manufacturing settings.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

I would probably add a couple of things as well. The timing of how COVID-19 has sort of rolled through
the map, if you will, has been beneficial in the sense that as our U.S. suppliers perhaps had their
production diverted to very specific needs and started putting on allocations, the Chinese suppliers were
beginning to open up. And I think this is really the value in having 200-some-odd professionals on the
ground over in Asia, communicating with product professionals domestically in that they really are able to
go out and find alternative uses of -- or alternative sources of product and make sure that, that product
is of a sufficient quality and is going to deliver or achieve the needs of the customer. And so I think that
we've done a really good job being able to find alternative sources of product as we've gone on, and I
think we're built to be able to do that.

So I think that the timing of things has certainly been advantageous as well. And again, I think the folks in
product and international procurement and all that deserve a lot of credit for continuing to keep our supply
chain of PPE product pretty filled. And as Dan indicated, right now, we still have product that we're going
to be working through delivering throughout most of April at this point.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Ryan Merkel from William Blair.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

So I want to dig in on April a little bit more. I'm surprised that it's only down 10% to 15% so far. So
it sounds like the safety is buffering, and that's going to continue. But what about the OEM fastener
business? And what about the non-res business? I just would have thought with factories shut down and
job sites potentially closed, that there might be bigger impacts there. What sort of growth declines are you
seeing right now in that part of the business?

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'm not sure that I have a great answer for you from a granular standpoint. We just don't necessarily
collect that level on a day-to-day basis. But I think what you're describing has been playing out. I think
that you're seeing weakness in the manufacturing side. I had -- one of our leaders in the construction side
shared with me yesterday sort of an email from some of our suppliers about what they're seeing in the
marketplace in terms of construction. There's just a lot of states, cities that have shut off construction in
many respects.

And so Ryan, the environment that you're describing absolutely exists, and it's being mitigated, to some
extent, by the need for the PPE products and our government and things of that nature. So I'm not sure
in April exactly what the OEM versus the MRO versus the non -- or versus the construction fasteners are

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

doing. We don't have that on a day-to-day basis. But I think that the environment you're describing is the
environment that exists today. It's just, unlike 2009, there are some areas where there's a great need,
and we're built to be able to find the product to meet that need. And I think that's what you're seeing as
an offsetting factor.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. Makes sense. And then switching to gross margin, I guess a 2-part question. How
much lower are the safety margins to government customers versus the company average? And then,
Holden, I know you don't want to be in the gross margin guidance game, but any help on the magnitude
of gross margin declines in the second quarter would be helpful. Or maybe just quantify -- or coming at
it a different way, maybe just quantify the expected mix headwind relative to the typical 30 to 40 basis
points in normal times.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

I would normally tell you that I don't want to be in the gross margin prediction game. I will tell you I
can't be in the margin -- gross margin prediction game right now. It's really going to depend. I don't
know what the second half of April is going to look like versus the first half in terms of where the demand
comes from, right? We've had conversations internally about this is a situation where the world doesn't
have enough PPE, right? But it's also one of those situations where you can see getting to a point, at
some point, where, frankly, there's too much of it. I don't know if that's April, if that's May, if that's fourth
quarter. It's really hard to answer, Ryan. So I don't think I'm going to go down that path.

The only perspective I think I can give you is, if I look at mix through the course of Q1. In January, mix
was probably about a 65 basis point drag to the business. And if I look at March, it was closer to 90 basis
point drag to the business. And it wasn't necessarily because the customer mix had changed so much, it
was because the product mix had changed as dramatically as it had.

And what does that mean going into Q2? I honestly don't know where that's going to settle out. I think it's
an impossible question at this stage for us to answer. But you could clearly see, in a very short window,
what was impacting mix. And we're going to see how that plays out over April and second quarter, just like
you are. But I wish I could give you more detail, but we just don't have a lot of ways to understand that
right now.

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

I'll add just one tidbit to that. First off, one thing that we did is, early on in the process, we put in some
pretty strict pricing guidelines for our field from the standpoint of there's times where you look at your
obligations to society and your obligations to your customer. And we're probably leaving -- there's
probably examples where we're leaving some margin on the table because we're more interested in
getting through this and getting society through it and getting back to whatever the new normal is.

The fact that we closed our front door, not only did that cost us some sales growth, a few percentage
points I would guess, it also cost us some mix elements to our business. And the real question is, for
everybody looking at Fastenal or at the market in general, when do you believe some elements of
regrouping of the economy step into place? As long as restaurants and theme parks and things like that
are closed, that will hurt a piece of our business. And that small customer, in the case of the restaurant,
is probably a higher-margin element. And so even that mix comes into play when we look at our MRO
fasteners.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

I would say as well that when you're procuring more products from sources that aren't usually part of
your supply chain, as we do when we go get fill-in buys to solve customers' needs at this point in time,

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

that tends to come in at a lower margin as well. So it's not just mix. There's some unusual circumstances
that are playing out in the marketplace today that, frankly, when this whole thing begins to normalize and
stabilize, we expect that most of those sort of near-term drags would unwind.

So it's a relevant question to 2Q, Ryan. I don't have a great answer for you at this point, but I do believe
that the issues that we're seeing are not permanent issues. I think that they exist as long as this situation
with COVID-19 exists. And once that goes away and our mix begins to revert back to normal and our
supply chain reverts back to normal, that -- then we'll have a more normal pattern reasserting itself on
gross margin as well. I don't think there's a long-term issue here.

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.

Adam William Uhlman
Cleveland Research Company

Hope the entire team is healthy. Wanted to continue the discussion on gross margin, if we could. Could
you tell us what price realization was this quarter? And then Holden, price/cost, I guess, was expected to
moderate or level out. Are we seeing that in the numbers today?

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would say the price level that we experienced in Q1 was comparable to what we experienced in
Q4. And I would say that in terms of characterizing price/cost, I would still characterize that as not a
meaningful factor on our gross margin in the period.

Adam William Uhlman
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. Got you. And then, I guess, could you expand your thoughts a little bit on what the team is doing
from a selling standpoint right now? It's got to be a big change of working from home and trying to do
remote selling processes rather than in person. Maybe walk through how vending fulfillment is occurring
when customers are restricting access to their facilities. Are there creative sales steps that folks are
taking? Just how the organization is working right now.

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

First off, if you think of our organization in buckets of population, the bulk of our employees work in a
branch or Onsite. And those folks are going to work every day. Unless you're in one of those Onsites that
are closed, then you're probably going to -- you might be working at home or you might be working in
another facility and doing certain aspects of the business remotely. But most of our folks are going to --
are going to the customer.

I know there's examples of vending machines we're not filling, but I would say it's a relatively small piece
of the equation. I have received over -- through either our web feedback or through comments, whether
it's on LinkedIn or other places, pictures of our employees taken by customers where they're cleaning
the vending machine as they're filling the vending machine. Very positively received, I think, by our
customers. I do believe our customers appreciate the fact that we closed the front door to our branches
because that way the amount of interaction we have is dramatically reduced from the variety of people.
So I feel safer having a Fastenal rep come into my business knowing there's not a whole bunch of people
walking into our location. And so we are still fulfilling vending as we have in the past.

One element of that fulfillment is slowly changing, that is we've talked in the past about changes to our
fulfillment model for vending and the creation of what we call LIFT, our local inventory fulfillment terminal.
I believe we had 2 late last year. I believe, right now, we're up to 7. So we continue to invest in that.
We're expanding that element. And that's really about how we pick and how we fill the machines. And you

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

can fill with a team that can go into -- has more concentrated inventory and can go into more customer
locations with product that's already picked down to the individual machines.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

But we're certainly getting asked to make accommodations by our customers. There are some customers
who are not comfortable signing packing slips. And maybe we're dropping off and they're picking up and
they're filling their machines where we might have done it before. But -- so obviously, we accommodate
what our customers want from us in this, but we're still providing those services.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.

Samuel John Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So obviously, with respect to the lack of visibility in terms of Onsite signings and openings this year, I'm
guessing April will be the low watermark for that. Holden, any sense of what you're tracking in terms of
Onsite signings and openings near term?

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

Not a great sense of it, to be honest with you, Sam. The -- yes. I don't know, Dan, if you've had a more
recent conversation on the matter, but...

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

I haven't. Like I say, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of signings we had in March because I thought
they would have dropped more meaningfully than they did. And that's a testament to the pipeline we
already had in place.

One side of me says organizations are, I mean, slower to make decisions. They're going to be looking
at how they're operating. Another side of me says we've had the ability in this environment to really
demonstrate what our supply chain resources can do. And I've heard more than one example of our sales
team talking about comments from customers of, "I get what your supply chain resources are about more
than ever from what I've seen firsthand over the last 3 weeks." So I don't know if, ultimately, that helps
us sign more.

And I talk about that more in the context of Onsite versus vending because vending is a different animal
in that it's a transactional element. The piece of vending that I'm not sure if it expands or how it expands
or how it changes is the idea of where we're delivering to a vending machine, sales that are outside the
vending machine. And what I mean by that, historically, the dollars going through the vending machine
are products that we put in there that are repetitive. We have seen a meaningful increase -- and again,
it's on a small basis, but a meaningful increase in where we have a locker at a customer, and a few -- a
door or 2 are now dedicated to deliveries. And we're seeing more examples of it coming from a relatively
small subset of branches and Onsites. But we saw that grow dramatically from February to March. Again,
I'm going to qualify it by saying it's on a very small base. And -- but I would expect, over time, that might
expand as it creates distance in delivery. And with our recent transaction with Apex, our ability to do it is
stronger today than it was in the past.

Samuel John Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the prior inquiry, which is -- I just want to be clear. You're
not really seeing any increasing instances of your Onsite or legacy branch salespeople not actually being
allowed on customer premises because they're viewed as nonemployees? I guess that's the real question

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

a lot of folks have, is if we do see some sort of a seasonal or intermittent restrictions on nonemployee site
visits, how does that affect the business model? But it would be obviously good if you're not seeing that
across the board or even any instances of it.

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

I'm sure we're seeing examples of it, but what probably happens there is we make arrangements with that
customer, where they still need the product and we'll -- the product probably gets delivered at their dock
as opposed to delivered inside their facility. There are -- we're following the protocols of the customer.

We have, in addition to procuring safety products for our customers, we have lined up and we now have
-- and so we have safety products for our employees. And so many customers now, for our employee to
come into their facility, there are requirements for masks and things like that, and you will see more of
that, I suspect, in the future. And -- but absolutely, we're seeing examples of reduced access. I would say
other partners are probably being impacted more from it than us just because of the intimate relationship
of our stocking right to production lines, of stocking into vending devices. But by all means, a customer
could do that with their own personnel, and we will work with them to build some of the tools to do it.

Operator

Well, it's about 4 minutes until -- this quite possibly could be our final question before top of the hour,
from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.

Hamzah Mazari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Hope you're safe and healthy. Just a question on e-commerce. Do you expect that to be a bigger piece
of your business model coming out of COVID-19? I know with the fastener mix, captive fleet, branch
network, e-commerce historically has not been a big part of the business model. Do you see that changing
at all?

Daniel L. Florness
President, CEO & Director

You're right historically. But in recent -- the last few years, it's really been growing fairly rapidly as we
continue to really present to our customers what the possibilities and options are on our e-commerce
platform. And so we do expect that to continue to be the case.

Now we're always going to be a business that wants to be local, wants to be directly engaged with the
customer, and so e-commerce plays a supplemental role to that. But there are customers that want to use
e-commerce for certain of their purchasing needs. And that's -- our improvement of that platform over
the last 3 years is a big -- and really being able to show that value to the customer is a big reason why it's
growing the way it is.

I will say that, at least to this point, I don't know -- in the Q1 data, I don't know that we see anything
there suggesting that COVID has caused more of our customers to opt to go online versus dealing with us
in the way they traditionally do. That isn't evident in the first quarter numbers to me. Is that something
that emerges in the second quarter or is it something that emerges sort of longer term? I don't really
know, Hamzah. But I do know that we've had a great growth trajectory in terms of adoption of our e-
commerce capabilities among all of our customers but certainly our larger National Account customers as
well. And we do expect that to continue.

Holden Lewis
Executive VP & CFO

I'll just add to that, Hamzah. If you think of what we talked earlier about vending growth over time and
bin stock growth over time, in my way of thinking, these are all e-commerce. So if I take vending and
add bin stock and add discrete e-commerce, it's 35% of our business today. And over time, I see that
being 60%, 70% and 80% of our business simply because it's a more efficient means to procure. And our

17

FASTENAL COMPANY FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 14, 2020

objective is to be -- is create value for the customer that they know it's a reliable supply chain that I can
trust the quality of the product, I can trust the reliability of the supply chain and it's cost-effective. And I
believe we're positioned really well for that. So yes, I expect that to grow faster. I don't know if COVID-19
accelerates that or not, but that's a long-term trend.

Operator

We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to
management for any further or closing comments.
