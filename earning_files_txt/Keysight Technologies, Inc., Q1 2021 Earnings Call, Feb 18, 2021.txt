And now I will turn the call over to Ron.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Keysight delivered another outstanding
quarter. Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, broad-based
momentum across diverse end markets and the durability of our business model. Today, I'll focus my
comments on 3 key headlines. First, we achieved record first quarter orders, driven by growth across all
regions despite China trade headwinds. Second, strong execution by the Keysight team delivered revenue
and earnings growth above guidance. And third, we entered the year with solid momentum across multiple
end markets and confidence in our revenue and earnings growth trajectory for the year.

Despite a short-term expectation of elevated expenses from variable compensation which is due to the
high near-term revenue growth, we expect to achieve mid- to high teens earnings growth in fiscal 2021.

Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered record first quarter orders of $1.2
billion, which again exceeded revenue and grew 7%. First quarter revenue grew 8% to $1.2 billion. As
previously discussed, we faced strong year-over-year headwinds in the first quarter due to China trade
restrictions. Adjusting for this impact, both orders and revenue grew solid double digits.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

We continue to make strong progress towards our long-term financial targets with consistent execution
and enabled by the strength and discipline of the Keysight leadership model. We delivered first quarter
gross margin of 64%, operating margin of 27%, which increased 210 basis points and free cash flow of
$267 million.

Turning to our markets. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter orders
and revenue. 20% revenue growth was driven by continued investment in electromagnetic spectrum
operations, space and the new commercial technologies like 5G and early 6G research.

In commercial communications, we achieved all-time record orders in total as well as for 5G, while
revenue declined 3%. Adjusting for the transit impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, commercial
communications orders grew double digits, and revenue grew high single digits. Strength was driven by
ongoing global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G devices and continued investment in 400G and
800G Ethernet for data centers.

Keysight's end-to-end solutions portfolio is enabling the rapid progression of new technologies, both in
the wireless and wired systems of the communications network, where our value proposition remains
strong. Keysight continues to lead the industry in 5G powered by years of close collaboration with market
makers and standards bodies. We are advancing our 5G strategy to capture emerging opportunities in the
application layer as

momentum builds ahead of deployments in 2021.

We made great progress this quarter as broad industries embrace our 5G platform and new applications
emerge. For example, O-RAN continues to be an area of active investment for our customers. We recently
introduced a suite of end-to-end solutions for O-RAN vendors and mobile operators. Our solutions are used
to verify the interoperability, performance, conformance and security of multi-vendor 5G networks.

We also announced strategic partnerships in the expanding O-RAN space with industry leaders like Xilinx,
Radisys, ArrayComm and Altiostar. In addition, we continue to accelerate Keysight's capabilities to provide
industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions. In Q1, we acquired Sanjole, a leader in wireless
test and measurement solutions for protocol decoding and interoperability. Sanjole's offerings complement
our end-to-end solutions portfolio providing problem-solving tools that extend from inside the wireless
network out through over-the-air analytics.

Record revenue for our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group was driven by double-digit growth in
semiconductors and general electronic solutions. Record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing
investment in next-generation process technologies bolstered by new customer wins in China as we
successfully redeployed our sales force to capitalize on new opportunities.

General electronics strength reflected continued economic recovery with growth across all regions
and improvement in the advanced research education market. In automotive, despite ongoing macro
challenges and demand is stabilizing as strategic investments in advanced technologies have accelerated
in Asia and in the Americas.

In Europe, we continue to expand our presence and recently announced a collaboration with ElringKlinger,
one of the world's leading system partners to the automotive industry.

They chose Keysight's battery test solution to advance e-mobility in the field of battery development for
electric vehicles. Software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Combined,
they were approximately 1/3 of total Keysight revenue contributing significantly to our software-centric
solution strategy and differentiation and further strengthening the durability of our business model with
increasing recurring revenue.

In summary, I'd like to thank our Keysight employees around the world who have reacted dynamically to a
challenging environment to deliver exceptional results for our customers and shareholders. We are pleased
with our first quarter performance and encouraged by the broad-based momentum across our markets
entering the year.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

Now I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered an outstanding
first quarter as the continued economic recovery drove a steady improvement in demand across all major
regions. First quarter revenue of $1.18 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8%
or 6% on a core basis.

Q1 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across multiple end markets and geographies. Total
Keysight orders again exceeded revenue in Q1 with a book-to-bill just over 1. We achieved first quarter
orders of $1.223 billion, up 7% or 5% on a core basis successfully overcoming increased trade restrictions.

Turning to our operational results for Q1. We reported gross margin of 64% and operating expenses of
$439 million were well managed. Resulting in an operating margin of 27%, an increase of 210 basis points
year-over-year. We achieved net income of $270 million and delivered $1.43 in earnings per share, which
is well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188
million shares.

Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record
first quarter revenue of $852 million, up 4%. Was delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin
of 26%. In Q1, commercial communications achieved all-time record total and 5G quarterly orders.
First quarter revenue declined 3% to $558 million, with commercial communications disproportionately
impacted by the China trade restrictions.

Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter revenue of $294 million, an increase
of 20% versus a strong compare in Q1 last year. Growth was driven by robust year-end spending across
all major regions. In the U.S., growth was driven by prime contractor spending, offsetting slightly lower
spending from direct government customers as we saw less-than-expected disruption from the U.S.
administration transition. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $328
million, up 18% from 13% on a core basis.

Orders and revenue for our semiconductor and general electronics measurement solutions both grew
double digits for the second quarter in a row, with strong revenue growth across all regions, particularly in
Asia Pacific.

EISG reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 29%. Moving to the balance sheet and
cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash
flow from operations of $295 million and free cash flow of $267 million or 23% of revenue. Under our
share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 137,000 shares on the
open market at an average price of $145.14 for a total consideration of $20 million. Before moving to our
guidance, I'd like to remind everyone of my comments last quarter, in which I stated that flexible spending
and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY '21 with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all
other quarters.

The principal driver is variable compensation, which is a function of organic revenue growth and operating
margin. Just as we flexed expenses down last year in response to a decline in revenue, it will flex up
this year, particularly in quarters with soft revenue comps, notably Q2 and Q3. We believe our variable
compensation is an important element of not only our flexible cost structure, but our human capital
philosophy in which employees are engaged and participate in both the ups and downs of the business.

Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range
of $1.19 billion to $1.210 billion which represents 34% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q2
earnings per share to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.35 based on a weighted diluted share count of
approximately 188 million shares.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

In closing, we are entering the year with order momentum, a solid backlog position and strong operational
execution. We are pleased with the trajectory of our business and expect to achieve mid- to high teens of
earnings growth for the full fiscal year.

With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.

Jason Kary
Vice President of Treasurer & Investor Relations
Thank you, Neil. Sedarius, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rick Eastman with Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Could you perhaps maybe just kind of walk through a little bit of the operating leverage that we really saw
in both commercial -- Communications Solutions Group. I'm kind of looking at the op profit number of
170 is that -- with the gross margin maybe down, is that primarily all mix? Or maybe give us a couple -- a
little bit of a feel for that. And maybe the same question around EISG, this significant operating leverage
there. I'm curious how much is mix versus volume. I mean that's where it's worth.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Rick, this is Neil. So I think you've hit on it, right? Q4 was a very favorable -- if you're looking
sequentially, Q4 was a very favorable gross margin quarter for us as we really significantly ramp
production after the COVID disruptions of Q2 and Q3. And I think just the nature of us responding to
immediate customer demand for urgent delivery kind of shifted the mix in a favorable direction in the
fourth quarter.

I think what we saw in the first quarter was a return to more normalized mix. It aligns with kind of the
quarters leading up to Q4 as well as slightly lower volume. And I think that, that comment is basically true
across both the Communications Group as well as EISG. There's nothing really specific to either 1 of the 2
businesses.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

And if you also look at the long-term model that we outlined at Analyst Day for FY '23, obviously, our
performance shows very strong against that. And we have no doubt that we'll be able to deliver to that
level going forward.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got you. Great. And then just a quick question, maybe if I could. I'm surprised to see and positively
surprised to see the order growth. And basically, it looks like you held your backlog up kind of in the low
20s year-over-year, 20% year-over-year. I think my math quickly says 23% year-over-year on the backlog
side. And I know you spoke to orders being strong across geographies and across product lines. Is there
any particular place that you might flag, whether it be geography or between the 2 business segments
where you were pleasantly surprised with the order growth in the quarter?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes, I'll mention a couple and then I'll let Mark chime in with a little more detail. First of all, if you look
at China, our China orders were down 6%, and we expected them to be down much more because of the
effects of the China trade restrictions with Huawei. If you were to strip out Huawei, we had 19% order
growth from our other Chinese customers. And as Huawei comes out of the compare in the past, we're
very, very pleasantly surprised and pleased with that performance.

Our Chinese sales force was redeployed from the accounts where they cannot sell into other accounts
within the geography. And we were to do that almost instantaneously to produce the type of results that
we did do. So that was clearly one. India was also very strong. Japan was very strong. Both of those well
into double digits as well as Europe, which also hit double digit performance.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

Mark, you may want to add a couple more regional comments.

Mark A. Wallace
Senior VP & Head of Global Sales

Sure. Ron covered it really well, Rick. But I would just add that about half our growth in China overcoming
to headwinds was from new customers. Again, showing how we're executing and rotating to both new
opportunities and new customers. And we won additional business with our existing customers, whether
that be around 5G to some of the long tail of customers, 400-gigabit Tier 2 customers. And I was very
pleased with semiconductor, very strong growth, again, both from existing large customers as well as
acquiring 2 new fab -- fabless semiconductor customers in the quarter in China. Very strong results in
Japan for 5G and aerospace defense. And then if you look at Europe, it really was a story of this very
broad demand across multiple end markets.

We had growth across most of our countries across Europe. And it really goes to show the strength of our
portfolio and the depth of our penetration into all these end markets.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

I'll add just a couple more comments, Rick. One, our general electronics business was up in orders over
20%, and that's a really good sign. That talks about the macro environment in the industrial markets. So
we're very pleased to see that. And also, our overall corporate strategy and moving to more software-
centric solutions, which requires more software and more services, both software and services both grew
double digits in orders again this quarter.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And really good job on the results in an unclear, uncertain environment. My question is a little bit more
just to help us out. Looking forward, not so much on the trade and tariff stuff. But recently, the supply
chain with the freezing in Texas and chip shortages. Can you talk to us a little bit about -- do you have
some buffer chips that you're okay for the next 3 to 6 months? Or are you tempering your outlook a
little bit? I'm just kind of a little bit concerned about the procurement cycle seems to have this additional
variable.

And then my second question is on OpEx. How should we be thinking about that as hopefully COVID
becomes behind us at some point?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Sure. I'll cover the procurement piece, and then I'll let Neil talk a little bit more on the OpEx formula going
forward. As far as procurement, we have taken into account the long lead time cycles that we're seeing
from semiconductor providers as well as the other environmental impacts that we're seeing around the
world. As a matter of fact, we have just put out guidance where the midpoint is at $1.2 billion for the next
quarter, and that takes into account the semi cycles.

We do hope, though, that things don't get worse from the standpoint of COVID, another surge, although
we feel very confident that we are in good shape to come out with this guidance, which was above the
Street consensus for the next quarter.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Jim, your second question was kind of forward-looking as it related to OpEx and I made some
comments in my prepared remarks. Certainly, I think our underlying investment levels are stable and are

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

likely to be stable going forward, but we do expect some short-term increases over the course of the next
couple of quarters. And well, not the only impact, by far, the biggest driver of that increase is our variable
pay program.

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks last quarter, Q2 expenses are expected to be seasonally higher
than all other quarters this year. The principal driver is the bounce back of variable compensation relative
to last year. And that variable compensation is a function of both organic revenue growth and operating
margin.

And in quarters where we have soft revenue comps and therefore, higher revenue growth, like we will see
in Q2 and in Q3 of this year, our variable compensation is going to be materially higher. So as you saw, we
guided variable -- we guided very strong revenue growth of 34% in Q2 and expect a sequential increase
as a result in our variable compensation program of more than $30 million relative to Q1.

And since all of our nonexecutive employees are participants in that variable pay program. That increases
split roughly equally between cost of sales, R&D and SG&A. So specifically impacting the OpEx lines that
you asked about.

But again, it's important to note that the underlying investment level is stable. And once we get past Q3,
we're going to -- our variable pay and our expense levels are going to return to more normalized levels.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Thanks, Jim. And just to finish that up, if you take a look at our overall model, this is a short term effect,
and that's why for one of the few times we've guided out for the whole year producing EPS growth in the
teens, as we had mentioned in our prepared remarks.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Marchetti with Stifel.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I was wondering if you could just take a moment and talk about some of the strength that you continue
to see in 5G. How much of that maybe is coming from new customers as you sort of hinted at in the
comment about the order strength?

And how much of it is maybe moving into different variants of 5G, whether it's standalone versus non or
millimeter wave versus sub-6?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Satish, feel free to answer this question.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes, I'll take that, Ron. I think one of the effects in 5G that we're seeing as deployments are scaling is the
broader interest in deploying this technology across different end market verticals. And that as a result of
expanding the ecosystem, as we have talked about this quarter, we added over 100 new customers to our
5G platform. So that continues to be strong.

At the highest level, I think we stated it's growth across all regions. For 5G and all parts of the ecosystem.
So it is broad, and we see sort of 4 themes, right? If you look at the R&D investment cycle, there's new
themes such as our Release 16 and O-RAN that are capturing interest, manufacturing opportunities
scale as 5G deploys, and it's profitable manufacturing, as we have talked about, a select manufacturing
strategy.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

And third is the interest in this technology from new verticals, such as aerospace, defense, automotive
and industrial. And finally, we see this long-term steady push to commercialize millimeter wave, as we've
talked about, is a long-term dynamic for our business, which has got an upgrade pattern and to feed this
momentum we've just announced over 30 new product introductions this quarter, and we feel confident
about the projections based on everything we see in the industry.

John Warren Marchetti
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And maybe just as a follow-up there, Satish, do we still -- you guys have mentioned in the past, you think
this market sort of peaks out in '22 or '23 for you. I'm curious if that's still the case or if you think with
some of these newer bits coming on, that actually extends it out a little bit.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. I think based on what we have seen in the past, I think we've sort of seen an industry CapEx
projected to peak due to the millimeter wave parts of 5G being deployed. However, for our business in
comms, we have a broad portfolio of both wired and wireless. And this end-to-end portfolio that we have
created not only has sort of a per incident effect, but as Ron referenced, higher software content, higher
services. So we're much more plugged in and able to monetize the life cycle value of -- from our early
lead.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.

Joseph Lima Cardoso
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So my first question is just around aerospace and defense and the
Electronic Industrial Business segment. Obviously, you had 2 great quarters of execution in a row. I guess
how should we think of the sustainability of the momentum in both those segments and what is driving
your confidence?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Ron, should I take -- yes. So as far ...

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Sure.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

As far as aerospace, defense is concerned, very pleased, record orders and record revenues. And as we
mentioned before, this trend is coming across all the regions, tracking the COVID recovery or macro
recovery, and that's probably a common dynamic between our aerospace, defense business and the
general electronics business in our industrial segment.

Specifically on the aerospace defense, our portfolio is focused on defense modernization, in particular,
around these new themes continue to position us well. The passage of the NDAA or the budget in the
United States in December, we feel cautiously optimistic about the outlook for that business as we look
forward.

And we also have a pretty healthy backlog in the business. So we continue to expect strong growth in the
next couple of quarters. As far as the EISG business is concerned, again, broad strength from our general

11

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

electronics business, but also semiconductor, where we're seeing increased investments driven by the
advanced nodes and the China IC investment that Mark referenced earlier.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

And I would also comment that different foreign factors are contributing to that, such as our modular
solutions had a very strong quarter as well as software and services that have been mentioned earlier, all
play into this general electronics market and the overall EISG market.

Joseph Lima Cardoso
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I appreciate the color. And then just a quick follow-up. I mean, you guys kind of went into detail about the
5G and the momentum that you're seeing there. I'm just curious, can we get an update on how you're
seeing the declines play out on the 4G side? I know last year because of COVID, there was obviously a big
impact there. But are we seeing declines starting to moderate on the 4G side?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Sequentially, 4G has been flat quarter-over-quarter for us, and we're very pleased with the uptick
in 5G, as I referenced, it was a record quarter. And was -- and if you include 5G and 4G together, we've
grown it year-over-year and sequentially quarter-over-quarter. So we feel good about the portfolio. And I
did mention that we've launched 30 new products this quarter to feed that momentum in the market.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

One follow-up for Satish. Can you please help me understand the mix of a 400 and 800-gig Ethernet as a
mix of overall communication sector group? And how do you see that trending, especially as the volume
brand for 400-gig plays out in the second half? And for the -- Neil, it will be great if you could give us
some reference. You -- I think there was a mention of software and services accounting for 1/3 of our
revenue.

Can you give us a qualitative or quantitative assessment of what the mix of software is? Where was it a
year ago? And how should we be thinking about the software mix looking forward?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes, I'll maybe start with the 400-gig question, Mehdi. As we have really done very well with the wireline
technology evolutions over the number of years. And last year was a pretty strong year for 400-gig.
I think we've referenced it on calls. And what we saw this quarter was a broader adoption of 400-gig
technology still heavily driven by data center demand, which tends to -- which is seeing -- which is
adopting, I should say, the 400-gig at scale.

We saw increased spend from Tier 2 and long-term -- long tail customers in Asia, in particular. And we
expect as the 400-gig economies of scale and maturity occur that more of that demand would start to shift
in the telco or metro opportunities. So there is -- we're still on the front end of that.

I would also say that on 800-gig, the investments are in early R&D which we expect to play out in
production in 18 to 24 months. So we're engaged early. Just this quarter, we announced a full suite of R&D
offerings for 800-gig as well, which positions us well to benefit from not only the wireless on the 5G side,
but also from the wireline opportunities in our commercial communications business.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

As far as the software, I'll kick it off and maybe Neil can make a comment. We see for our double-digit
growth in software coming from our PathWave design franchise and from the 5G solutions, which, as
we have referenced before, have a higher percentage of software content with them. We're also seeing
renewals for subscription contracts become important to our 5G growth, which I think helps us with the
ARR. I'll just pass it off to Neil.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Just in terms of the relative size of software, we've said previously that software is approximately 20%
of total revenues. And as Satish has mentioned, it continues to outgrow the broader business by growing
double digits again this quarter. So that makes it increasing slowly over time. And we expect that it will
continue to do so as we continue this migration towards more complete solutions or higher software
content.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Sure. If I may, just a quick follow-up for Neil here. If you execute and deliver software growth above the
top line, could that be potentially a source of gross margin upside that could potentially drive EPS growth
this year towards the high end of mid- to high -- mid-teens, mid- to high teens, sorry.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

I mean certainly, over the long run, we see increasing software content as a driver of gross margin. I think
you've seen that over the past couple of years as we've added software to our portfolio as well as taking
other actions to drive our gross margins northward. The mix shift is not dramatic. It's slow and steady
over time.

So hard for me to draw direct link between a mix shift over the next couple of quarters and immediate EPS
increases, there's a lot of things that are going to go into -- that are going to play a role in determining
that level over the course of the next several quarters. But generally speaking, yes, our software gross
margin improvement over time.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Well, so if you're looking to the short term, if orders were to go ahead in order to exceed our projections
-- when you take a look at our incrementals we have delivered to our model and then some pretty much
consistently over the last 5 years and we expect to continue I do so.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Yes. And I was just trying to understand how conservative is the mid- to high teens EPS growth? And how
should we think about upside from there?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, I think you can see in our guide that we're very encouraged by the market and our
performance in the business on the top line. We do have some short-term expense pressures over the
couple of quarters that will put some pressure on EPS relative to normal incrementals over the course -- or
where the incrementals would otherwise have been over the course of the next several quarters.

But by Q4, where we've kind of returned to -- we kind of lap those comps and the impact that they have
in our business and we've returned to kind of more normalized levels.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I was hoping to dig more into the full year EPS growth commentary of mid- to high teens and recognizing
the very good orders that the company just reported for the quarter. If my math is right, the implied
second half EPS growth is relatively flattish to slightly higher, year-over-year is 5% to 10% or so. And I
understand the higher variable comp, which makes a lot of sense and is a good news.

But is there anything else besides the variable comp that you're trying to factor into the implied EPS
growth guidance that you're discussing today?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Well, the only other thing I have mentioned was -- what I mentioned earlier is that our Q4 gross margins
in last year were extraordinarily favorable, right? Not only do we have the highest revenue quarter
we've had by a pretty significant margin. We had significantly higher gross margins than we'd ever had
previously. So we are going to have a tough year-over-year comp in the fourth quarter that is going to
factor into that ultimate equation as well.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful and makes sense. My other question was on the 5G order strength and the strength
that the company is now seeing within millimeter wave. Can you describe to what extent you're seeing
some increased adoption of millimeter wave in different geographies and perhaps the opportunity for a
millimeter wave deployments to help your business in China?

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Thank you. I think the -- as we have referenced before, the millimeter wave opportunity is a long-
term one for us. We see a very steady increase in interest from our customers. At this point, heavily
driven by the U.S. bands, you think of 20- to 40-gigahertz sort of spectrum. And with new spectrum
coming online, the 66- to 90-gigahertz range, I think that tends to sow the seeds for the runway.

We're talking about China's 2022 Winter Olympics is -- we expect it to be a push with a showcase of
millimeter wave. So those are clearly drivers. And then if you look even further out, you start thinking
about some early research occurring in the terahertz space.

So again, this is a very long-term opportunity. Keysight's got a competitive differentiation. We have talked
about this, and we are well positioned to address this. Currently, we're working with customers to solve
some critical challenges in commercializing millimeter wave like in advanced beam management, peak
higher data rates of 10 gigabits per second and above. And it's a long-term dynamic, and we're well
positioned there.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays.

Peter A. Zdebski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Peter Zdebski on for Tim. Congratulations on the results. On CSG, just again, as we see the 400G
cycle coming closer, could you help us parse out what that has meant for you between your wireline
hardware business versus the network visibility side? And do you have a sense of what inning we are in
that cycle from the test and measurement perspective?

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

And then also on A&D, how should we think about what this very strong Q1 here implies for Q2
seasonality just coming off this very strong base?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I didn't hear the second part of that at all.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

We didn't hear your question. Could you please repeat it?

Peter A. Zdebski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I'm sorry. Is this better?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Just if you could slow down just a touch that would help.

Peter A. Zdebski
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Sure. I was just asking on CSG. Just as we see the 400G cycle coming closer, I was wondering if you could
help us parse out what that has meant for you between the wireline hardware side versus the network
visibility side. And do you have a sense of what inning we are in that cycle from a test and measurement
perspective?

And then just a follow-up on A&D. I was wondering how we should think about Q1 -- Q2 seasonality, given
this very strong Q1 base.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. So I'll take the aerospace defense first. Again, record orders and given the comps from favorable
comps we have for the next couple of quarters, we expect strong revenue performance in the business.
And our focus areas around defense modernization are also aligned with some of the strategic priorities of
the governments around the world. So we feel good about where we are in the business.

With regard to your question on wireline, the entire portfolio of wireline involves the focus on -- in 3 areas.
If you think of it, the focus on high-speed evolutions, 400-gig, 800-gig terahertz -- terabit Ethernet and
beyond. And security as a second theme, which is gaining customer interest. And the third area is on
visibility.

Clearly, we're -- the drivers for the business right now are 400-gig and 800-gig. In terms of the visibility
business, we expect or we're -- everything we hear and we see the pipeline building towards it is a
recovery in enterprise IT spend, which would be a good peg and that to occur as folks return back to work
or in a hybrid mode later on in the year.

So that's probably a driver for that part of the business. But overall, we're pleased with the synergies
we're seeing, and you see that reflected in the strength of our commercial communications business this
quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America.

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

Since you've done the math on the impact from trade restrictions on both orders and revenue, what was
the estimated headwind for both of those?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

It was roughly 6 points -- 6 to 7 points at the Keysight level, obviously, heavily skewed to CSG specifically
to commercial comms. So I think if you get to the commercial comps level it was a double-digit headwind
for the commercial communications business. Putting the record orders for commercial comms in context,
we were extraordinarily pleased with that result given the China trade headwinds on that business.

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then since no one else has picked up on it. I'll ask you tell us a little bit more on the
Sanjole acquisition that you closed. I think it was about $100 million or so from the cash flow revenue,
how it fits into the portfolio? And it seems like it's in a very fast-growing part of the market. So kind of
what's your near-term revenue expectations as well.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. So maybe I'll start by saying it's a smaller acquisition, roughly 0.5 point to the Keysight revenue as
an estimate. And it's highly profitable, and it aligns with our M&A strategy of focusing on software-centric
product categories. And more importantly, enables us to complete all the customer workflow.

Sanjole plays into the interoperability testing space, which enables customers to resolve complex system
issues. And given that the 5G deployments are taking place at scale and new trends like Open RAN are
disaggregating more of the -- what used to be a monolithic block, we believe this acquisition will really
help us continue our momentum with -- in the commercial comms business.

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And then last one for me. I mean, you're now in a net cash position. How do you think about
Keysight's ability to be just -- is being in a net cash position aligned for you?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. So first...

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Go ahead, I'm sorry.

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. Our first objective, obviously, is to grow the business and provide a great return above our WACC. So
we continue to look for M&A opportunities that can further our strategy. But again, if we can't go ahead
and produce an ROIC above our WACC, we're not going to spend it. So you can see we're very deliberate,
and we're very focused. And we will not go ahead and go after things that are too speculative. So that is
our first priority.

The second thing, if we had -- if we have excess funds, at the end of the day, we would rather do that
through opportunistic share repurchases. As you saw, not this quarter, but as you saw in Q4, where our
average price was below $100 in the shares that we did repurchase.

But -- and then third would be to do something like a dividend, but we're far, far from that at this point.
But still, first, we're going ahead and making sure after organic growth is funded through over $700

million in R&D. Second, it's to look for M&A. That could go out and enhance our growth and produce a
higher return on invested capital. Third, clearly, is to look for opportunistic, opportunistic share buybacks,
which we have done.

And we plan to make sure we're at least antidilutive, like we've stated before, but we will get a little bit
more aggressive if we see a very big opportunity.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thomas (sic) [ Thompson ], Davis.

Adam Robert Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

Great quarter. Shoot. I mean, this might be a waste to question, but I got to ask about the Biden
administration and Huawei. There have been some early indications that may be some of the restrictions
get eased. Just curious if you have any thoughts on that?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Well, we don't have any particular insight as to what the Biden administration will do. But I'm very pleased
that we were concerned about having to have that in our compare and to go ahead and seeing what that
would do to our top line when we had to go ahead and stop selling according to the government laws.

And we're very, very pleased that we reported double-digit order growth and revenue growth outside of
our other -- at our other accounts in order to basically smooth right over that.

So if things were to change at Huawei or with any other government restrictions, that would be --
certainly be significant upside for us.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from UBS.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So just following up on the capital allocation. So the company finished the quarter with $1.9 billion of
cash, which is certainly well above historical levels. What do you view to be the optimal level of cash to
keep on hand? And is there a willingness to go after larger acquisition targets? Because while there's been
a steady stream of bolt-on type acquisitions, it feels like that is difficult. It would be difficult to kind of
rightsize the cash balance with these just bolt-ons alone?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Sure. Well, I'll just say this that we had looked at over 300 different acquisitions. And again, we're very
selective. We've made about a dozen at this point, and you're right, most of them have been smaller,
except for 2 of them, and we continue to look for large and small things that fit into our strategy.

But there is a very high hurdle for the large acquisitions. Obviously, the downside or the upside is much
more significant. But when you look at the premium and the amount of dollars that you have to make up
in the premium you pay for a company, we want to make sure that pays off for the shareholders.

We have more cash than we need to run the company right now, but we are aggressively looking at M&A.
And unfortunately, we can't share much more than that.

Neil, you may have something else you want to add though.

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2021

Yes. The only thing I was going to add is that the optimal level of cash -- I would agree with Ron, we have
more cash than we currently need. But the optimal level of cash, there's a lot of things that go into that.
It fluctuates over time. And we're looking to put that cash to work either through value-creating M&A or
looking for opportunities to return at a favorable -- in a favorable fashion like we did in Q4 of last year. So
we'll continue to do that.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then just for the second question, can you talk about the pricing environment, both for CSG and
EISG? And what level of positive pricing, if any, is baked into the company's mid-single-digit long-term
core growth targets?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

We always look at pricing depending on what's going on in the market, and how much a differentiation is
in a particular segment. So clearly, if there's a lot of competition, we don't know if differentiation that is
that great, we cannot go ahead and utilize too much pricing power.

But what we're doing in 5G is certainly unique. We're on the leadership end and not only in different
products, but when you look across the workflow. And we look for opportunities to do so, but we're not
going to gouge our customers. We want to make sure that we have a good long-term environment and
they stick with us.

So we review our pricing at a minimum twice a year, and we look for opportunities for price increases. And
we will continue to do so to drive our margins higher or to offset inflation. But as far as what the amount
is, that's something that we do not state publicly.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Most of my questions has been covered, but Ron, I don't think you've mentioned any color on the auto
market specifically yet. Curious, latest thoughts there? And if there's been kind of any turn perhaps in the
order trends in that market?

Ronald S. Nersesian
Executive Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. Well, I'll let Satish answer this. We've been focusing certainly on a battery test and the overall
infrastructure for EV. We mentioned a win -- a nice win that we had in the prepared remarks earlier, and
we continue to be in a good position in that space. Also, as we look at autonomous vehicles, it's the same
thing. But as far as the market, we've seen the market a little bit more depressed as we all know, in auto.

And I'll let Satish get a chance to comment on where he sees that going.

Satish Dhanasekaran
Senior VP & COO

Yes. Thanks, Ron. We're seeing signs of slow recovery in the auto market. The business is definitely
stabilizing, manufacturing parts of the business are depressed, as Ron referenced. But there is a steady
focus on next-gen R&D with AV and EV applications. Definitely the push around the world for more
electrification, we view as a long-term opportunity. And we're focused on creating value to help extend
the ranges, help with the interoperability needs by implementing global standards, including in China and
focusing on bidirectional charging applications.

With 5G, in particular, we have a differentiated position on C-V2X technology that we're continuing to
progress. So this may be a market where as the auto end market recovers, we start to see even bigger
traction, especially in EV and AV. That's our expectation. But our portfolio is strong. And we continue to be
engaged with customers.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And Neil, could you remind us just what the China trade headwind is on a year-over-year basis to the top
line in the second quarter, is that a similar sort of 6% to 7%?

Neil P. Dougherty
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. What we said before was that it was 5% on the half. Obviously skewed towards -- score skewed
towards Q1. We've just told you Q1 was 6%. So Q2 is in the 3 to 4-ish range.
