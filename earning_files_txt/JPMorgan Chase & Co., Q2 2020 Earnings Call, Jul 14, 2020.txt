JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand
by.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and
Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is
available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.

Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $4.7 billion, EPS of $1.38 and record revenue of
$33.8 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 9%. Included in these results are a number
of significant items: First, a credit reserve build of $8.9 billion and then approximately $700 million of
gains in our bridge book and $500 million of gains in Credit Adjustments & Other, both of which represent
reversals of some of the losses we took in the first quarter. As we continue to navigate this challenging
and uncertain environment, this quarter's performance once again demonstrates the benefits of the
diversification and scale of our platform.

So I'll just touch on a few highlights here. CIB reported its highest quarterly revenue on record, with IB
fees up 54% and Markets revenue up 79% year-on-year, each representing record performances with
strength across the board. We saw record consumer deposit growth of 20%, up over $130 billion year-
on-year. And firm-wide average deposits were $1.9 trillion, up 25% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-
quarter.

Average loans were up 4% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely reflecting the COVID-related
loan growth that we saw in March. However, on an end-of-period basis, loans were down 4% quarter-on-
quarter due to revolver paydowns as well as lower balances in Card and Home Lending, partially offset by
the impact of $28 billion of PPP loans.

And lastly, we increased our CET1 ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter after building
approximately $9 billion of reserves and paying nearly $3 billion of common dividends.

As you'll recall, we started the second quarter on the back of unprecedented levels of business activity in
March. On the following pages, I'll give you an update on some of those key activity metrics we looked at
last quarter and share what we're seeing today. So with that, let's turn to Page 2.

Starting with Wholesale on the top of the page, we saw record levels of debt and equity issuance in the
quarter as clients sought to pay down the majority of the revolver draws for March and continued to shore
up liquidity while market conditions were receptive, supported by extraordinary Central Bank actions. The
surge in investment-grade debt issuance seen in March continued throughout the second quarter. And as
high-yield markets reopened, U.S. issuance volumes increased by 90% compared to the first quarter.

In ECM, as markets rebounded to pre-COVID levels, May and June together were our 2 busiest months for
equity issuance ever, driven by converts end follow-ons.

Moving to consumer spending behavior on the bottom left. Debit and credit sales volume, while overall
still down, has consistently trended upwards since the trough in the second week of April to down just 4%
year-on-year in the last 2 weeks of June. T&E and restaurant spend continued to be down meaningfully,
but we have seen some improvement, especially on the back of higher levels of restaurant spend. The
most significant improvement we saw was in retail with a strong recovery in card-present volume in the

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

second half of the quarter and consistently strong growth in card-not-present volume throughout the
quarter.

More recently, we've seen the improvement in overall sales growth across the country flatten out, notably
in both states with increasing cases and states with decreasing cases. We continue to see larger year-on-
year declines in states that remain partially closed, particularly those in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
regions.

In terms of consumers' demand for credit, we observed similar recovery trends. In Auto, April saw the
lowest level of loan and lease originations since the financial crisis. But activity rebounded sharply in May
and June. And in fact, June ended up the best month for auto originations in our history. And in Home
Lending, retail purchase applications, after reaching a low in April, recovered to well above pre-COVID
levels in June due to a strong and broad market recovery.

Continuing on the topic of consumer behavior, let's turn to Page 3 for an update on what we're seeing
around our customer assistance program. Relative to the peak levels we observed at the beginning of
April, we've seen a significant decline in new requests for assistance over the quarter. To date, we have
provided customer assistance for nearly 1.7 million accounts, representing $79 billion of balances across
both our owned and serviced portfolios. And of those accounts, a large percentage having made at least
one payment while in the forbearance period, just over 50% in both Card and Home Lending.

In terms of early reenrollment trends. In Card, only a small portion of our customers have completed
both the initial 90-day deferral period and reached a payment date, but the majority of those customers
resumed payments, with less than 20% of accounts requesting additional assistance. And then in Home
Lending, of those whose forbearance period expired in June, most have either been extended at the
customer's request or auto enrolled into new 3-month forbearances, with approximately 40% of the
extension still current. And so while we're following this data closely, it's still too early to draw any
conclusions.

Now moving on to Page 4 for some more detail about our second quarter results. We recorded revenue
of $33.8 billion, which was up $4.3 billion or 15% year-on-year. While net interest income was down
approximately $600 million or 4% on lower rates, mostly offset by higher Markets NII and balance sheet
growth, noninterest revenue was up $4.9 billion or 33% predominantly driven by CIB, Markets and IBCs.

Expenses of $16.9 billion were up approximately $700 million or 4% year-on-year on revenue-related
expenses, partially offset by continued reduction in structural expenses. This quarter, credit costs were
$10.5 billion, including a net reserve build of $8.9 billion and net charge-offs of $1.6 billion.

Let's turn to Page 5 for more detail on the reserve build. Our net reserve build of $8.9 billion for the
quarter consists of $4.6 billion in wholesale and $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly Card. The reserve
increase in the first quarter was predicated on an acute but short-lived downturn with a solid recovery in
the second half of the year. And while we have seen some positive momentum in the economy over recent
weeks, there does continue to be significant uncertainty around the path of the recovery.

At the bottom of the page, you can see our updated base case. But remember, this is just 1 of 5 scenarios
we use to derive our allowance for credit losses. Our build is based on the weighted outcome of these
scenarios and assumes a more protracted downturn with a slower GDP recovery and an unemployment
rate that remains in the double digits through the first half of 2021. In addition to the obvious impact
on consumers, this protracted downturn is expected to have a much more broad-based impact across
wholesale sectors than we assumed in the first quarter.

Given the increased uncertainty of the macroeconomic outlook, how customer payment behavior will play
out and the future of government stimulus and its ultimate effectiveness as it relates to both consumers
and wholesale clients, we've put more meaningful weight on the downside scenario this quarter. And so
therefore, we're prepared and have reserved for something worse than the base case. And given CECL
covers life of loan, if our assumptions are realized, we wouldn't expect meaningful additional reserve
builds going forward.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 6. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%,
which is over 100 basis points above our new SCB-based minimum of 11.3%. And just to touch on SLR,
while our reported ratio is 6.8%, it's worth noting that we're not going to rely on temporary relief. And so
without that, our ratio is 5.7%.

As we said in late June, unless things change meaningfully, the Board intends to maintain the $0.90
dividend in the third quarter. Given the wide range of potential outcomes going forward, I'd like to spend a
few minutes on why we're comfortable saying that, including the value of our strong and steady earnings
stream as well as how we're managing our capital through this crisis.

So with that, let's go to Page 7. It's an obvious point, but it's worth a reminder that since 2018, our
average quarterly PPNR of over $13 billion has been generating over 60 basis points of new CET1 capacity
per quarter, even after having made meaningful investments in our businesses. This powerful earnings
stream allows us to grow the franchise and serve our customers and clients when they need us most, and
it provides us the capacity to absorb losses and quickly replenish capital in times of stress.

While over the last 2.5 years, we've paid out approximately 100% of cumulative earnings, distributing
nearly $75 billion of excess capital, we're now building a significant amount of capital since we've
suspended our share repurchases. And we believe our capital base remains strong even in more severe
scenarios, which you can see on Page 8.

Standing here today, we have $34 billion of reserves and $191 billion of CET1 capital, of which $16 billion
is excess over and above our regulatory buffers. Our 3.3% SCB translates to $51 billion of capital that is
available to prefund stress at any time. And on top of that, our 3.5% GSIB surcharge translates to another
$54 billion. All that, so our $69 billion regulatory minimum is never touched.

And as you know, we prepare for and manage our capital to a number of scenarios, and one of them is the
extremely adverse scenario that Jamie discussed in his shareholder letter earlier this year. We've updated
this analysis, and it now assumes an even deeper contraction of GDP, down nearly 14% at the end of 2020
versus 4Q '19; and reported unemployment ending the year at nearly 22%. Even under this scenario, we
estimate that we would end the year with a CET1 ratio above 10%, and we would be bound by advanced,
so our regulatory minimum would be 10.5%.

While we are not likely to voluntarily dip into any of our regulatory buffers, this scenario would require us
to do so, but notably only to a small extent. It's also worth noting that based on the limited information
provided from the Fed about their U and W scenarios, we believe that our extremely adverse scenario
simulates an even worse path for the economy over the next 12 months. And even if we get this wrong
and our losses are twice as high, we still wouldn't use the entire SCB.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Yes, so this is Jamie. I'd just like to amplify a couple of these points. So we're showing this example.
Obviously, it's predicated on a lot of assumptions which we're not going to give you a lot of detail on, just
simply to show that we can bear another $20 billion of loan loss reserves. That $20 billion brings us to an
extreme adverse which roughly may equate to the U or W of the Fed, and we're going to do a lot more
analysis on that because, obviously, we need to be prepared for that.

We dip into advanced CET1, but that's because we're taking no actions. So I've always told you that
advanced capital is very pro-cyclical. So as things get downgraded, your RWA goes way up. Your capital
base doesn't change that much, but the RWA goes way up. And there will be lots of actions we would take
that we could avoid that from taking place whatsoever.

The other thing I want to point out is this extreme adverse probably can't happen in 1 quarter. It'll
happen several quarters. Because we already know kind of what July looks like and August and stuff like
that. So even if the economy starts to head there, it'll take us a couple of quarters before you make the
determination that, that has a 100% possibility. So remember, this is saying we now believe it's 100%.
Now of course, things could be worse, by the way. But we're just trying to show you how much capital the
company does have.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

And the dividend, now I'm going to be -- it sounds like I'm going to contradict myself. I am not, okay?
Today, we have all of that PPNR, all of that earnings, all of the things. So it would be kind of be foolish to
guess the future of extreme adverse and cut your dividend because we can easily get through very, very
tough times and never cut the dividend.

However, if you enter something like an extreme adverse, all of a sudden, you have new scenarios which
are even worse. You don't know. So at one point, the Board would consider cutting the dividend because
things can get even worse than extreme adverse, and we want to be able to handle anything out there.
The primary concern of the company is to serve our clients, serve our community through thick or thin,
and no one should ever worry about JPMorgan Chase. So there's no intent to do it, but if things get really
bad, and we use the words materially and significantly, that's something we should look at.

The other thing, by the way, is these loan losses are our best estimate of loan losses. They're not the
CCAR type of stuff. You all are doing estimates that show DFAST and Fed adverse. We will not lose that
kind of money on credit, okay?

And on the next page, Jen is going to explain some stuff. I'm going to make a few slight, additional
comments. I also want you to -- and she said that we're not going to use temporary buffers. I think
temporary is a funny thing when you go into a crisis. I mean you could use it for a while, but it disappears
on March 1 or February 1. So -- and my view is we shouldn't rely on anything like that.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

And I'll just add, Jamie, to the point on advanced RWA. If you look on the slide, and you can see we
travel from 13.1% to 10.4%. About half of that is just the RWA increasing. And the other half is the [ loss
increasing ].

So anyway, as Jamie said, moving on to Page 9. All of this is against the backdrop of a capital framework
that still has opportunities for recalibration. So while we've talked about this for years, it has perhaps
never been more important.

I'll start with CCAR, and Jamie just made this point, but it is not predictive of what we actually think would
happen. And the best example of this might be the global market shock. It is a significant portion of the
SCB, and we've obviously experienced a very different result here in the first half of 2020. So we continue
to believe that there are opportunities to rationalize the overall capital framework, including the points
we've repeatedly made about GSIB. These changes would foster a higher pace of economic growth over
time without compromising financial stability.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So again, I just want to emphasize a couple of things here. So look, the point of CCAR was that banks
couldn't handle extreme stress and if everything goes wrong. CCAR itself is not a predictive forecast of
what your results might be. So all the CCAR tests roughly equate to a global financial crisis. And all the
CCAR tests always have us losing somewhere between $25 billion and $30 billion over the ensuing 9
quarters. But in the ensuing 9 quarters after Lehman, we made $30 billion. We never lost money in a
quarter. We take actions, we diversify, we've got a lot of streams of earnings.

And so I'm not -- we're not against CCAR because that's protecting you from the worst of the worst of
the worst, but that's not necessarily predictive. The global market shock, which I think they have as $25
billion in counterparty losses, again, just to be instructive of that, in '08, '09, you had Fannie Mae go
bankrupt, Freddie Mac go bankrupt, you had Bear Sterns effectively, you had Lehman Brothers effectively,
you had AIG effectively, you had tons of financial institutions in Europe, tons of counterparty failures. And
our trading results in the worst 2 quarters combined was a loss of $4 billion, not $25 billion.

And of course, it was quickly made back because, as we pointed out, when things get bad in trading,
spreads gap out. And then all of a sudden, you're making more money trading because you -- and you

7

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

have recoveries in positions. So the stress capital buffer of 3.3% is not indicative of what we would lose.
And so -- and I hope over time, we can drive that down by taking real actions to a number closer to 2.5%.

GSIB itself, I pointed out before, I'm not against the concept of big banks and more capital. But GSIB
is -- it's not the same as CCAR. CCAR includes your diversification, your strengths, your earnings, your
PPNR and things like that. GSIB does not. It's just a measure of size multiplied over and over and over. It
doesn't include diversification. It doesn't include margins. It doesn't include actions. It doesn't include --
and it's just really not representative at all that I would say is risk of a company or something like that.

And so we have enough capital to handle a lot of stuff, which is -- we've always run the company that way.
We've always run the company so that we can handle adverse times because in my short lifetime, I've
seen crises over and over and over. We're not predicting them, we're just prepared for them. So I'll stop
there.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Thank you. All right. So let's go on to the businesses. So we'll start on Page 10 with Consumer &
Community Banking. So CCB reported a net loss of $176 million, including reserve build of $4.6 billion.
Revenue of $12.2 billion was down 9% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, lower
transaction activity and customer relief, partially offset by strong deposit growth and Home Lending
margin expansion.

Deposit margin was down 108 basis points year-on-year on a sharp decline in rates, but deposit growth
was a record 20% year-on-year, up over $130 billion. We would estimate that approximately 50% of
that growth is COVID-related due to government stimulus for consumers and small businesses, lower
consumer spending and tax payment delays.

Mobile users were up 10% year-on-year. And since the start of the pandemic, we've seen increased levels
of digital engagement. For example, quick deposit enrollment is up 2x pre-COVID levels.

As I noted earlier, for Consumer Lending, the overall activity for the quarter reflected an environment that
continued to evolve. Auto loan and lease originations were down 9% year-on-year due to the exit of the
Mazda partnership. Excluding this impact, auto originations were up mid-single digits. And while the Home
Lending market was favorable, Home Lending total originations were down 1% year-on-year driven by a
decline in correspondent volume, substantially offset by an increase in retail volume. Total CCB loans were
down 7% year-on-year driven by Home Lending down 14% due to prior loan sales and Card down 7% on
lower spend, offset by Business Banking, up 59% due to PPP originations.

Expenses of $6.6 billion were down 3% driven by lower travel-related benefits, structural and marketing
expenses. And lastly, credit cost included the $4.6 billion reserve build I mentioned earlier and net charge-
offs of $1.3 billion driven by Card.

Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 11. CIB reported net income of $5.5 billion and
an ROE of 27% on revenue of $16.4 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3.4 billion was up 91% year-
on-year, largely driven by our strong performance in capital markets as well as the gains on our bridge
book, which were primarily a function of improved market conditions.

IB fees for the quarter were an all-time record, up 54% year-on-year. We maintained our #1 rank and
grew our market share to 9.8% for the first half of the year.

In Advisory, we were up 15% driven by the closing of a few notable transactions. Debt underwriting fees
were up 55%. We maintained our #1 rank in overall wallet, and we're the leaders and the lead left across
leveraged finance.

In equity underwriting, fees were up 93%, and we grew share by approximately 200 basis points relative
to the first quarter.

With regards to outlook, we expect third quarter IB fees to be down, both sequentially and year-on-year,
due to the usual seasonal declines and lower M&A announcements year-to-date. And if the economy

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

begins to stabilize, we expect capital markets to revert to normal levels. However, any sustained period of
instability could result in additional demand for liquidity and therefore increased capital markets activity.

Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $9.7 billion, up 79% year-on-year, an all-time record, driven by
strong performance throughout the quarter, and it was only later in June that activity began to revert
to more normal levels. We saw strength across products and regions from both flow trading and large
episodic transactions. While strong client activity was a continuation of the first quarter theme, our
market-making activity this quarter benefited from improved market liquidity, and we were able to better
monetize flows.

Fixed income was up 99% year-on-year or 120% adjusted for the gain from the IPO of Tradeweb last year
driven by very active primary and secondary markets across products, particularly in macro. Equities was
up 38% largely driven by strong client activity in equity derivatives and cash.

Looking forward, we expect the slowdown that we started to see towards the end of June to continue. In
addition, the second half of last year was very strong, making any year-on-year comparison difficult. But
obviously, the environment makes forecasting Markets performance even more challenging than usual.

Wholesale Payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 3% year-on-year primarily driven by a reporting
reclassification in Merchant Services. Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year-on-year
as continued elevated volatility in the second quarter drove increased transaction volumes and higher
average deposit balances. Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $510 million as I mentioned upfront
driven by the tightening of funding spreads on derivatives and was a partial reversal of the losses in the
first quarter. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 19% compared to the prior year due to revenue-related
expenses. Finally, credit costs of $2 billion reflects the net reserve build I referred to earlier.

Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 12. Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $691
million, which included reserve builds of approximately $2.4 billion. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 5%
year-on-year, driven by higher deposits and loans an equity investment gain and higher Investment
Banking revenue, largely offset by lower deposit NII. Record gross Investment Banking revenues of $851
million were up 44% year-on-year due to increased bonds and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of
$899 million were down 3% year-on-year driven by lower structural expenses.

Deposits of $237 billion were up 41% year-on-year as the increase in balances from March has largely
remained on our balance sheet as clients look to remain liquid in this environment. End-of-period loans
were up 7% year-on-year but down 4% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 7% quarter-on-quarter
as revolver utilization, while still elevated, has declined significantly from the all-time highs in March.
However, this was partially offset by the impact of PPP loans. CRE loans were flat with generally lower
originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. Credit cost of $2.4 billion included
the reserve builds mentioned earlier and $79 million of net charge-offs, roughly half of which were in oil
and gas.

Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 13. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of
$658 million with pretax margin and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was up 1% year-
on-year as growth in average deposit and loan balances, along with higher brokerage activity, were largely
offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.5 billion were down 3% year-on-year with lower
structural as well as volume and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by continued investments in
advisers. Credit costs were $223 million driven by the reserve builds that I mentioned earlier.

For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $29 billion, positive across all channels and all regions, led
by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity inflows of $95 billion, making us the
#1 institutional money manager globally. AUM of $2.5 trillion and overall client assets of $3.4 trillion, up
15% and 12% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-
term products. And finally, deposits were up 20% year-on-year on growth in interest-bearing products;
and loans were up 12%, with strength in both Wholesale and Mortgage Lending.

Now on to Corporate on Page 14. Corporate reported a net loss of $568 million. Revenue was a loss of
$754 million, down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, including

the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities. And expenses of $147 million was down $85 million
year-on-year.

Now let's turn to Page 15 for the outlook. You'll see here that despite the uncertain environment, our
latest full year outlook remains largely in line with our previous guidance. Based on the latest implies, we
expect net interest income to be approximately $56 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately
$65 billion, which is slightly higher than expected previously, reflecting the outperformance in the second
quarter and will ultimately be an outcome of our performance in the second half of the year.

So to wrap up. Against the backdrop of an unprecedented environment, our second quarter performance
highlighted the benefits of our diversification and scale and the resulting earnings power of our company.
While the range of outcomes is broader than ever before, our priorities remain unchanged. We are focused
on supporting our employees, customers, clients and communities around the globe and on being good
stewards of the capital entrusted to us by our shareholders.

I'd like to end by thanking all of those who continue to serve on the front lines of this crisis and our people
here at JPMorgan Chase, who have demonstrated unwavering fortitude and dedication through these
times.
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous.

John Eamon McDonald
Autonomous Research LLP

Jen, I was wondering if you could give us some incremental color on your commercial exposures to
heavily COVID-impacted sectors across CRE and C&I, so thinking oil and gas, travel, retail. Just to help us
understand the types of areas where your incremental commercial reserve-building was directed towards
this quarter.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So I'll start by saying the most impacted sectors, like the ones that you mentioned, represents
about 1/3 of our overall exposure. More than half of that is investment-grade, and 2/3 of the
noninvestment-grade is secured.

And in terms of the second quarter downgrades. Well first, I'd say in the first quarter, when we were really
looking at a deep but short-lived downturn, we were really very much focused on the most impacted
sectors. And now that we're looking at a more protracted downturn, we're reserved for a much more
broad-based impact across sectors.

So just to put that in context, the second quarter reserve build, about 40% of that is in the most impacted
sectors versus 2/3 of the build in the first quarter was the most impacted sectors. And then in terms of the
downgrades that we saw in the second quarter, less than 1/3 of those were in the most impacted sectors.

John Eamon McDonald
Autonomous Research LLP

And just for your definition of most impacted sectors, what would you be including in that?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Consumer and retail, oil and gas, real estate, retail and lodging and subsectors as you think about real
estate.

John Eamon McDonald
Autonomous Research LLP

Okay, and just a quick follow-up question. You maintained the NII outlook for the year despite a pretty big
drop in net interest margin. Could you talk about the dynamics embedded in that second half outlook for
NII and maybe how trading NII might play into the thinking?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's a great question, and you're spot on, which is Markets helps NII. So the outperformance in
Markets helps NII, but can be a headwind on NIM, just given that the NIM is below the average. So yes,
it was -- maintaining that outlook did have something to do with the outperformance of Markets. You're
right.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Jennifer, just to kick off on the question. On Page 3, you went through a lot of detail around the
forbearance that you've been given and the percentage that has been paying you at least once during the
deferral period. Could you give us a sense on these different asset classes that you've outlined? In your
base case, what are you assuming those delinquencies end up becoming?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

So I won't go into specific details, but I'll just say a couple of things, which is, it is still too early to really
read a whole lot into what we're seeing. The visibility here remains low, I would say, given the amount
of support that is out there. But you are right that we are considering these customers to be higher risk,
given that they are in forbearance programs. So we did account for that as we thought about our reserves.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, okay. Because I'm thinking, all right, you've got the inverse of the right-hand column could be
construed as what should be expected to become delinquencies over time.

And I'm wondering, as a follow-up question, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that, if your
assumptions are realized, that you could be basically close to fully reserved for this cycle. Maybe you could
give us a sense as to which assumptions you're talking about because I know you're expecting an outcome
that's worse than your base case. So I was just a little confused about what I should assume your base
case is and what assumptions you're pointing to that, if realized, you're done on the reserving.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So first of all, there are a lot of assumptions, given, as I said, the visibility is still quite low. So
assumptions around the economic outlook, and I'll come back to that; assumptions around consumer
payment behavior; and then assumptions around stimulus.

So going back to the economic outlook, we have 5 different scenarios. We did lean in more heavily to the
downside scenarios relative to what we would have otherwise done. Even the Fed has put equal weight on
downside scenarios in their base case. So we certainly thought having a conservative bias there was the
prudent thing to do.

And so as you look at that Slide 5, that is just the base case. So you can see there exiting this year just
under 11%. When you then look at the weighted outcome of unemployment across the 5 scenarios, we
end up with double-digit unemployment through the first half of 2021 versus what you see on Page 5
there, is just the base case, which shows some improvement relative to the fourth quarter, getting down
to just under 8% by the end of 2021.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Betsy, so I just clarify. The base case, if you took Morgan Stanley's estimates or Mike Feroli's or JPMorgan
or the Fed estimates for their base case, that is basically the base case. Embedded in that are all these
assumptions about stimulus and PPP and all these other things. But that is the base case, and we're
reserved more than that. So therefore, if the base case happens, we may be over-reserved. I hope the
base case happens.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Me too.

Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Seaport.

James Francis Mitchell
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Maybe just a quick follow-up on the consumer and delinquencies. Obviously, you had an impact from
deferral programs, and delinquencies actually -- 30-day delinquencies were actually down. Can you talk
to what you're seeing in the nondeferral programs? It doesn't seem like we're seeing much stress at all,
even in early stage delinquencies. What would you attribute that to? And what are you seeing in your
nondeferral programs?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

I mean, simply, I would attribute it to the amount of support that is out there in the form of stimulus. And
so as I said, the visibility on what we're dealing with is very, very low because we're not seeing right now
what you would typically expect to see given a recession. And so the way we have to think about reserving
is all about the outlook because we're not actually seeing it today.

And so Jamie has said this many times. May and June will prove to be the easy bumps in terms of this
recovery. And now we're really hitting the moment of truth, I think, in the months ahead.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And just to amplify it. In a normal recession, when unemployment goes up, delinquencies go up,
charge-offs go up, home prices go down, none of that's true here, incomes go down, savings go down.
Savings are up, incomes are up, home prices are up. So you will see the effect of this recession, you're
just not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus, and in fact, 60% or 70% of the unemployed
are making more money than they were making when they were working. So it's just very peculiar times.
And...

James Francis Mitchell
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Yes. No, that's fair. Maybe a follow-up on DFAST. Jamie, you made comments about the market shock,
and we kind of went through a market shock, and everyone's trading held up quite well. Do you see that
changing the Fed's view over time in terms of how they think about stress losses in the trading book? Or is
it -- or you don't think that's too optimistic?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I don't expect any change. And like I said, they're not -- what they're looking at is they're making sure
a bank can withstand the bad -- as if they were all the worst bank. They're not giving credit to banks for
things happy and good, so I'm not against that concept. I just want to say, if it goes really bad and you
do everything totally wrong, what happens to your trading for something like that? And they do the same
assumptions like outflows. The outflows they have on liquidity are worse than the outflows of the worst
bank in the worst crisis. But they just want to make sure that every bank can withstand that.

Operator

Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Great. Quick question on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously, there's tremendous balance sheet growth
as liquidity built up in the quarter. But how are we thinking about that on a go-forward basis? Is that
expected to roll off over the next couple of quarters? Or is that kind of persistent and expected to stick
around, and you're just going to be operating with a much larger balance sheet in the near term?

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

So I'll start with deposits. I mean, in the first quarter, it was very much a wholesale story, and we said we
expect it to normalize, and we have seen that. We started to see that. So looking ahead on wholesale, I
think there are puts and takes. We'll continue to see revolvers paid down, Securities Services will likely
continue to normalize. I think tailwinds for deposits, Fed balance sheet expansion will be slower but will
continue and we do think we'll continue to see organic growth. On the consumer side, probably down from
here on tax payments as well as a pickup in consumer spending. But in both cases, I think we'll continue
to see very, very strong year-on-year growth, both for wholesale and consumer in the latter part of this
year.

And then in terms of balance sheet management, I mean, we manage the balance sheet across multiple
dimensions: NII, liquidity, capital and interest rate risk. And so we have had $400 billion of deposit growth
since the end of last year. And when you consider, as you know, that some of that growth is likely to be
transitory and deployment opportunities have been diminished given the rate environment, we have held
a decent amount of that in cash. However, we did add about $88 billion in securities here in the second
quarter.

And on the deposit side, we've been very disciplined on pay rates.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

So if those deposits have grown, we should expect more to migrate from deposits on the asset side into
securities? Or are you looking to fund loans on those?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

As the Fed grows the balance sheet, it's going to end up in deposits. And for the most part, those deposits
end up in securities because the loan growth usually going into a recession doesn't go up that much.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We should see -- as consumer spending recovers, we should see some growth in Card, which will help
us. But we'll have PPP starting to pay down, and as Jamie said, loan growth but likely slower.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I'd just point out that look at the big numbers. We have over $1 trillion between cash held at the Central
Bank, which is close to $400 billion, $500 billion; treasuries, which is close to several hundred billion;
and other very liquid assets, mostly good securities, that's $1 trillion. So when people look at the safety
and soundness of an institution like this, that is a tremendous sum of money. Some is required. We are
required to hold a lot of liquidity, but some of it just because we're investing conservatively.

Operator

Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the expected timing of starting to see some charge-
offs. Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns with the stimulus and the forbearance. But what are your
assumptions in terms of when charge-offs start going up, maybe where they peak, and how long they stay
at that level?

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

It's really difficult to know. I mean, first, we have to start seeing delinquencies. And so later this year --
but next year will be much heavier on charge-offs as you think about realizing the assumptions that we've
made in the reserves. It's very -- it's difficult to know. The good thing is CECL is life of loan, so we feel
well-covered for the scenarios that we're looking at.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And then remind us, you are seeing some creep in the nonperforming assets. Obviously, it's off low levels,
but they are starting to go up. And remind us why that's not starting to feed into net charge-offs. Or is
this just a timing issue and will in the next quarter or 2?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. When you look at the nonaccrual increase in wholesale, half of that is one client. So it's really -- I
wouldn't draw any conclusions from that. And as you say, it's creeping up off of very low levels. So again,
we still aren't seeing what you would expect to see in terms of recessionary indicators.

Operator

Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just more on the reserve question. So if the Fed's base case is achieved, then you are over-reserved. If
your base case assumptions, which are...

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

We hope. We hope we're over-reserved -- okay.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And if your base case assumptions, which are more conservative, are realized, then okay, you're
done with the reserve-building. And if it's worse, then you'll have to add more reserves.

But since the end of the quarter, we're seeing an increase in COVID cases in Florida, in Texas, in California
and elsewhere. And isn't there a link between an increase in COVID cases with death, with economic
activity? Or how do you think about that?

And I'm staring at Slide 2 and I can't get my eyes off that debit and credit card sales volume. And it
seems like it's flattening off here in June. So just since the end of the quarter, if you were to kind of mark-
to-mark your thinking -- mark-to-market your thinking as of this second with what's happening, do you
feel better, worse or the same versus the end of the quarter as it relates to your assumptions?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

So can I just -- we feel exactly the same today that we did at the end of the quarter, that's sort of mark-
to-market. And Mike, we're very clear, we cannot forecast the future. We don't know. We're also very clear
that -- and I know at least I think, you're going to have a much murkier economic environment going
forward than you had in May and June. And that we -- you have to be prepared for that. You're going to
have a lot of ins and outs. You're going to have people getting scared about COVID. They're going to get
scared about the economy, small businesses, big companies, bankruptcies, emerging markets. So it's just
going to be murky, which is why if you look at the base case, an adverse case, an extreme adverse case,
they're all possible, and we're just guessing at the probabilities of those things. That's all we're doing.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

We are prepared for the worst case. We simply don't know. I don't think anyone knows. And this -- the
word unprecedented is rarely used properly. This time, it's being used properly. It's unprecedented what's
going on around the world. And obviously, COVID itself is a main attribute.

So the Fed's W case, they made it very clear. Their W case is that COVID comes back in a big way in the
fall and you have to shut down the economy again. And obviously, we've got to be prepared for that, too.
We don't know the probability of that. We simply don't know, and I think by the way, spend all waking
time guessing.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

And I would just add, Mike, just to clarify, that we are reserved for something worse than the base
case. And for all the reasons you said, they informed our decision to lean in a bit more on the downside
scenarios. And so while there is a bit of a -- we hope, a conservative bias here, this does represent
our best estimate based upon everything we know, which does include the sort of slowdown that you
referenced in terms of more recent activity.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

All right. And my follow-up would be kind of the flip side. During this very difficult time, you've grown
deposits over the past year equal to the fifth-largest bank. I mean, the deposit growth is kind of off the
charts here. So you said half of that is due to COVID, but is the other half due to share gains? So I guess
there's several questions in that. But how much of that is related to digital banking, and how much of that
do you expect to go away once this crisis has passed?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

So I talked a little bit about kind of how we're thinking about deposits looking forward. Also, I'd just
clarify, Mike, when we said 50% COVID-related, that was on the consumer side. And so that, we do think
some of that will leave with tax payments and consumer spending coming back. And then in terms of how
much of it is share gain, it's difficult to know at this point. Historically, we have performed well in lower
rate environments. And I think you're right. I think it is because of our digital capabilities and our branch
footprint and our people and all the things that we offer that differentiate us in a time like this.

Operator

Our next question is from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

The first question is for Jamie. A lot of investor feedback has indicated that they are encouraged by the
fact that banks can remain profitable while absorbing pretty significant provisions, which you've proven
today, but are hesitant about bank stocks, given the overhang of the DFAST resubmissions in the fourth
quarter and what that could imply for the dividend. And I guess, I just -- I know you alluded to this in
your prepared remarks, but I'm wondering, under the scenario that you see playing out and relative to
that 60 basis points of CET1 generation per quarter, what is your view on dividend sustainability outside of
that extreme adverse case?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

That it's completely sustainable. And if you -- if we enter the extreme adverse case, the Board should and
will consider reducing it. And like I pointed out, the FEMA adverse case itself is completely sustainable
with the dividend. The reason they would consider reducing it is because once you enter like 14% or 15%
unemployment, you don't know the future. So now you're going to have another extreme adverse case,

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

which is going to be 20% unemployment. And therefore, you would protect yourself from that, and cutting
the dividend is cheap equity.

And so the goal is to sustain the dividends. You can look at the numbers, it's completely minuscule relative
quarter-by-quarter. So this decision can be made as you enter these things. And we're all hoping the base
case happens.

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And just as a quick follow-up. We also got this question from investors. In the extreme adverse case,
is there a preference towards cutting the dividend or a temporary suspension? Or is there a difference
between the 2?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

There's no difference between the 2. If you cut your dividend, you're going to hopefully put it back when
the time comes and -- but a temporary suspension just sounds peculiar. It's a suspension. And I've done
that twice in my life. It's a prudent thing to do, and if you might need that capital going forward because
things are going to get that terrible or something like that.

But the other thing, and you can ask the other question. If the base case happens, we're going to end
up with far too much capital generation, and we'll start buying back stock again, which I hope we can do
before it goes way up.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Question for you. So we've had this big market rebound in the overall markets, and that's led to a lot of
revenue. But given this outlook and the uncertain path that we've been talking through this whole time,
I'm curious on ways you think about potentially derisking on the balance sheet. Now some of it is just this
huge liquidity buildup is a derisked balance sheet, I get that. But are there proactive things you can do to
reduce the high-leverage RWA in a more stressed environment? Have you been selling into this recovery
is, I guess, my question.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

I was just going to say, I guess there's 2 components to it, which is the investment securities portfolio,
and then proactive things we can do on RWA. If that answers your question, Glenn.

I'll start with investment securities. We are being cautious, and we have opportunistically looked to reduce
credit exposure there over the second quarter. And then on RWA, we are -- because we're preparing for
a range of outcomes, we are spending a lot of time thinking about, if we needed to, what could we do?
But it is sort of a last resort because we certainly don't want to have any impact on clients and customers.
And so we're ready. We're looking at it, but we haven't done anything I would say proactively at this point.
We're very much focused on helping clients and customers get through this crisis.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

So let me -- let me answer this way. On the consumer side, we, like other banks you've seen, are kind of
prudent tightening up with how you do credit. That's already happened. And obviously, you could do some
more. But Jen, you had some great numbers about how good credit is. Like, I think the -- give those FICO
numbers you gave me the other day.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

FICO numbers?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Well then, how much better Home Lending is.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Oh, that was that on the LTV? The weighted average LTV?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. LTV, yes.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

I mean, it's really extraordinary. And I was in mortgage, so I should have remembered, but I did have to
ask. In 2010, our weighted average LTV on the portfolio in Home Lending was 90%, and it's now at 56%.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Right. And you can assume it's better in credit cards, it's better in auto, we have less subprime. That's
the consumer side. On the lending -- on the business side, we've always been prudent. We're always very
tight and careful and stuff like that. Usually, what happens in downturns like this, you get a little more
serious about security and the management team and responsiveness and raising capital. So a lot of these
companies have been raising a lot of capital.

On the investment side, and this is kind of a peculiarity of accounting again, we can actually make it more
conservative by putting securities into healthy maturity, which we've done very little of, and I'm going to
consider it. I don't personally understand why that reduces risk, but it does reduce your SCB, and maybe
we'll do that over time. But the security portfolios are pretty prudent as they are.

And in trading, it's every day. So trading is -- just think of trading as Daniel and Troy Rohrbaugh and Jason
Sippel and the whole team, they are every single day managing those risks and those exposures. And you
could assume that they're managing it very, very well and tightly today. And we certainly are not punting

for fences or anything like that. We're trying to be very cautious and serve our clients. And so yes, you are
more conservative.

And reducing your RWA, yes, we can -- if we wanted to, we could start doing that by all these various
things.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

One quickie on the consumer side. I'm curious if you've had -- we're now 4 months into the bulk of the
lockdown in the United States. And some of your branches have been either closed or drive-up only. And
I'm -- and we're watching your deposits grow like a weed. So I'm curious if you've learned any lessons
that might change your thoughts on the branch network, on your organic growth efforts, as we go forward
and come out of this someday.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So first of all, the deposit numbers, deposits went up because of PPP. Deposits went up because
of the payroll checks that people got. Deposits went up, the revolvers are taken down by $50 billion,
something like that -- or something like that. Almost of all that end up in deposits. And of course, a lot of
that's already reversed and stuff like that. So you've got to look at both sides of that, and -- but you were
going to say something, Jen?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

I was just going to add on -- I mean, there's -- of course, we're learning a lot. I mean, I mentioned the
quick deposit enrollment. But we haven't learned enough to make any changes to our strategy around
branch expansion. In fact, we just opened our 100th branch in market expansion. So we're really excited
about that. We think we'll open probably another 75 this year. So we'll be nearly halfway to the 400
branches that we've talked about in market expansion.

And so we'll see. We do have -- still have about 1,000 branches that are closed. And it's possible that we
learn something that helps us think about accelerating de-densification or consolidation, but it will be at
the margin. And we're not going to make any big changes quickly because we want to make sure that we
have the benefit over time of watching our customer behavior so they can really be the ones that inform
our strategy.

Two questions. One, on Page 6, you give the SLR ratio as adjusted for the temporary relief programs on

would be the more confined ratio starting next March?

James Dimon

There's no temporary relief in CET1.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

CET1, the only -- and I'm not even sure I'd call it relief. There's a phase-in on CECL, but it's over many
years. And so I don't necessarily think about that as temporary like SLR. SLR, at this point, the -- it
is temporary. It is due to expire in the first quarter of next year, which is why we're very focused on
managing that without big exclusions.

And both -- we manage them both. I wouldn't say one is more than the other. We manage, so it's
something like 20 different capital and liquidity ratios.

Charles Peabody;Portales Partners;Analyst

And Jamie, FSOC is meeting today behind closed doors. If I understand, there are 2 topics. One has to do
with mortgage -- secondary mortgage market liquidity, and the other with the COVID stress test overlay.
Do you have any thoughts or insights as to what they may be discussing on either of those?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I don't. The COVID, I mean, you could be -- you obviously have some insights, right? I don't have -- the
COVID, obviously, we're going to run the new stress test. We're going to run it. we'll look at all the Fed
cases, U, W and stuff like that, because they laid it out, perfectly reasonable that people would refer to
that kind of stress test.

I think the mortgage markets is a different issue, okay? And we've been very consistent that mortgages,
believe it or not, are more -- far more costly than they should be. Normally, you'd be looking at -- if you
looked at the 10-year rate, which is what, 60 basis points, the mortgage take should be 1.6% or 1.8%
instead of 3.3%.

The cost of -- the reason for that is because the cost of servicing and origination is so high, it's obviously
got to be passed through. It's high because there's an enormous amount of rules and regulation put
in place, that a lot do not create safety and soundness. Safety and soundness is basic 80% LTV, verify
peoples' incomes, making sure you're doing the right kind of stuff.

And the second one is because it's a very no-securitization market. The securitization market is important
because it reduces your risk-weighted asset, and it puts more incentive for banks to put on their balance
sheet. And the securitization market is a real transfer of risk to somebody else. So we -- I think they
should change that. They should change it immediately. The beneficiary of that will be non-agency
mortgages, which are even more -- a lot more expensive than agency mortgages.

So once you have a securitization market that people believe in and you have to change Reg A, B a little
bit fast -- all day, you're going to have a much better market. The cost of mortgages will come down, and
they will particularly come down for people at the lower end. I mean, so this should be phased, and it
should be phased right away.

a little bit more broadly than the discussion about capital planning and stress test. And I know banks are
working hard to be part of the solution this time and not part of the problem, but we're also having more
open discussions about things like inequality and social justice, which, in my opinion, are long overdue.
But I worry that fair or not, banks are sort of being depicted as being on the wrong side of some of those
issues. And I think you see that in things like the mainstream press' depictions of big banks and PPP and
stuff like that.

And I'm just curious if you are concerned at all about populist anti-bank policies gaining traction, however
you want to define them, whether it's breaking up the banks, directed lending, rate capture or whatever,
in a pretty polarized political environment? Or do you think I'm being too alarmist or overly concerned

about stuff that is pretty unlikely in our country? So I just kind of want to get your perspective just
generally on how banks fit into the overall policy and political backdrop.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Let me just -- the things you got to do every single day when you go to work is to do the right thing
for the right reason, serve your customers, and we try to do this. We try very hard to take care of our
employees, to train people. We try very hard to advance black leaders in the company and finance and
others. And of course, we make mistakes. And so I understand some of the angst out there. But we try to
do the best we can.

We get involved in policy, like this mortgage thing, that would be better for Americans. And we understand
that there's -- people want banks to help America, and we do. The most important thing we could do is be
a healthy and vibrant bank through this crisis and continue to serve our clients.

And remember, responsible lending is good lending. Irresponsible lending is bad lending. So very often, we
hear that banks should do more of x. No, irresponsible stuff is irresponsible. It will lead to bad outcomes.
And that's kind of what happened last time around.

So we try to do it right, and we try to listen very carefully when there's criticism, and sometimes -- and
often legitimate, about what we could have done better or should do better or try to do better in the
future.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I guess, as broad as that question was, I'm going to ask a very narrow
question for Jen and -- on your NII guidance. Does that -- I presume that includes gains on PPP fees for
unforgiven loans. And have you quantified that or sized that up in terms of where you think the magnitude
of those figures could be?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

So we've been really clear on PPP, which is that we don't intend to profit from PPP. That doesn't mean that
you won't have some geography issues. So you'll have some revenue and then you'll have expenses, and
the profit will be near 0. It is an immaterial amount this quarter, given these fees are recognized over the
lives of the loans. So it's very little this quarter, both revenue and expenses.

And looking out, you'll see -- we'll see more of that probably in the third and fourth quarter. Again, they --
it will still be 0 on the bottom line. And even the gross numbers won't be meaningful in the grand scheme
of things.

Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can you share with us the reclassification of the wholesale portfolio that you talked about? How often do
you go through that process where you have to look to reclassify the corporate loans?

And second, you touched on earlier in a question about some of the COVID-related sectors that are being
impacted because of what we're going through. Can you highlight for us what is the most stressed within
that COVID group that you mentioned?

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

So first on the reclassification. We mentioned it was a geography issue in Merchant Services, but it didn't
have to be...

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

There was no reclassification of wholesale loans.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. And then in terms of the most impacted, I mean, they are the ones that you would expect to
see around travel, oil and gas and real estate and retail. So it's the sectors that you would expect to see.
Although as I said earlier, and it's important to note, that for the downgrades that we experienced in the
second quarter, less than 1/3 of them were in the most impacted industries. So really, this is -- we're
seeing this as being much more broad-based.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then second, and I may have missed this, I apologize. But in your Slide 3, you gave us very
good detail on the forbearance on the consumer portfolio. Do you have any numbers on the commercial
and corporate portfolios that -- loans that might be in forbearance? And is it more commercial real estate
or C&I?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. They're just not meaningful numbers. We would have included them had they been. So I'll just go
back to what we said, which is we're just not seeing what you would typically see.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

But they ended up in nonperforming.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

They end up in nonperforming...

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

We don't have a category in wholesale or commercial the same way you have a category in consumer.

Operator

And our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just a question on the points in slides you made about capital and long-term opportunities for
recalibration. First, I guess, will you have any dialogue with the Fed about the 3.3% SCB as some other
banks have mentioned?

And then secondly, where do you think we stand on the GSIB recalibration, to your points about systemic
risk not -- that shouldn't impact a bank's balance sheet?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

We're not going to go back to the Fed and the 3.3%. But obviously, we're going to look at why 3.3%? And
we can try to adjust our plans going forward to try to reduce that number a little bit because we know
we have another CCAR coming up in a couple of months, so there's no reason for us to go through an
extensive amount of work as opposed to fix what's already there.

And GSIB, look, I've always thought GSIB needed a lot of recalibration. But there are things they should
have recalibrated for already, which is America gold-plated it, which I think is wholly unnecessary. They
should have taken cash and treasuries and a whole bunch of stuff out of the calculation. And obviously, it
goes way up when the Fed does things like they're doing recently. And they never adjusted it for growth in
the economy or growth in the shadow banking system, which they were supposed to do.

So I'm just hoping they go about and do that at one point. But these things get so wrapped up and
political. People politicize very complicated calculations, which I thought kind of peculiar and funny. But my
view is if they do the numbers, they should do them right, and they're just not right anymore.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes. And the second question is just going back to Slide 3. You lay out the percent of accounts on this
page. Auto seems to be the biggest, and then in the supplement on Page 13, the balances seem to imply a
bigger percent on deferral. Just can you talk a little bit about the differences there? And then why do you
think you're seeing more accounts in auto deferring versus other asset classes?

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. I don't actually know the answer to reconciling the supplement to Slide 3. So Jason and team can
follow-up with you on that one.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Maybe then just a comment about auto on deferrals. And why do -- what do you think you're seeing
in that customer base versus others? And do you think that means anything different for forward credit
trends?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

No.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

No, yes.

Operator

Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.

Christoph M. Kotowski
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I guess, I just think it was such an extraordinary quarter for capital raising. Dealogic shows over $2 trillion
of debt and equity raised in the quarter. And I guess a 2-part question around that.

One is, as you look at that, was a good portion of that in kind of the stressed areas, and presumably,
capital that's junior to your bank debt? And to what extent has all that helped raise the quality of bank
loans?

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

And then secondly, looking forward, I mean, did all the companies that needed to and could raise capital
do so in the second quarter? And therefore, we're looking at a kind of a flat spot going forward? Or do you
see this as kind of like there's an ongoing need for a lot of these companies to continue to raise capital?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I think, first of all, it was across the board. I mean, you saw our strong companies, weaker companies,
high-yield markets opened up, converts. I'd put converts and equity in there, too. People did a lot of
capital-raising. I think it was wise. I think a lot of people said they prefunded a lot of their capital needs
to make sure they could get through whatever this crisis means for their company and their industry and
stuff like that.

So I don't think it would be like it was before. So it will definitely come down, but I still think there's
opportunity for some people to prefund some of that. But it is prefunding. This is not capital. All this
capital is not being raised to go spend. It's being raised to sit in the balance sheet so that you're prepared
for whatever comes next.

And you've heard a lot of companies make statements, and you guys have got to go through it yourself
about, we've got 2 years of cash, we've got 3 years of cash. We've got -- people want to be prepared, and
I think it's appropriate.

But just for your models, we don't expect revenues in Investment Banking. They will normalize or even
come down below normal next quarter and the quarters out. At one point, we can't predict month-by-
month exactly. And for trading, because no one asked, cut it in half. Cut it in half and that will probably be
closer to the future than if you say it's going to still be double what it normally runs.

Operator

And our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

That's the last question.

Andrew Lim
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

My questions, I think they're quite straightforward. I just wanted some clarity really on the nature of CECL
provisioning. And obviously, you've made some very big provisions based on much more conservative
assumptions. But the nature of CECL provisioning, obviously, should mean that in the third quarter, if your
assumptions do not change, then your provisions should fall down quite considerably versus the second
quarter to a much more normal level. And I just wanted to see how you thought about that for the third
quarter.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So I would start by saying where we are right now, while there's a conservative bias to where we
are right now, it is our best estimate of what we're facing. We certainly hope that in the future, we look
back on this as a conservative moment. But this is our best estimate. And so if our assumptions are
realized, and again, our reserve reflects something worse than the base case. So if that's realized, then
we shouldn't see meaningful reserve build in the third quarter. Or if that continues to be -- in the third
quarter.

Andrew Lim
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

Right. Yes. So I mean, context, would it be similar to quarters that we've seen in 2019, for example?

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 14, 2020

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. You have reserves for growth, but not for the crisis per se.

Andrew Lim
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

Yes, exactly, exactly. That's very clear.

And then on the CIB trading environment, obviously, we saw June and we've seen a bit of it in July. Would
you say that's normalized to a level consistent with what we've seen with 2019? Or are you still seeing
some pretty strong trading following through into the second quarter -- sorry, into the third quarter?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I just answered that question. You should assume it's going to fall in half. We don't know. It's only a
couple of weeks into this thing, but we don't assume we have these unbelievable trading results going
forward. And hopefully, we'll do better than that, but we simply don't know.

I also support a point on reserving. Since it's probabilistic, you could actually change nothing in your
assumptions but the probabilities of potential outcomes, and put up more reserves.

Operator

We have no further questions at this time.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Great. Thank you.
