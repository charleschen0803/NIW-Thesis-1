Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February
4, 2021. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.

Tim Argo
Senior VP & Director of Finance

Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for
MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom
Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions.

Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the
discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ
materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in
yesterday's earnings release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may
impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy
of this morning's call will be available on our website.

During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-
GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial
data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.

I will now turn the call over to Eric.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Tim. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As detailed in our fourth quarter earnings
report, MAA ended 2020 on a positive note, results were ahead of expectations, and we carry good
momentum into calendar year 2021.

During the fourth quarter, leasing traffic was strong, and we captured 6% higher move-ins as compared
to prior year. And despite the normal seasonal slowdown during the holidays, we were able to capture
positive blended lease-over-lease rent growth that equaled the prior third quarter with particularly strong
renewal lease pricing averaging 5.2% in Q4.

Average physical occupancy also remained strong at 95.7% in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement
from the performance in Q3. We believe these trends supported by improving employment conditions and
the positive migration trends across our footprint positions MAA for continued outperformance into the
coming spring and summer leasing season.

Overall, conditions are setting up for a solid recovery cycle for apartment leasing fundamental across the
Sun Belt over the next 3 years or so as demand recovers and supply levels moderate a bit into 2022. I
believe for several reasons that MAA is in particularly strong position as we head into the recovery part of
the cycle.

First, we expect that our Sun Belt markets will continue to capture job growth, migration trends and
demand for apartment housing that will be well ahead of national trends. While there were clearly
favorable Sun Belt migration trends by both employers and households prior to COVID, this past year the
trends accelerated. The primary reasons behind these favorable migration trends, including enhanced
affordability, favorable business climates and lower taxes will still be with us well past the point we get the
pressures associated with COVID behind us.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Secondly, the efforts we have underway this past year implementing change to a number of our processes
involving new technology and web-based tools will continue to drive more opportunity for margin
expansion. Specifically, steps taken to automate aspects of both our leasing and maintenance service
operations will drive more efficiency with personnel cost. We expect to begin harvesting some of those
early benefits later this year.

Our redevelopment operation aimed at upgrading and repositioning many of our existing properties
continues to capture very attractive rent growth and returns on capital. These higher levels of -- the
higher levels of new apartment supply introduced into a number of markets over the past year will
actually expand this redevelopment opportunity for us over the next couple of years. As outlined in the
supplemental schedules to earnings release, we also expanded our new development pipeline in the fourth
quarter, with just over 2,600 units now underway.

Our external growth pipeline executed through in-house development, prepurchase of joint venture
development projects and the acquisition of existing properties will continue to expand over the next year.

In addition to the projects outlined in our current pipeline schedule included in our earnings release, we
have predevelopment activity currently underway with sites we own or have tied up in Denver, Tampa,
Raleigh and Salt Lake City.

Finally, and importantly, our balance sheet remains in a very strong position with ample capacity to
support both our redevelopment and our new growth initiatives. Calendar year 2020 was certainly not the
year we expected, but MAA's full cycle strategy with a uniquely diversified portfolio across the Sun Belt
supported by a strong operating platform and balance sheet position the company to hold up well.

Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to also say thank you to our MAA associates for a tremendous
year of service and support to our residents, our shareholders and each other. Our strategy is working and
our platform capabilities are strong. However, it's your intensity and passion for serving those who depend
on our company that enables us to truly excel. Tom?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued
across the portfolio through the fourth quarter. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 6%. This allowed
us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.6% in the third quarter to 95.7% in the fourth quarter. In
addition to the improvement in occupancy, we were able to hold blended rents in the fourth quarter, in line
with the third quarter and an 80 basis point increase.

All in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved 1.3% for the fourth quarter.
As noted in the release, collections during the quarter were strong. We collected 99.2% of build rent in
the fourth quarter. This is the same result we had in the third quarter of 2020. We've worked diligently to
identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The numbers of those seeking assistance
has dropped over time. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants
has decreased to just 491 for the January rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our
100,000 units.

We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we made progress on
our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package
that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year
2020, we installed 23,950 Smart Home packages and completed just over 4,200 interior unit upgrades.
January's collections are in line with the good results we saw in the fourth quarter. As of January 31,
we've collected 98.7% of rent build which is comparable to the month end number for the third and fourth
quarters of 2020.

Leasing volume in January was strong, up 4.9% from last year. Blended lease-over-lease rent growth
effective during January exceeded last year's results for the first time since March. Effective blended lease-
over-lease pricing for January was positive 2.2%, 40 basis improvement from the prior year.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Effective new lease pricing for January was negative 1.8%. This is a 70 basis point improvement from
January of last year. January renewals effective during the month were up 6.3%.

Our customer service scores improved 110 basis points over the prior year. This aids to our retention
trends, which are positive for January, February and March, as well as lease-over-lease renewal rates for
those months, which are in the 5.5 to 6.5 range.

Average daily occupancy for the month of January is 95.4%, which is even with January of last year. 60-
day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.8%. We're well
positioned as we move into 2021.

Led by job growth, which is expected to increase 3.4% in 2021 versus the 6.1% drop we saw for our
markets in 2020, we expect to see the broad recovery in our region and the country continue. We expect
Phoenix, Tampa, Raleigh and Jacksonville to be our strongest markets and expect Houston, Orlando and
D.C. to recover at a slower rate.

I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They served and care for our residents
and our associates, and they have adapted to new business conditions that drive -- and they drive our
recovery. Well done, and thank you, all. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. While most buyers have returned to the market, the lack of
available for sale properties continues to restrict transaction volume. Investor demand for multifamily
product within our region of the country is very strong. And this supply/demand imbalance is driving
aggressive pricing.

Due to the robust demand, supported by continued low interest rates, cap rates have compressed further
and are frequently in the high 3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations
within our markets. We expect to remain active in the transaction market this year. So based on pricing
levels we're currently seeing, we're not optimistic that we will succeed in finding existing communities that
will clear our underwriting hurdles in 2021.

While acquiring will be a challenge, as noted in the earnings guidance, we do plan to come to market with
$200 million to $250 million of planned property dispositions this year. We will redeploy those proceeds
into our growing development pipeline, which currently stands at $595 million with 8 projects in just over
2,600 units.

In the fourth quarter, we started construction on the MAA Windmill Hill in Austin, Texas as well as Novel
Val Vista, a prepurchase in Phoenix, Arizona. Both of these are lower density suburban projects that we
expect to deliver stabilized NOI yields around 6%, well in excess of our current acquisition cap rates.
Despite increased construction costs as well as some supply chain issues related specifically to cabinets
and appliances, our development and prepurchase projects remain on budget with no significant delay
concerns at this point.

We have several other development sites owned or under contract that we hope to start construction on
in 2021 and into 2022. We are encouraged that despite facing some supply pressure, our Phase 2 lease-
up property located in Fort Worth continues to lease up at our original expectations as does our soon to be
completed Phase 2 in Dallas, where over 90% of the units have been delivered.

Turning to the outlook for new supply deliveries in 2021. Based on our assessment and the projection
data we have, new supply deliveries across our major markets are projected to remain flat with 2020
levels, at 2.8% of existing inventory. Consistent with previous year's, we expect delayed starts, extended
construction schedules, canceled projects and overall construction capacity constraints to continue to
impact actual supply deliveries to some degree. While clearly, new supply does have an impact on our
business, it's just one side of the equation with demand playing a significant role as well. And for reasons
Eric mentioned in his comments, we believe the demand for multifamily housing within our region of the
country will remain strong and improve this year as the economy continues to recover.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

When looking at the ratios for expected job growth to new supply deliveries in 2021, we expect leasing
conditions in our footprint to improve from last year. Encouragingly, the data on permitting activity and
construction starts for our region of the country continue to show activity below prepandemic levels.
This group -- this drop in activity will likely lead to a moderating level of new supply deliveries into 2022,
setting up for what we believe will be an improved leasing environment beyond this year.

That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Al.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Core FFO of $1.65 per share for the fourth quarter produced
full year core FFO of $6.43 per share, which represented a 2.7% growth over the prior year and is
well above our internal expectations following the breakout of the pandemic. Stable occupancy, strong
collections and positive pricing performance were the primary drivers of continued same-store revenue
growth for the fourth quarter, which is 1.8% and for the full year, which is 2.5%.

As expected, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were impacted by growth in real estate
taxes, insurance costs and the continued rollout of the bulk internet program, which is included in utilities
expenses. And though some of this pressure will carry into 2021, we expect overall same-store operating
expenses to begin moderating this year, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment.

Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We had no significant refinancing activity during the fourth
quarter, but we continue to fund the development pipeline and internal redevelopment programs. As Brad
mentioned, our development pipeline has increased to 8 deals with total projected costs of $595 million.
During the quarter, we funded $104 million of development costs, leaving less than half or another $259
million remaining to be funded toward the completion of the current pipeline. Though still growing, our
pipeline is still is only about 3% of our enterprise value, which is a modest risk, given the overall strength
of our balance sheet and a diversified portfolio strategy.

As Tom mentioned, we also made good progress toward the -- during the quarter on our internal
programs, funding a total of $40 million toward the interior unit redevelopments, Smart Home installations
and external amenity upgrades, bringing our full year funding for lease programs to $76 million, which
is expected to begin contributing to our growth more strongly late in 2021 and 2022. We ended the year
with low leverage, debt-to-EBITDA of only 4.8x and with $850 million of combined cash and borrowing
capacity under our line of credit.

Finally, we provided initial earnings guidance for 2021 with our release, which is detailed in our
supplemental information package. Core FFO for the full year is projected to be $6.30 to $6.60 per share,
which is $6.45 at the midpoint. The primary driver of earnings performance is same-store revenue growth,
which is projected to be around 2% for the year. This growth is based on the expectation of continued
improving economic trends and job growth in our markets, as Tom outlined, and we believe these trends
will support both stable occupancy levels, averaging around 95.5% for the year. And modestly improving
pricing trends through the year, driving effective rent growth for the year of around 1.7%. An additional
contribution of 30 to 40 basis points of projected revenue growth for the year is related to the final portion
of our Double Play bulk internet program.

We do expect the first quarter to be our lowest revenue growth for the year as it will bear the full impact
of 2020's pricing performance growing from there as the -- head from there as improving leasing trends
take full effect.

Same-store operating expense growth is projected to moderate some as compared to 2020, will continue
to be impacted by the rollout of Double Play and higher insurance costs with these costs combining for an
estimated 1.4% of the same-store expense growth in 2021. But excluding Double Play and insurance, all
other same-store expenses are expected to increase in a more modest 2.5% to 3% range for the full year.
And this includes real estate tax growth of 3.75% at the midpoint, which is moderating, but still somewhat
elevated.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Overhead costs for 2021 are projected to be more normalized, with total overhead expenses expected to
be about $107 million for the year, which is a 2.8% increase over the midpoint of our original guidance
for 2020. Our forecast also assumes development funding of $250 million to $350 million for the year,
primarily provided by projected asset sales of $200 million to $250 million. And given our current forecast,
we have no current plans to raise additional equity, and we expect to end the year with our debt-to-
EBITDA just below 5x.
So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we'll now turn the call back over to you
for any questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sumit Sharma with Scotiabank.

Sumit Sharma
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Thank you for providing all the color on the stats in Q4. I guess to kick things off, in terms of the [ SS ]
rev growth this year, I know you mentioned that Tampa and Phoenix were one of your stronger markets.
So just wondering, as you looked at 2020, Phoenix was your strongest performer, Orlando was the
weakest, the spread in SS revs was 630 bps. In Q4, that changed, Tampa was better and Orlando was the
weakest.

So I guess, what's that spread look like in the context of your 2021 guidance of 1% to 3%? And where do
you see the most meaningful change in performance in terms of things you already know about.

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes. I'll start with that one, and I'm going to let Tim or Al wrap up on the forecast. What I would tell you
is, as I mentioned in the call, the thing that is most different for us in 2021 is the shift in the swing in
jobs, bringing from negative 6.4% to positive 3.4%. And that's going to be the thing that drives us, and
that moves across the markets.

We see that at the high end, where we'll continue to see markets like Tampa and Raleigh and Phoenix and
Jacksonville accelerate, but we'll also see it in places like Orlando and Houston and D.C., which are weaker
now, but they will begin to improve as job growth comes to play in those markets.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And then just looking for the future what we have in our forecast, the 2% overall, I mean, I think,
you just think about the markets and some of the markets that we're thinking will be the strongest, as
Tom talked about, mentioned, Phoenix, Raleigh, Tampa, Jacksonville, some of the ones that are going to
be okay markets. So they are going to be reasonable. It's still challenging, Atlanta and Dallas, Austin and
then some of the more challenging markets, Houston, Orlando and D.C., and I think all of those together
and based on the pricing trends we see right now and expect for the year given the job growth come to
2% expectation.

Sumit Sharma
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Got it. Got it. One more, if you will indulge me on supply. Now you talked about 2021 supply being 25%,
price 25% higher and centered in urban and downtown markets or submarkets. I guess we -- the permit
levels are less than at lower levels than pre-COVID levels but they are increasing as we've heard from
other market participants as well.

So keeping that in mind, do you have any insights to share on what types of markets or product or price
points that are being emphasized by the new permit. So not the '21 deliveries, but what's being started
right now, are they more garden style, more urban, less urban. Any color on that?

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Yes, this is Brad. I would say that, just giving the economics of what we're seeing today, it's really hard to
underwrite more urban, high-density products. So I think it's safe to assume that a higher percent of the
product that's being developed today is more suburban in nature.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

But I'd say, having said that, when we look at the spread between the rents of new supply that's coming
online versus our properties. That spread is still really good. And as Eric said, that's leading to more
redevelopment opportunities for us. So we think that continues. It's hard to say where -- just looking at
permitting trends, while they're clearly down versus pre-COVID levels, I would say construction starts
are down even more. It's hard to say just from the permitting data, where that supply is located. But my
sense is, it's going to be more suburban in nature. But given the economics of where costs are, the rent
levels of those are still going to be pretty substantial compared to our current product.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

This is Eric. Sumit, I'll add to what Brad is saying. I agree. Based on everything that I've seen that it
does -- would appear that the majority of a lot of the lease permitting activity is oriented more suburban
in nature. But having said that, one of the things that we're really starting to see more evidence of is,
frankly, entitlement and permitting is getting more challenging. As more of this multi-housing product
heads to the suburbs, we're seeing a lot of -- particularly in the satellite cities, the suburban cities, if you
will, that have their own school systems and their own municipal governments. They are becoming very
restrictive about what they are allowing in the way of apartment permitting, believing that these additional
households will put some level of stress on the infrastructure and we're seeing that the permitting activity
is starting to get a lot more restrictive than it ever has been in a lot of these southeastern markets.

So I think there is another, if you will, a hurdle starting to develop across some of these southeast markets
that will make it increasingly a little bit more challenging to supply some of these suburban locations.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Neil Malkin with Capital One.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

So this is the first time, I think that you guys have really called out or Eric, your comments have called
out the in migration. Can you just maybe talk to that, what you've seen over the recent months in terms
of that sort of out migration from the coast, just given the confluence of bad factors that the coasts are
facing, which have been exacerbated by the COVID and work from home. I think last quarter, you laid
out some statistics about like, what percentage of your new leases were from out of state. If you can just
update us on that and any incremental commentary from the property level managers would be great to
hear.

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Neil. It's Tom. I'll jump in on that one, if that's all right. Move-ins from people moving into our
footprint from outside of our footprint was 12.2% of total move-ins in fourth quarter. That's the highest
we've seen and reflects the steady upward trend that we've seen over the past couple of years. It was
-- for context, it was 9.2% in Q1 of '19. So almost a 300 basis point increase. We've seen that steadily
happening from '19 on. Just to give you a little bit more color on the Q4 move-ins, New York move-ins --
move-ins from New York state, were up 36%. And apartment searches, we pulled some information from
Google, apartment searches in Atlanta were up 60% in New York City.

Move-ins from Massachusetts were up 43% and apartments in Raleigh searches were up 68% in Boston.
And trends go on from there. The other notable is probably California, which is up 60% and apartments in
Austin searches were up 90% in Los Angeles.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

And Neil, this is Eric. Just to add on to some of that detail that Tom laid out there. I do think that there
are a lot of reasons to believe that a lot of this migration trend that we saw the U.S. population to the
southeast over the past year, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, a lot of these trends were evident

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

prior to COVID. COVID accelerated those trends somewhat. And I would tell you that, I believe a lot of this
-- a lot of the moves that took place during 2020 are pretty sticky in nature. And I think that the trends
are likely to continue post COVID.

I think you have to recognize a lot of these southeastern markets, they continue to offer all the same
attractive qualities that I think started the trend some years back. And what is so -- happening as
more employers are bringing more knowledge-based jobs and tech jobs into this region of country,
the employment base is really starting to further diversify. And of course, work from home and these
knowledge-based jobs allows a lot more remote working, which I think is also working in our favor.

And so I think that a combination of just how these economic trends have been building, frankly, in these
job and migration trends have been building for the last 10 years or so, recognizing -- accelerated a little
bit last year, but those trends were in place well before COVID, and I think we'll continue past COVID.
The affordability of the region, particularly as it relates to housing, continues to, I think, be very, very
attractive and will become even more so over the next 10 years.

And I think we also have to recognize that these Sun Belt markets are continuing to become very
desirable places to live. And what Nashville and what Austin and what Raleigh have to offer people today
versus where they were 20 years ago is night-and-day difference. And so I'm very optimistic that we are
at the beginning of some continued very favorable trends for housing needs throughout this region of the
country.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Eric, so I guess what you're saying is, you think it would be -- it will take longer or it may not happen for
the people who have moved to your area to make the track back to the coastal urban city?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think the idea that once a vaccine is in place, and if you will, society returns to normal, the idea that
there's going to be this giant reversal of population shift back to the gateway markets. I think that's a
ridiculous argument. I don't think that's going to happen. Those trends were in place to the Southeast and
Sun Belt markets before COVID. COVID accelerated a little bit. And I think those trends are going to be --
and we learned a lot last year, and employers learned a lot and households learned a lot. And I think the
attractiveness of this region is only was -- is better understood today than it ever has been. And I think
these trends are going to continue.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

That's great. Other one from me, the single-family market has been very strong. You have new and
existing home sales and mortgage applications at multiyear highs. Just wondering -- and obviously, you
guys are theoretically more exposed to that sort of risk, just given the relative affordability. Have you seen
any uptick in move-outs for home purchases or home rentals or anything like that, that would give you
some [ reticence ] just in terms of potential demand erosion, let's say, over the next 12 months?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Neil, it's Tom. I mean nothing -- I mean, 0 reticence, I would say. We're quite pleased with the way the
market conditions are going at this point. I mean the fourth quarter, home buying this time was up slightly
by like 3 percentage points as a move-out reason or about 200 move-outs on total. So I mean, we saw
a little bit there. But as you look forward, our accept rates are at their normal levels. So we're not seeing
turnover go up over time there.

And home renting is flat again. So that continues not to be a major factor. We agree with you that the
overall home buying market certainly getting stronger. And we wouldn't be surprised to see that tick up

jobs. And frankly, jobs are the thing that drive our business. So that would be my thought thus far.

We'll take Our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

It's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. So I had a question and Nick would add another one as well. Eric,
as you think about, and I know how positive you are on the current markets in the Sun Belt, and all
the trends that have been accelerated away from the gateway market. You inherited D.C. when you
bought Post, I don't know if it was a gift with purchase or whatever, but you got some exposure to some
coastal exposure in the Northeast. What would make you come in and want to buy or develop in gateway
markets? I guess at what point does the risk/reward, what needs to happen, A, from a diversification
standpoint, is it trends? Is it relative values? Growth profiles? I guess where is your mindset about
that today because if everyone is zigging, maybe you want to zag. And maybe there would be a good
opportunity from a value perspective there?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Michael, I would tell you that my principles and sort of the philosophy that I've always had in terms
of how we will think about deploying capital is really -- continues to be grounded in the overriding belief
that the most important thing that we are charged with doing is deploying capital in a manner to create
the highest recurring quality revenue stream and earnings stream that we can, to pay a steady growing
dividend, throughout the cycle and if you will, in creating a optimized sort of full cycle performance profile.

At the end of the day, I think REIT shareholder capital over time, over a long period of time is largely
rewarded through steady earnings growth, obviously, and particularly dividend growth. And having said
that, I've always believed then that the best way to accomplish that performance objective and that profile
is, deploy capital where demand is likely to be the best and the strongest and growing in a consistent
fashion over a long period of time.

I get it that the southeast markets for years, the argument and criticism was that there are lower barriers
to supply and new supply can come in and oversupply a market. What I would tell you is, what supply
causes, it causes moderation. What demand causes is steady earnings growth over time. And a falloff in
demand can have catastrophic consequences. And an oversupplied market is unlikely to be catastrophic in
nature. It can be weak for a year or two but it's unlikely to trigger a massive -- sort of upset your earnings
stream, which can put a company in trouble, create dividend stress and things of that nature.

So I've always believed that these Sunbelt markets offer the performance profile that we're after. And
that's what we should be doing and where we should focus our capital. So it's a very long answer to your
question. But no, we have no interest in now using this opportunity to go into these gateway markets. I
don't think our -- what we're trying to do for capital -- for shareholder capital would not be sufficiently
rewarded for pursuing that. At this point, we don't see a reason to do that and we like what we're doing.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

How do you think about just the risk/reward from a return perspective, right? I think you're extraordinarily
fortunate to be so heavy in these markets, having built the platform that you've done through a lot of hard
work and acquisitions and M&A and development. But there's a lot of capital chasing these markets too,
right, which is going to drive down returns overall.

And I'm not ignoring the fact that the demand is extraordinarily strong, but is there a financial side of
it, too, that, as money is coming out of these gateways that you could create a better total return by
deploying capital or reallocating capital in the portfolio? Or is that just not -- in your view, the demand is
not there, so I'm not going to -- it doesn't matter if I can get 100 basis points or 200 basis points higher
initial return out of it?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

No. No, I get your point. And I mean, obviously, I think it depends somewhat on your investment horizon.
As you think about risk return, risk/reward/return, I think, clearly, there's going to be opportunities that
are going to emerge in some of these gateway markets, where you can go in and deploy capital and make
an investment and create an exceptional return on your investment.

I think it somewhat depends on your horizon and how long you want to think about the capital being
deployed in that market. Again, from our perspective, we're very long-term investors, very long term
holders, and we're trying to create an earnings profile from that investment action to match up well in
terms of how we're trying to perform for capital over a long period of time. And so we just don't believe
that, with that horizon that we're working with and that objective that we're shooting for, that the gateway
markets really align for us in the way we want to try to perform for capital. I'm not suggesting that
focusing on those markets is wrong. And I think there are -- there's certainly ways to make a lot of money
in those markets. But I think you have to think about your horizon, perhaps a little bit differently.

And I will say that, while we continue to see capital coming into these markets, I think that there were
times where these gateway markets over the last -- and you know this, over the last 10 or 15 years, I
mean, just attracting enormous amount of capital and a lot of international capital sometimes that I think
was really motivated by, now someone who're looking for a great return on their capital, in some cases, is
looking for a place to preserve capital, if you will.

And so you get a lot of different influences on some of these bigger gateway markets, and particularly
with international capital that can, I think, create some distortions from time to time in terms of assets are
being priced relative to the long-term earnings potential of the investment. So we just see volatility and
other aspects of those markets. Now those gateway markets just don't really match up well to how we're
trying to perform for capital, and we're going to continue to focus on it the way we do.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Appreciate that. And this is Nick. Just 1 other question on guidance. The first quarter range is pretty wide.
Obviously, we're a month into the quarter, and there are fewer leases that are signed and recognized, still
the uncertainty, but just wondering if you can walk through how you could end up at the high end or the
low end? And then specific to your same-store revenue comment, where you expect same-store revenue
to be in the first quarter? I know you said it should be the lowest point of the year?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Nick, this is Al. I think just overall, I mean, just given the uncertainty that's in the marketplace, I
think that the first quarter being the first quarter of the year and where you have the most uncertainty. I
think the range was just to reflect that. And I think the driver for the forecast for the whole year is based
on revenue performance.

And so I think that's the key to be the top or the bottom of the range and really for the year or for the
quarter. And I think the first quarter, as talked about a little bit in the comments, is expected to be

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

the lowest revenue quarter for the year, but that's really reflecting effective rent per unit, which is a
combination, which is backward or trailing indicator, which is a combination of the pricing you did last year,
plus what you're doing this year.

And so we're expecting improving pricing trends, but the first quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter
because it will reflect really, the bulk of last year's pricing, which was 1.3% on average, and we certainly
expect that to be higher in 2021 based on the forecast we're putting together. So that's really the key
factor. I hope that answers your question.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

It does.

We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Tom, there was nearly an 800 basis point delta between the new lease rate and the renewals. How
sustainable is that type of spread? And given that pricing is out there in the Internet, why aren't residents
pushing you guys harder on renewals?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

The spread is always going to be kind of the widest at this time of the year, Rob, because new lease
pricing is at its most challenged. But that delta and that delta will close over time, but that gap will always
be there. And the -- really, the variation is with a new renter, they have a level of leverage because
they're shopping, and they can move anywhere and their switching. Costs are really the same. If we have
done our job and provided good resident service in taking care of the residents and, frankly, a pretty
challenging time, we've earned the opportunity because we've created for value to charge a little bit more.
And so that is where we have the most pricing power because we've worked with them, we've earned
them and their switching costs are a little bit higher. So that delta that you talk about has always been
there. It is widest in this time of year, and it will be tightest in the summer months, but we expect that,
and we plan for that. And we ask our residents for a little more to reflect the value that we've created for
them.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

And implied in the guidance for the year, I mean where are you guys thinking that new lease versus
renewals winds up coming in? We're talking about something that's more or less flat on new leases or still
negative there? And how significant should the or is the guidance anticipating renewals being?

Tim Argo
Senior VP & Director of Finance

Rob , this is Tim. I think what we would expect overall is that new lease pricing, probably slightly negative.
It will -- it's very seasonal, as Tom mentioned and depends on the sort of the leading edge of demand.
So you'll see pretty negative in Q1. Q4 moved to positive as we get into the summer. But I think over the
average, probably a little bit negative. And then renewals kind of hanging in there like they have anywhere
in that 5% to 6% range and again, varying some with a little bit higher in the summer, a little bit weaker
in the fall and winter.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Okay. And then the other one for me is, you guys did, call it, $424 million of revenues in 2020. How much
of that is nonresidential, so retail, commercial, other spaces at your properties? And where did that wind
up coming in versus expectations a year ago? I mean what was the negative delta? How significantly was
that impacted over the last year versus what you would have expected this time a year ago?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

I think the major component that's outside of residential is really just commercial. It's only about 1.5% of
our revenue stream. So it's really minor overall, Rob. And so we've had pretty good performance. I mean
we've looked at our tenants, and we certainly have some programs to sort of -- or rent where we needed,
but we had good collection and a lot of our tenants are very strong and have strong businesses that been
able to continue paying well.

And so it's -- so collections have been good. So it hasn't even on a small number, hasn't -- we've had
pretty good performance still, on a relative basis.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

And the occupancy there? I mean are you guys fairly full? Is that sort of -- is that half full? I mean how
are you guys sort of characterizing even though it's a small percentage, given that it's also amenity space
for some of your tenants as well, I assume.

Robert J. DelPriore
Executive VP & General Counsel

Rob, it's Rob DelPriore. The -- we're sitting at about 85% to 90% occupied, and we've collected about
90% of the revenues in cash on the commercial side.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird.

Amanda Morgan Sweitzer
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing today in terms of construction financing?
Have you seen the large money center banks come back to your market at all? And then how development
loan terms changed relative to pre-COVID, both in terms of interest rates and then LTVs?

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Yes, Amanda. This is Brad. I'd say that the construction financing is really kind of a mixed bag. I think it
depends on a few things. One, the markets that folks are looking in. Certainly, some markets are easier to
get financing in or less hard to get financing in than others.

Then I think it also depends on the sponsor. I mean I think what we're seeing is generally for the larger
developers, the strong sponsors that historically have had pretty good pipelines. They're still able to get
financing. But I think the smaller developers that do just a handful of deals a year, they're not as strong.
They don't have as strong a relationship with the banks, or having a little bit tougher time getting their
debt financing lined up.

So that certainly has been an impact in financing, and that also certainly leads to some of our prepurchase
opportunities. In terms of loan terms, we're seeing, call it, 10-year rates in that 4%, 4.5% range for
construction financing, which I think is still decent at the moment. Really, the only change that we've -- or
the biggest change we've seen in construction or in financing, not construction financing, but is really has
to do with the low cap rates that we're currently seeing for these stabilized assets. The low cap rates are
starting to drop some LTV movement in order for debt service coverage ratios to continue to be held.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

So we are seeing loan to values come down a bit. We're not seeing any impact yet on pricing, but we'll
really just see how that unfolds later this year as more opportunities come to market. But that's basically
what we're seeing at the moment.

Amanda Morgan Sweitzer
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's helpful. And then on your comments about that cap rate compression, what's kind of a reasonable
assumption for a cap rate for your targeted dispositions this year?

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

I think for our dispositions, given that we're selling our Jackson, Mississippi portfolio, which we had on the
market last year is 30-, 35-year-old product in a tertiary market. You're talking 5 to 5.5 cap rate for what
we'll look to sell this year. We're looking to sell properties that really don't line up as well with our overall
growth strategy.

It's going to tend to be older property in some of these smaller markets initially, where really the after
CapEx, cash flows are really not what we're looking for and then the long-term growth is obviously not
what we're looking for as well.

But on a historical basis, the cap rates for these properties are still really, really good at the moment, but
I'd say 5 to 5.5.

Operator

And we'll go next to Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.

Alex Kalmus
Zelman & Associates LLC

Quick one on stimulus checks. Given your market backdrop, the stimulus onetime payments will likely go
further for your residents than compared to the urban environment. So limited historical perspective, how
do you think these will play out in terms of your rent negotiations this year?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

I would think any stimulus check is going to help that situation. But we're frankly in such a strong position
on that with our collection rate where it is, it will help close the gap to get us back to last year and would
be welcomed, but it would just primarily help a little bit.

Alex Kalmus
Zelman & Associates LLC

Got it. And just touching upon the recurring CapEx. I noticed year-over-year, there was a little jump there.
Can you provide some additional color and what drove the increase.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

I think recurring CapEx can be -- it can be the timing of certain jobs with some of the significant jobs like
paint jobs and some of the things of that nature. I think over time, we expect for -- we put recurring and
revenue-enhancing together, and we'd expect to spend, call it, $1,100 to $1,200 per unit, those 2 together
in 2021, which is fairly significant to what 2020 was, but somewhere in that field for the long term.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And I would add, we had a little bit bigger jump from '19 to '20 in recurring CapEx. But for '21, we're
projecting a very modest increase in terms of recurring CapEx.

We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

On your prepared remarks, you mentioned blended lease growth rate was 2.2% in January, you expect
improving pricing trends this year. But then effective rental growth of 1.7% for the year. Assuming that
these are apples-to-apples numbers, you're pretty close to it. Why will that effective rent growth for the
year be higher?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

Well, John, this is Al. The effective rent growth, we talked a moment ago about that a bit. I think that's
more of a trailing indicator. It's a combination of all the leases you have in place right now. And so the
pricing performance we have for 2020 was 1.3% on average. And so we're projecting for 2020 is certainly
higher than that. I think you could do the math. But this is a rough approach. But in a pretty easy way to
look at it is, take half of what we did in 2020 and half of what we expect to do in 2021 and that will drive
your effective rent growth to 1.7%.

So you can do the math on it back end too. We're expecting something in the -- a 2% to 2.5% range on
pricing in the first quarter was -- I mean the January was a good indication toward that.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

If you take what Al just said, if you take half your lease-over-lease performance, blended lease-over-lease
performance for '20 and half of your blended lease-over-lease performance for '21, collected or together,
that comprises what your effective will be for the year.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

And that's the back of the envelope way to do it. But I think if you do that, given that we have leases on
average of a year, that works out pretty close, and you can get to where we are on our forecast.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Your redevelopment pipeline, it sits up 15% sequentially this quarter. Can you just remind us how
long you think it will take to complete this 10,000 to 15,000 units of redevelopment?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

In terms of the pipeline going forward, we'll do over 5,000 units in '21 towards that. But what we found,
John, over time is that, as we move forward, our product ages another year and new supply is brought
into the market. So I would be surprised if we ever blew through our potential on that. But at this rate, it'd
be about 3 years, but I would expect us to see the pipeline grow over time as new properties are added to
it, as market conditions change, product added -- product is added and product ages.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

And John, just to add to what Tom was saying that, as he's mentioned there's new product comes into the
market, that really, what that does is that it expands our opportunity for redevelopment.

And historically, at least over the last number of years, where the redevelopment opportunity for us
has been the best has been in some of our more urban oriented locations, which is really where the
opportunity largely lies in portfolio now, particularly with the legacy Post portfolio.

17

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

But as new supply begins to -- over the next few years, if it is more oriented towards the suburban
locations, that's actually going to expand our field of opportunity for more extensive redevelopment out
in the suburb components of the portfolio because obviously, this new product is coming in at a price
point that is well above our existing product and with comparable locations and comparable appeal in
that regard, we can go in and make these investments with kitchen and bath upgrades and create a very
competitive product. And so offer the market, the renter market a slight discount to the newer product
and get great returns on capital and get great lease-up success with it. So we think that this is a real
opportunity for us over the next few years, and we expect it to stay at the same high level for the next 3
or 4 years for sure.

Piljung Kim

Is [ 99 ]% a good run rate as far as what you'd expect as, as far as the effective rental growth for the

And we will take our next question from Zach Silverberg with Mizuho.

Zachary D. Silverberg
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Could you guys just talk about the opportunity set on your development pipeline after the 2 new starts,
you're up to about. It was $600 million properties under development, what type of terms are you
underwriting? And sort of how does that compare to the acquisition market in those specific markets?

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Yes, Zach, this is Brad. I think Eric touched on it a bit in his comments. We do have a number of sites
that we're currently working on predevelopment work on. We've got some that are owned, some that are
under contract. I'd say in terms of the terms they were underwriting, not a lot different than what we've
underwritten previously.

We are fortunate in our markets that the rents have continued to hold up within our markets. So we're
not having to make some aggressive assumptions with rent trending or some large recovery in rent in our
underwriting.

So the 2 that we just started, as I said in my comments, we're still looking at north of a 6% yield. And
certainly, that compares very favorably when you look at Class A brand-new products in our markets, what
they're trading at today. So we continue to believe in that. We have another own site that we purchased

in Denver. We hope to start in 2022. We're working on a site in Tampa, a site in Raleigh. Those are likely
2022 sites as well.

And then we have under our prepurchase platform, where we've got 1 in Salt Lake City that we hope to
start in the second quarter and then another site in Denver in our prepurchase platform that we're hopeful
will start in the third quarter of this year. So...

Zachary D. Silverberg
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Got you. I appreciate the color. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned it was about 3%, I think of
gross assets and there was moderate risk. Sort of what is the maximum and minimum risk you're willing
to slide the lever on in between development?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

I think we've discussed historically somewhere around 4% to 5% would be a range that we would look at.
I think -- but when you're looking at your actual pipeline relative to your enterprise value, another aspect
of risk is how much is unfunded. And so I'd point to this fact that we have $600 million sort of going right
now. We only have a fairly small amount that's unfunded. So I think those 2 factors together is what you
will consider. So we're definitely at the low end of the risk range on that right now, and you'll see our
pipeline grow a bit 2021, as Brad talked about in early 2022, but certainly a modest risk program, given
our profile.

Operator

And we'll go next to Rich Anderson with SMBC.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

And of course, Eric, I didn't expect you to open up the comments suggesting that everyone is going to
move out of the Sunbelt next year. So no surprise there. But if you do look at the statistics, in the period
after the last great recession, 2010 time frame, the migration out of New York, for example, substantially
slowed.

And you can argue that there are some real bargains in a lot of other areas that you're not in, that could
entice people perhaps even more this time around than then. Again, it's never been positive in migration.
Really, I don't think that's ever happened with the Sunbelt into a market like New York, but it probably will
normalize.

And so when you mentioned this 12.2% of total leasing is moving from outside your footprint, how much
is that impacting your growth profile? Because you really probably don't want to hang your hat on that
type of level for very long.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

No. I mean, I think that we still believe that a lot of the growth that we will have in demand, if you will,
will be people that have been in the Sunbelt, we'll stay in the Sunbelt organic, if you will. So I don't
disagree that the 12% -- go back 2 years ago, before COVID, the move-ins from outside of our footprint
were a little over 9%. So even compared to where we are today with COVID, it's only moved up from
9% of our move-ins from outside the footprint to 12% of the -- so I -- your point is valid in that sense. It
hasn't changed radically.

But I just -- I feel like that what we're going to find is that over the next -- I think there's real
fundamental shift that has -- that was in place, if you will, to some degree before COVID as employers and
job seekers, if you will, were continually drawn to this region of the country as a consequence of all the
things that you know about.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

And I just believe that those factors have not moderated. They have not lessened. COVID accelerated
them a little bit, but those trends are going to continue well past COVID. And I think that what we're
finding that is, particularly as some of this millennial generation continues to age. They've moved in up
in their career. They've moved into jobs increasingly that I think offer the ability to be more remote than
they have been in the past.

That drive that they had to be in New York and work 60, 70 hours a week that was then. They're in a
different place now. And I just -- I feel like that a combination of, frankly, the aging millennial generation
and how their lifestyle needs evolve and desires change as well as retiring baby boomers, who are looking
for change and looking for more affordable living. Those 2 big slugs of the demographics of the U.S., the
millennials and the retiring baby boomers, those are huge numbers. And as those 2 age demographics
evolve, I think the Sunbelt stands to benefit more so than some of the higher cost coastal markets.

And so I heard somebody suggest that, yes, the coastal markets are going to -- the gateway markets are
going to come back. But they're probably going to come back a little bit cheaper and a little bit younger
than they were before. And I think there's probably some truth to that.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Good enough. That's good color. And then my second question, perhaps, well, maybe on the
uncomfortable side, but I never shy away from that. You had some sort of C-suite succession activity in
some of your peers, Essex, UDR, Avalon Bay. And I wonder, to your credit, Eric, you have made MAA not
an [ ever-golden ] show. You have a great bench there. And I think everyone recognizes that. But can you
talk about how much this team right now today looks to be in place for the next, at least few, 3, 4 years?
Or we can talk about the succession plan that's perhaps in place for you and others, how that dialogue is
happening at the Board level?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Well, we can take a poll around the table right now, if you want, but we won't do that. What I would
tell you, Rich, is it's a very active topic at the Board level. We discuss it to some degree, at every meeting.
There's active planning that's underway and continues to this day. I will tell you that, I feel great and
have no plans to do anything different. I don't play golf. And don't really have anything else to do. So I'm
focused and plan to continue in that way for some time.

But as you point out, we've got a great team, great bench strength. The company has been through a
lot in the last 7 to 8 years. The team has really come together. And so we're developing and focus on
leadership development and leadership succession. But frankly, we don't see a lot of change on the near-
term horizon. Okay. Great.

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Rick, just a real quick point on what we're hanging our hat on. As you mentioned earlier, I mean, supply is
going to be pretty much the same. Job growth in 2020 was negative 6.1% in our market. It's going to be
plus 3, 4. That 900 basis point swing in job growth is really what we're hanging our hat on for near-term
growth.

We'll take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.

Richard Wynn Skidmore
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Eric, just a question, just with regards to how you think about development going forward and the shift
in perhaps working from home and people wanting more space. Are you changing the design of the

developments? And does that change the economics in terms of how you think about returns as you go
forward?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Rick, I mean we are a little bit more focused on creating workspace areas, nooks and things of that nature
in a number of our apartments. And we're also very much more oriented towards outdoor amenity areas in
shared office sort of configurations in some of our leasing centers.

Frankly, it's not really having much of an impact on our overall cost of build-out. And we certainly think
that there's a lot of reason to continue to introduce more of the support for work from home, but no real
significant change in terms of the cost impact for us.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Could you give us the actual data around what the ratio of jobs to new supply is in 2021 for your markets
versus maybe 2019 and some historical averages, if you have that with you?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, of course. For our group, the jobs to completion ratio last year was negative 8.1%. It swings to
positive $7.1 million. And I think we've consistently found that [ 5:1 ] is a place where we can grow rents.
So it's a substantial shift and sort of the key to our rent growth aspirations.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes. Appreciate the data point. And I think it kind of really goes to some of the questions that I've heard
asked, and maybe, Eric, your tone, just on the recovery in your market seems pretty upbeat.

But yet, when you kind of take where fourth quarter same-store revenue growth was, and you look at
the midpoint of the guidance, you layer in the accelerating redevelopment. I guess one of the questions
we have, and I think others are driving at is, why isn't that driving a little more reacceleration other than
just the earn-in of last year's effective rents. Is there anything else you've assumed in guidance, higher
turnover, lower occupancy that's contributing to maybe a more muted reacceleration in 2021?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

No. I think that what you have to recognize is that getting the revenue impact of pricing changes takes
time and it takes time to go up, and it takes time to go down. We went into the 2020 with some of the
highest earned-in leasing performance that we've ever had, and that allowed effective rent per unit to
remain fairly strong, if you will, throughout 2020, which was hugely helpful. I remember late in 2019, if
people asking me, what I'm worried about. And I've said, I'm worried about the slowdown. I'm worried
about something happening with the economy. And in preparation for that worry, the best thing we could
do is, grow rents as hard as we could, even at the expense of giving up a little bit of occupancy and
allow that compounding benefit to be there as a protective performance on revenues, should we see the
economy weaken and that certainly helped us this past year.

So what I would tell you is, I mean, there are 2 things that play here that I think are going to cause the
recovery process, recovery slope to be steady as opposed to being a real steep up-up curve, if you will.
One is, we are still battling supply issues, and we will have those supply issues throughout 2021, pretty
consistent with what we saw in 2020. And we think it actually peaks in the first part of the year and

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

probably starts to moderate a little bit towards the back half of the year, but that's well after we get past
the peak leasing season for 2021.

So -- and then as we pointed out, the supply picture, I think, improves as we get into 2022 and beyond,
at least for a couple of years. I think probably by the time we get to '24, '25, it starts to accelerate again
as a consequence of what we see happening with permitting today.

But the other factor that is at play here is that, we are still now carrying and the first quarter of this year
is going to reflect the full negative impact of the pricing performance that we had to do during the spring
and summer leasing season of 2020 when it was at its weakest. And so that -- all that's going to continue
to roll through the portfolio and it will peak, we believe, in the first quarter.

But as we get into the spring and summer leasing season of 2021, where we do believe that the leasing
environment, it will be much more positive and better than we will again start to compound that
improvement in terms of our revenue performance, and it will build, and it will build by the time we get
into late 2021, and particularly as we get into 2022. So that -- those 2 things sort of supply pressure, but
particularly sort of the compounding effect of lease-over-lease pricing and what it does to revenues, it
takes time for that to work through the system.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

No, that's very helpful. And then you guys mentioned the -- where you expect cap rates on dispositions
this year for the assets that you have teed up. Where would you pay cap rates today just kind of across
your markets? And I'm curious if you have a sense of maybe what type of growth buyers are underwriting
and how far off you think you are on assets that you're betting on?

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Well, Austin, this is Brad. I would say talking about cap rates across our markets. Certainly, as I
mentioned, it's very aggressive on new assets for these Class A new assets in our markets that we're
looking at. I would say from a growth aspect, it's hard to pinpoint what the other folks are certainly
underwriting. I would say one of the things that's driving the difference in valuation, it really is leverage.
Certainly, our leverage level is a lot different than high-levered buyers that are looking for 65% to, call
it, 80% leverage on some of these deals and given where interest rates are. That's a big difference in the
valuation of these assets.

And so I'd say that's probably one of the levers that's having a biggest impact on our ability to be able to
compete with those folks.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That makes sense. Any sense where maybe the cap rate spread is versus long-term interest rates versus a
couple of years ago? Has that tightened at all in your markets?

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

I think it's certainly pretty low. I think if we're seeing interest rates right now in the 3.5% -- 3% to 3.5%
range, it's probably come up a little bit in the last 30, 60 days or so. And you're still seeing, again, cap
rates in the low 3s -- or high 3s, low 4s. That spread is certainly low right now. And yes, we'll just have
to see as interest rates move a little bit more and these LTVs change a little bit, how that filters through
in pricing, we just don't know right now. There's so little assets coming to market that they're able to still
find a buyer for most of these assets.

But as the supply of these properties pick up and come to market, we'll just have to see if there's an
impact to pricing once that picks up and the supply/demand on investments here changes a bit.

We'll move next to John Pawlowski with Green Street.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Just one question for me. Tom, last few quarters, the smaller markets have really outperformed your
larger metros. Are you seeing notable -- the same notable in-migration trends in the Alabamas and
Memphis, Greenville? Or is this just more of a factor of more supply hitting the larger metros a little
harder?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

I think -- I mean, we're seeing the increase in in-migration sort of everywhere, and you do have it in
places like Greenville, but it's consistent, and it's been the same thing than it has been before. Things like
BMW and BASF and Michelin and those large international manufacturing conglomerates that are in those
in those places. But it is -- so it is those are holding -- that is continuing. And then obviously, we're seeing
strong results out of some of the larger markets that are like Phoenix and Raleigh.

But the spread of in-migration is fairly widespread. Even Huntsville is picking up some of it because of the
NASA expansion.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

And John, I would add to what Tom is saying is that, yes, I mean, we do see the supply pressure more
pronounced generally in the bigger markets. And that historically has always been the case, which is why
we've always intentionally embraced a good component or a percentage of the portfolio to be invested in
some of these secondary markets.

We think that, that secondary market exposure does provide some downside protection to our
performance profile against the pressures that often come from time to time from supply. And so those
secondary markets we're doing exactly what we thought they would do during this phase of the cycle.

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Sorry, John, I misheard a bit there. And then I'd also add in, the supplies you expect and largely
know on those large markets tends to be more urban [ inter looping ] suburban balance that we have has
helped us there as well.

We will take our final question Buck Horne with Raymond James.

Buck Horne
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Thanks for keeping the call going along. I appreciate it. I'm going to ask one question then. Single family
rentals. Thinking about, you've seen a lot of homebuilders validate the concept getting into purpose-built
communities of single-family rentals that can operate like horizontal apartments with an amenity, maybe
in more kind of outlined locations, but definitely Sunbelt.

Does a concept like a purpose-built single-family rental community potentially offer you anything
attractive in terms of diversifying the product mix? Or how do you think about that concept going forward?

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Buck, it is something that we've been talking about a bit. I do think that if you get a purpose-built single-
family rental community, where you get, if you will, all the homes in a very organized, defined sort of
community footprint, on the lines what you just described kind of a horizontal multifamily plan, if you will,
then, yes, we think that there may be some logic to that.

We are -- we've seen a few examples from time to time. And should -- right now, of course, that kind
of opportunity is attracting a ton of capital. So pricing is pretty competitive. But should the opportunity
present itself for something that along the lines of what you're describing, it would be something we would
take a hard look at for sure.

There are no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for any closing remarks.
