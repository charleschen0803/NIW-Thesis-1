Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, good day, everyone, and welcome to the Northern Trust Corporation Fourth Quarter
2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call
over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Bette, for opening remarks and introductions. Please
go ahead, sir.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP, Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's Fourth Quarter
2019 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'Grady, our Chairman and
CEO; Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; Lauren Allnutt, our Controller; and Kelly Lernihan from our
Investor Relations team. Our fourth quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both
available on our website at northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings
review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call.

This January 22 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this
call is the replay that will be available on our website through February 19. Northern Trust disclaims any
continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.

Now for our safe harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-
looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or
future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these
statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are
difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual
results. [Operator Instructions]

Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As you know, Jason Tyler became our CFO as of January
1, as Biff Bowman will be retiring after 35 years at Northern Trust. We're grateful to Biff for his many
contributions as a trusted colleague and thoughtful leader throughout his time and especially for his
significant contributions as CFO for the previous 5 years. I welcome Jason to the CFO role. He brings deep
financial expertise and leadership experience, and I'm confident he will be very successful in the role.

Before Jason goes through our results in detail, I'd like to comment on some of the trends we're seeing in
our businesses. Our performance for 2019 continued to exhibit foundational strength as we executed on a
number of growth strategies while continuing to advance our digital efforts and improve our productivity.
Our results for the year generated a return on average common equity of 14.9%. We also returned a
record $1.7 billion to our common shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 11.8 million
shares.

In our Wealth Management business, our capabilities and positioning continue to resonate in the
marketplace. On a year-over-year basis, assets under management grew 13% to $314 billion and assets
under custody grew 18% to $736 billion. On the capability front, spurring some of this growth, we
continue to invest in our data, digital and analytics capabilities as well as the innovations around the
delivery of goals-driven holistic advice.

We also closed out the year with the opening of a new office in Philadelphia, and we were named the Best
Private Bank by the Financial Times Group for the ninth time out of the last 11 years. In sum, for Wealth
Management, it was a very solid year of performance and momentum.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Our Corporate & Institutional Services business remains focused on executing its growth strategies,
digitalizing the business and innovating for the future to enable scalable growth. Assets under custody
and administration ended the year at $11.3 trillion, up 19% from the prior year. We continue to achieve
healthy organic growth in our core asset servicing fees within both the asset manager and asset owner
segments, driven by our strong positioning. We are also making targeted investments that are expected to
continue to fuel growth in areas like front and middle office outsourcing and capital markets.

For example, we launched new capabilities in front office solutions, integrated trading solutions and
currency management in 2019. Finally, C&IS is executing a multiyear strategy to digitize the business to
drive more profitable, scalable and sustainable growth into the future.

In Asset Management, we ended the year with $1.2 trillion in assets under management, an increase of
15% from the prior year. As the industry transitions through key secular shifts, we are delivering long-
term value to stakeholders through: first, strengthening our areas of competitive advantage, such as
portfolio construction, quantitative research and liquidity management; second, prioritizing investment
in growth markets and growth segments such as financial intermediaries and family offices; and third,
shifting our business mix to higher value-add products such as quant active, ETF, ESG and multiasset.

As we enter 2020, we are excited about the competitive positioning within each of our businesses. We
remain focused on providing our clients with exceptional service and expertise, driving efficiencies into our
business and driving profitable growth.

Let me turn the call over to Jason to walk you through the details of our performance.

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mike and Mark in welcoming you to our fourth
quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported fourth
quarter net income of $371.1 million. Earnings per share were $1.70 and our return on common equity
was 14.8%. The current quarter's results included a $20.8 million charge recorded in other operating
income related to the decision to sell substantially all of the leased portfolio and a $6.8 million software
disposition charge recorded within equipment software expense. As you can see on the bottom of Page 2,
the macroeconomic environment was mixed. While equity markets were strong, short-term interest rates
in the U.S. declined both on a sequential as well as a year-over-year basis.

Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue
increased 3%, with noninterest income up 4% from 1 year ago and net interest income flat. Expenses
increased 5% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $1 million in the current
quarter compared to a credit of $4 million 1 year ago. Net income was down 9% year-over-year. In a
sequential comparison, revenue increased 1%, with both noninterest income and net interest income up
1%. Expenses increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Net income declined 3% sequentially. Return
on average common equity was 14.8% for the quarter, down from 17% 1 year ago and 14.9% in the prior
quarter.

Assets under custody and administration of $12.1 trillion increased 19% compared to 1 year ago and were
up 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $9.2 trillion were up 22% compared to 1 year ago
and up 5% sequentially. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis
and up 2% on a sequential basis.

Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a
fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.6 billion, up 3% compared to last year and up 1% sequentially.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $992
million in the fourth quarter, up 6% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading
income was $65 million in the fourth quarter, down 17% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. The year-
over-year decline is primarily related to lower foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Other noninterest income was $70 million in the fourth quarter, down 6% compared to 1 year ago
and down 17% sequentially. Other operating income included the aforementioned $20.8 million loss
relating to the lease portfolio. Excluding the lease-related loss, the year-over-year growth was driven by
implementation with bank-owned life insurance program during 2019 and strong security commissions
and trading income. The sequential growth, excluding the lease portfolio loss, was primarily driven by
favorability in the Visa-related swap. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $430
million in the fourth quarter, flat with the other period -- flat with the prior period and up 1% sequentially.

Now let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate &
Institutional Services business, fees totaled $567 million in the fourth quarter and were up 6% year-over-
year and up 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of
C&IS fees, were $397 million and up 6% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-
year performance was primarily driven by new business and favorable equity markets. Performance on a
sequential basis was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and favorable markets.

Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $11.3 trillion at quarter end, up 19% year-
over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was primarily
driven by higher markets, new business and favorable currency translation. Recall that lagged market
values factor into the quarter's fees, with both quarter-lag and month-lag markets impacting our C&IS
custody and fund administration fees.

Investment management fees in C&IS of $116 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-
year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business and favorable
markets. The sequential performance was primarily due to favorable markets. Assets under management
for C&IS were $917 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase
was driven by favorable markets and new business as well as an increase in end-of-period securities
lending collateral levels. We've had strong success within our liquidity [ portfolio ], with significant growth
in our institutional cash funds. The sequential increase is primarily driven by markets, partially offset by a
decline in period-end securities lending collateral levels.

Securities lending fees were $23 million in the fourth quarter, up 4% year-over-year and up 12%
sequentially. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by higher volumes, while the sequential
increase is primarily driven by higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $163 billion at quarter end
and averaged $164 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 4% year-over-year and
were down 7% sequentially.

Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $425 million
in the fourth quarter, were up 7% compared to the prior quarter and up 2% sequentially. Both the year-
over-year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under
management were $314 billion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Increases
were primarily driven by favorable markets.

Moving on to Page 6. Net interest income was $430 million in the fourth quarter and flat compared to the
prior year. Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. Total deposits
averaged $89 billion and were down 4% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.59% in the
fourth quarter and was up 7 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin
compared to the prior year primarily reflects the balance sheet mix shift and the impact of lower foreign
exchange swap volume, particularly -- partially offset by lower short-term interest rates versus 1 year
ago.

On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up 1%. Average earning assets increased 2% on a
sequential basis, while the net interest margin declined 2 basis points. It's worth noting that net interest
income results for the quarter did include approximately $6 million in various onetime nonrepeating items.
During the quarter, we also added to our bank-owned life insurance program that was first put in place
during the second quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, this quarter's net interest income declined by
approximately $900,000 as a result of the additional BOLI, while other operating income benefited by
$1.5 million. The full quarterly run rate will be reached in the first quarter of 2020, with an additional net
interest income decline of approximately $2.3 million and other operating income increase of $2.7 million

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

on a sequential basis. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter, U.S. dollar
deposits represented 68% of our total deposits. This is down from 70% 1 year ago and 69% in the prior
quarter.

Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 5% higher than the prior
year and 3% higher versus the prior quarter. Compensation expense totaled $463 million and was up
4% compared to 1 year ago. The year-over-year growth is primarily related to higher salaries, driven by
base pay adjustments and staff growth, partially offset by lower incentive expense. On a sequential basis,
compensation was up 1%. The sequential increase was partially due to higher salary expense, driven by
staff growth and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by lower cash-based incentive accruals.

Employee benefit expense of $93 million was up 2% from 1 year ago and was up 6% sequentially. The
year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher payroll taxes, while the sequential growth was
primarily due to increased medical costs. As it pertains to our benefits expense in 2020, due to changes
in underlying assumptions, we expect to see an increase in full year pension expense of just over $30
million, which represents a 0.7% increase in our overall total 2019 expense base.

Outside services costs of $206 million were up 5% on a year-over-year basis and up 6% sequentially. The
year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher technical services, consulting and legal expense.
The sequential increase was primarily due to higher legal and consulting services as well as costs related
to increased business volumes, including brokerage clearing, market data, sub-custody and third-party
adviser fees. Equipment software expense of $165 million was up 8% from 1 year ago and up 9%
sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were impacted by the previously mentioned
software disposition charge of $6.8 million. The year-over-year growth also reflects higher depreciation
and amortization, while higher software amortization costs contributed to the sequential increase.

Occupancy expense of $57 million was up 15% from 1 year ago and up 8% sequentially. Both the year-
over-year and sequential increases were driven by higher rent and building operation costs related to our
workplace real estate strategies. Other operating expense of $88 million was down 1% from 1 year ago
and down 4% sequentially. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the Northern Trust-sponsored
golf tournament in the prior quarter, partially offset by increases in advertising, staff-related and other
operating expense categories.

As we've discussed on previous calls, through our Value for Spend initiative that we started in 2017, we've
been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by
2020. Our current quarter results reflect approximately $60 million in expense savings or $240 million
in annualized run rate savings. Our efforts around Value for Spend and productivity more broadly will
not cease as we further embed a culture of sustainable expense management across the company.
Expense management is a core emphasis, and we continue to focus on striking the right balance between
productivity, growth and investing in the business.

Now turning to full year, our results in 2019 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $1.5 billion,
down 4% compared with 2018, and earnings per share were $6.63, flat with the prior year. On the right
margin of this page, we outline the nonrecurring impacts that were called out for both years. We achieved
a return on equity for the year of 14.9% compared to 16.2% in 2018.

The full year revenue expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing
fees grew 3% in 2019. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business and favorable
markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation. Foreign exchange trading
income declined 18%, driven by a decrease in foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function
as well as decreases in market volatility and lower client volumes. Net interest income increased 3%.
Average earning assets during the year declined by 6%, while net interest margin increased 14 basis
points. The net result was 2% growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2019. On a reported basis,
expenses were up 3% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense charges in both 2018 and 2019 that
are on the prior page, expenses were also up 3% from 2018.

Now turning to Page 10. Our capital ratios remain strong where common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.7%
under the standardized approach and 13.3% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage

ratio of the corporation was 7.6% and at the bank was 6.4%, both of which achieved 3% minimum
requirement. During the fourth quarter, we declared cash dividends totaling $150 million to common
stockholders and repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of $264 million. These 2
factors combined represent a payout ratio of approximately 113% for the quarter.

Also during the fourth quarter, Northern Trust issued $400 million in perpetual preferred stock at a fixed-
for-life dividend rate of 4.7% callable in 5 years. Fixed rate dividends for this new issuance are expected
to be paid on a quarterly basis, with the first dividend declared at our Board of Directors meeting earlier
this week and to be paid April 1, 2020. Given the November issuance, the initial preferred dividend
payment will cover approximately 5 months and therefore is expected to equal $7.6 million in the first
quarter of 2020. Going forward, these fixed rate dividends are expected to be $4.7 million per quarter.
The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C preferred stock in
January -- on January 2, 2020. First quarter 2020 results will include $11.5 million in accelerated Series C-
related costs.

Now let me turn the call back over to Mike for closing comments.

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Before we open up the call for Q&A, I wanted to close by talking about our key financial objectives and our
performance against these in 2019. Our primary financial target is to achieve a return on average common
equity of between 10% to 15%. For 2019, our ROE of 14.9% was at the high end of that range. This was
the sixth consecutive year we have achieved our targeted ROE.

We are also focused on driving profitable growth and have objectives to achieve both fee operating
leverage and positive operating leverage. Although we have achieved positive fee operating leverage in
8 of the last 10 years and positive operating leverage in 7 of the last 10 years, we did not achieve those
for 2019. As we enter 2020, we are continuing to rapidly evolve the company by providing differentiated
services and experiences to our clients and investing in innovative capabilities to do more for our existing
clients and gain new clients. We combine this with our intense focus on improving our productivity to
profitably grow the company and create value for our stakeholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you again for participating in the Northern Trust fourth
quarter earnings conference call today. Jason, Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions.
David, could you please open the line?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

And our first question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Mike, picking up on the last point, I guess when you talk about operating leverage, I guess, over the last
few quarters, you guys talked about getting organic expense growth to be in line with organic fee growth,
not just total fee growth. I guess, question number one there, is the organic fee growth still in the 3% to
4% kind of range as you look out into 2020? And then secondly, should we expect you to achieve this level
of expense growth for the full year sort of despite the fact that markets are starting off on a very strong
point, and that should naturally create more kind of pressure or more tailwinds, rather, to fees? And I'm
just wondering whether or not the sort of level of expense growth could be sustainable into 2020.

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

So Alex, I think you're thinking about the framework the right way, which is, as I mentioned earlier, we are
focused on the objective of generating positive fee operating leverage. And underneath that is the goal to
achieve that on an organic basis as well, knowing that, that is a higher bar, if you will. But the reason why
we focus on an organic basis is because just as you indicated, when markets are stronger, we expect that
we'll get more positive fee operating leverage from that. It's more challenging to achieve that in, call it,
lower growth environments than when we do have the tailwinds, but that's why it's important to have that
primary objective around organic.

In 2019, we did not achieve the organic fee operating leverage. And that's something that, certainly, as
far as what we're shooting for, we're trying to get that so that if we would have achieved it, we would have
positive fee operating leverage here for the year. And going into 2020, it's the same objective. Now as
Jason talked about and can go into more detail, there are certain aspects of the expense base that roll
in, in this case, pension, as he mentioned, for example, $30 million increase for the year. We still look to
cover that, if you will, and try to just focus on the productivity objectives to try to overcome things like
that as well. So the goals haven't changed. From year to year, we can have different challenges to achieve
it. But as far as what we're trying to achieve, it's the same objective.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then, Jason, one cleanup for you for NIR. It sounded like there were $6 million of onetime, I
believe it was a benefit in Q4. Can you flesh that out a little bit? So what are those benefits and maybe
help us bridge the kind of the right jumping off point for Q1 '20 NIR as we zone in on the quarter here?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, you got the headline number right, it's about $6 million. It's a combination of a couple of different
items. There's some premium AM. And then one thing we didn't headline much, but we did have a payoff
of a non-accruable loan -- that was a nonaccrual. We picked up another $2 million in interest on that. And
then the FTE adjustment was a couple of million dollars higher. So you add those factors together and you
get to the $6 million.

Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.

James Francis Mitchell
The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated

Can we just talk a little bit about the period-end balance sheet? It really kind of spiked. Is that what --
should we take that as a sort of transitory? Because if you look at average balances, they weren't up that
much. Or is there something that's continuing into 1Q that we should maybe up our assumptions around
deposit growth, given Fed actions, et cetera?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. You're right, it was high. I actually look back to see if this is a record high. It wasn't but it was close.
But more importantly, it did come -- it has come back down. The -- obviously, as you know, the balance
sheet tends to spike at the end of the quarters and particularly the end of the years. This was higher than
normal, not a record, but already, we've seen more normalization as some of the large clients put money
back to work into the market in different ways.

James Francis Mitchell
The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated

Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the comp line and expenses going forward. Just on -- you
had headcount growth of 5%. So how do we think about that kind of upward pressure from headcount
growth versus your desire to kind of the scalable [ digitization ], trying to keep core expense growth below
organic growth, but we're kind of starting off with a much higher employee base, how do we think about
the comp line specifically?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

So a couple of things. And maybe you might be looking at Page 7 of the press release and you get the
comp line there. And I look at it more on Q4 '18 versus Q4 '19 and you've got a 4% growth rate there.
So the first thing that from my lens is to say, what was revenue growth? What was really trust fee growth
over that time frame? And it was about 6.25%. So first of all, on that comp line, even though it's a tiny
bit higher than we'd like to see, we did get leverage in that, which is good. And we're in a year where
we've got revenue up, a lot of our expenses are going to bring -- a lot of our revenue growth is going to
bring with it expense growth, and it's going to hit in just about every one of the key expense line items,
including comp.

The second thing to -- for us to think about is that in general, we've got a technology investment that
we're making. And so part of the reason that number may be a little higher is that some of the tech
investments that we're making in the business are coming through in that comp line.

And third, just so you guys are thinking about it the right way coming into the next year, we're always
going to have effectively, call it, $30 million to $40 million base pay adjustment for the comp line. And so
you think about that on the base of business that we have here, that's going to lead to almost 1 point, in
and of itself, in the growth. So those are just a couple of ways, different lenses to think about that line
item.

Operator

Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to follow up a little bit on that regarding just technology in general. I know in the past,
you've given some insight on what your tech budget is. Maybe you could give us a little sense as to how
you see that trajecting over time. I know you don't give guidance but just to understand, do you think
that trajectory is accelerating, decelerating? And then how you see that shifting over time, comp versus
noncomp as it relates to tech?

CFO & Executive VP

Yes. So it's obviously -- we've got a high sense of urgency as we think about expenses in general, and
tech is where it is outsized relative to the other areas. And so you're right to hone in on it. A couple of
data points as you think about next year. One is, as I take a step back, we thought about what we wanted
to convey that we know about. We don't want to give guidance on expenses, but we do want to tell you
what we know at this point. And there are some things that we have high degree of certainty of as we sit,
at this point, coming into 2020. So I'm going to do those in 3 buckets just to put those out.

One, I hinted to a couple of minutes ago, and that comes down to the compensation line. We know that
we're going to see, in general, a lot of -- somewhere between $35 million, $40 million just in base pay
adjustments, based on the business that we have. Secondly, we talked about pension being a little over
$30 million higher. And then third is, we have a sense right now of what IT depreciation is going to look
like, and that's about $40 million higher for the year in 2020 than it was -- than it will be as we look back
on 2019.

Now some of that is reflected in the fourth quarter. And so we can -- it's hard for us to develop [ most of
it ] but we do know that on a year-over-year [Audio Gap] $40 million higher. So those are 3 key items that
I think everybody -- we want to make sure everybody is aware of because we've got clear line of sight
on them at this point. And the second, more broadly, as we think about how do we depict the IT budget
and this IT increase, it is actually hitting in a lot of different line items. So just we're talking about Page 7
on the press release a minute ago, stay there for a second and if you look at these different line items, I
actually went back and pulled out IT from each of the different components that you can see externally to
get a sense of how much they're impacting those growth areas because I do look at not just comp, which
we were talking about a second ago, but all of those line items, trying to get a sense of whether we're
getting leverage there.

And obviously, the biggest -- it hits very heavily in equipment and software, which is why you'll see that
line item be pretty elevated. But there's also smaller but still meaningful impacts that will hit in obviously,
compensation, employee benefits and outside services.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And is it still around $1 billion that you're thinking the tech budget was in 2019? I recall that was the
estimate that was given most recently.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP, Director of Investor Relations

Yes, Betsy, this is Mark. Yes, about -- we look at it kind of on a 3-year rolling average, so 2019, 2020,
2021, a little bit over $1 billion per year, and that includes both operating expense as well as capital
investments.

Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Maybe just a question on NII. Is there any impact on future net interest income from the sale of the
leasing portfolio? And if so, if you can quantify that. And then also, if you can talk about what you're
seeing for deposit trends into 1Q so far.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

So on -- I'm just going to write down deposit trends. On the impact of more lease on NIM, very de minimis
increase, nothing to really think about. That's pretty clean accounting perspective on how that was hit.
And then secondly, on deposit trends coming in more broadly, I know that it's -- first of all, it's a strategic
focus for us across the business on both the Wealth side and on the C&IS side. And we've talked about on,
the Wealth side in particular, we told you about some strategic initiatives we have there to bring -- that
brought some money out of the 2a-7 funds on to the balance sheet. That's held in pretty well.

And then I'd say, on the Institutional side of the business, it's more volatile. And there's no -- the
initiatives that we have there aren't as aggressive as what we've been thinking about on the Wealth side,
but we're still doing everything we can to make sure we're getting a good share of our deposits -- of the
deposits coming in from clients as the custody book grows and as we're talking to clients across the globe.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So on an averaging basis, is that -- are you expecting growth in 1Q based on those initiatives? I know the
end-of-period was elevated, of course, but if we think about it average to average.

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

No, I think there was a -- if you think about the asset side and then the funding side, if you think about
NIM, the only other item there of note, there was a little bit, and it's a couple of billion dollars higher
on that, but that didn't really come more from the deposit side, it came more from trading-related
activity. And so there's nothing I'd call out at this point that would lead you to say that deposits would be
moderately or significantly different.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, great. And then on organic growth, I think you commented on Wealth Management, AUM being up
mostly from the markets. Just wanted to get a sense, that's been a strong driver of organic growth for
you guys for a while. I just want to get a sense of the cadence of the organic growth trends in Wealth
Management versus the asset servicing business. And as you think about expenses, are we still thinking
about a comparable growth rate in expense growth, even with those headwinds that you've mentioned
on the comp, pension and the IT side? Is that still reasonable to think of a rate of growth that would be
similar to the organic growth, if that's still like trending towards the mid-single digits?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

When you hit the top side first on the growth side and the trends within the Wealth business, the
business is continuing to do well. And Mike touched on it earlier this year, some really nice differentiated
approaches that, that business has, the market with goals-driven Wealth Management, resonates very
well. And the trend there that continues to be seen and come through on the financials, and you guys are
able to see this actually, is that we're doing well at the very top end of the market.

And so the family office business is growing faster, and you can see that in the numbers we report on both
a sequential basis and a year-over-year basis. That trend has been going on for a while, and it's attractive.
And then the second component is how we'll see the expenses align differently between the business.
I'm going to separate it in a couple of ways. One is that the tech-related expenses apply a little bit more
towards the C&IS side of the business. As we think about things like matrix and our strategic operating
model, those things are going to be allocated a little bit more toward the C&IS side of the business. That
said, the Wealth side of the business is also investing in different ways, and they're working hard on
digitizing the business. Mike talked about that earlier, that we're probably a little ahead in our investments
there on the C&IS side. Wealth is starting to think more about how to reflect the digital transformation
that we've seen across the marketplace and how we can take our position with things like [ culture and ]
Wealth Management, make it even more accessible to clients, have even better interactions and have
better foundational technology.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And are we still thinking about organic growth in that sort of mid-single-digit area on a go-forward basis,
sort of low to mid-single digits?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Brian, just to confirm, are you talking about wealth or the corporation as a whole?

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

The company as a whole.

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So maybe just to address that, Brian, kind of across the businesses. So Jason talked about Wealth
Management. We continued to see, as you mentioned, healthy, solid growth in that business. That's the
nature of it. And again, our strategic imperative in that business is to increase or accelerate that growth
even more. We're still seeing a higher growth rate in our asset servicing business. And so that continues.
It's at the lower end of its range, but it continues to grow at a healthy rate. And the strategic imperative
for that business is, yes, to continue that growth but we want to see that growth be more scalable.

And then I would just also add, with our Asset Management business, we're all well aware of the secular
trends in the industry there. And I would say, that certainly impacted our Asset Management business,
although comparatively, the business is performing well. And so it's experiencing positive organic growth,
just meaning they're able to increase the flows but also then change the mix in such a way that it is
offsetting the fee compression that you're seeing across the industry. So it's positive. Having said that, it
is at a lower rate than the other 2 businesses.

So you put that all together, to your point, we've talked about the organic growth rate for our fees at the
company level kind of being mid-single digits. That's still the case. We're at the lower end of that right
now. So what does that mean? Well, that's why we're focused on our growth strategies and executing
on those. But that's why one of our other key priorities for the company is on continually improving
our productivity. And when we are at the lower end of the growth side, we have to work just that much
harder on the expense side to get more savings, if you will, on the expense side. So that's the strategy,
if you will, and again, focused on trying to execute that so that we can deliver the positive fee operating
leverage.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Jason, could you expand a little bit more on -- underneath the fact that you said that some of the balances
might have gone off the balance sheet, can you help us understand either how much you saw is like the
overgrowth in the earning assets this quarter? And then secondarily, if rates stay stable from here, can
you talk us through the dynamics of NIM in terms of how much asset repricing has to come through and
how much deposit repricing you could still see happen now that we've gotten to a more stable level of
banks?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Sure. So on the first, I think it's -- as these spikes happen late in the quarter, it's frankly a relatively short
period of time that these spikes are on balance sheet. And so it comes in late and at least pretty early.

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

And so -- and we're not doing anything fancy when those dollars come in. And so frankly, it just doesn't
impact the overall NIM very much. It does spike that, we're obviously looking at the balance sheet on a
daily basis. It spikes that and -- but it doesn't -- I don't think it really drives NIM that much at the end of
the day.

And then as we look out into next quarter, I don't think that spike should necessarily be reflected in your
thought process as you think about -- so that's more from a volume perspective. As you think about --
although I did hint earlier that kind of that $2 billion increase in the securities portfolio. I do think that's
likely to come down, and that had more to do with, I think, more idiosyncratic trading that was happening
at the time. Nothing abnormal, we just said we're trading some more longer-dated securities and the
security settlement process led to higher securities being on. That's really what led to that little bit of an
average increase, and I think that will update.

As we think about the rates going forward into the first quarter, the thing that we can all see that will
have maybe more of an impact than what people realize is that Fed funds to LIBOR spread. And that did
have an impact in fourth quarter. And when we talked to everyone at the conference we attended and
then on the last call, we were looking at the spread there. It was more probably 13 or 14 basis points.
And we thought that was going to go away. It actually held in, it even expanded a little bit. But now that
compression that we anticipated has actually come to fruition. And if you look at that delta right now, it's
more on the 9, 10 basis point land. And so that is a factor that if that holds in, that would have an impact
on what we would think about for NIM for next quarter.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then do you have the ability to reprice much on the right side of the balance sheet? Can you
just talk us about customer dynamics outside of just market index type of deposits? Like how is the
discussion going with clients? And what opportunities do you still have to reduce rate?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. It's just so incredibly different between the businesses. And so on the Institutional side, first of
all, the deposits there are driven a lot more by our EMEA clients. And in that thought, those clients are
shopping in real time. And so we're making very tight decisions on those, and we can only -- we're going
to get what the market gives us, frankly. And so -- and we're not in a position to be a price leader there.

Now on the other side of the business, the Wealth business, very different dynamics. And there, we talked
again about the fact that we sunsetted an anchor sweep product, and we brought assets from the 2a-7
funds out of the balance sheet. We're looking much more there and can think about what we want to be
strategically in the marketplace. And to give you some headlines on how we talk about it, we do want to
-- we want to be very attractive for large depositors. And so that's where we're going to be much more
competitive. And for more of the retail client base, we're going to be less competitive. And -- but at the
top end of the market there, we're always trying to figure out how to attract and be extremely aggressive
about retaining our top depositors.

Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just wanted to start off with a question on capital. I know that in the past, you've discussed the
business need to manage to higher ratios, to ensure you don't deviate meaningfully, at least from some of
your GSIB peers are running closer to 12%-plus, given that you're competing with some of these firms for
RFPs. And I was hoping you can maybe just unpack or speak to some of the competitive considerations,
such as RFPs versus regulatory constraints. It looks like the regulatory changes are swinging the right way
in terms of SLR relief, potential for the elimination of leverage constraints in CCAR. I'm just wondering if

14

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

some of those changes come through, how that informs your willingness or appetite to manage to a lower
target over time.

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

It's Mike. Why don't I start off? So first of all, as you would expect, we feel very good about our capital
levels and our flexibility with regards to capital. As you've highlighted, we are always cognizant and
focused on what the implications would be on the business for our capital levels. And that can play into
formalized RFP processes where, yes, we want to compare favorably to some of our competitors.

But also just more broadly, and I'll say even subjectively with our Wealth Management business, dealing
with large family offices, they are looking for safety and security, conservative, strong balance sheet. And
so it's a part of the business strategy for us. Having said that, like any resource, it needs to be balanced.
And so we're comfortable with where we are. To your point, we're cognizant of where our competitor
capital levels are. And to the extent that those move, that gives us more flexibility on that front.

And then the last thing I would add is from a regulatory lens, as you've talked about, there are changes on
the regulatory front. Having said that, they've also recently recategorized banks. We're a category 2 bank.
We happen to be the only category 2 bank, which we take as a compliment, reflecting the unique nature
of our business model. But it also does mean, once again, we have to work our way through whatever
changes that may mean as far as capital management for us. We're not concerned about anything per
se, but there just is some uncertainty until they fully roll out the implications of category 2 on capital
management expectations.

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

No, very helpful color. And just one follow-up for me, just a clean-up question on the other income line.
Even when we adjust for the one-timers in the quarter, it looks like that was a source of revenue strength.
And I was hoping to gauge the sustainability of some of that strength versus the $50 million core level in
4Q. And just given some of the guidance on BOLI-related impacts, how we should think about what could
be a reasonable or appropriate run rate for that line in 2020, recognizing there's always mark-to-market
and other noise.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP, Director of Investor Relations

Steven, it's Mark. As you said, if you adjust for the lease, we would have been at closer to the $50 million
mark. There was -- the BOLI benefit came into that line. That will continue to have a little bit of a bump
up in the first quarter, like Jason said. I would say that the mark-to-market adjustment on the Visa was
favorable this quarter, about a $5 million sequential benefit, which there was more of a negative drag on
that last quarter for some of the adjustments that we made there.

This quarter, when you take that into account as well as the BOLI, we did have a little bit higher
miscellaneous income and credit and bank-related fees, probably higher than normal. One way that I
would say that you can look at that line because it does move around is if you do strip out some of the
nonrecurring items that we've had in that line. You're probably looking at an average of about $35 million
over the last several quarters. And then in theory, you could layer BOLI on top of that. That would be one
way to look at it.

Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just had a follow-up from a few of the questions that have been asked so far and just wanted to try and
frame it in the best way to think about 1Q NII. And Jason, I know -- welcome to the circus, our quarterly

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

circus here with your first call. I know your predecessor had started to help us think about one quarter
out NII. I know that was a departure from Northern's normal course of business. I don't know what your
plan is going forward, but it does seem like there's a lot of noise. So if you could help us frame how to
think about 1Q. You guys sold some of the lease portfolio, so I'm guessing we need to shrink that average
earning asset bucket a bit. We've got an over-earning of about $6 million. You've got the tighter Fed
funds/LIBOR. How should we think about how all this will weigh on NII as we go into 1Q based on what
you've seen so far?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Right. Well, I think -- Brennan, I think you've got all the pieces. The way I think about leading into it,
another couple of items: one, you talked about the one-timers of really $5 million, $6 million; secondly,
I mentioned that LIBOR/Fed funds spread, I think that's a very important one as you think about how to
model this out. And then you mentioned BOLI, which having that in place now for a full quarter because
remember, we didn't have it in place last year. The benefit of that, even if you just assume the same type
of economics that we experienced this time, should be a positive $5 million. And then lastly, we haven't
talked about the day count is going to work against us if you're thinking about it on a sequential basis.
We'll go from 92, not to 90 but to 91 with leap year. And -- but those are the -- in my mind, those are the
big 4 buckets to use as a starting point.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then when we think about the average balance sheet, it looked like there was a big -- a bit of a
jump in the other liabilities this quarter, and it's at the highest level that it's been in a couple of years by
about $1 billion. Should we -- is that temporary? Obviously, it was enough to skew the average balance for
the fourth quarter. So is there something unusual happening that will prove sustainable? Or should we just
expect that to wind down in 1Q?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

[ That's as same thing as ] earlier that had to do with more of the nature of the securities we were trading
that had more time and were in settlement mode for longer. And so that's what I think will drive, bringing
that -- the securities portfolio down to a more normalized level.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay, like TBAs or something?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Mortgage -- yes, TBAs, mortgages. Just some -- nothing that we don't normally do, just with a little
higher mix of those items that led to a higher level of securities setting. And obviously, we're not getting
the yield on those as they're setting -- settled. The other thing I just mentioned, I think -- you're right,
there is kind of a lot of question about where NIM is going, and we had gotten in a mode of talking about
what we expect and effectively providing guidance. And I'll say at this point, we do think NIM will be down
2% to 4%. But...

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

NII.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

NII will be down 2% to 4%. And so it's not to say that every quarter, we're going to give that. But I do
think -- we gave you guys a handful of different items that you had to square up to get a good launch
point. And so I think putting it out there this quarter is fair.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Terrific. And that's off the reported number in 4Q, right, the $107 billion, what we should base that
minus 2% to 4%?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Off of the reported net interest income of $430 million, right?

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Sorry, sorry, yes.

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

And so that's not indicating -- just to be super clear, it's not indicating the 1.59% is going to be down 2%
to 4%. Just the $430 million in dollars, we'd expect to be down about 2% to 4% based on the items I
walked through.

Brennan Hawken

Got it. NII, not NIM?

Jason Jerrome Tyler

Right.

Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I don't want to focus too much on 1 year, but when you look at the like not hitting the op leverage target,
was that more of a function of higher necessary investments that came up during the year? Or was
it lighter organic growth than maybe expected? And since you mentioned some of the expense items
heading into 2020 on comp, pension and tech, are there any areas like maybe real estate that you could
see some savings, given some of the repositioning that you guys have been working on?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. I'll start with the second, which we have mentioned that we expect occupancy to be higher in the
short run as we've got some double leased -- double rent payments that we have effectively. And for those
who have been as close to it, we're going through a transition of a very large number of seats from a
building we've been in for a long time in Chicago to a new building. We're starting to move people in this
month. A lot of the move is going to take place next month, and so we're right in the midst of that. And
so you can imagine, we're still obviously paying rent in the old facility and also have started in the new
facility. There's a lot of work that goes around making sure that move is taking place. And there are other
areas around the footprint overall from a real estate perspective that's going to lead to a higher level of
rent in the first half of this year.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Now in the second half of the year, we should get some benefit from that, and so that's something that
we'll actually see come down. We'll eventually grow into that run rate, but we're expecting to actually see
that line come down in the second half of the year. Mike, anything you want to add to that?

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, just to the first part of your question there about the year, and again, it is a year but part of the trend
there and so what came out of that. One, much broader perspective pulling back from it is, if you look
at our expense base overall, the -- I'm going to call them technology expenses. So this is the expenses
for our technology group and the IT, depreciation and amortization represents about 20% of our cost
base, and that grew at 8%. If you look at the other 80% of our cost base, it grew at about 2%. And so I
would say, across that 80%, for the most part, we hit on the costs related to the business to bring on new
clients, and importantly, hitting on our Value for Spend initiatives and the objectives there. So it's not that
we didn't achieve those.

And then you say, well, on the technology side, what happened there? And there, if you think about
technology or as I think about technology, there's 3 primary things that we're trying to achieve there: one
is security; two is stability; and three is scalability within our technology. And if you look at the costs that
were related to that in the year, there were costs that we had on the safety and stability part, which ended
up being higher than we would have expected going into the year but are things that you absolutely do in
order to make sure that you are being able to provide the value proposition, if you will, for your clients.

And then likewise on the scalability, there are certain aspects of that, where the greater demand for, I'll
call it, just computing power, if you will, on the part of our large asset manager clients, on some of the
asset owner clients. We're just in an environment where there is greater activity, and we didn't achieve
the level of, I would say, scalability on our platform that we need to be able to achieve. So with each of
those 3, not only are we trying to ensure we have a strong, safe, stable, secure platform, but we want to
increase the scalability on that. So a lot of the focus of our technology strategy beyond kind of digitizing
the business and providing new capabilities for our clients is also saying, how do we also get greater
productivity out of that platform.

Michael Roger Carrier
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Tax rate was a little bit lower. You guys mentioned some
of the drivers. Jason, I'd -- just any like change in terms of the range that you guys typically expect when
we think about it going forward?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

I'll start. This quarter had some impact even from newer lease, some other small items, none of which, in
and of themselves, worth calling out. But I don't think you should expect us to be at this 22% level. And
we talked, I think Biff mentioned last time on the call, it's something in the 24s. I do think 24% is a better
longer-term assumption at this point.

On the C&IS business, can you give us an update on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape and

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, I'd be glad to talk about it. So there's a tremendous amount of activity in C&IS broadly and
specifically, I would say, asset servicing. And I would say a lot of these changes, well, certainly, they
create challenges. We're very optimistic about the growth opportunities that are out there. So if you just
give me a minute to run across it, I think I can address some of these trends that you're looking for.

So if we think about asset owners, even in the parts of the asset owner space that you might think
about as being more stable in just their operating models, they have greater needs, and greater needs
certainly lead to more opportunities for us. So if you think about the not-for-profit sector. Health care is an
area that continues to grow and presents opportunities for us to manage the assets of large health care
organizations. Universities, where you have endowments, and also the foundation space, they've increased
the mix on the investment side to greater use of alternatives. And then as a result, they have greater
needs for how they manage those portfolios and those managers, and that's why we've invested in and
are rolling out what we call front office solutions because that gives them the capability to do that.

If you look in Australia, for example, some of the large superannuation fund, not only had that been a
great growth opportunity for us over the last decade, but likewise, you're seeing consolidation within the
superannuation complex, which again presents changes in the marketplace and opportunities for us.

And the last thing I would say in the asset owner space is more of the very large, sophisticated clients.
So if you think about the sovereign wealth funds are actually in-sourcing some of the asset management
as opposed to allocating it all out to asset managers. What that requires is then they need to have the
capabilities to operate as asset managers. So they have data -- greater data needs, and the nature and
timing of what they need is greater, and so that provides opportunities for us. That drives a lot of the
investment that you hear about because it's now putting them in a different position.

And then if I shift to the asset management space, we talk a lot about the pressure of the secular trends,
and we feel that in our Asset Management business as well, but it does create opportunities for us on the
asset servicing side because it causes these asset managers to look at every aspect of their business,
including the operations side. And so that presents opportunities for us where they're looking to outsource
more activities.

Now historically, as you know, that's meant mostly middle office and what we do in IOO. We are seeing
more of those types of opportunities in the marketplace. But there are also some new activities that
previously were just largely done in-house by everybody that they're now saying why should they do
those and it shouldn't be a part of their outsourcing solutions. So if you think about the trading side,
where we have integrated trading solutions, that's really an outsourced trading service that we would
provide to them that enables them to essentially move something that's not core to them and that we can
do it better and more efficiently for them. And there are other opportunities like that.

I would also just continue with the asset managers to the alternative space, where for years, the hedge
fund space has presented growth opportunities for us. Our hedge fund services business continues to
grow nicely, win large mandates, as you saw this last year. But then also, for us, in the other parts of the
alternative space, so thinking private equity, infrastructure, real estate, those are areas where we've had
less of a market share or market position there, but it presents larger growth opportunities for us going
forward.

So overall, a high level of activity. And that's why when we talk about the growth, we're optimistic about
the growth, and we just want to make sure that we're able to bring that on in a scalable way so that we
get very profitable growth in the business.

A couple of questions. Mike, just following up on that last question. So you talked comprehensively about
a lot of the volume-related opportunities. How about pricing? What are you seeing as you continue to
expand into all of these new areas?

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Good point. And there's no doubt, clients want more for less, and that cuts across all parts of that
sector there. So we look at the fee pressure in the asset servicing business as just ongoing. So we don't
necessarily see, I would say, a repricing cycle per se that starts and then ends and then we don't do
anything. It's ongoing for us. And that's part of the organic growth equation. So we're always netting out
the -- not only if we lose the client or they drop a service, but also if there's repricing that happens in
order to maintain the client.

Now the other aspect of that, which is just a dynamic with that business is because large portions of it are
based on the asset levels, the pricing is based on the asset levels, and so as you see greater appreciation
in the market, then that does mean, yes, we get the benefit where the fees go up, but that's then when
you see greater fee pressure. So it's terrific for us that the markets are going up. It does then create more
focus on the parts of the client base to look at their fees. And that's why overall, what we're trying to do
is balance that but also broaden these relationships, do more for them so that they're still very profitable
relationships overall.

Vivek Juneja
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And as you're trying to build all of these areas, and as you said, you need the tech capabilities for that, is
there room to bend the growth rate of that tech spend a little bit or not quite yet?

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

We believe that there is. Mark talked earlier about when we think about our tech spend, you have the
expense side of it, which we focus a lot on here and we talk a lot, and Jason's mentioned the increased
amortization cost that comes through. Well, the other piece of that is that CapEx piece that Mark
mentioned, which is the capitalization of those costs happen now. They manifest themselves in expenses
later. And that's an area where not only we've been focused, but I think there's much more opportunity
when you think about how technology is developed these days to be able to do it in a more cost-efficient
way.

I think you're all familiar with Agile and other methodologies. Well, we're deploying those, but it's still in
the earlier stages. That, in my mind, will produce savings. It first hits through more efficient capital spend,
and then later over time, it results in lower amortization.

Vivek Juneja
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

One more, if I may, on the funding side. Your noninterest-bearing deposits did pretty well. They actually
turned around and grew again in the fourth quarter. And conversely, your short-term borrowings have
been shrinking over the course of 2019. So can you comment on both those? Have noninterest-bearing
deposits basically turned and should be growing? Or what's your outlook on that? And what do you plan to
do with short-term borrowings?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

You can start, Mark.

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Yes. On the demand deposits, we did see an increase sequentially, Vivek. I don't think that we're calling
this an inflection point. We've talked before over the last several quarters, we do have, especially, I would
say, on the Institutional side, fluctuations that occur quarter-to-quarter, with clients either positioning
their assets on- or our off-balance sheet, depending on what they might be doing with their own capital
investing. So I don't know that we would call out a specific new trend on demand deposits here, starting
with what we just saw in the fourth quarter. We'll have to see how that plays out over several quarters.

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Yes.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP, Director of Investor Relations

And on the short-term borrowing side, I would say there, that is a -- if you look back a year ago, 3, 4, 5
quarters ago, I would say that some of the discretionary leveraging that we are doing within the treasury
area was running at a higher level. And now at this point, over the last couple of quarters, we've kind
of had that down at a lower level. And that manifests itself both in wholesale deposits on the non-U.S.
office line but also in those short-term borrowings. So that's -- it's really just a function of the leveraging
opportunity to kind of gross up the balance sheet. The trade there isn't at the tripping point where we
would actually go through with that, so we've kind of reduced some of that discretionary leveraging that
we do.

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

And it's not to say we wouldn't do it again.

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP, Director of Investor Relations

Right.

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

The rate environment today just isn't providing that trade for us.

Our next question comes from Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler.

Jeffery J. Harte
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes.

Jeffery J. Harte
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So a lot of talk about expenses, but kind of with the growth you guys can deliver on the top line, I tend to
think a little more of kind of margins. In 2019, X items saw kind of our first pretax margin compression in
what's been a number of years. Looking to 2020 and given that you need to keep investing in the current
rate environment and with kind of organic fee growth is near the bottom end of the kind of range, should
we expect a return to margin expansion in 2020, even with those kind of things facing us?

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, I'll start. Before we get to pretax margin, we're looking at our expenses relative to our fees, and the
reason why we do that is just the nature of the expenses and how they're lined up against the different
revenue streams. And so there's no question, we're focused on positive key operating leverage. That's
because we're saying we want to bring down that ratio first. And on that front, again, it's affected by
markets and other things, but that's why we focus on the organic part because we want to be able to drive
that down.

Then if you go to the pretax margin, yes, some of that flows through. But as you know then, it gets much
more impacted by what's happening with the other revenues, to some extent, things like FX and the other
income line, but mostly net interest income. And we're trying to provide what we see in the marketplace
as far as deposits and deposits pricing and things like that and quarter-by-quarter, but that gives you
some indication of as we know, from not only last year, but every year, it's really hard to project interest
rates. And that's a big factor that drives in it, and it's also a tougher time to predict client deposit activity,
and that drives in it.

So that's just saying, it's not that we aren't focused on positive fee -- positive operating leverage as well.
It's just there are more factors that, frankly, are out of our control and even difficult to forecast to be able
to answer a question of like, "Well then, is your pretax margin going to go up or down?" We certainly are
aiming for it to go up, but there are things that are out of our control.

Jeffery J. Harte
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So when you think of kind of the interest rate environment holding stable and some of the markets
stuff like FX trading not really declining, these pretax margin kind of expansion should -- is potentially
attainable.

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, dependent on the environment, you're right. It can make it more difficult, or it can give us a tailwind.

Jeffery J. Harte
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And secondly, with the preferred issuance and redemption, can you just review what kind of we
should be thinking about the net impact on preferred dividends next year? I know there's some weird stuff
in the first quarter, but then even after that, what kind of run rate we should be looking at?

Mark M. Bette
Senior VP, Director of Investor Relations

Jeff, it's Mark. Yes. So when you look at -- if you look back at what our prepared remarks were, the new
Series E will have essentially, call it, a 5-month dividend in the first quarter, which would be $7.6 million.
There's also some costs from Series C that we would also need to recognize upon redeeming it in the
first quarter, so that's $11.5 million. And then we have the Series D, which you see in the first and third
quarter of each year.

So if you take all that into consideration, at this point, our expectation is you're probably looking at a
preferred dividend right around $30 million, $30.5 million in the first quarter. And then in the second
quarter, you come down to the normal new dividend for Series E, which is $4.7 million, and that would
be the new run rate in the quarter where we don't have the Series D. Hopefully, that helps. We could talk
through it off-line, if you'd like.

Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Just a quick question on all these expenses. I mean you have a normal expense investment that
you're doing. Was the 3 items that you laid out, the pension expense, the base pay adjust and the IT
depreciation, included in that growth rate already? Are you saying that you're investing and then you have
to still consider these 3 additional items that are going to be on top of it?

Jason Jerrome Tyler
CFO & Executive VP

Portion of it. So the base pay adjustments are -- that's always factored into how we think about our
expectations for expense growth. The pension is obviously anomalous, and that's one that's not forecast.
And Mike mentioned earlier, we're not ignoring it. We still want to do everything we can to get leverage in
that.

And then the depreciation increase, we've known that we're going to be leaning into more IT spend
in the short run, at least. And so I'd say the base pay adjustment's fully factored into our long-term
assumptions. The pension, not, but we're still working hard to try to even cover that. And then the third
element of IT depreciation, and part of that's already in the run rate. And so that's the key element
there. But the increase itself is one -- we have to own it. And we've got it -- there's a high sense of
urgency about making sure we get leverage across each of the key expense items, including equipment
and software. At some point, that's going to be difficult to do in the near term, given what we're trying
to do strategically. But certainly, the BPA and a portion of the depreciation reflected in our long-term
expectations.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then separately, in the Asset Management, I hear again that the organic growth, not kind
of where you want it to be. I mean at what point do you need to do something bigger with regards to
restructuring the unit or taking more strategic actions there?

Michael G. O’Grady
Chairman, President & CEO

I think within the asset management sector, that our Asset Management business is performing very well.
We talked about the environmental line just because it is going through secular change. But if you just
looked at the competitive positioning, if you looked at the growth relative to others and then you look
at the profitability, it's performing well. And I would say strategically, we feel very good about how the
business is repositioning itself. And what I mean by that is, we've been strong and had scale in certain
areas like liquidity, like index for a long time. And what we've been doing though over the last few years is
repositioning towards some of the higher growth but also more value-added areas, which I talked about.
So quant, ESG, things like that.

And so those areas, although they represent a smaller portion of the pie, if you will, they are growing,
they are resonating. But like any longer-term strategy, it takes time before you see the impact of that
from a financial perspective. But as far as thinking bigger, if you will, I would say we are. And I just talked
about, I'll call it, the product side of that. We're also looking -- not looking at, but have been executing on
our strategy on the distribution side as well. And it's going well, I would say, on the institutional side. You
saw that not only in the fourth quarter but the second half of the year where that's gone well. But then
you also saw last year that we acquired a business, but it's very small but -- Emotomy, which is essentially
a technology platform, which we are utilizing in the intermediary space. And we think again, that's the

type of capability that will enable us to accelerate the growth rate that we already have within there. So
yes, secular change, but we feel very good about our strategic positioning there.
