Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q3 2020 Baxter International
Earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your
speaker today, Clare Trachtman. You may begin.

Clare Trachtman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining
me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Saccaro, Baxter's
Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter's third quarter 2020
financial results and full year 2020 financial outlook. A supplemental presentation to complement this
morning's discussion can be accessed on our website in the Investors section under Events & News. This
presentation includes related non-GAAP reconciliations.

With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including
comments regarding our financial outlook for full year 2020, new product development, business
development and regulatory matters contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and
uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations.
Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings more details concerning factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used
to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP
financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our
earnings release issued this morning and available on our website.

On the call this morning, we will be discussing operational sales growth, which adjusts for the impact of
foreign exchange and the acquisition of Seprafilm, which closed on February 14 of this year.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Claire, and thank you to everyone joining us on the call. I hope that you and your families
remain healthy and safe. I will begin with a brief review of Baxter's third quarter performance. Jay will
provide more detail on the financials. Then we will wrap up with your questions.

I want to start again by acknowledging all of the healthcare providers, first responders, researchers
and personal caregivers who are rising to enormous challenges every day in the ongoing fight against
COVID-19. And as always, I want to express my deepest appreciation to Baxter's employees, who are
navigating these unprecedented times in the unwavering spirit of our mission to save and sustain lives.
Just as COVID-19 continues to impact all of our daily lives, it naturally also influences the trajectory of
Baxter's operations and performance. During the third quarter, all 3 of our geographic regions observed
sequential improvement in both hospital admissions and surgical procedures, but volumes remained below
pre-COVID levels. For the third quarter, we estimate the hospital admissions and surgical procedures in
the U.S. declined low-double digits and mid-single digits, respectively. Jay will discuss our 2020 outlook in
more detail, but this guidance assumes volumes remain at these levels throughout the fourth quarter.

Turning to our results. Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 4% at constant currency rates and
3% operationally. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $0.83, up 12% year-over-year. All
3 of our global regions contributed to positive performance for the quarter. Growth was led by Asia Pacific,
which was up 7% at constant currency rates, reflecting the geography's global leading virus containment
and recovery to date as well as our portfolio mix in the region. 5 of Baxter's 6 global business units also
delivered positive constant currency sales growth in Q3. Among them, Acute Therapies grew 35% year-

over-year, adjusting for FX. This business continues to experience heightened demand for its continuous
renal replacement therapy or CRRT products in the midst of the pandemic.

In Q3, Baxter was granted U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorizations for our Regiocit replacement solution,
select set to help address increased demand for CRRT supply and treatment options. This quarter, we
also announced a distribution agreement with bioMérieux for the NEPHROCLEAR CCL14 diagnostic test
currently in development for use assessing the risk of developing persistent severe acute kidney injury.

Renal Care delivered mid-single digit growth at constant currency rates for the quarter, driven by
continued demand for our portfolio of peritoneal dialysis products. Pandemic conditions continue to
underscore the advantages of home-based PD treatment as well as Baxter's share source remote
monitoring technology for both clinicians and patients.

Late in Q3, CMS announced the finalization of the end-stage renal disease treatment choices payment
model, a core component of the Advancing American Kidney Health initiative. This is a key step forward in
increasing U.S. adoption of home-based dialysis care, and Baxter stands prepared to support patients and
healthcare providers as the new model take effect in 2021.

Also during the quarter, Baxter received FDA de novo authorization for our THERANOVA dialyzer for
expanded hemodialysis or HDx therapy. We have a TPNIES add-on payment application pending with CMS
for this novel Renal Care technology and expect an update when the final rule is published in November.
While at this time we're not going to speculate on CMS final determination, we continue to believe in the
benefits this product offers ESRD patients.

Continuing among our attributes, Clinical Nutrition achieved constant currency mid-single digit growth.
Performance here reflects sustained demand, new product introduction and the impact of the competitive
supply issue in the U.S. Last month, we announced FDA approval of new higher-protein formulations of
CLINIMIX and Clinimix E for parenteral nutrition. These offerings further expand the diversity of our U.S.
nutrition portfolio, offering physicians new options and flexibility to meet their patients' needs.

Advanced Surgery grew 9% at a constant currency rate, bolstered by our February acquisition of
Seprafilm. Adjusting for the acquisition as well as FX, Advanced Surgery declined mid-single digits
operationally, in line with the lower rate of surgical procedures as compared to the prior year period. On
a constant currency basis, Pharmaceuticals increased low single digits and Medication Delivery declined
low-single digit. Performance in both businesses reflect lower rates of emergency room utilization and
associated hospital admissions for a range of acute and chronic conditions.

In medication delivery, we remain optimistic about our NOVUM IQ smart infusion pump technology. We
are making progress addressing the open questions from FDA on the NOVUM IQ 510(k) applications and
remain on track to update the submissions within the next 3 months. We are working collaboratively with
the agency and currently expect to launch the pumps in the U.S. next year. In Canada, the NOVUM IQ
large volume pump was recently approved, and we hope to receive approval for the syringe pump in the
fourth quarter. And finally, we anticipate obtaining CE Mark for the entire NOVUM IQ platform by the end
of this year.

By now, it goes without saying that we are operating in a largely unpredictable environment. We are
experiencing an unfortunate resurgence of COVID-19 in many geographies, which resonates across
the broader treatment landscape. Baxter continues to respond with a sustained focus on efficiency and
effectiveness, which has become second nature across the enterprise. Our strategic emphasis on medically
essential products and our broad geographic footprint reinforce the underlying stability of our business
model. We remain focused on advancing innovation as a critical growth driver and are actively evaluating
opportunities to augment this performance through strategic capital deployment, including business
development and opportunistic share repurchases.

Despite today's challenges and unknowns, I remain confident in Baxter's trajectory and potential.
We are reigniting a legacy of innovation, building upon our leadership in corporate responsibility and
implementing new racial justice efforts that are rooted in our long-term emphasis on inclusion and

diversity. By executing across all dimensions, we will deliver enhanced value and make a meaningful
impact for all stakeholders we serve over the long term.

Now I will pass it to Jay for his comments on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year.

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Although COVID-19 continues to present unique challenges,
not only to our business, but the overall healthcare landscape, our third quarter results demonstrate a
level of resilience during these unprecedented times. As we move forward, we must continue to evolve
our business strategies and identify new opportunities to deliver enhanced value for all of our stakeholders
over the long term.

Turning to our third quarter 2020 results, global sales of $3 billion advanced 4% on both a reported
and constant currency basis and 3% on an operational basis. Growth among Baxter's GBUs was led by
Acute Therapies, reflecting the ongoing demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Joe mentioned, sales
in both Medication Delivery and Pharmaceuticals continue to be affected by lower rates of emergency
room utilization and hospitalizations in the wake of the pandemic, particularly in the United States. We
estimate COVID-19 negatively impacted net revenues by over $65 million in the quarter. On the bottom
line, adjusted earnings increased 12% to $0.83 per share, reflecting our top line performance, reduced
discretionary spending and the benefit of a lower tax rate.

Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and global business units. Note that this
quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, with
the exception of our Advanced Surgery business, for which we will provide both constant currency and
operational growth, adjusting for the acquisition of Seprafilm.

Starting with our 3 regional segments, sales in the Americas advanced 2% on a constant currency basis
and 1% on an operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa advanced 3% on both a constant
currency and operational basis. Sales in our APAC region advanced 7% on a constant currency basis and
5% operationally.

Moving on to performance by Global business units, global sales for Renal Care were $955 million,
advancing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in
both our PD and HD businesses. PD benefited from 6% patient growth in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions.
Sales in medication delivery of $680 million declined 3% on a constant currency basis. In the quarter, we
continued to see strong execution of our infusion pumps led by EVO IQ placements internationally.

As Joe mentioned, although we saw a sequential improvement from the second quarter, hospital
admissions and surgical procedures remained below pre-COVID levels. We estimate these lower
volumes negatively impacted medication delivery sales by approximately $40 million within the quarter.
Pharmaceutical sales were $540 million, up 1% on a constant currency basis. Increasing demand for
our international pharmacy compounding business as well as a onetime U.S. government purchase of
approximately $20 million contributed to the growth in the quarter. This was partially offset by the impact
of reduced hospital utilization, lowering international demand for our inhaled anesthesia products and
enhanced competition for Transderm Scop in the U.S. We estimate a net negative impact of approximately
$40 million related to COVID-19 in the quarter.

Moving to Nutrition, total sales were $237 million, increasing 5% on a constant currency basis. Strong
performance in the quarter was driven by the benefit of recent new product launches, increased demand
for our automated nutrition compounding business and competitor shortages in amino acids. We estimate
that growth in the quarter was partially offset by approximately $5 million related to COVID-19. Sales in
Advanced Surgery were $236 million, advancing 9% on a constant currency basis, plus declining 5% on an
operational basis.

The acquisition of Seprafilm in February contributed approximately $30 million of sales in the quarter.
Declines in surgical procedures drove an estimated negative impact of approximately $14 million for the
Advanced Surgery portfolio. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $177 million, representing growth

6

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

of 35% on a constant currency basis. We estimate that heightened demand for COVID-related products
contributed over $30 million to growth in the quarter. Finally, sales in our other category, which primarily
includes our contracting manufacturing services, were $147 million in the quarter, advancing 4% on a
constant currency basis.

Moving through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 42.6% declined by 310 basis points
over the prior year, driven by lower sales of higher-margin products as well as approximately $60 million
in increased operations and supply chain expenses related to our COVID-19 response. Adjusted SG&A
of $574 million declined 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued financial discipline, reduced
discretionary spending resulting from COVID restrictions and lower bonus accruals under our annual
employee incentive compensation plans. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $122 million declined
9% on a reported basis with reductions in non-project spend being supplemented by our continued focus
on operational excellence.

We continue to prioritize strategic investments to fuel our innovation pipeline. Adjusted operating margin
in the quarter was 19.2%, a decrease of 30 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was
$39 million in the quarter, an increase of $26 million compared to the prior year, driven by increased
interest expense from higher outstanding debt balances as well as decreased interest income due to lower
interest rates. Other nonoperating expense totaled $16 million in the quarter compared to $9 million in the
prior year period. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 15.7%.

With respect to cash flow, year-to-date we generated free cash flow of $686 million, compared to $776
million in the prior year period. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $4.4 billion
of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, along with $6.5 billion of long-term indebtedness.
Subject to market conditions, we regularly evaluate opportunities with respect to our capital structure. We
expect to recommence our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter of 2020, generally consistent
with our capital allocation philosophy. Baxter's Board recently also authorized an incremental $1.5 billion
to our existing share repurchase program, bringing the total share repurchase authorization to $2.4 billion
of common stock, generally consistent with prior authorization increases.

Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year. For full year 2020,
we now expect low-single-digit sales growth on a reported constant currency and operational basis. As
we see resurgences of COVID-19 cases across many geographies, we anticipate a sustained impact on
our business, particularly in Medication Delivery and Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. Nevertheless, we remain
ready and committed to addressing patient and physician needs globally with our portfolio of life saving
and sustaining products. In line with our previous commentary, we expect to absorb approximately $150
million of incremental operations and supply chain expenses related to our COVID-19 response efforts
in 2020. These costs include measures we are taking to protect employee safety, bonuses paid to our
frontline manufacturing and field service employees and increased freight-related costs as we prioritize
delivery of critical products.

We expect year-over-year reductions in operating expenses driven by continued financial discipline as
well as lower travel and meeting expenses. In line with the previous commentary, we expect net interest
expense to increase by over $60 million as compared to the prior year. And for the full year, we also
expect adjusted other nonoperating expense to be negatively impacted by approximately $50 million year-
over-year due to the loss of pension-related income from the Q4 2019 transfer of $2.4 billion in pension
assets and related liabilities. Given these factors and underlying assumptions, we now expect adjusted
diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, between $3.02 and $3.05 for the full year 2020.

In closing, the third quarter continued to demonstrate the durability of our medically necessary portfolio
and the importance of our multiyear transformation journey. The commitment of our employees and
the speed at which the organization has responded to the pandemic has fueled our year-to-date top line
performance. 2020 has certainly brought many challenges. And through it all, we believe we remain well
positioned for continued financial stability and long-term success.
With that, we can now open the call to Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on a good quarter.

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Robbie.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Not sure if this is for Jay or Joe, but I was hoping maybe we could start with the guidance outlook here.
You're not the first company to point to worsening trends. We see the COVID rates ticking up. And I was
hoping you could walk us through -- was this fourth quarter your projection didn't improve as much as
you originally thought? Or are you seeing worsening trends coming into fourth quarter here? And if you
could just walk us through -- down the P&L, how the lowered top line outlook affects -- down the EPS, the
different changes versus expectations?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Robbie, overall, Q4 is a little bit below the previous expectations that we shared on the last call,
both with respect to sales and then also with respect to earnings, while we didn't sort of have specific
guidance on Q4, we did have some internal assumptions. And really, I would say, the largest driver relates
to admissions in the U.S. Our prior expectation, you'll recall, I said in the fourth quarter we expected
admissions to be down approximately 3%. We are now modeling roughly an 11% decline in admissions in
the fourth quarter. And if you think about it, each point of admissions is worth a couple of million dollars
per month. So in totality, this impact is roughly $50 million to the sales line.

The second factor, again, we believe this to be a temporary item, is we did have some sales in the fourth
quarter related to our NOVUM IQ platform. And while Joe commented around this and our expectations
about this being a long-term driver for us, we did remove those sales from the fourth quarter roughly
$25 million, $30 million, representing a couple of cents. So admissions, as I said, roughly $50 million,
approximately $0.06, then you also have this pump factor of roughly $30 million, a couple of cents as
well. So those are the primary drivers. From our perspective, the good news is these should correct over
time. The pace of that correction is the real question at hand.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And just a follow-up question. It's great to see the share repurchase program coming back online in
the fourth quarter. You have authorization up to $2.4 billion, over $4 billion in cash right now. How should
we think about the impact in fourth quarter? What's in guidance for share repurchase? And with the share
price at $78, is this something we could see a pretty aggressive move here over the next several months?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Certainly, we were pleased to announce the increase to the stock buyback authorization and that the
Board approved that recently. And from our perspective, one of the things that we put on hold over the
last 6 months was the share buyback program. We did that in large part because of uncertainty around

8

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

the pandemic and its impact on our business. I think now having reported a couple of quarters of solid
results in the face of a pandemic, we now have confidence to start to get back to share buyback as a
vehicle for returning value to shareholders. It's something that we've done over the last 5 years.

As we think about amounts, the way we assess it is we look at what we believe the shares are worth,
evaluating that against an intrinsic value model we keep here. And depending on how shares trade relative
to that intrinsic value model, that's when we end up making purchases. We talk about it after the end of
each quarter. So we didn't repurchase anything last quarter. And so for the fourth quarter, we'll talk about
this on our -- when we report fourth quarter earnings in February. So stay tuned for that. And that's the
standard program that we have in place. Again, it was a severe departure from our normal protocol, but
we had that in light of the pandemic. We wanted to make clear what we were trying to optimize during
this timeframe.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just a follow-up on Robbie's question on your fourth quarter assumptions. Specifically, the publicly traded
hospitals have been seeing improvement throughout the third quarter on admission trends. So the fourth
quarter run rate should be higher than what they saw during the third quarter. Are you seeing or hearing
about things getting worse? Or are you just making assumption? And also, as you talk about admissions
impacting volumes, the patient-days [ through AC in ] tenant were actually positive. So how should we
think about the interplay between lower admissions versus longer length of stays and the impact on
Medication Delivery?

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

Let's divide. This is not -- you can't just make one assumption. We are a hospital company, but within
the hospital, there are several different drivers of our business. So if you look at -- procedures in general
are largely stabilizing, right? So they're coming up. They're a little bit below last year's, but it's coming
perhaps in the fourth quarter more to a same level. Now we have a flare-up in the pandemic right now, so
we're watching that very closely.

Hospital admissions has more to do with Medicare patients being admitted in hospitals and how hospitals
are taking patients through the ED, the emergency department. So we don't see a significant deterioration
between Q3 and Q4. We have indicators that are very reliable because we are in those accounts, we are
in these businesses. So we don't see that as a huge deterioration in the fourth quarter, but we've got to
watch what is coming with this new wave of infections and how that's going to be dealt at the hospital
level. But the main drivers for a hospital today, the way we see it is, is the OR which is largely stabilizing.
And then the admissions of patients through the general floor of the hospital, and that is what you see the
biggest deficit in those patients, they're usually Medicare patients. So we're going to watch it closely, and
then we'll inform how we are not only thinking about the fourth quarter, as we're living through the fourth
quarter, but 2021.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then on the margin guidance again for fourth quarter, it looks like pretty substantial margin
guidance that you're giving us on fourth quarter versus third -- what you saw in the third quarter. Can you
walk us through what are any new costs being added in sequentially? Is it all just margin pressure coming
from product mix? Or just help us understand why the margin difference is so big in fourth quarter versus
third quarter?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Sure. There is some margin deterioration in the fourth quarter. And really, that relates to a few things.
First of all, we are expecting to see flat or slight decline in the U.S. business sequentially from Q3 to Q4.
And again, it's going to be a temporary impact in nature, but it certainly is a decline. So the result of
that, when your ex U.S. business is growing faster than the U.S., you tend to have a fairly substantial
mix impact on gross margin. And then the second factor is because of some lower volumes we're now
anticipating, we are expecting some incremental manufacturing absorption impacts, again that flow
through to the bottom line. So really, those are the primary drivers of the Q3 to Q4 margin story.

Operator

Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just first off, just wondering, Joe, if you wouldn't mind giving us your sense for the progress that you're
making on the filings for NOVUM IQ and the syringe pump? Just maybe express how confident you are in
your timelines and any update on the progress would be great.

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

We are working very diligently with the FDA. We have meetings with the FDA scheduled and we are
still very confident in our platform. I can't speak on behalf of the FDA and how long it's going to take
in the questions. But I think we have a very good idea what are the issues that the FDA had with our
previous submission and we're addressing them very, very quickly. And we hope we can address them to
the satisfaction of the FDA. As you know, this is an important platform for us because this is a platform
not only with 2 pumps coming up, but also a PCA pump coming later on as well as an ambulatory pump
coming in 2022.

So we are very excited about that but also, as a company, very focused not only on Medication Delivery,
we have a company-wide effort to make sure that we got the most experts in place, helping the
group answer all the questions satisfactory to the FDA. We, as a company, don't think that those are
unsurmountable questions and issues and we're working very hard. And probably in the next 2 or 3
months, we'll refile and go through the process. We hope to launch this product next year. I think it's
going to be a great product for -- not only for Baxter but also for the market.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. So it sounds like you still plan on filing this year, no change there. And then my second question is
just maybe for Joe or for Jay. For 2021, the Street models 19% earnings growth over 2020, aided in large
part by much lower COVID-relating spend. I assume you're not going to give guidance on this call, but any
directional comments on where the Street is for next year or on just kind of year-over-year spend levels?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Bob, it's really hard to comment on that at this point in time. We're still in the middle of our annual
operating plan process, understanding market trends in the fourth quarter with respect to the pandemic
is going to be a critical input to our 2021 guidance. The plan is to provide the guidance on the earnings
call on February 4. The one thing I will tell you is we do anticipate some level of sustained impact from the
pandemic on our business, potentially through the first half of '21. This is -- it's really hard to assess at
this point. It's really hard to assess what's going to happen to admissions. But we're watching that very
carefully as it's a critical driver of our growth.

So we're going to take all of the time, and we're actually spending a lot of energy and effort really trying
to model out expectations around patient admissions and procedures because that's such an important
driver for us. As you know, we've had about $150 million in COVID-related costs but we've had a far
bigger impact on the sales line. Over time, the COVID-related costs will dissipate. So as the pandemic

10

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

ends, we expect to claw back the vast majority of those spend items. But we're watching carefully
the sales line. And these -- the 2 key drivers are the ones that I mentioned, admissions and surgical
procedures. And it's early to say, but we do expect some impact in the first half of the year.

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

Bob, we're working very hard in modeling this. We have modelers. We have people working relentlessly in
creating a sustainable way of looking through this pandemic and how it affects not only the U.S. but also
affects Latin America and affects Europe at the moment. We see much less effect of the pandemic in Asia,
as everybody knows. Now we had a pretty healthy growth in the third quarter in our APAC business, but
we are working 24/7 in getting this model complete. And we hope to have something for you guys when
we give guidance that we feel confident in standing behind it in January.

Operator

David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe I'll just stay high level because I don't think we're going to get much on '21 specifically. But Joe,
people entered this year enthusiastic about the pump launch, THERANOVA and other various drivers.
And as you know, we didn't get the benefit of the Analyst Day. I think the key question we're getting
from investors is what is the growth thesis for Baxter on a go-forward basis? Maybe just -- I mean take a
couple of minutes and sort of as you see the intermediate term growth outlook for Baxter, what investors
should be enthusiastic about? As it relates to the growth portfolio what are the things that are getting you
excited? And what should they be focused on?

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

We are still very excited about NOVUM IQ. This is the first time Baxter has a global platform as we said
in the prepared remarks, this is not a U.S. product only. We're expecting the syringe pump approval in
the fourth quarter. In Canada, we expect at the end of the year that we're going to have the platform
approved in Europe for CE Marked. By the way, we start already hiring people for the sales force to launch
this product in Europe. Remember, we were not present in Europe for I don't know how many years,
probably 20, 30 years that we have not sold the product. We just started about 2 years ago selling our
Evo IQ pump that replaced the old COLLEAGUE pumps there. So this is something new.

The European folks are super excited. So I'm very excited about the pump because I think it is a
transformation for Baxter and is going to be a transformation in the U.S. market as well. I'm also excited
about the PD business in the U.S., AAKHI opened the door for this business to grow. We were growing
at 5% to 6%. We started to see the growth hitting now 7%, 8%, 9%, 10% as last quarter. So we think
high-single-digits to about 10%. It is a great place for this business to be. We made investments already
for the short-term capacity need. We're going to be looking at more investment if we need to. We're
also looking at new technology eventually to come into the cycler business that will change our ability to
service even better our customers.

China PD is a great business that is also growing 8% to 10% a year. We're #1 there. It's a good business
for us and it's a very profitable business for us. So this is a driver that excites me. And actually, I have a
call this week looking at more capacity for the renal business in Asia.

Also, we have some molecules like Myxredline that we were not able to roll out well in 2020 because of the
pandemic, as you know. This is a new way that the product is configured -- insulin, premixed insulin. And
we need to service the accounts and be able to promote that. And we were not able to get into hospitals
for the longest and I would tell you that this is going to be almost like a relaunch in 2021. And we're
excited about that.

Also, going back to normal, I think the ability to be participant in the vaccine business as a fill-finish
company that we are between our plant in Bloomington, Indiana and Halle in Germany will be able to be a
participant in this business. So we look at all of this as drivers for 2021.

But beyond 2021, we also have some notable launches that I'm excited about, ambulatory pump in
2021, a few advanced surgery businesses, new products -- rather new products coming out, some
pharmaceuticals as well. So our innovation has not stopped. We took a little break in our labs in the
beginning of the pandemic, but we're back in on our labs operations pretty intensively and we're getting
things out there. The employees of Baxter have been relentless in the innovation. We're going to
transform this company's innovation pathway.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Super helpful, Joe. And just maybe, Jay, a quick one for you. Just -- I'm not going to get you to
comment on THERANOVA, what CMS will do here next week. But just in terms of kind of risk mitigating
the AAKHI, if it were to happen, just given where you see the plant manufacturing today, what type of
revenue ranges could we be expecting for 2021, if you had the approval and you began to scale up sort of
from here?

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

David, I would say that first of all, if -- we're contemplating both scenarios. The approval and being
included or not included, okay? We have a good momentum going on outside the U.S. with THERANOVA.
It's -- as a matter of fact it's a little bit of a downer for our colleagues outside the U.S. because the way
if this gets approved in the U.S., U.S. is going to take most of the volume of the world. And they were
gaining pretty good momentum until we upped the capacity to supply them. So our plan B is if it doesn't
gets reimbursed here, it doesn't mean that we're not going to sell it here. We're going to continue to sell.
We actually had the first sale of THERANOVA about 3 weeks ago in the U.S. We will then press forward
with outside the U.S., and that sales growth is in the double digits with really good margins.

I will refrain now to give you a number for 2021. We'll be more precise about this number. If this product
gets included in the TPNIES coming up early November, we then become more clear about what that
impact is in the U.S. But I want our investors to know that despite the fact it may or may not get TPNIES
approval in the U.S., we'll continue to sell it in the U.S., and we will expand and accelerate the sale of the
products overseas.

So in the -- at the end of the day, the product is still a great product for our patients. We believe in the
product and the clinical evidence is there as we were able to show to the government.

Vijay Kumar from Evercore.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I had one quick on the quarter and a big picture question. Maybe, Jay, for you on the Q itself. When you
talk about the higher manufacturing variance, is that signaling gross margin flattish to down sequentially
in Q4? And when you look at the incremental expenses you guys incurred, $150 million incremental, with
below the line another $50 million. How much of that is going away or moderating next year?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we do expect a sequential step down in gross margin from Q3 to Q4. From a Q4 standpoint,
thinking for a second year-over-year, there's roughly 100 basis points of COVID cost impact. The fact
that we've lost sales is about -- and some of those sales are higher-margin in the U.S. It's 130 basis
point impact. There's some FX impact in the fourth quarter, maybe 70 basis points. We are seeing some

12

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

incremental manufacturing costs as well. So there's a combination of items that do take the gross margin
down from Q3 to Q4, even absent the COVID impact. But like I said, many of these items are short-term
items, which we do expect to recover.

Now as it relates to when, that really is the critical question for us. And so at this point in time, we do
expect some continued impact certainly through the first half of next year, both in terms of sales and
in terms of incremental manufacturing costs. My hope is that in the second half of the year, we see a
more normal environment, but I can't say that with certainty at this stage. As I said before, we expect
admissions to recover over time and we also expect the vast majority of those COVID costs to go away
over time. But it's hard to say is that Q1, Q2, Q4 next year, that's the question that we're working through
right now. And it's difficult to model, but we're spending a lot of time really trying to model it. Joe?

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

I'll add as well that we have a new Head of Manufacturing, Jim Borzi, he comes in with tremendous
experience and already making a difference. We're looking to significantly alter some of the ways we
do things in the engineering groups and parts of the company. So we will be looking for efficiency and
productivity in operations throughout the fourth quarter and next year. So this will contribute when we
think about back to a normal gross margin, it has to do with mix, it has to do with COVID, it has to do
with efficiencies because if you're producing less in some of our factories, the cost is actually much higher
because the lack of efficiency of running plants 24/7.

As we adjusted already our capacity down without affecting at all the customer at the end because we're
holding inventory for any kind of spike in demand due to the COVID situation. We are relentless looking
for productivity improvements. And we have put a tremendous faith that Jim and the team in global
supply chain will continue to look for those efficiencies throughout 2021 to offset some of the losses until
the situation comes back to normal, and then we'll continue to progress in our quest for improving gross
margin.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful. And Jay -- Joe, sorry. One -- a big picture for you. This buyback versus M&A debate, I'm
curious on have your thoughts changed? And the reason I ask is, look, your balance sheet is stellar, but
I think investor perception has changed on M&A. Investors are willing to look at a longer time horizon for
ROIC to be above WACC. So I'm just curious on how you think about M&A in a 0 interest rate environment
when investors are willing to look at longer time horizon for returns.

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Vijay, good question. For us, we expect to do a mix of both buyback and M&A going forward, as
we've seen in the past. And so from a capital deployment standpoint, we think Baxter can be a great
acquirer of a lot of different assets, especially ones that have some strategic relevancy to what the
company does. It's harder to stretch out into completely new areas. But what we're finding is we are
able to generate adequate ROIs in those areas that have some strategic relevancy to the company where
the company becomes a logical buyer. So you never say -- you never know what's going to happen with
business development, but we are very active. The pipeline is rich. And while we have -- while ROI is an
important strategic and financial criteria for us, we are seeing a rich pipeline today. Joe, do you want to
add anything to that?

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

I think you answered it very well. I'll simply supplement the answer with the 4 pillars of transforming
Baxter, the last one is transformation of the portfolio to outdo our weighted average market growth rate.
Now with a solid balance sheet, with our cost structure and SG&A in place, with the innovation pathway
set internally for organic investment, and talent and culture being one that we've tackled first, now our

focus is undivided on how do we alter our portfolio in a way that we'll continue to provide value to our
patients and customers but also create a good return for our investors. And we always look at the ROIC
and the IRR and NPV on these deals. We were very stringent some time ago, not that we changed how we
look at them, but we were in a position in the very beginning when I started here 5 years ago with a very
low free cash flow and very low cash reserves.

Now we feel that we have a solid balance sheet, and that actually help us understand the landscape better,
open the opportunities. So it doesn't mean we're doing something. I'm not indicating that. I'm just saying
that we are relentless looking for those opportunities.

Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

One on the Q4 guide, one on -- Joe, on your vaccine comments a minute ago. So Jay, on the Q4 guide,
I've gotten a couple of inbound e-mails. Are we thinking about the implied Q4 operational growth,
negative 2% to plus 6%? Is that the right way to think about it? And what kind of gets you to the high end
versus the low end?

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

There is a fairly wide range, but we are expecting some level of decline, low-single-digits in the fourth
quarter. And really what that comes down to is the admissions gap versus prior year but then also a
very challenging comp as we look at last year's sales growth. You'll recall, I believe the fourth quarter
operationally was in the range of 9% growth. And so tough comp, we always knew that was going to be
a challenge for us, but then we have the added fact that we are now assuming admissions down double
digits year-over-year, roughly 11%. So that's kind of the high end of the guide range, reflects some low-
single-digit sales decline.

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

And Larry, also we were planning to launch NOVUM IQ in the fourth quarter, and that carries a higher-
margin as well, as we all carry the sales. So the combination of 2 are the ones that created a little bit of
headwind in the fourth quarter that we'll see easing off throughout next year.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And Joe, I've heard you talk about the vaccine opportunity a couple of times recently. Are
you talking about COVID vaccines? Or is that the flu vaccines? And my understanding is you've generally
operated at capacity there with the flu vaccines in Baxter pharma solutions. Are you thinking -- do you see
this COVID vaccine opportunity? And do you have to add capacity? Any color there would be appreciated.

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

So we have the ability to do that. As a matter of fact, we have 2 different plants, 1 in Germany with a little
bit more capacity, and Bloomington. And we have the ability to help the country and the manufacturers of
the vaccine developers in this process. We are part of this network of companies that finish vaccines. We
have that ability and we cannot comment on who and what and why? But we are part of this effort, and
we hope to be part of this effort continuously throughout this pandemic. I'm talking about coronavirus,
COVID-19, I'm not speaking about flu.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

I had a specific question on the renal business and PD. I think you guys saw a 6% PD patient growth
number. That's very strong. And I'm just curious how to think about where that patient growth number
can go as the AAKHI rolls out? And how we should be thinking about the trajectory of that business as the
AAKHI moves into implementation?

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

Throughout this pandemic earlier on -- early on in the pandemic, I think the insertion, catheter insertion
for PD was deemed emergency surgery. So our fear was if you -- in the very beginning, if people don't
have an opportunity to have the catheter, they will straight -- go straight into hemodialysis and that's it.
We see 6% even throughout this pandemic as a very good number. If you think about the AAKHI and you
just do the math, the growth would go between 8% and 10%. That's where we should be looking at for
the future. So it represents a really good opportunity for the patients to take advantage of this therapy.
And also for Baxter, which has been for 3 or 4 decades behind this therapy that finally is being more
understood and infused in the U.S.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just one follow-up on -- from a technology perspective, and where we are with the sort of
point-of-care dialysis PD system? And how that could change the adoption trajectory here?

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

Listen, the point-of-care was a project that we've actually proven that works. We have the technology
to make it work. We are focusing right now in developing new technology for cyclers as well as we have
some investments, minority investments in companies in the wearable space. So Baxter is playing in all
these spaces, not only point of care, but also in technologies that will make more affordable the cycle. The
issue that I think we have with the cycler is not one that affects much the U.S. as much as it affects the
penetration of APD across the globe, it's a very expensive cycler, which you don't see adoption in most
countries they are in development today. So to give access to health care and access to that technology,
our teams are developing very interesting technologies that eventually will be global in nature and used.

Also, I think wearable technology offers a promising future and we have minority investment in that kind
of technology. We also are very focused on point-of-care in terms of technology that can be used with
some of those that are being developed in conjunction, not as itself being launched but being added to
other technologies that we're currently developing. We have a pretty healthy spend in our Renal Care
business, and we don't plan to ease off on that and continue to develop those products.

So I just had one follow-up. Just to clarify something that we talked about a little earlier in the call, and
this is the difference. I think, Joe, you answered the question around difference in types of admissions.
Jay, in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned a couple of times the importance of ER visits or the
fall-off of ER visits. Could you just -- is that sort of the difference, fewer people coming in through the
emergency service and other types of admissions that we see in the press kind of not really being what
drives your businesses? Just wanted clarification on that and then I have one follow-up.

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Well, the admissions in hospitals come from few places, one of them is the ED and the other one is
procedures, it's OR. People who have schedule or -- scheduled procedures, either scheduled procedures
through normal routes or a knee replacement or a gastric bypass or a colon procedure, oncology. That
part, the procedure levels are coming back to normal levels. And I think will normalize, as you can see
now, even with the pandemic research in so many places, hospitals are more reluctant now to stop
the procedures altogether. There's a few doing that, more of them are saying that they will be able to
accommodate COVID patients as well as procedures in the other side of the hospital. That is unaffected,
and we see healthy pickup and going into the fourth quarter, not perhaps at the same level as we saw pre-
COVID, but close to those levels.

What we see as issue is the ED has 20% to 25%, 30% reduction in visits. Those visits are the ones that
generate admissions into hospitals, as well for the general floor. So -- and we see primarily Medicare
patients who are more reluctant, because of the age, to go to an ED visit even to be admitted. So they
are presenting themselves later with more severe issues. So that is how we look at this. We also look at
surgery centers, and we look at alternate sites for procedures, and those actually are doing well.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Super helpful color, Joe. And then the -- just some additional question made on the pace and change that
we're seeing in Europe for time. Some of these European geographies, markets were moving in the right
direction over the summer. Now obviously, we're very focused in the U.S., but there is also these changes
in policy there. I guess, anything that you're seeing there? Does that factor into Q4? Any comments or
color would be helpful.

José E. Almeida
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We saw a pretty good recovery in Europe. If you remember our second quarter numbers were
affected and now the third quarter, even with issues is not -- is still showing growth. The concern that we
have is the 2 largest markets that you have in Europe right now is one of them, France, the other one
is Germany. Those are the 2 largest markets in Europe, followed by Spain, U.K. and Italy. So you see a
resurge in the lockdown for 30 days just announced by Angela Merkel. You will see that may affect the
way people are treated in Europe in the health system.

Remember, uninsured and noninsured patients is not an issue in Europe. So you don't see the reluctance
to go to the ED, but you see a concern in people having procedures is hospitals continue to fill up would
be for us to watch very closely. When we do modeling here, we don't do modeling only for the U.S., we're
doing modeling for U.S. and Europe in a very deep level, even with variations of vaccine approvals and
sentiment of the population in terms of going to the hospital.

As I said, the numbers that people are seeing right now is Medicare patients are more reluctant to go
to the hospital today for a chest pain and other ailments, and telemedicine has helped some of this
alleviation because you can do that remotely. In Europe, we see that coming up as a trend as well. We're
keeping our eyes very close in Europe, but that's part of our analysis as well.

Operator

Our last question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I just wanted to follow-up on 2 key points that you've been talking about on this call. Jay, the first one
is the $150 million in cost, I know you said that we could be under these kind of COVID conditions for a
while. If that does occur, can you talk about what proportion of the costs you could still work off? And how
long would it take post sort of normalization to get rid of the remainder claw back or remainder of those
costs?

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

Well, post normalization, I would say, within 1 to 2 quarters, we should be back to -- we should have been
able to alleviate the vast majority of these costs, so -- or mitigate, I should say. So post normalization, it's
something that we'll see go away over time, the vast majority. There will be some that remain because
for example, all of our employees in facilities today now use PPE, in the past that was not the case. And
so that has a daily cost attendant with it that we'll live with. But like I said, post normalization of vast
majority of costs will be mitigated. As it relates to next year and how much we can do in the interim to
mitigate some of this $150 million impact, that's an open question we're working through, and we believe
there is some opportunity, but it's hard for me to quantify that at this stage.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And just a follow-up. I think a lot of people are surprised by the admissions comments. And I guess I was
wondering, is that reflective of what you've seen quarter-to-date? Or are you assuming any deterioration
as we move forward given the cases rising? If you could give us any color, that would be helpful.

James K. Saccaro
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Last quarter, from an admission standpoint, I would estimate roughly a 12% decline Q3, that's
Q3. Q4, our assumption is roughly 11%. And October to date, that's kind of what we're seeing. The
wildcard is what happens to escalating cases around the U.S. and in Europe. But look, we think we have
a sufficient range that we've shared that encompasses a wide swath of potential outcomes. So we think
we've got it correctly called with the range that we've shared. But we're looking -- we're not expecting
deterioration from -- in our high case, we're not anticipating deterioration from the current level of roughly
11% decline.

Clare Trachtman
