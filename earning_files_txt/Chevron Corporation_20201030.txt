CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of
Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir.

Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations

Thank you, Audra. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and Webcast. I'm Wayne
Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. And on the call with me today are Mark Nelson, EVP
of Downstream and Chemicals; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on
Chevron's website.

Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statements on Slide 2. Now I'll turn it over to
Pierre.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Thanks, Wayne. Third quarter earnings were about breakeven, improved from last quarter of reflecting
continued challenging market conditions. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the
appendix to this presentation. Special items totaled $220 million, including a tax charge related to a
settlement agreement on asset retirement funding and other items tied to the expiration next August of
the Rokan production sharing contract in Indonesia. Free cash flow was almost $2 billion, and the dividend
was flat with last quarter. Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow from operations improved as commodity prices
increased from their lows in the second quarter. Included this quarter was a $265 million cash payment
related to the Rokan settlement agreement. Our cash flow dividend breakeven was under $50 Brent due to
improved downstream performance and our strong capital and operating cost management. We ended the
quarter with a net debt ratio over 17%, well below our competitors.

Even after closing the Noble acquisition, and stepping up its step to fair value, we expect to maintain the
leading balance sheet among the peer group. We're committed to protecting our financial strength during
this ongoing crisis.

Turning to the next slide. Our 2020 capital spending is trending below our latest guidance. Looking ahead,
we expect next year's capital budget to be $14 billion, below the combined 2020 guidance from Chevron
and Noble, and well below Chevron's 5-year guidance from our March Investor Day. Our 2021 capital
budget will continue to prioritize investments that drive long-term value, and shows the capital flexibility
in our portfolio, including assets recently added from Noble. We'll share additional details in December
after formal approval.

Operating expenditures in the quarter were more than 10% lower than our 2019 quarterly average, ahead
of our guidance. Turning to Slide 6. Relative to the same period last year, third quarter adjusted upstream
earnings decreased due to lower realizations and reduced liftings primarily due to curtailments, partially
offset by lower depreciation and operating expenses. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily
due to lower sales volumes and margins. The other segment was higher primarily due to various corporate
charges.

Turning to Slide 7. Compared to the second quarter, third quarter earnings increased by about $8 billion.
More than half due to the absence of second quarter special items. Adjusted upstream earnings were up
almost $2 billion, primarily due to higher liquids realizations. Adjusted downstream earnings increased
by over $1 billion primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins and favorable swings in both timing

effects and lower cost or market inventory adjustments at CPChem. The other segment charges decreased
primarily due to a favorable swing in accruals for stock-based compensation.

Turning to production. Third quarter oil equivalent production, excluding asset sales, was 3% lower than
a year ago. During the past 12 months, we closed a number of asset sales all signed pre-pandemic.
Increased Permian production and higher entitlement effects were offset primarily by curtailments and
higher turnarounds. The curtailments were in line with our guidance range and reflect mostly OPEC+
reductions in Kazakhstan and Africa and market-driven constraints in Thailand.

Now I'll turn it over to Mark.

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals

Thanks, Pierre. As shown on Slide 9, the operating environment has improved from the lows in the second
quarter, but is still challenged. Some products like diesel and petrochemicals have been more resilient
during the pandemic, and we've been able to develop new customer channels. Conversely, jet demand
has only modestly recovered. Its up demand picture has resulted in weak product margins, well below
cyclical averages. Since the crisis started, we've been focused on what we can control: safe and reliable
operations, cost management and value chain optimization. In the third quarter, our financial results
improved due to strong performance in these areas, along with some margin improvement in polyethylene
and West Coast fuels.

Turning to the next slide. Our focus on cost management is delivering results with third quarter operating
expenses nearly 20% lower than pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter. I'm proud of how our employees
have risen to this challenge. Streamlining work processes, reducing contractor costs and adapting activity
levels to a lower margin environment. Our teams have also delivered on more than 90% of the planned
scope of our 2020 turnaround program. Deferring only a minor amount of activity. This is a tremendous
accomplishment and positions our refinery network to be ready without a backlog when the economy is
back to pre-pandemic levels. Optimization activities further reduced the cost of this year's planned work,
contributing to lower operating expenses.

Turning to the next slide. As always, we're focused on safe and reliable operations, keeping our employees
safe, being a good neighbor and delivering the products of the world are all part of our license to operate.
Since the economic slowdown began, we've balanced efficient refinery utilization with the highest margin
sales channels for our products. We've consistently placed more than 90% of our high-value products into
our contracted sales channels despite volatility in demand. This generates the best margins across our
value chains. The recent acquisitions of marketing assets in Australia, in the Pasadena refinery and the
U.S. Gulf Coast further extend our value chains in those regions giving us more opportunities to improve
profitability and returns.

Turning to chemicals. GS Caltex continues to make good progress on their new mixed feed cracker.
We expect the project to be under budget and months ahead of schedule. Our local team has done a
remarkable job safely progressing the project despite the challenges of COVID-19. At CPChem, we've
completed feed at our U.S. Gulf Coast Cracker 2 project and have placed it on hold as we assess market
conditions. We continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals, and the importance of
world-scale facilities with access to low-cost feedstock. At the same time, any new investment needs to be
supported by project economics that will generate strong returns through the price cycle. Also, CPChem
began producing circular polyethylene at scale, an industry first in the United States. The production of PE
from plastic waste is an important milestone and underscores our commitment to finding innovative ways
to deliver sustainable products to our customers.

Now turning to renewable fuels. The future of energy is lower carbon and we're delivering more alternative
products to our customers. Recently, we announced first gas at our CalBio renewable natural gas joint
venture in California and a new partnership with Brightmark. Our capital committed to RNG ventures
is over $200 million. In renewable diesel, we're leveraging existing infrastructure to co-process biofeed
at our El Segundo refinery, with start-up expected in the first half of next year. Also, we sell a range of
branded biodiesels and are piloting the sale of R99 in Southern California.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Through Novvi, we recently announced first production of renewable base oil at our 500-barrel-a-day plant
in Texas. This leading technology partnership has developed an innovative and sustainable product with
future expansion potential. And lastly, our GS Caltex hydrogen testing site in South Korea has opened,
the first of its kind in Seoul, where customers can purchase traditional fuels as well as hydrogen and
electricity. All of these efforts align with how we're increasing renewables in support of our business, part
of our approach to the energy transition, which Pierre will now further discuss.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Thanks, Mark. We continue to make good progress in our energy transition focus areas. Next year, we
expect to fund $100 million of projects identified with our marginal abatement cost curves. The map
tool helps us select the most cost-efficient projects to reduce carbon intensity across our operations. As
Mark noted, we announced the new joint venture with Bright Mark, extending our renewable natural gas
portfolio.

Finally, in our partnership with Svante, we're pleased to have been awarded a U.S. DoE grant to help
fund the construction of a demonstration carbon capture plant in our California upstream operations.
The project is expected to start-up in 2022. These projects reflect Chevron's commitment to low-carbon
solutions that are both good for the environment and good for our shareholders.

Turning to the next slide. We closed the Noble Energy acquisition earlier this month, and integration is on
track. We've completed employee selections, had some early quick wins like paying off the revolver and
selling its plain, and assessment of operational opportunities is well on its way. In the third quarter, Noble
generated positive free cash flow, primarily due to ongoing capital and cost management and strong sales
in the Eastern Med. We're pleased to add Noble assets and welcome its talented employees to Chevron.

Our internal transformation launched late last year is mostly complete with a new organization in place
November 1. This was an enterprise-wide change effort, the largest since our Texaco merger, that
modernizes how we work, leveraging digital tools and empowered teams. Lastly, we recently signed an
agreement to sell our Appalachia natural gas business. We expect to close the transaction before the end
of the year.

Now looking forward, in the fourth quarter, we expect Noble production to be lower, primarily due
to seasonal demands in the Eastern Med. Curtailments and planned downtime are both lower than
last quarter. Production this quarter may include additional cost recovery barrels related to the Rokan
settlement. At Gorgon, Train 2 weld repairs are now complete, and we have started commissioning in
preparation for LNG production. We expect Train 1 to be taken out of service after Train 2 is back online.

At TCO, remobilization continues. We successfully increased the project workforce to near 15,000, and our
plans are to end the year with a project team over 20,000. Earlier this week, we completed our final sea
lift on schedule. All modules are now in Kazakhstan, a significant project milestone. And finally, we expect
severance payments to lower cash flow.

With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne.

Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. [Operator
Instructions] We'll go our best to get to all of your questions answered. Audra, please open the lines.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I have one upstream question here and one downstream question. Maybe, Mark, i.e., sort on the
downstream question, which is it looked like the downstream results, and particularly refining, surprised
relative to our expectations. Was there anything that you would call out here in the third quarter as many
of the independent refiners had very tough third quarters, including on the West Coast. And just can you
step back and talk about your big picture outlook for the refining sector in that part of your business.

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals

Thanks for the question, Neil. First, if I step back and look operationally at the third quarter performance
overall, I would say that operationally, it was first driven by our continued cost management efforts across
the downstream chemicals portfolio, much of which is actually focused in our manufacturing sector. Also
some polyethylene in the West Coast fuels margin improvement. And then contribution from our lubricants
and additives business.

If I step back and look at the refining sector, in general, I would say that the pre -- the pandemic demand
shock, clearly, has retested margin lows, and there's not a real analog for the pace of recovery. But the 3
things are required, I think, to have sustainable improved refining margins.

First, demand recovery for all high-value products in our materials. We've certainly indicated that as an
industry, we're within 5% to 10% of 2019 more gasoline/diesel levels. But jet is still only half of 2019,
and so we need continued recovery there. Second, we need inventory reduction, and we're beginning to
see some of that in different parts of the world. And finally, refinery rationalization. This is the part that's
interesting for us because we've rationalized our portfolio over the past decade and we're now seeing
competitors start to do that. In some of the regions of the world like Southeast Asia, Australia and the
U.S. Coast, you're hearing people talk about rationalization, which certainly creates an opportunity for us
going forward as the supply and demand balance tightens a bit over time. Thanks for the question, Neil.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And then, Pierre, follow-ups for you. It's on Gorgon. Where do we stand with Train 2? And what do we
know about Train 1 and 3 in terms of managing the downtime there?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Neil. As I said, the weld repairs are complete. We verified them with nondestructive testing.
We've also completed pressure testing of the kettle. So we're now in the process of getting back online. So
we've started the recommissioning process from the turnaround and the extended turnaround.

The next steps are to dry out the systems, and then we'll begin cool down. We expect this to take several
weeks, which will put first LNG production in the second half of November. In terms of train one, as I said,
we expect that to be taken down soon after Train 2 is back online. And then we would inspect Train 1, and
depending on whether repairs are required or not, that will determine how long Train 1 is down. And then
sequentially, then we would look to Train 3 after that one.

We'll move next to Jeanine Wai at Barclays.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first question is on sustaining CapEx and the second one is on the upstream with Eastern Med.

So the second half 2020 CapEx run rate, that's below your multiyear sustaining upstream capital estimate
of $10 billion. You've accomplished a lot this year with cost reductions and efficiency improvements. So
my first question is whether there's an update to that $10 billion in sustaining capital number that you
provided a few quarters ago. And I know we've got Noble in the mix now, too.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Thanks, Jeanine. No, there isn't. I mean the $10 billion is really an estimate, right? It's based on our --
again, Chevron only, how to sustain production in the short term. Noble gave out an equivalent number,
around $800 million for that.

To be clear, we're not trying to sustain short term production. Mark just talked about we're in an economy
that's impacted by the pandemic and demand for our products is below normal levels in pre-pandemic
levels, and therefore, we have oversupplied markets. We are trying to sustain the long-term value of the
enterprise. So if you look to our 2021 capital guidance of $14 billion, it includes an upstream capital of
more -- around $11 billion or so, so higher than the sustaining level, but not all of it is going to short-term
production. Some of it is going to long-term production like our project at Tengiz.

So we're focused on sustaining long-term value, not short-term production. That's true in combination
with Noble. But there's no real update to those numbers. Efficiency improvements are rolling through,
but this is an estimate, an analytical estimate that's not so precise that we're going to be updating it
frequently.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. Understood. My second question is on the Eastern Med. Could you provide any initial
indications or thoughts on how you expect to monetize Leviathan and a lot of the other discovered
resource in the area. I guess, specifically, do you think that regional demand growth could be strong
enough in the medium-term or longer-term to avoid either greenfield LNGs or a pipeline to Europe?

And then if I could squeeze one more in there, if there's any commentary on the headlines on the pricing
dynamics, that would be helpful.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

All right. Well, I won't comment on some of the headlines you've read. Those are commercial matters that
we'll discuss in private with our partners and with our customers. We've had a very smooth transition with
our operations in Eastern Med and all across the Noble assets. Our integration is on track. The employee
selection in the United States have already happened. We feel really good. We're pleased with the people
who are joining us in the Eastern Med included. So Noble employees are top quality, and we're very
pleased to be welcoming them to Chevron.

As you know, it's a good resource. It's free cash flow positive. The project has been completed. It's in
an area where there's demand opportunities, in particular, backing out coal. But it's only been a few
weeks. So our focus right now is to have a smooth integration with Noble. We're pleased, again, with
the operations and the free cash flow generation. We're going to work with potential customers, existing
customers, future customers to find the most cost-efficient way to develop that resource. There is upside
to it. And again, there's market, but that will -- we'll determine that all in time. Thanks, Jeanine.

Operator

We'll move next to Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question here, if I look at the third quarter, it looks like your Brent-based breakeven price,
somewhere in the order of $50 a barrel. And you're talking about this restructuring plan that's been
underway and kind of completing here. So I was just curious how you think about the cost side of the
equation and the ability to further lower the operating costs and the breakeven moving forward given
you've given us the capital number here already.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. We -- the breakeven, and again, we would have it a little bit below $50. It's important that it
doesn't factor in downstream margins or chemical margins in other parts of our business which Mark has
addressed. And those can vary, and they can make a difference, obviously, on where the breakeven is.
I mean, margins in that sector are pretty low, and as they recover, that lowers our breakeven because,
again, it's holding. It's just looking at the oil price and not all the other assumptions.

In terms of cost, look, our costs were down more than 10% this quarter. We provided guidance that we
expect to end the year on a Chevron-only basis here because fourth quarter will have Noble operating
expenses. But if you just looked at Chevron only, we would be down $1 billion. Again, we'd characterize
that as activity related and other actions that we've taken to manage through the pandemic and the crisis
that we're in. We've also provided guidance, and we've completed our transformation. So we launched
that transformation, which is an enterprise-wide restructuring. We started that almost 12 months ago, and
we just are completing our employee selections right now. It's a tough time for our employees as they're
being notified and we'll have the new organization in place November 1. We've talked about $1 billion of
OpEx reductions from the transformation. And then finally, we have the Noble synergies. And we've talked
about $300 million of total Noble synergies, not all of that is operating expense.

So all of that is rolling through. We'll bring that together for you, likely at our Investor Day on any kind
of updated guidance. But it's all consistent with your question, which is we're working hard to get our
breakeven down. We sustained our dividend. So the comparisons are consistent. And we continue to make
progress, both through capital discipline and cost management to lower our breakeven, preserve our
balance sheet strength, right, ending the quarter with the leading balance sheet in the industry, a net debt
ratio of 17%. That's essentially what we're doing, and we'll continue to do it as we're in these challenging
times.

Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. My second question would just be as it relates to 2021 production. Obviously, you gave us a
CapEx number here. On the last call, you talked about the Permian potentially declining high single-digit
rate year-over-year in '21 on an organic basis. Obviously, you're layering in Noble here. So I didn't know if
maybe you could provide any early read on '21 production, whether it's stand-alone or pro forma, or if not
a hard number, maybe some moving pieces around it?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. We'll provide our production guidance. As we normally do. That will be on our fourth quarter call at
the end of January. We did provide guidance for the fourth quarter, so we do a quarter ahead.

I think you've hit some of the pieces there. Again, I would add the Rokan PSC expiration, which I referred
to, and we had a settlement agreement. It was a really good agreement that assures the certainty around
the funding for abandonment and adds a little drilling activity to keep production managed heading into
that contract expiration. But that's going to be in August of 2021, so I'd point that out. And again, our
efforts in the Permian, which I talked about is a potential decline of 6% to 7% if we stay at those activity
levels.

9

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

So I don't really have more to say, Phil, to you. We'll provide that guidance when we finalize our plans, get
formal approval on our capital budget and we'll do it at our regular time during the fourth quarter earnings
call.

Operator

Next we'll move to Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.

Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So the first one I wanted to ask on is actually around some of the latest investments and momentum
you've made on emissions reductions. And there's been some positive announcements here over the
last few months. And I think the disclosure on this marginal abatement cost curve is interesting in that
it shows there's opportunities to potentially reduce emissions while also boosting returns of the negative
cost of carbon that you have there. The question specifically, I think about over the next few years
here, any sense of the depth of opportunities where you can actually have this nice win-win of driving
down costs while also reducing carbon intensity. And then as you think about planning longer term, any
intentions of expanding your emission production goals that already exists perhaps through the post 2023
in line with Paris [ climate ], like some of your peers have done, and just how you're thinking about that
longer term.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Sure. On the second question, as you said, we have 4 carbon intensity reduction metrics. They go out to
2023. 2023 was chosen because that's the first stock take date under the Paris agreements. And so we're
aligned with those. We're the only company -- first company, only company in our sector to do it on an
equity basis. Many do it on an operatorship basis. And then we do oil and gas metrics separately because
they serve a different market. So the $100 million that you're referring to is something that we expect will
be recurring. So we see opportunities for a number of years to be able to invest that kind of expenditure
and achieve what we would call cost-efficient carbon reductions.

But if I -- and yes, will we extend at some point in time? I think, yes. The answer is yes. It would be
logical for us to go to the next Paris stock take date. But we're right now focused on delivering on those
2023 targets. We also have those as part of the incentive pay of almost every Chevron employee. So we're
making good progress on that.

But I would think all of our energy transition activities, and Mark referred to a number in his business,
they really support making our business more sustainable in the lower carbon future, and they do
it in a way where we earn returns. So the renewable natural gas that Mark was talking about also
generates returns. And then, of course, then we're looking at some of the new technologies, and those,
obviously, are at a different stage of maturity. So we're taking a number of actions that we believe address
climate change that lowers carbon and does it in a way that's good for the environment and good for our
shareholders.

Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is just on the portfolio composition post
the Noble transaction. So you recently executed on the Appalachia sale, and you've done a good job under
kind of pruning the portfolio and divesting noncore assets over time. As we kind of look forward here
post this transaction, any updated thoughts on further opportunities for divestitures and whether or not
-- or I guess part of the question, if you could address things like Noble Midstream or anything within
Noble portfolio that might be noncore? And then lastly, whether or not as part of the Noble transaction,
guaranteeing Noble's outstanding data is part of what your vision.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Okay, Devin. I got the asset sales. What was the question about Noble debt at the end?

Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Whether or not that will be guaranteed by Chevron.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

All right. Well, let me just address Noble debt. We're reviewing options. We haven't made a decision. And
again, we'll notify bondholders when we make that decision, and you should expect that in the next couple
of months.

In terms of asset sales. We're on track to complete the program that we've talked about. It was 2018
to 2020, a 3-year program of $5 billion to $10 billion before tax proceeds. We expect to close our U.S.
natural gas sale here before year-end. And when we complete that, we'll be right in the middle of that
range.

In terms of what else is in the public domain, the most significant ownership interest that we've talked
about is selling our interest in Northwest Shelf and that's a commercial matter, and we just -- we won't
comment on.

But I guess I would just say we're in a different place than many of our competitors, right? Mark referred
to the rationalization we've done on our refining network over the last decade and even before. I referred
to a number of asset sales that we've completed in the last 12 months. You saw that in our production
chart, all that are signed pre pandemic at good values. Obviously, we just bought a bunch of assets -- a
company that comes with high-quality assets, and I won't comment on any specific assets in the Noble
portfolio.

So we're very value-driven. The gas assets that we have that we're planning to close here before the
year-end and in our interest in North West Shelf, it held up better in this post-pandemic world. Also, if
you think of North West Shelf, it's more -- almost like an infrastructure investment as the resource behind
the plant comes down and it becomes more of a tolling facility going forward. So you'll continue to see us
to be disciplined in how we manage our portfolio. Would not expect us to have any kind of big program
announcement. We'll have the ongoing portfolio rationalization that's been part of the Chevron approach
to management for a long time.

Operator

We'll go next to Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

2 questions. I think one is for Mark and one is for Pierre. Pierre, what would be a reasonable allocation of
future capital in the new renewable, low carbon initiative? And two, let's assume that at some point, you
probably will set up a target to be net carbon zero on at least [ script ] 1 or 2, maybe over the next 15,
20 years. Do you need other new business by some of your peers go into the renewable power business in
order to achieve that. So that's the first question.

The second question is for Mark. If I look at over the last couple of quarters, one of the big performance
difference between you guys and the U.S. comparing to your customers in Europe, they have far stronger
downstream results, mainly because of their marketing assets and also their trading operation. On that
basis, that do you think for Chevron, that is the right recipe so that you may want to further boost your
marketing asset. I mean, you've been selling down your marketing asset over the past 10-plus years. And
for trading, historically, you guys look at the facilitation cost center, while your European peers are looking
at the profit center [ to trade ] around the asset. So is that the right approach for you, or that you don't
think it's right fit for you?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Okay. Paul, I'll start then. Look, we're going to be disciplined with our capital. That's true in our
conventional business, and you've seen that with the announcement of our organic capital budget. That's
true in our acquisitions. You saw that when we walked away from Anadarko, and collected the $1 billion
termination fee. And I think you've seen that in how we executed the Noble transaction being the first
to announce and complete that, an acquisition. And it's going to be true in energy transition. No one in
Chevron has an open checkbook. And that's -- again, that's true in our conventional business. That's true
in our [ main ], and that's true in energy transition.

What you have seen is investments now that are on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. We
talked about $100 million into our marginal abatement cost curve investments, $200 million in renewable
natural gas. So the investments really are limited by what we believe are -- or reflect what we believe
are the opportunities that are, again, good for the environment, address climate change and good for our
shareholders. In terms of do we need to adopt this change in strategy, I think we've been pretty clear that
we're not going to diversify away or divest from our core business. The actions we're taking around the
energy transition are geared to making these businesses that are good businesses. That play an important
role in society and making them more sustainable in a lower carbon future. So I think you should expect
us to continue to do that. We are going to operate in businesses where we have competitive advantage,
where we have a value proposition for shareholders that is advantaged relative to other alternatives. And
again, we're going to do that in a way that is part of a lower carbon future. So maybe we'll go to Mark on
the downstream question.

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals

Thanks for the question, Paul. On the marketing question, we've consistently indicated that we are
interested in strengthening our value chains. In fact, you could say that here in the third quarter that
we've demonstrated the benefit of linking our refinery production to higher-margin product placement,
and that's kind of our view of a value chain. And I could -- I would suggest that the recent Puma
transaction is an example of us strengthening value chain in Asia, where we have essentially added
terminals in the retail stations in Australia, where we can now place our Asian joint venture refinery
production in a very strong market where we own the strongest brand. And we acquired that on June 30
and first 3 months and it's working just as we would have expected. So I think that goes to the concept of
strengthening our value chain.

To your comment on the trading portion of our portfolio. Our trading business is designed first to ensure
that we flow product. Second, that we optimize around those value chains and then we trade in those
areas where we have demonstrated considerable expertise and it's vital to our downstream business.
They're critical partners in regard to how we run our business and make those value chains work. And
they continue to look for opportunities to increase their impact. So I appreciate the question because the
way we think about our value chain is important to us.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

I'll just add, I think our shareholders support our approach to trading because I think they understand
the added risk and volatility that can come with trading earnings, and it generally attracts a little multiple
because of that, in particular in a resource company. Paul, thanks for your questions. We appreciate it.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Mark, maybe I could take advantage of you being on the call. I just wonder if you could offer some
perspectives on how you see the -- this bottoming process of the downstream cycle playing out, what
signposts are you seeing in any of your markets in terms of any green ships or any expectations that
we're going to be here for a while. And I guess what's behind my question is, is Chevron totally done with
rationalization in your downstream portfolio?

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals

Well, Doug, I think it's a thoughtful question given a unique situation we're in. If I go back to the question
Neil asked about -- it relates to margins, in general. I mentioned 3 things that we have to see to feel
like we are on a path for greater sustainable margins in the downstream business. And it is that demand
recovery for all high-value products. And you can see some of those things happening in our Asian
markets where we see Australia past its 2019 levels. We see certain Southeast Asian markets going
beyond their levels. And with our strong brand, we've been able to go past industry rates of growth in
some of our areas. So I think those are opportunities that will help us on the demand side of the equation.

The inventory reduction, I think the industry has demonstrated over time that we'll work through that,
but that will take a little bit of time. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, the refinery rationalization as an
industry, while we've done the predominance of our rationalization, we're always looking at strengthening
the value chains in which we've chosen to compete. And we'll continue to look at that over time.

But the green shoot, I would say, is the amount of companies that are announcing suggested
rationalizations. And I think if those come through, we might see getting to those recovered margins
sooner than maybe we would naturally expect. We will presume that. We will stay focused on the self-
help side of the equation, things that we can control like lowering our operating costs, certainly running
efficiently with the desired yields and then using data analytics to place and price our products. So we'll
focus on what we can control, but we're hoping that some of those green shoots actually come to fruition.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

My follow-up is for Pierre, if I may. Pierre, just some clarification on the CapEx. What's the cash CapEx
number unrelated given the headcount reduction and so on you've had. What should we think as apples-
to-apples operating cost reductions as we look at '21 versus '20? And I'll leave it there.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. So again, we'll give all the details on our capital program when it's formally approved. But a cash
equivalent, excluding affiliates, of about $10 billion is a good number to use right now. Well, I'm not sure
I can say much more on OpEx. I think Devin asked that question. Again, we have $1 billion of reductions
we've seen this year, $1 billion that we'll see next year through transformation, Noble synergies. And as I
said, we'll put that all together and provide some guidance here in the first quarter.

We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey at Sankey Research. .

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

You've talked about your industry-leading balance sheet, and we've seen some incredible deterioration
in values around the various other oils even globally. In terms of acquisitions, I assume that you're now
very happy with your Permian position. It feels as if it's difficult to find anything that would improve your
position. Can you talk a little bit about that? And I assume that you don't want to add debt without there
being a compelling opportunity, which I assume that kind of isn't globally. It just seems that you're in such
a strong competitive position. I wonder if you're thinking about actually doing some more deals.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Thanks, Paul. Look, we're focused on integrating Noble successfully, and we're off to a really good start.
I also talked about our transformation, again, it's enterprise-wide restructuring that we've been working
on for almost a year now and will go in effect November 1. And so those are really our priorities. As we've
said, we have a high bar for M&A., and Noble cleared that bar. And so it's quality assets -- it meets our
criteria of quality assets at a good value at the right time. I'm just not going to speculate about future
M&A.

If I do talk about our financial priorities, I mean, I think we've been pretty consistent and clear on what
they are. Sustain and grow the dividend. We've done that for 33 straight years. Invest to support long-
term value, and we're doing that in our organic program. And of course, we've done that through our
Noble acquisition. And maintain a strong balance sheet, which we've been able to do with a net debt
ratio of 17.5%. In terms of the Permian, I think you said it very well. We have a leading position. Noble
provides a nice bolt-on. Again, our M&A is not focused necessarily on the Permian. It's focused on assets
that are accretive to our shareholders and a good value for our shareholders that add quality assets.
Thanks, Paul. Do you have a follow-up?

Paul Sankey

I do, actually, yes. It's a totally different subject. Could you talk about your OPEC curtailments? And
anything you can add on the neutral zone?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. In terms of the neutral zone, the production was about 30,000 barrels a day, our share in the third
quarter. So that startup is going well. In terms of our curtailments overall, the guidance we provided was
about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent, so that's oil and gas equivalent. And the majority of that is OPEC+
related. So 80% or 90% of that is OPEC+ related. And that's, again, in countries like Kazakhstan, Nigeria
and Angola. Thanks, Paul.

Paul Sankey

Just quickly -- where are you headed on neutral zone? Just quickly. Where will that go to?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

We haven't provided any guidance. We're focused on continually having a safe and gradual ramp up. So
again, we're at near 30,000 barrels a day, Chevron share, and we'll update you at year-end.

Operator

Next from Biraj Borkhataria at RBC.

Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

First one I had was on -- just a clarification on TCO. The co-lending figure has gone down for the last
couple of successive quarters. Is it safe to assume, given you've had issues mobilizing the workforce, that
the bit that's missing from 2020 just gets pushed to 2021? That would be my first question.

14

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. So there's 2 parts to that. I mean, let me just address. TCO project spending is about down $1 billion
our share this year relative to what we had planned, in part due to the demobilization. But we said about
half of that are through true cost efficiency savings, about half will be deferred to next year and future
years. That's sort of related to the lending, but not entirely right because lending is also dependent on
dividend policy and prices. But you're correct that you've seen that the lending has come down, our
guidance on it has come down during the course of the year, which is again, a combination of lower
project spending. But also where prices have gone.

Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. And then second question on a slightly different topic. But when you're looking at
project sanctions, and just in the context of your kind of energy transition approach. Do you currently
assume a carbon price even where countries themselves do not have a sort of fiscal framework in place?
And if so, can you kind of tell us what the carbon price you're using is?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. We don't disclose our price forecast for oil and gas prices. We think it's commercially sensitive. We
don't disclose our carbon price forecast. We look at it under a variety of scenarios, both commodity prices
and carbon pricing. And we look at it by jurisdiction because it can vary.

The investments that Mark referred to, certainly are policy supported. So they generate, in some cases,
low carbon fuel credits or renewable fuel standard, the federal standard. And so again, it really varies by
jurisdiction. We are looking at returns. Again, we're trying to make investments in energy transition that
are both good for the environment and good for shareholders. And some of that return is policy enabled,
but it really does vary by jurisdiction. Thanks, Biraj.

Operator

We'll go next to Roger Read at Wells Fargo.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just 2 questions I have for you. The first, I know you said all the modules are in Kazakhstan now, but any
more update you can provide like how many people are actually able to muster to the site and kind of
thought process as we head into the typically slower winter season for what this might imply for budgetary
and time frame of start-up on the next phases?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Roger. Look, the remobilization is going well. I said we're near 15,000 workforce on the
project and we're heading to end the year above 20. So far, our safeguards are working well. We've kept
the rate of infection very low, and we're seeing our work progress in line with expectations. So the key for
us going forward to holding cost and schedule is to complete the remobilization, sustain a full workforce
during a pandemic using our safeguards, and achieve our progress milestones. So we're -- as you say,
we're in the -- I wouldn't say, early days. We're in the middle of the remobilization. We're heading into
winter. We need to see how this all progresses, and we'll know more by our Investor Day, and we plan to
provide an update then. Having all material and modules on the ground is a really important milestone. It
does mean that we now can just address all of the work in place. And so that's -- those are really the keys
for us going forward in terms of, again, maintaining cost and schedule.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Okay. Great. And then a quick unrelated follow-up, if I could. As you look across your various operations,
leave Noble out of this, but everybody's kind of spinning, everybody's kind of drilling. Just curious if
you see anything in the way of decline rates that are either better or worse than what you would have
anticipated, thinking whether it's Permian or Gulf of Mexico or just international?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Short answer is no. We're not seeing any surprises. I mean, the Permian is a little bit higher than our early
guidance, if you recall, at our market response press release, I think it was March 24 or 25, we guided to
the exit rate on the Permian being down 20%. We'll be a little bit better than that. So our production in
the Permian was 565,000 barrels of oil equivalent. We think our exit rate -- this is Chevron only. We think
our exit rate will be around 550. And again, that's a little better than we had guided to back in March. Now
we'll have the Noble Permian production on top of that, that's about $50 million. So we expect to be near
$600 million.

So we're managing -- again, I -- we are managing declines very well. We are not putting a lot of capital to
add short-term production because of oversupplied markets. But we're pleased with how we're operating
the upstream, just like Mark has talked about safe and reliable operations, we're seeing the same on our
upstream operations. Thanks, Roger.

Operator

We'll move next to Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research.

Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC

My question is about your renewable gas business. If you look at the California Air Resource Board, carbon
intensity scores, actually when I first saw it, I thought it was a mistake because renewable gas is like a
negative 400 or something totally off the charts. I guess you're constrained by the CNG market, which I
don't know how big it is, but given the emissions benefits of this product, are you able to offset all or at
least a significant amount of your obligations from the refining business under the LCFS.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Sam, this is Mark. Thank you for the question and the kind of the recognition of why we would be
considering the renewable natural gas as part of our value chain. I mean, you should expect us to be a
strong player in the RNG space and policy enabled markets like the West. It is -- as you've indicated, it is
the most cost and carbon efficient fuel from an LCFs and RFS perspective and it's actually low execution
risk. And so it leverages our strengths, our ability to partner with folks, especially on the feedstock side.
And then our ability to place the product, we've got to your second element that you need a place to put
this over time. And so we're excited about the CalBio and the Brightmark and even the adoptive port
announcements that we've made, and I think you'll see us continue to wisely grow here. Thanks for the
question, Sam.

Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC

Oh, sure. Okay. And I mean, I guess, just it's a related follow-up. But one of the things that you've said
that I think is differentiated from a corporate level is that you manage your capital planning not really on
the basis of prices, but on how you see the demand outlook shaking out or directionally because the price
can change and it might not necessarily reflect actual conditions.

But -- so in light of that, you mentioned that we're transitioning to a low-carbon world, some things could
change depending on the election, but can this renewable gas business, if there really is market share to
be had, can it scale beyond California? What other geographic footprints are out there for you? And just
basically, just in terms of scope, what are you thinking here?

Yes. The short answer is growth is clearly plausible. We tend to look at this in regard to our existing value
chains where we have our strengths and where we can execute well, and we'll consider growth in that
context. But there's certainly upside potential.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Manav Gupta at Crédit Suisse. .

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

You have 2 high-class refining assets in California, and we saw that the earnings were stronger in the
downstream, as Neil pointed out. The governor over there is indicating that he wants to ban the internal
combustion engine in 2035, the sale of new vehicles. Is that any way changing the way you plan your
business in California? Or you think that he does not have the legal authority as many legal experts are
pointing out?

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals

Well, thanks for the -- thank you for the question. I'm actually a native Californian. When I think about
California, I think of, generally, under normal conditions, a very strong economy and a tremendous desire
for affordable mobility. And with that backdrop for the foreseeable future, to be successful in California
from a fuels perspective, I think you have to have reliable refineries. A strong brand both to place the
product and to keep a connection with the customer, and an ability to participate in California's lower
carbon future. And we've been here in California for over 100 years. And I think we are well positioned
to engage with the government to build a path towards the lower carbon future, and we will actively
participate in that and believe we can do so.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. A quick follow-up is you have had Noble assets for about a month. Are there any upside surprises,
thoughts like synergies you think you can do better on? Any integration you think you can do better on
since you acquired those assets?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Manav. Look, it's going very well. Again, we're pleased to have been the first to announce a
transaction and to complete it. It's a good fit, and I won't go through all that. Again, a very successful first
month.

Synergies are on track. We expect that there will be more as we operate as one company. In the first few
weeks, we've been able, for example, to see contracts and look at procurement opportunities. We're also
starting to see operational synergies. We'll update you sometime in the first quarter. Just let us -- give us
some time to fully assess the opportunities. We expect the synergy number to be higher. I don't have a
number for you now. We're going to do that work, and we'll advise you in due course.

use moving forward. 2 kind of related questions on it. One, does this enable you to kind of get to net

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

0 by 2030? It seems like your European peers are pushing towards that, and I'm assuming the U.S. is
going to ultimately face pressure to hit net 0 on its own emissions by 2030. And do you have any sense
of what you'd be able -- what you need to spend to achieve that now that you have this kind of cost curve
model? And does Algonquin -- the partnership with Algonquin, how does that kind of figure into this? I
think you've been partnered with them for a couple of quarters. Just wondering if that unlocks some of the
opportunities within the goal of reducing carbon intensity?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. Jason, look, we support the Paris agreement. And as Mark says, we're going to be part of the lower
carbon energy future. Our focus is on results, not pledges. And so what you're seeing our actions today
that are addressing carbon intensity. I'm just not going to get further. We have our 2023 carbon intensity
metrics I referred to earlier, that we're likely to update those in time to get to the next stock take period.
But our approach, again, is really focused on delivering results that we think address climate change and
are good for the environment.

In terms of Algonquin, it's early days, but yes, we see opportunities there. That does both, right? It sort of
increases renewables in support of our business. You've seen us do that in the Permian and in Bakersfield
with wind and solar projects that are providing power to our operations that we otherwise were buying off
the grid. And Algonquin is working on opportunities in other areas of Chevron operations. This does take
a little bit of time. You got to do some of the engineering work and the development work. But so far, that
joint venture is going well.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. And just a clarification. I appreciate -- on Slide 9, you included downstream earnings, excluding
timing effects, which is definitely useful. Is that a disclosure you plan on including going forward? And is
3Q '20, does it imply kind of no timing effects this quarter, just looking at where the graph, where the bar
is on the graph.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes, Jason. So in the very -- the last slide of the appendix, you see that we actually give the absolute
timing effects for U.S. and international downstream. So for a long time, we've been showing the variance.
But as you said, you could figure out the absolutes in each quarter. So now we've shown that for -- going
back to 2017. And yes, you should expect us to continue to do that going forward.

curious, your thoughts, another regulatory issue, the European Climate Law, getting ready to be passed 5
weeks from now and what the impact on your upstream and/or downstream operations might be.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Well, as you say, Pavel, although we've operated in Europe upstream and downstream for many decades,
and I worked there in Aberdeen when the first carbon tax was enacted, we sold the majority of our
upstream operations we have a little non-op position still. And again, no large-scale refining or marketing.
We do have some lubricants and additives businesses in there. So I think, again, we support the Paris
accord. We believe the future of energy is lower carbon. We expect more policy. I think it gets to what

Pavel S. Molchanov

Just a quick follow-up since we're a week ahead of the election. Can you remind us, on the combined
Chevron plus Noble Permian acreage position, how much of the acreage is federal?

Pierre R. Breber

Yes, it's about 10% is federal in terms of total Permian acreage.

Operator

We'll go next to Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc.

I was hoping -- just you've talked a lot about these details on the renewables, but my question was more
particularly on the Novvi partnership. I'm just wondering again on that, out of the zero part facility, can
you talk about maybe some details on what industries you all might target once that starts rolling out of
that facility?

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals

Well, so the concept for Novvi for our downstream business is to provide a renewable base oil to round
out our base oil offering over our own business and for the business of others. The product itself, which
is a technology partnership between ourselves, leveraging our isodewaxing technology and some other
patented solutions, allows us to create -- to take multiple types of bio feedstocks and turn them into what
I would consider higher-performing base oils. There are other applications even in cosmetics and things
like that, that will be investigated over time, but we do see an opportunity for expansion at that joint
venture should be economics continue to warrant it. Thank you. Thanks for the question.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc.

Sure. And then one maybe just quick follow-up on that was you certainly are doing a great job of
continuing to move not only in Novvi, this CalBio gas and just continue to move in the renewables in
general. Do you all have sort of any target or where kind of metrics on where you would like to be as far
as what you think renewables might be as a part of your potential total part of your business, 2 or 3 years
from now? Or is it just too early to determine that?

Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals

I'll give a first answer, and then maybe Pierre can build on this. I think it's too early for us to say about
how big it could become, but we do intend to continue to grow it as part of our business, and I think
we can do that successfully while we return -- while we improve returns as well. Pierre, would you add
anything?

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

Yes. That's just well said. Again, I think I addressed earlier, no one has an open checkbook in Chevron to
spend money. That's true in the conventional business and acquisitions and energy transition. We're going
to pursue the opportunities that's good for the environment, good for our shareholders, and that will grow
over time.
