Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Fair Isaac Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's Tuesday, November 10, 2020. I would now like to turn the
conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.

Steven P. Weber
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve
Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO,
Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior
year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to
facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business.

Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the
impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company's business, operations and personnel
that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained
in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements
portions of such filings.

Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This
call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the
company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these
non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation
G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the
SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 10, 2021.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope you and
your families are healthy and staying safe as we deal with the effects of the pandemic.

At FICO, we continue to make the health and safety of our employees a priority and are primarily working
from home with most of our offices remaining closed. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire
team for their perseverance and their adaptability and their commitment to our customers.

On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that I will reference during
our presentation today. 2020 has been a remarkable year for all of us. At FICO, we've been focused on
navigating an extremely volatile and unpredictable environment. I'm happy to report that our Q4 results
again demonstrate not only the quality of our management team, but also the resilience of our business
model.

In our fourth quarter, we posted exceptional results that capped off a very successful fiscal year. We
reported record revenues of $374 million, an increase of 23% over the same period last year. For the full
fiscal year, we recorded $1.29 billion of revenue, up 12% from fiscal 2019.

We delivered $59 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.98 per share even after taking a
large charge in restructuring and impairment losses. On a non-GAAP basis, the $3.25 earnings per share
was up 62% from last year, and we're delivering strong free cash flow growth as well.

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Q4 free cash flow was $135 million, up 51% from last year. Total fiscal year '20 free cash flow was $343
million, up 45% from fiscal '19. We had another solid year throughout our business.

In our Applications segment, we had a great quarter, up 12% versus last year, in large part due to some
Falcon license renewals.

For the year, the segment was essentially flat, a good result considering we entered the year with difficult
comps as a result of large license sales in fiscal '19. Applications bookings in the quarter were $117
million, up 42% over the same period last year and $282 million for the full year, up 6% versus fiscal '19.

In our Decision Management segment, we continue to prove that we're gaining traction with our new
technology. We again delivered our largest DMS revenue quarter ever, up 36% from last year's fourth
quarter. And the segment was up 22% for the full year versus fiscal 29 (sic) [ '19 ]. Our bookings were
even more impressive.

We signed $99 million in new DMS deals this quarter, up 62% from the same quarter last year. For the full
year, we signed $199 million of new DMS deals, up 27% versus last year. Let me take a few moments to
highlight the DMS success this quarter.

First, we signed the biggest single platform and centralized decision solution in company history with a
large Latin American bank. The bank is looking to implement 19 different instances on our platform to
drive the decision to support use cases related to auto, credit line management for the different retail
products and collections and others on the corporate platform.

We're signing more deals and bigger deals as we find operators are eager to use our advanced analytic
tools to automate their most difficult decisions. We continue to focus our strategy of investing for platform
success. We've been making coordinated changes across the business to grow revenue from our on-
platform solutions, favor software over services, optimize pricing and manage operating expenses. In our
fourth quarter, we made some changes, including reducing headcount and some of our facilities footprint.

Those were announced in September when we disclosed the charge we would be taking. Subsequent to
the end of our fiscal year, we also made the decision to exit our FICO cyber risk score business, which we
sold to institutional shareholder services last month.

We don't make these decisions lightly. We're committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in
decisioning analytics, and we need to be focused on that mission. That may mean exiting nonstrategic
products or not signing or renewing low-margin project work.

We are constantly looking at our business to identify areas for growth and improvement and implement
actions to deliver our strategic initiatives. We'll continue to keep you updated on the progress we're
making in our software business, and we'll be providing more information in the coming quarters to
explain the transformation we're making there.

In our Scores business, we had another very successful year. Scores were up 32% in the quarter versus
the prior year and up 25% for the full year. On the B2B side, revenues were up 27% as we saw continued
strong mortgage originations volumes. We saw a small rebound in auto originations in the quarter, while
cards and other personal loan volumes continue to be down.

The quarter also included a onetime true-up of royalty revenues. For the full year, B2B revenues were up
26% compared to 2019. Our B2C revenues were up 45% versus the same quarter last year, and 23%
for the full year compared to last year. We continue to see incredible growth at myFICO.com, which was
up 62% this quarter versus last year and are also getting good growth through our partners. As we look
to our fiscal 2021, we see customers looking to accelerate their digital transformation and looking to our
technology to facilitate the process, but we're also faced with a number of uncertainties.

Obviously, we're all still dealing with the ongoing pandemic and all of the resulting health and economic
impacts. We may see a new stimulus package from the federal government, but with the just-completed
elections, it's difficult to predict any timing or impacts.

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

It's also difficult to predict what we'll see in debt markets in the coming year. Obviously, the mortgage
markets have been growing at phenomenal levels, but we can't predict when or to what degree those
markets will cool off.

In auto and personal loans, there's still a great deal of volatility, and we cannot confidently predict how
the next 12 months will play out. As in past years, we've instituted some pricing increases in various areas
within Scores. But it's also difficult to determine their potential impact because of volume uncertainty.
We're coming off a quarter with record revenues and record bookings. But again, with an ongoing
pandemic, it's difficult to predict with certainty how quickly our solutions from the new sales will be
implemented.

In addition, our subscription-based go-to-market strategy will have an impact on the timing of revenue
recognition in fiscal '21, causing less revenue to be claimed upfront and more to be taken ratably, which
Mike will describe in his remarks.

We're proud of how our business performed in fiscal '20 and are excited as we embark on a new year. But
we're also realistic in understanding that we are in unprecedented times with many uncertainties. Because
of this, we remain committed to providing as much transparency as possible, but are not providing
guidance for fiscal '21 at this time.

I'll have some final comments in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call over to Mike for more
financial details.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will said, we had a great finish to our fiscal year, and
were able to post exceptional results in the midst of a tumultuous business environment. Revenue for the
quarter was $374 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.29 billion
was up 12% over last year. Within our 3 reported business segments, our Application revenues were
$168 million, up 12% versus the same period last year. The quarterly increase in revenue was driven by
increased term license sales, including an unusually high number of large multiyear license renewals.

Full year revenues for Applications were $602 million, roughly flat with last year. Applications bookings
were up 42% over the same quarter last year and up 6% for the full year. In our Decision Management
Software segment, Q4 revenues were $53 million, up 36% over the same period last year. Full year DMS
revenues were $164 million, up 22% from fiscal '19. The revenue increases for both the quarter and the
year were due to increased license sales as well as increased SaaS subscription revenue.

Q4 DMS bookings were $99 million, up 62% from the previous year. For the full year, DMS bookings of
$199 million were up 27% over last year. Finally, our Scores segment revenues were $153 million, up 32%
from the same period last year. The B2B part of the business was up 27% over the same period, driven by
high volumes in mortgage originations and a onetime true-up of past royalties.

B2C revenues were up 45% from the same period last year, both myFICO.com and partner revenues grew
significantly. For the full year, Scores revenues were $529 million, up 25% from last year. This quarter,
74% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 18% and the
remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific.

Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 71%
of total revenues. Consulting and implementation services revenues were 13% of total quarterly revenues
and license revenues were 16% of the total.

SaaS software revenues, not including related professional services revenues for the full year of fiscal
2019 were $237 million, up 11% from fiscal 2019. We had record total bookings in Q4 of $235 million, up
46% from the previous year. These bookings generated $34 million of current period revenues, which is a
15% yield.

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Full year bookings of $537 million represent an 11% increase from last year. SaaS bookings were $221
million for the year, up 18% from 2019. As you may recall, our total bookings lagged in Q2 and Q3
of this year due to disruptions from the pandemic. But the strong finish put us in line with our annual
expectations.

Our operating expenses totaled $289 million this quarter, including $42 million of restructuring and
impairment charges. Excluding those onetime charges, expenses were $247 million compared to $231
million in the prior quarter, up $16 million due to increased expenses associated with additional revenue
and incentive expenses.

Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 41% for the quarter and 34% for
the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 400 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP
net income this quarter, which again included onetime charges, was $59 million, up 8% from Q4 in fiscal
2019. Our non-GAAP net income was $97 million for the quarter, up 59% from the same quarter last year.

For the full year, GAAP net income was $236 million, including $45 million of restructuring and impairment
charges and $50 million in reduced tax expense from onetime excess tax benefits recognized upon the
settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million, up 28% from
the prior year.

Our effective tax rate for the full year was 8%, including the $50 million of reduced tax expense from
excess tax benefits. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%,
compared with 28% in FY '20.

That expected recurring tax rate is before an estimated excess tax benefit of approximately $20 million in
FY 2021. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 20% in fiscal '21. Free cash flow for
the quarter was $135 million compared to $90 million in the same period last year, an increase of 51%.
For the full year, free cash flow was $343 million, up 45% from last year's $236 million.

Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $157 million in cash. This is up $32
million from last quarter due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by $25 million of share
repurchases in Q4.

Our total debt now stands at $845 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. Turning to return
of capital. We bought back 60,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $123 per share. In
fiscal 2020, we repurchased a total of 675,000 shares at an average price of $348 per share for a total of
$235 million.

At the end of September, we had about $225 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization,
and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. Finally, as Will mentioned, we
have recently shifted the sales of our on-premise software away from the sale of separate license and
maintenance components to subscriptions that include both the rights to use the software and the ongoing
maintenance.

As a result, at the beginning of FY '21, we adjusted our revenue recognition assumptions to be consistent
with industry standards for software subscription sales. This change will result in less upfront revenue
recognized in the year we signed subscription contracts and more revenue from those contracts
recognized ratably during their term. This will likely result in a material decline of our software license
revenues in fiscal '21 as a greater percentage of the total expected revenue to be received from newly
signed on-premise subscription sales and renewals of existing term licenses are spread over the term of
the deal. This will not have an impact on our cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software
license sales over the term of each subscription contract.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY '21.

Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm proud of our team in what we were able to accomplish
in fiscal '20. I'm excited about our prospects for 2021 and beyond. Clearly, there's uncertainty, but we're
confident that our future is bright. We can't pin down exact expectations, but we've proven our business is
remarkably resilient, and we're well positioned for the future.

We'll continue to innovate, fine-tune and improve our business model with an eye toward improving
margins and delivering on our potential, and we look forward to keeping you all informed as we progress.
Now let's turn to Q&A.

Steven P. Weber
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer
This concludes our remarks. Eric, if you could please open the lines for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just on the software business, clearly, a solid end to the year to you. You characterized it as a backlog that
kind of paused because of a pandemic. But I was hoping you could give us just a little bit more color on
how the clients are viewing the next few quarters ahead, I guess, is the fact that you ended strong just to
try and get back to normal? Or is there some shift in where you're signing these deals?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Hi Manav, I think that -- I wouldn't say things are back to normal, but I would also say that with respect
to the software that banks buy from us, things didn't change that much. Remember, we have a very long
sales cycle, 270 days on average.

And so a lot of what we've booked in 2020 was pipeline built even earlier. Now we're now in the process of
building pipeline for 2021. We have some pipeline built. We have more to build. And it's a little hard to say
how do all turn out. But I would say that our customers are -- they have the same needs for the software
that they had before the pandemic.

If anything, there is increased appetite because the pandemic has gotten everyone focused on digital
transformation. And our software, obviously, plays really well for that. So I anticipate continued interest. I
don't think we're just working off a backlog.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then if I may, just on the Scores side. First, can you just quantify how much that true-up
was that you talked about? And then secondly, just going into next calendar year, I guess, how should we
think about the pricing initiatives that you've been doing in the last few years, like should we be expecting
another one?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

We can't disclose the amount of the true-up, that's health confidential. But as you know, these things
happen every several years, we wind up doing a true-up of the sort. With respect to the pricing actions in
Scores, we took some actions.

But as in years past, we don't really know exactly how it will feather in. We don't know exactly what the
volumes will be. And so it's a little hard to predict. I would say not a lot more nor a lot less than years
past, is probably a way to think about it. But it's -- we have uncertainty. We always -- we wind up getting
the activity and arrears from the bureaus, and that's just the way it is.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And if I can just squeeze in one more. You're selling the cyber score business to ISS. I guess I don't
know if you've ever sold or pruned your portfolio before. So I was just curious if something -- is there a
fresh look? Is there a lot more that maybe we can see coming?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Yes. Good question, Manav. We've undertaken a pretty massive strategic look at our business over the
last 6, 7 months. We hired in a former McKinsey Director, Tab Bowers, to help us. And we've been really
focused on what is strategic and what is not. And so we're -- the things that look promising, but they
really are not central to our mission for building a decisioning platform are definitely being moved to the
periphery and cyber risk score is an example when that was sold.

We're proud of it. It was good technology, but our success in the decisioning platform business doesn't
turn on whether we're successful in cyber risk score.

So at some level, it was a distraction for us. Are there other things like that? We're in a state of constant
evaluation, and we hope to find some things that are less strategic and free up resources for more
strategic.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.

Kyle David Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Just wanted to touch a little bit on the SG&A trajectory. I know you guys took some restructuring kind of
rationalized headcount in real estate. How should we think about kind of the expense trends over the next,
like, coming year, given that it seems like some of these efficiencies could be permanent, but I'm not sure
whether you guys are going to reinvest part of that in some higher growth areas such as DMS.

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll give you some quantitative thoughts and then maybe will can provide qualitative. A big part of the
reduction in the expense run rate in the second half of the year was T&E. You can see from the additional
slides we provide as a part of this call that our -- going into the pandemic, T&E run rate was about $30
million to $35 million a year.

I think it was something like $100,000 in Q4. So that's not going to persist, but it's probably going to be
less than $30 million to $35 million. So even if we do have a vaccine, we get back to normal. So that's 1
moving piece.

We've also taken actions to reduce our geographic footprint and to a minor extent, reduce headcount in
nonstrategic areas.

That real estate savings will accrue over the years. And so that will be a one-way benefit that isn't going
to change. But with respect to some of the headcount reductions, we actually did that so that we could
reinvest, if not all of that money into headcount augmentation in areas related to the software platform to
pursue our strategic ambitions there. So we expect overall expenses for the business -- probably, again,
with the pandemic so much is uncertain, but we expect flat to single-digit growth in expenses as the year
goes on.

Maybe we'll do better than that if perversely, we can't travel for the full year. Hopefully, we can, and we
expect -- we have some money to spend in that category. But hopefully, that at least gives you some
color.

Kyle David Peterson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes, that's helpful. And then I guess just more of a housekeeping item, particularly on some of these
longer-term license sales that you guys recognized this quarter. Was that more on the application side?
Just trying to think about how we should incorporate that in our model moving forward?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Yes. You can -- if you look at the segment breakout in the 10-K, you can figure it out, you have to do a
little quarterly subtraction math because we don't show the quarter-over-quarter comparison.

In as friendly way as we might. But the license growth was really driven by renewals. We had a healthy
new business license sales quarter as well as we would expect in the fourth quarter, particularly given
some of the delayed purchases that flowed over from Q2, Q3. But if you look at our $62.5 million of
license bookings for the quarter, which is up -- of that, $21 million or so is renewals.

That renewals in excess of renewals we had in the year ago quarter. So -- and just for better or worse,
they're lumpy, we have to recognize a lot of it upfront. And so it was both increase in new business sales,
which was up sort of mid- to high-teens from year-over-year, but most of the increase but not all was just
by this lumpiness of renewals, it happened to be a whopper renewal quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Mueler with Baird

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. I wanted to ask on B2C scores, kind of a really, really good quarter. On the myFICO side, recognize
you have a strong brand and recognized that direct is the part of the market that's been performing well
lately. But anything that you've changed for myFICO, either in terms of go-to-market or product or just
any other changes that are driving that exceptionally strong result?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

It's -- I would say it's more on the market side than on our side. But we're constantly innovating over
there. We're constantly pushing the -- trying to push the value that the consumer gets in that offering.
Our strategy around myFICO is to be kind of best-in-class credit monitoring for consumers. And at the
same time, we mostly go-to-market through partners like Experian.

And so myFICO is at some level, a laboratory for us, a place to test out ideas, to test out value proposition
changes. And so we're always doing that. There's -- that's not like a new thing this year. We constantly
do that. I think that the biggest thing responsible for the lift is the -- is consumer demand. I mean the
consumer is really interested in tracking his or credit score.

Jeffrey P. Meuler
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Okay. And then, Mike, just on these accounting changes. I just want to make sure that, I guess, a
couple of clarifying questions, but there's no change to the timing of expense recognition would be one
question.

And then, I guess, is -- are you viewing bookings as kind of the best way to track the performance of the
business throughout 2021. And I think that's unaffected? Or is there some other kind of metric or some
way that you're going to be adjusting revenue to give us a like-for-like impact or something to track the
performance of the business as we progress through '21?

Michael I. McLaughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks for those 2 questions. The first one definitely merits some additional detail, I think, for everyone
listening to the call. So the change really is to get in line with industry standard for how subscription
software is recognized. We had been recognized revenue for on-premise term license sales essentially in
the way that you would recognize a perpetual license sale, where you had a onetime license upfront and
then 20% maintenance every year. We were treating the total contract value of term license in sort of the
same way. That led to about between 80% and 85% of the total contract value for a multiyear deal being

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

recognized in the year you sign it -- when you sign it. And only 17% -- 15% to 20% recognized ratably in
years 2 and 3.

With this change, again, which is what the vast majority of subscription software companies already do,
we're shifting that revenue recognition to better reflect the fact that the value of the ongoing support and
maintenance for the on-prem software in a term license as opposed to a pressure license situation, is
higher than what we had been recognizing before.

That nets out to about a 30% reduction in the percent of TCV, total contract value, recognized in year 1
versus years 2, 3 and in some cases years 4 and 5. So when you think about the revenue side, and I know
you asked about the expense side as well. We had $128 million of license revenue in our software business
in fiscal '20. Going forward, we would recognize about 30% less of that in the first year, and 30% will
then be recognized as recurring revenue, in the remaining years of the contract. So it's all about revenue
recognition for accounting purposes. It doesn't change when we build a customer, how much we build
them or what total revenue we'll recognize over the term of the contract. So hopefully, that's clear. And
you can do your own math on how much of a headwind that will be for revenue, but it will be a headwind
in fiscal '21, for sure. And we want to make sure everybody knows that.

With respect to expenses, these are on-prem license sales. So there aren't that much -- there isn't that
much expense associated with it. Our margins on our on-prem business are consistent with what others
earn 90-plus percent. So the -- but it will change revenue recognition a little bit to the extent that we
recognize more revenue ratably, we match expense with revenue recognition. But it's -- that's not going to
be a material impact relative to the revenue impact.

And then you're talking -- you asked about booking, a separate question. Yes, for now, that's the best
indicator to measure our current period performance in generating new revenue. It's not a perfect metric,
as you know, it's on a TCV basis, so term length matters.

But we're sticking with that metric for now. As we move more to a subscription and SaaS business, annual
recurring revenue and its derivatives becomes more important to us. And we do expect to be able to
expose to you guys at some point during this fiscal year, those kind of metrics for FICO, but we're not
ready to do that again.

Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Just a quick follow-up on pricing. Could you guys give us a sense -- I think sometimes you've given us
a sense of which part of scoring you sort of dug into and were tweaking the pricing on. Could you -- any
insight there that you could share with us for this new round of price tweaks?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. To the extent we're willing to share that information. It's less to do with the type of scores, and it's
more to do with the size of the customer. So we're into a more kind of a tiered pricing philosophy. And so
I would say that the price increases were spread across the Scores portfolio with a view to the size of the
customer buying the Scores.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

And I'm assuming that the smaller customers may have been getting a pretty good deal for a long time,
and maybe we're tweaking that based on just volumes?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes, absolutely. And I would say they're still getting a good deal, but not as good a deal.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

In terms of bank buying behavior, you touched on this a couple of times. I know your sales cycles are
long. And so when things exactly come out of the pipe and get booked, I know it takes a while. But as
you're having conversations with folks, I know you mentioned digitization is really important. But as you
think about Falcon, Strategy Director, debt collector, sort of those key apps, any sort of detail on the
conversations there that stick out that might be useful to know?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Well, what's interesting is, historically, we have provided, for lack of a better term, point solutions for
our bank customers, originations and customer management and fraud and collections and recovery,
as you note. What we're seeing, what we saw last year and what we're starting to see more of is more
engagement with the IT department, more engagement with the CIO and a better understanding on the
part of our customers of just the benefits and value of the platform.

So while they may still be buying a solution like originations, now they appreciate that it's originations
on top of the platform. And there's all kinds of potential that goes with that, where for small incremental
investments, they get large incremental value out. I think that's the biggest change we're seeing in
the conversation is customers increasingly understanding our strategy around platform and looking to
leverage it.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then any update on the sort of the master plan of moving everything over to sort of the core
underlying DMS platform on the app side. Can you just -- sometimes you sort of say we expect Falcon to
be completely done in a year or whatever. Can you just give us the update on that to remind us where we
are in terms of finish line?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I guess the honest answer is our work is never done. Okay. So it's not like we will just say, okay,
"Now it's all on the platform, we can all go home." It's a process. And so we've moved some core fraud
applications from Falcon onto the platform. Our compliance is now available in Falcon X on the platform.

We're also looking at I would say, more flexible and modular approaches to providing fraud solutions on
the platform. So there'll be some of that. Some of our applications aren't going to make it to the platform.
So for example, collections and recovery has a massive code base, 8 million lines of code, and it just
doesn't make sense to rewrite it onto the platform. And so that will remain a distinct code base.

So when are we done? I guess another way to think of it is, when are we going to feel that the platform is
sufficiently mature that customers who want to have multiple use cases on the platform have that work.
I think we're almost there now. We're pretty much there now. This Latin American Bank deal that we just
referenced, it started out with a conversation about a handful of use cases that they would want to do

on the platform and that we're up to '19, and I think there's more in the future. So it's a different way of
thinking about the value that we provide.

Our next question comes from the line of Jake Williams with Wells Fargo.

Jake Leonard Williams
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Can you help us understand how much of an impact mortgage volumes were in this quarter in the B2B
Scores segment?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

So like last quarter, Experian -- sorry, Equifax and TransUnion reported before us last week and end of
the prior week. And you can see how they broke out mortgage volumes. We don't break out mortgage
volumes, but we can say that what we saw was consistent with what they told the street they saw. I think
one showed up 45% in terms of volume, and the other was closer to 60%, although it's a little unclear
whether that was for the quarter itself or sort of run rate, including the last -- including the month of
October, but our volumes were consistent with what you could see from them.

Jake Leonard Williams
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then in terms of the average bookings term, stretched out to 55 months this quarter from 37.
Was that impacted by the decision to change the revenue recognition on-prem? Or is this an independent
evolution?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

No. It's independent. It's not related to that. What it's related to is, we had some deals that are really
long-term deals, much longer than typical than has been our usual. And I would say that, that trend could
continue. We'll have to see how things play out.

But I think when banks adopt our platform and standardize on the platform, it's not surprising that they
would want to lock us in for a long period of time with an understanding what it's going to cost. So I think
there's going to be pressure for longer-term deals on us.

Jake Leonard Williams
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So can we assume that the clients are the ones who are coming to you asking for this long-term deal
because of stability and return, there's probably some price escalator built in each year?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We try to be smart about it. And yes, it's definitely a client request.

Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.

Following up on an earlier question about just the DMS platform. Maybe can you provide a little bit more
color on the investments you're making in terms of the -- you're redirecting some of this $36 million in

savings that you have towards additional headcount for the build-out of that platform. Is that something
you're just trying to accelerate the build-out of certain functionality? I was just hoping for maybe a better
understanding of where the road map is in terms of I think, ultimately, what we're trying to get to, I
guess, in terms of the function that we currently have versus where it will be a fairly equivalent product to
your on-prem in your old architecture cloud stuff.

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

So part of the strategy with the platform is to have a lot of interoperability around the data, right? So
we have a data orchestration layer. We can take data from lots of different places and bring it into the
platform. And then we have a wide range of analytics that can be applied to that data. And then we have
various solutions that sit on top of that platform -- of that decision platform to meet specific needs.

Our strategy with the platform has been to -- as we migrate our applications to the platform, the way we
think about it is we say, what are the components of this solution that we ought to modularize? What are
the micro services that are involved here? And let's break them up and make them available to users of
the platform so they can be mixed and matched in different ways.

And so that's really kind of the heavy listing that's going on.

We've also put a lot of energy into a thing called FICO studio, which is kind of a front-end fourth
generation language kind of a programming environment where you can drag and drop a lot of things to
build workflows based on the decisioning analytics in the platform. So there's a lot of work that's gone into
that. But the way we think about it is not let's port an application to the platform. It's more break up the
application into its component parts, understand how they can be micro services that could be consumed
independently and then bring those to the platform, so that they can be reassembled on the platform for
all different kinds of purposes.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Fair enough. And then in terms of just a bigger picture question. Obviously, with a potential change in the
administration, is there any other considerations that enter into picture here where maybe could there be,
let's say, an acceleration in the upgrade cycle for, let's say, from FICO 8 to FICO 9 or even to FICO 10 or
something for that matter that might drive based on the differences in the policy administrations?

William J. Lansing
President, CEO & Director

I'm not sure that we'll have a change in the rate and pace of adoption of new scores under -- based on
the administration. I do think that all lenders are really focused right now on how do they get the most
value out of their scoring algorithms, and they're increasingly using things like FICO Resiliency Index to
complement the traditional FICO score to make these decisions.

I wouldn't say that's driven by the administration. I think that's more driven by the innovation coming out
of our Scores team. But there's a tremendous appetite on the side of the banks to get the full benefit out
of it. And so we're pretty focused on that.

Surinder Singh Thind
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And then just a quick one on -- or maybe on the B2C revenues, obviously, really strong growth there.

I'm assuming the run rate is what is a sustainable run rate at this point. Is there any color you can provide
on how -- is this -- there's just this initial phase where we should expect this big ramp-up that we've seen
with the kind of the dislocation in the markets? Or how should we think about the growth rate forward
should it -- customers stay on a little bit or how long do customers stay on the platform?

President, CEO & Director

I think we've definitely enjoyed a spike because of the environment. There's no question that consumers
are more focused than ever on their score and whether it's going up or down, I get letters in the mail all
the time. And that's definitely the environment driving that. So I'd say the 62% spike I referenced earlier,
that is -- that's driven by the environment. In terms of lifetime value, how long they stay on. We have not
-- it's too early to tell, but we haven't seen changes.

So what we're seeing so far is kind of the same attrition over time that we've historically had. So we'll see.
What we have noticed is that there's an inexorable trend to consumers being ever more focused on their
credit score. I mean this has been every year, year in, year out, it's become bigger and more important to
them. And so I'm not sure that it's like a spike up and then a ramp down. I mean it may just be part of a
trend.
