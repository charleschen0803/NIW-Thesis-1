Thanks, Steve
For the March quarter, Seagate's addressable HDD market was relatively in line with our forecast
We continue to drive our HDD product sales towards our higher capacity products across our portfolio, benefiting both our revenue and margin results year-over-year
HDD enterprise revenues were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 20% year-over-year and representing 36% of our total consolidated revenue
Within this, nearline revenues were up 9% year-over-year and represented 24% of our total consolidated revenue
Hyperscale nearline revenues were up strong double digits, and our 8 terabyte nearline product continues to be our leading revenue SKU. Our HDD client high-capacity growth opportunities include consumer, surveillance, DDR and NAS markets
Revenues from these markets were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting exabyte growth of 41% year-over-year and representing approximately 28% of the total consolidated revenue
Average capacity per drive across these markets was over 2 terabyte per drive, up 22% year-over-year
In our mature mission critical and PC client markets, revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, and exabytes declined slightly
PC client revenues continue to represent approximately 25% of the total consolidated revenue
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $550 million on a GAAP basis and $443 million on a non-GAAP basis
Total consolidated expenses were slightly higher than forecast, primarily due to non-executive variable compensation
Capital expenditures were $95 million for the March quarter for maintenance capital and manufacturing footprint redeployment supporting the continued ramp of new HDD products in our portfolio that utilize new tooling and equipment
Our capital expenditures and maintenance capital requirement levels are expected to be less than 5% of our revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year
And through our manufacturing consolidation activities, Seagate is and will continue to operate at, or very near, full capacity
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $426 million and free cash flow was $331 million
These results include approximately $150 million in cash payments related to restructuring charges and biannual non-executive variable compensation
Excluding these items, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $576 million
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter in $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 297 million ordinary shares outstanding
Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5. In January, we successfully completed a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment-grade financing with a weighted average interest rate of less than 5%
This funding will serve as a pre-financing of our 2018 and our 2021 notes and other corporate purposes
We have called our 2021 7% senior notes with a payment of $158 million scheduled for May 1. Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million and will be similar in the June quarter
Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities and reflective of our investment-grade framework, given our staggered maturities and low interest rate
Our March quarter results continue to reflect strong execution of our business model objectives and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our Storage portfolio
Combined with our Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, we view that approximately 80% of our Storage product revenue opportunities in calendar 2017 and beyond have growth potential
While we are still in the process of executing a number of our cost actions in our manufacturing sites and at the corporate level, we believe the combination of these cost alignment activities and the competitiveness of our HDD product portfolio will continue to benefit our product gross margins and overall profitability of our business over the course of calendar year 2017 and beyond
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve
