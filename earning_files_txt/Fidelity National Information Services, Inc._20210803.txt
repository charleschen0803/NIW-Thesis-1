Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the FIS Second Quarter 2021 Earnings
Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator
Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Nate Rozof, Head of Corporate Finance
and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Nathan A. Rozof
Executive Vice President of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the FIS Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference
call. This call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all
available on our website at fisglobal.com.

Gary Norcross, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss our performance and review our strategy to continue
accelerating revenue growth and maximizing shareholder value. Woody Woodall, our Chief Financial
Officer, will then review our strong financial results and provide updated forward guidance. Bruce
Lowthers, President of FIS, will also be joining the call for the Q&A portion.

Turning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are
subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The
company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor
language.

Also, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted
EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These are important
financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP.
Reconciliations of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information are presented in our
earnings release.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary who will begin his remarks on Slide 5.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results exceeded
expectations across the board and demonstrate the continued success of our pivot to growth strategy that
we laid out before the pandemic.

Revenue of $3.5 billion was the highest quarterly revenue in our company's history. Revenue increased
more than $500 million or 17% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS grew 40%. Sales results, which were
the strongest in our company's history, are being driven because our solutions remain in high demand,
enabling businesses of all sizes to advance the way the world pays, banks and invest.

This demand, combined with our organizational focus on delivering broader value to our clients, was also
reflected in a very strong cross sales, driving our largest revenue synergy quarter-to-date, increasing our
run rate by 50% or $150 million sequentially to $450 million. This sales execution, in turn, drove a $1.5
billion increase to our backlog, which is now greater than $22 billion. Our strong execution is driving us to
raise both our 2021 guidance and increase our year-end revenue synergy target to $700 million.

In addition, as we consider client demand across our portfolio of solutions, we are extending our midterm
outlook of 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024. I want to thank and recognize our colleagues around
the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. They are our most important asset and play a vital

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

role in advancing the commerce and financial technology that keeps thousands of clients up and running
and the economy moving today.

Turning to Slide 6, I'd like to highlight a few recent wins that demonstrate FIS' differentiation. Clients are
increasingly demanding access to new capabilities that are outside of their traditional solution set so they
can innovate in new and interesting ways. We have the unique ability to serve our clients horizontally
across the breadth of financial technology with integrated cloud-native platforms.

Further, our open APIs are resilient and easy to use as clients expand their relationships with FIS.
Our sales success with the Modern Banking Platform demonstrates its client demand as they look to
differentiate with cloud-native capabilities. This quarter, we delivered the largest release since the start of
MBP, including expansion of commercial deposit functionality as well as new enhancements to our lending
module.

As we have previously discussed, one of the exciting opportunities with the current MBP clients is an
ongoing ability to cross-sell additional functionality and modules. This quarter, we had our first cross-
sell to American Express who added a new checking account feature to their deployment. This is a great
example of our ability to land large, complex clients and the value of our modern platform. As we continue
to add functionality, clients continue adopting these new capabilities to grow their businesses, which drives
additional revenue for FIS and expands these important relationships.

Fifth Third Bank provides a second key example of the ways we grow our strategic relationships. Fifth
Third is a long-time client who is on a journey to reengineer its technical infrastructure with a focus on
resiliency and scale. This quarter, they expanded their relationship with us to replace their legacy in-house
core with the Modern Banking Platform and their legacy wealth management system with FIS Unity.

Unity is our leading-edge global wealth management system and will provide rich data and insights for
Fifth Third's customers throughout their wealth journey. It incorporates automated cash management,
multi-currency and other advanced wealth management functionality in a flexible design that is fully
integrated with FIS Trust Accounting.

T. Rowe Price provides yet another example of an industry leader looking to FIS to help them modernize
their 401(k) retirement offering with advanced technology. This landmark win will lay the foundation for
other large asset managers to utilize FIS as they look to leverage our scale and expertise in the retirement
space.

In addition, PayPal and Chevron both expanded their relationships with us to begin utilizing our cloud-
enabled payment switching capabilities. And finally, WesBanco joined our merchant referral network in
order to upgrade to our leading acquiring technology. As we continue to innovate, our integrated cloud-
native ecosystem creates a powerful network effect that empowers our clients to transform and grow.

On Slide 7, I want to highlight another important win. I'm pleased to announce that Walmart will begin
utilizing our innovative loyalty network, Premium Payback, for both in-store and e-commerce transactions.
The value proposition for this solution is exceptional, driving positive outcomes for our merchants, issuers
and the end consumer.

In other retail locations where we have rolled out the solution, we are seeing consumers accept Premium
Payback's offer to pay with points approximately 50% of the time when they are prompted. Both our
merchant and our issuer clients are increasingly eager to participate. And we expect adoption to continue
to ramp as we implement the solution with all the innovative clients shown on the slide as well as more
in the future. Premium Payback is a clear example of the network effect that we've created by integrating
issuing and acquiring.

Turning to Slide 8. We invest heavily in new solutions and capabilities with the belief that the market
is changing in how it consumes technology and looking for cloud-native architectures. The revenue
contribution from solutions developed over the past 3 years continues to grow as a percent of our total
revenue mix, up from less than 1% in 2019 to over 4% in 2021. This rapid growth is driven by our ability
to cross-sell new solutions into our existing client base as well as adjacent verticals which increases our
total addressable market.

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

New solutions also contribute meaningfully to our total revenue growth with contribution increasing from
less than 1% in 2019 to more than 2% in total revenue growth in 2021. Looking forward, we expect new
solutions to drive up to 3 points of incremental growth each year, supporting our outlook for 7% to 9%
revenue growth through the midterm. At this point, a strong commitment to innovation is embedded in
our culture and will continue to drive growth for years to come.

I will conclude my prepared remarks with Slide 9 before handing the call to Woody. We are at the forefront
of the industry with the broadest collection of cloud-native solutions available. We remain uniquely
positioned to serve domestic and multinational merchants who are looking for a single trusted provider for
all of their acquiring needs. We solve our clients' most complex problems ranging from global acquiring for
their e-commerce business to treasury and cash management with our innovative Quantum software.

Further, on the right side of the page, we show our unique bundle of cloud-native solutions for financial
institutions that demonstrate our ability to innovate at scale. Lastly, we highlight a few examples of
innovative solutions that create compelling value propositions for both merchant and FIS clients in the
center of the page.

Clearly, the investments we've made, enduring the pandemic and driving differentiated outcomes for our
clients and for us, and we continue to make these investments today in order to power future growth. It's
why we are confident in our forward momentum to drive strong 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024.

I'll now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results and forward guidance. Woody?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today.

Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations. On
a consolidated basis, revenue increased 17% to $3.5 billion, driven by outperformance in each of our
operating segments. Organic revenue growth was 16%. We haven't had any material M&A activity over
the past year, so the difference between reported and organic revenue growth this quarter is primarily due
to the impact of foreign exchange rate.

Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 460 basis points to 44%, reflecting strong operating leverage and
synergy contribution. As a result, adjusted EPS increased 40% year-over-year to $1.61 per share. As
Gary mentioned, we had exceptional cross-selling quarter, driven primarily by Premium Payback, issuer
processing, merchant referral and data analytics win. Given our progress and strength of our pipeline, we
are increasing our revenue synergy target for 2021 by $100 million to exit the year at $700 million on an
annualized run rate basis.

Our achievement of cost synergies also continues to be successful, running further ahead of schedule than
we anticipated when we announced the deal. We have more than doubled our initial cost synergy target of
$400 million and are on track to exit the year with approximately $900 million in total annualized savings,
including approximately $500 million in operating expense synergies.

Turning to balance sheet and cash flow, we repurchased 2.7 million shares worth approximately $400
million during the quarter, bringing share repurchase to a total of $800 million year-to-date at an average
price of $145 a share. Our leverage ratio declined to 3.3x, keeping us on track to end the year below 3x
leverage. Lastly, we generated free cash flow in excess of $1 billion this quarter, which is the most in our
company's history and reflects the highly cash-generative nature of our business.

Turning to Slide 12 to review our segments. Banking revenue growth accelerated to 8% due in part to
strong issuer processing growth of 17% and a 30% increase in Modern Banking Platform revenue. As Gary
noted, we had another 2 MBP wins this quarter as well as an add-on sale, and MBP revenue will continue
to accelerate as more clients go live. We currently expect MBP revenue growth of nearly 50% for the full
year 2021 and for this to further accelerate into 2022.

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

The Banking segment's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 410 basis points to 46%. These strong results
were driven primarily by ramping revenues from our recent large bank wins as well as continued recurring
revenue growth. Capital Markets revenue growth also accelerated to 6% this quarter, reflecting strong
recurring revenue growth and sales execution. Capital Markets adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 100
basis points to 46%.

Lastly, for Merchant, revenue growth rebounded sharply to 45% in the second quarter, which includes
10 points of yield benefit, and the segment generated its largest new sales quarter in the history of the
business. Merchant's revenue acceleration included 31% revenue growth in e-commerce. Our eCom
revenue growth is particularly impressive in light of in-store reopening as lockdown orders eased and
cross-border travel remains affected, making it an avenue for significant future growth.

Growth was also broad-based, spanning both domestic and international, and discretionary verticals
like restaurant are accelerating sharply. Merchant's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 910 basis points
to 50%, primarily reflecting its high contribution margin and synergy benefits. As we begin to lap the
pandemic with growth spanning online and in-store, SMB and enterprise across North America and
international, our results clearly demonstrate the strength of our competitive position. In addition, growth
includes both rebounding volume and yields as we expected.

Relative to 2019, we've seen no increase in attrition, and we'll continue to grow our client count. We
have not taken our foot off the gas, investing through the pandemic, completing now -- ramping Access
Worldpay, expanding our sales force, entering new countries and adding multiple strategic ISV and bank
partners, including expanding integrated payments to Europe. The business clearly has strong underlying
momentum. We expect to further drive acceleration relative to 2019 in the second half of the year.

Turning to guidance on Slide 13. Based on our strong results and favorable outlook, I'm pleased to raise
full year guidance. We now anticipate revenue of $13.9 billion to $14 billion for the full year 2021, which
represents an increase of $250 million over our prior guidance. This guidance assumes full year revenue
growth for Banking in the upper single digits and Capital Markets in the mid-single digits. We now expect
Merchant growth to approach 20% this year, ahead of our initial expectations.

Relative to 2019, Merchant revenue growth accelerated 9% in the second quarter or 12% in the U.S. We
expect Merchant revenue growth to continue to accelerate into the mid to high teens in the second half of
the year as international revenue and discretionary verticals like travel and airlines continue to rebound
versus 2019. We're also raising our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $6.125 billion to $6.2
billion and increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $6.45 to $6.60 per share.

For the third quarter, we expect 9% to 10% revenue growth and to generate revenue of $3.49 billion to
$3.52 billion. As a result of the high contribution margins in our business, we expect adjusted EBITDA
margin to expand by more than 50 basis points sequentially or about 200 basis points year-over-year to
approximately 44% for the third quarter. This will result in adjusted EPS of $1.66 to $1.69 per share. I'm
excited about our results and raised guidance. Beyond our guidance for the year, we expect to generate
7% to 9% revenue growth in the midterm through 2024, as Gary discussed.

I have confidence in this outlook for a number of reasons. First, our sharp second quarter revenue growth
acceleration and our ability to significantly increase revenue guidance show strong execution and the
underlying strength in the business. Second, strong new sales and cross-selling activity drove our backlog
above $22 billion and increased our revenue synergy attainment by 50% in just 1 quarter, which will
continue to drive future growth into 2022 and beyond. And finally, the investments we've made and
continue to make are driving strength across our segments and accelerating our revenue growth profile.
Our cloud-native ecosystem of solutions is highly differentiated, helping us to grow in new and emerging
verticals.
I would like to thank our colleagues for their efforts to drive FIS forward and to empower our clients.
Operator, would you please open the line for questions?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Looking at the 2021 guidance, it's increasing by $153 million over the second quarter beat and EPS by
$0.01 over the second quarter beat, implying about 50 basis points less of EBITDA margin expansion. So
can you talk to your margin expectations for the second half and what might be driving higher OpEx?

And then just as a follow-up, Gary, you've laid out very extensive product innovation, both in the Merchant
and Banking Solutions business. I'm curious, how do you respond to Square's acquisition of Afterpay
yesterday with their intent really to move more into the national account space in merchant acquiring?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

I'll touch on the margin profile, Gary, if that's all right?

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Sure, absolutely.

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes, we continue to drive margin expansion, including more than 200 basis points this year, and we expect
50 to 100 basis points longer term. In the quarter, the guidance, we significantly increased the revenue
based on the strength of our new sales and our competitive position. I'm excited about driving another
$250 million, up to 10% to 11%.

On the margin itself, we are increasing incentive accruals to reward our people for their very strong
performance compared to our operating plan, which we're outpacing significantly this year. And as we
continue to focus on some of the successive quarters of very big wins, it does create some near-term
margin pressure as we ramp these contracts. Margins from these new wins will expand as revenue hits full
run rate as we get those clients up and running, David.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. As far as the Square acquisition of Afterpay, when we think of buy now, pay later, David, it's just
another payment type for us. It's another unsecured lending mechanism. Obviously, we're enabling buy
now, pay later in our largest merchants. We're doing it through partnerships because we don't want
to take the credit exposure risk that comes with that. But frankly, we feel very comfortable not only
competing in the national markets, but as we push down market into the SMB verticals, you're starting to
see we're coming off record growth over the last 2 quarters in our merchant sales as we've now retooled
our sales force and increased that and started pushing down market.

But clearly, we've got the most extensive capabilities in the merchant acquiring space today, and you're
seeing that growth across our large enterprise, our large nationals, our multinationals, and that's playing
to our strength in our sales results. But at this point in time, our view on buy now, pay later is just that,
another payment type that we're going to accept. We'll make sure that we have that available to our
customers if they want to offer that, but we're going to minimize taking the credit exposure.

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.

Jason Alan Kupferberg
BofA Securities, Research Division

My first question was just to actually build on David's and get your thoughts just in terms of attractiveness
of transformational type M&A given what's going on in the environment, just how you're thinking about
that for FIS specifically.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Look, Jason, we've always had transformational M&A in our strategy. We continue to look for
opportunities that bring us a new capability or a new service in existing market or adjacencies. The team
is doing an excellent job of delivering new product out of our engineering group. And you're seeing the
results of that contribute to our accelerated revenue growth.

Will we do additional M&A in the future? Absolutely. Things are expensive. Right now, we continue to see
the intrinsic value of our stock is undervalued. And so obviously, we're very focused on share buybacks
and deploying free cash flow in that manner, but we're not opposed to doing M&A activity if it fits our
strategy and fills in a gap in our overall capability.

Right now, we feel very good about our competitive position of product set. You're seeing it come through
in our sales results. I mean second quarter was the largest sales record for us across the board. Across
Capital Markets, across Banking, across Merchant, we hit record numbers for that from the sales in the
existing quarter. So we feel really good about the strength of our position and where we're -- the demand
for our products and services in market, but M&A will always continue to be something that we evaluate
and look at. If it makes sense, then we'll execute.

Jason Alan Kupferberg
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And just a follow-up for Woody on the margin front. It looks like there's an implied step-up of
maybe about 300 bps of margin expansion from Q3 to Q4. So can you just talk about the visibility on that
acceleration? What's driving it? Is it just the top line or the OpEx cadence? I know you were calling out
some incentive comp and some contract ramp-up costs, but is there just some cadence considerations
there between the 2 quarters? And I just wanted to get the sense of the visibility there on the Q4 ramp.

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes, there's certainly some ramp in the fourth quarter as we sign clients and get them up and running and
drive the revenue at that point in time. I think there's also just some cadence of the quarterly spread, and
the consensus is a little off between Q3 and Q4, no more than that, to be honest with you, Jason. We feel
very good about the outlook for the remainder of the year across all 3 segments, are continuing to drive
the growth profile and continue to fuel that accelerating revenue growth. So we feel really good there.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just want to get a sense on the backlog being up 8%. It sounds like the pipeline, Gary, is really strong.
Just -- and I heard the revenue synergies are, I think, up $100 million. Are those all related? Just trying
to better understand sort of if you can unpack or decompose the new sales, the backlog from the revenue
synergies. Where is it coming from? Is it driven by the synergies? Or is it really from the return on
investments on some of the product modernization efforts that you've taken on?

Gary Adam Norcross

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, it's a great question. Yes, it's a great question. It's really coming across the board. I mean you're
seeing us succeed our cross-sales and revenue synergies with the Worldpay integration. We're real pleased
on that, with the acceleration, and Woody highlighted a number of those products. But we're also seeing
great adoption of our new product and innovation capabilities. Modern Banking Platform is up over 50%.
You're seeing our issuer business with PaymentsOne up substantially. You'd look at what we've done in
Capital Markets about end-to-end solutioning across the front, middle and back office, and you're seeing
accelerated revenue growth there in Capital Markets as well.

So when we look at sales holistically, as I said, all 3 segments were up, had a record quarter from a sales
perspective. But it really was -- it was new logo sales actually gaining share and taking share. It was
cross-sells to existing customers of new product capabilities we're delivering to market or cross-selling
existing products and then revenue synergies across the Worldpay integration efforts. So couldn't be more
pleased with our sales channel.

And as I point out, you guys have seen this, we've now had multiple years of record sales and seeing that
demand continue to accelerate. So that's what has us so bullish on the future of FIS. And you've seen the
growth rates across all 3 segments consistently trend up as well. And now that the global pandemic, we're
starting to see opening, obviously, in the U.S., Europe is lagging a little bit there and Asia, but as you're
starting to see reopening, you'll just continue to see more accelerated growth going forward.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Perfect. So it's broad-based. Just a real quick follow-up, just the visibility into getting -- I know Banking
accelerated a little bit sequentially in the second quarter. It's sounds like it's going to accelerate more in
the second half. Do you need to sell more business to get there? Or is it really just timely conversions of
the backlog? And then really quickly, if you don't mind, the Fifth Third modernization effort to the modern
piece on FIS Unity, is there a change in annual contract value by moving from legacy to a modern solution
there from an FIS perspective? Sorry for the 2 extra questions.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, there's 2 points. Yes, no, it's a great question. Two points on the banking backlog in Q3. We don't
need a lot of sales to hit that Q3 number. It really is backlog. You saw the backlog increased 8% which is,
I think, on memory, one of the largest increases we've seen of that backlog. It's certainly the largest the
backlog has been. So the team is doing a great job of delivering new capabilities. We've now got 6 of our
clients on MBP in production. So you get a ramp effect of that going into that and also the new products
and capabilities we're selling. But it's really just in delivery of that backlog into Q3. And so that just goes
to show as that backlog builds, you're going to see a consistent ramp across that Banking segment.

When you look at Fifth Third, it's a substantial increase for us in contract value and the relationship
because keep in mind, a number of those capabilities, they're going off in-house systems to our systems
in a fully outsourced manner. And so for us, we see a significant step function as we deliver those
capabilities and then start recognizing that revenue through the processing channel. So it's a great
relationship we've had with Fifth Third for a very long time. So we're excited about expanding this and
excited about helping them re-architect their technology stack for the future.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

Darrin David Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

I just want to hone in for a minute on the Merchant side. You talked about record sales growth, I think,
the second quarter in a row. If you could just give us some of the dynamics of where the -- what kind of
business you're seeing from that front.

And then the confidence level in the second half of '21 being mid to high teens, above '19 levels, I'm
assuming that's in part of these mix, travel and certain geographies. If you can just give us a little
more color and understanding of the drivers there. What -- how much pressure was the second quarter
impacted by whether it's volume or revenue from those aspects? And then what could that mean for the
second half?

Bruce F. Lowthers
President

Yes. I had a hard time hearing the beginning of the question, but I think it was around sales and the...

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes, the success.

Bruce F. Lowthers
President

So what I would just say, first of all, is the team has just done a phenomenal job kind of embracing that in
the playbook of sales and what we were trying to accomplish. So whether it be the Banking organization,
the Merchant organization or Capital Markets, all 3 had really strong sales outings for Q2. The Merchant
team, in particular, has really kind of turned that engine around and really creating a lot of momentum.
Whether it be in the SMB space, as you've heard, or the enterprise space and our e-commerce space,
we've really had strong sales right across the board, continued expansion with our FI partners, continued
expansion in our channels, the SMB space, as I said. So really just a strong outing. Our pipeline is really
robust as we come into Q3. So we feel very good about where we're heading in the back half of the year.
And we would expect to continue from the great success that we had in the first half of the year.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Yes. Darrin, I'll add, too, we've seen yield dynamics were positive as we see volumes and reopenings
happen. The international business is reopening, but lagging the U.S. in terms of timing. So we think
that's a tailwind in the back half of the year. Discretionary verticals are also improving as we've seen in
both restaurant being up very sharply, both domestically and internationally. We really haven't seen any
attrition. And our actual merchant count is up year-over-year and about 5% up sequentially during the
second quarter.

So you add the sales, you add the merchant count, you add the outlook in terms of the yield benefit and
the volume expectations, we feel really good about the back half of the year being in that mid to high
teens. Further, we saw July improving compared to June, and it's in line with our 3Q guidance that we just
put out and generally in line with the networks as well. And then the international business is trending a
little higher than the U.S. in terms of volume improvement in July. So you add all those things together,
that's how we think about mid- to high-teens growth compared to 2019, both Q3 and Q4.

Darrin David Peller
Wolfe Research, LLC

All right. Very quick follow-up is just your extension into 2024, your confidence in the 7% to 9%. What
really changed about that? Was it just the big pipeline? Was it bookings in banking or maybe broad-based?

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Well, I think the nature of our business, Darrin, we've talked about this a lot, it's such -- it's so highly
reoccurring in nature. And when you look at the backlog, you look at the acceleration of $22 billion, you
look at the pipeline, you look at record signings in Q2 following record signings in Q1, followed by a record
year last year in sales, you look at the delivery channel of what we're onboarding, you look at the trend

and the recovery going on, I mean, we feel very confident in extending to 7% to 9% in growth and look at
accelerating further beyond that.

You've got capital markets that we used to look as a low single-digit grower. You're seeing that move into,
what, 6% organic growth this quarter. You're now in the mid-single digits. You're going to see Capital
Markets, given its sales success, trend towards the upper single digits. Banking is getting well established
in the upper single digits, given its backlog and given its sales success. And then you look at the strength
of the Merchant portfolio and the recovery, I mean we had strong recovery across every one of the
verticals we participate in. Our sales were strong across all those verticals as well. The yield dynamics
have recovered from where we -- just as we said they would, back to kind of 2019 levels.

So all of that comes together. We just got a lot of confidence that the engine is running very well and the
growth aspects, just booking the historical sales to date will continue to propel us into that 7% to 9%
range through 2024. Now obviously, we look at the pipeline as well. We've got a lot of confidence in what
we're seeing shaping up in Q3, Q4 and into next year. So all of those things are just driving us to extend
the long term -- the midterm outlook.

Bruce F. Lowthers
President

Yes. If I could just add and underscore the really -- bringing new product to market and the innovation
that we're driving there has really helped us accelerate, and we expect that to continue. We've really
created a wonderful process with the organization. We're seeing a lot of success. Whether it be Access
Worldpay, whether it be MBP, PaymentsOne, we've got a whole litany of new products that have come and
are really making a material impact for us. And we expect that to continue as we're driving forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And I guess my first question, when we think of some of the yield dynamics that are starting to really play
out now, when we look into next year, is this year still depressed from the standpoint the mix of revenue
is still coming less this year from SMBs than normal and volumes are probably a little bit, especially in Q1
this year, were also a little bit non-normal? Do we think yields into next year provide another catalyst --
positive catalyst as SMBs recover as part of a mix -- as part of the mix?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think it's beyond just the SMBs, too. Some of the verticals that had richer margin profiles like travel
and airlines, we anticipate to continue to recover into 2022 as we continue to go forward. So yes, we think
it will still be a bit of a tailwind at least through the first half of 2022. Over time, we anticipate yields to be
a net positive for us, but obviously, not quite as big as we've seen this year with the dynamics that we've
seen around the pandemic. But you're right, both a combination of the sharp increase in some of the more
discretionary verticals that continue to reopen both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. as well as some of the
other verticals like travel and air will certainly be some benefit to yield next year.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got you. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, it seems like the market -- the banking market is really good,
and you're taking share on top. I guess, is there a way to almost disaggregate the 2? Like do you feel
like the market is better than usual and maybe sustainable for several years? And then how much of the
growth do you think is just kind of above market gain share type stuff?

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

I think we positioned -- Dave, it's a great question. I think we've positioned in banking and, frankly,
capital markets for the last several quarters. We're really at an inflection point for the industry. A lot of
those technologies are legacy -- what people call legacy-based technologies. They're at -- they're in very
old architectures. They're trying to respond and becoming more nimble and take cost out and getting
more digitally native. And that's where that plays to the strength of FIS. We started this transformation
almost now 4 years ago. Bruce mentioned a number of the products we're bringing online, Modern
Banking Platform, Digital One, PaymentsOne, the list goes on and on and on in banking, and you're seeing
a high demand for that.

So we're taking share from traditional in-house where large -- very large financial institutions actually
built their own systems or leveraged some type of off-shoring capability to build their own through some
augmentation or just running a very old piece of technology that's been in existence for decades. And so
they're now reaching in and taking advantage of some of our modern architectures and doing it through
our cloud because of all the investments that we've made in cloud-based technologies. And all of that
really is timing us very well for this inflection point. So we feel very confident that we're just getting
started on what I've described as a journey over the next decade, and FIS is exceptionally well positioned
to take advantage of that globally and will.

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Dave, I'll just follow on, too. We've highlighted over several years the investments that we've been
making. We anticipated those investments to turn into sales, and they did. We've told you those sales will
turn into revenue acceleration, and they are. And now we're even highlighting the contribution of that new
solutions and that new innovation revenue as part of the overall contribution mix and the revenue growth
profile to try to give you some confidence in our ability to sustain these higher growth levels based on the
investments and the innovation work that we're doing.

Bruce F. Lowthers
President

Yes. And I would just add, from a customer perspective, the thing that I hear back from our customers is
really twofold. They're very focused on kind of modernization in the banking space, and they're extremely
focused on new product offerings, how do we get more product offerings out to them. And I think you've
heard us talk over the last year about these 2 themes and actually longer. As Gary has talked about,
our modernization efforts started years ago, and we're positioned very well to kind of meet what our
customers are asking for, and we feel very good about that.

Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen.

Georgios Mihalos
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats. I think in normal times, this will be considered a good quarter, so congrats.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Thank you.

Georgios Mihalos
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

But I just wanted to ask -- good to see that, that longer-term outlook through '24, the 7% to 9%. I think
that's something that's being underappreciated by the market. Gary, I'm just curious, the derivation of
that 7% to 9%, has that changed at all at the segment level, meaning are there segments or businesses
where you feel you're doing better than sort of post-pandemic and that will continue and others that may

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

have been perhaps somewhat impacted in the post-pandemic world? Just curious how you're thinking
about that.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

It's a great question, George. I would say that our Merchant businesses, we're seeing good acceleration
there. The team has done a very nice job of expanding the sales team and the technology stack and
starting to push in the markets that Worldpay traditionally didn't play in. We're starting to see a nice
acceleration there. So we expect that segment in the coming years to be a consistent double-digit
performer on organic growth, which used to perform below that historically.

When you look at the Banking business, I would say the Banking business is operating the way we thought
it would. We've had good line of sight in that for a number of years of our investments. And we're seeing
that actually kind of hit the numbers exactly where we projected and realizing that we were expecting
some big ramps and big ramps through the sales initiatives. So we made a lot of investments there, and
that business has been fundamentally transformed. And so we're seeing the results that we had hoped for.

Capital Markets actually has improved over what we thought. We traditionally thought when we bought
Capital Markets, there was a strong position to expand there. We saw the ability to bring solutions to
market, not just products, move beyond the licensing business into an outsourcing business. And we
thought if we did that, we were conservative and thought mid- to low-single-digits organic growth there.
And what we've seen is that business has transformed actually faster. And the demand for our front,
middle and back-office solutioning, the new investments we made around RegTech and some of the higher
growth areas of that market have really paid big dividends. And so now we're seeing that move much
closer to the Banking business. So I think that's going to continue to accelerate for us. And that's why we
think the 7% to 9% is very -- we're very confident in executing in that range for the coming years and
look forward to continuing execution.

Georgios Mihalos
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's great color. Just sort of a quick follow-up. I know you got the buy now, pay later question,
but maybe I'll ask this one a little bit more broadly. Some of your competitors, your partners, they have
acquiring models where they obviously own proprietary APMs. I'm curious, is that something that could
potentially be of interest to you guys? Or do you sort of want to sort of stay in the Switzerland approach in
terms of how you're servicing clients?

Bruce F. Lowthers
President

Yes. I think from our perspective, we've participated in APM for a long time, and we'll continue to do that.
And more of a Switzerland type of -- we're going to take the right payment types in the right markets and
continue to partner. One of the things we talk a lot about is being kind of a world-class collaborator with
others. The bedrock of that for us has really been Code Connect and Worldpay connect as we have built
out these experiential APIs, and it's allowing us to bring product to market faster and meet the needs of
our customers. So I think for us, we're going to continue to go down that path, building out solutions that
I think other people won't be able to do in the time frames that we'll be able to bring them.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.

Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on another strong quarter here. I guess I want to go back to the margins and completely
understand investing in people, client ramp products, those are all good things. The question is, what
drives the lower end of your margin range? What drives the upper end of the margin range? And while

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

sticking on margins, is there any one-timers like maybe nonrecurring things like higher crypto things that
might have driven this particular quarter here?

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes, a couple of things. We are seeing higher incentive accruals, as we've talked about, driving that up
to reward our people for outperforming our operating plan. You've got that as one component. I would
tell you, incremental incentive accruals, Ashwin, are about $0.04 in our full year outlook of incremental
there. We also are seeing continued wins in these large deals that are taking some time to get up and
running. T. Rowe Price as well as Fifth Third are 2 of the largest transactions that we've ever won in terms
of size of contract. And they'll have some short-term pressure on margin as we continue to ramp up those
customers and get their revenues moving.

This flows all the way from a revenue driving at full run rate, showing the operating leverage in the
business. But you have to ramp that revenue up and you have a little bit of a headwind in terms of the
margin rate as we continue to see accelerated revenue on the top line. So those are really kind of the
components I've tried to highlight in there as what's driving the margin. From a one-timer perspective, not
a lot of one-timers in here, pretty clean in terms of the quarter, and feel good about what we've executed
on.

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

We do feel good, Ashwin, long term. Even in the out years, we've talked about 7% to 9%. But we've
got consistent margin expansion built into our models in the out years as well. I mean the contribution
margins of these new sales come on, as we've talked about in the past, they come on in very high
margins. Bruce has talked about our ramp and investment in new products. And obviously, we continue
to do that to continue to bring new product capability to continue to increase our overall growth rates.
But we feel very good about where our margins are today. We'll have really strong margin expansion for
the full year this year. Also highlights just how well we're doing with operating synergies and all of the
revenue growth. So that will continue as we push into the out years with margin expansion in the midterm
guidance we gave each year.

Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's great. No, I definitely agree with the way you guys are executing. There was some speculation
recently with regards to a portion of your Capital Markets business potentially from being divested or that
you are perhaps open to divesting it. Any updates? And so broadly, when you look at your current book --
current businesses, does it all still fit together in your eyes? Or any strategic new point you might want to
share?

Gary Adam Norcross
Executive Chairman & CEO

Ashwin, we don't comment on rumors, as you know. But what I would tell you is we've always had a
strong viewpoint as part of our strategy is to continue to look at our portfolio and make sure that our
portfolio of assets make sense for our long-term strategy. We signaled recently that we pushed some
things into our other segment as nonstrategic. Would we divest things in the portfolio, don't fit our overall
strategy? We've done that historically when you think about what we did years ago with our health care
business and our public sector business. But typically, as I said, we signaled, as we move things into the
other category, things that we are considering as nonstrategic, but we really don't comment on rumors on
divestitures or acquisitions for that matter.

Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it, got it, got it. Congratulations again. This is pretty solid.

Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho.

Dan Dolev
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Two questions. The first one is, and then I have a follow-up, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on sort
of the puts and takes of what happened in the second quarter in terms of just the growth rates between
SMB, I know you called out e-commerce, but just if you think about those subsegments? And then I have
a follow-up.

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I can comment on that. Overall merchant growth in the second quarter was 45%. If you break that
down between enterprise and SMB, SMB grew 50% for us in the second quarter. And the enterprise
business grew a little over 40%, combining to that, that 45%. If you remember, global eCom sits in the
enterprise business growing at 31%. So that's a little bit of the breakdown between them.

We did see some sharp increases in verticals. Both North America restaurant and international restaurant
were up about 70% around reopening. So as we anticipated, we expected the volumes to come back, and
they did. And then we got the yield benefit through those -- some of those higher-yielding verticals. As the
reopenings happened, it rebounded. So that's a little color around SMB and enterprise there, Dan.

Bruce F. Lowthers
President

I would just add that the team is just performing at a very high level. The execution with the Merchant
team, bringing product to market execution, driving sales, the Banking team and the Capital Markets
team, all of them just really kind of embracing what we're trying to do and executing at a very, very high
level.

Dan Dolev
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes, that sounds really strong. And then my follow-up is more macro. There's a lot of anxiety here in the
U.S. that we're kind of a few months behind the U.K. I know you have like a huge U.K. exposure. Can you
give us some understanding of how things are trending there given the decision that they made to reopen
everything? I mean, are the -- are you seeing things sort of reopen as it peaks and comes down? Like it's
just I think there's a lot of anxiety here that we're going to see the same thing in a couple of months given
the surge in the delta.

James W. Woodall
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. As we highlighted, we continue to see July results improving. That is improving better or trending
better internationally than in the U.S. right now. You certainly saw some benefit in the back half of
July with some of the U.K. reopening as we've seen the volumes increasing there. Certainly continue
to monitor everything as things go along, but feel good about what we're seeing right now in terms of
volumes outside the U.S. continuing to improve. They are lagging the U.S. a little bit, as we've talked

international areas to continue to drive into the back half of the year.
