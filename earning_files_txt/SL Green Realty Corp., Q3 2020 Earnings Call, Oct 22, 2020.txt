SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Thank you, everybody, for joining us, and welcome to the SL Green Realty Corp.'s Third Quarter 2020
Earnings Results Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded.

At this time, the company would like to remind listeners that during the call, management may make
forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from any forward-looking statements that
management may make today. Additional information regarding the risks, uncertainties and other factors
that could cause such differences appear in the MD&A section of the company's latest Form 10-K and
other subsequent reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Also during today's conference call, the company may discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined
by Regulation G under the Securities Act. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each
non-GAAP financial measure discussed, and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP
financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on both the company's
website at www.slgreen.com by selecting the press release regarding the company's third quarter 2020
earnings and in our supplemental information filed with our current report on Form 8-K, relating to our
third quarter 2020 earnings.

Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty
Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit your questions to 2
per person. Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined here by Andrew
Mathias, Matt DiLiberto; Ed Piccinich, Steve Durels, David Schonbraun, Andy Levine; and Maggie Hui as
well as several others. And we're all together here socially distant and looking forward to a good earnings
call today.

So yesterday, we released our earnings for the third quarter of 2020. And for the most part, the results
and achievements met or exceeded our expectations and are aligned with our corporate goals, which
were, of course, altered back in March and April at the outset of the pandemic, which you might recall
from our Q1 call.

Our earnings for the quarter were in line as we track towards the higher end of our revised guidance
range. So we're pleased with that. And our office and overall collections remain relatively strong.
Surprisingly strong at 97% and 92%, respectively, something that we're quite proud of as it relates to
the rigorous nature of our underwriting and our diligence and the -- just the superior quality of our tenant
base this far into the pandemic.

Our occupancy dipped, but finished the quarter above 94%. We are aggressively managing our operating
expenses in order to maximize our bottom line throughout generating of savings in excess of $30
million of operating expenses year-to-date realized without sacrificing service to our tenants. We leased
approximately 187,000 square feet of Manhattan office spaces, slightly less than we had hoped for but the
pipeline looks very good at 825,000 square feet of leases and term sheets pending are in negotiations. So
that pipeline number has actually increased.

While we do not expect to certainly close all of that activity by year-end, we are on track to lease
1.2 million square feet for the full year, a lofty goal we reset for ourselves in April at a time of great
uncertainty when there was not really good visibility as to what we could achieve. And as we sit here
now, we feel that it's attainable and working hard to make those numbers for the year. Through additional
focused reductions and savings, we also managed to reduce total G&A by $10 million to approximately

$90 million projected for the full year. And we, along with others, are benefiting from significant interest
savings due to the Fed's easy monetary policy.

While generally pleased with these results, it doesn't nearly tell the entire story of what we have achieved
as a company in the past 7 months, how we achieved it or what our current metrics are for measuring
success in the pandemic economy. The city's economy is essentially on pause right now as much focus is
on the containment of COVID-19 and the traditional financial measures that we and our industry look to,
we don't think they really apply during these highly irregular times. The focus has changed. And at this
moment in time, our focus has shifted, and we are driven more than ever to help promote this great city
work with our hardest hit tenants to sustain their businesses, create a safe and secure environment within
our portfolio for building occupants and their employees, invest in the future of New York City, and lead by
example.

And I'm happy to say that we feel there's no real estate company in our market that exceeds our
efforts in these areas. We are batting 1,000 in these areas. It all stems from SL Green's extraordinary
employees who are 100% work-from-office, not from home. We accomplished this safely, smartly and
with enthusiasm for doing something positive for our families, our company and our economy. We wish
and encourage other companies to do the same for the sake of their employees, many of whom feel
disconnected and frustrated by the isolation of working from home for the sake of local businesses who
want to work and want to call their employees back to business and who rely on the 1.5 million office-
using workforce in New York City their sales.

These businesses need everyone back in the city and back in their office spaces to make a go of it, and
for the sake of the city, which has provided so much to so many. So lots of reasons beyond -- that go far
beyond the productivity of work from office, but that really relate to the whole ecosystem of an economy,
which is why we have such a stout belief in work-from-office and school from classrooms and all the rest.

So on June 15, SL Green employees returned to work at 420 Lexington Avenue and in our satellite office
building offices, and we are working over time with a sense of purpose and urgency that has expressed
itself in many ways over these past months.

First and foremost, we quickly established new operating procedures and protocols for our buildings
combined with infrastructure upgrades, which make the building safe and secure for the employees that
have returned to work and the employees that work in the buildings, the building employees themselves.
And the feedback, so far, has been nothing short of excellent. Next, we work to secure our several
construction sites so that construction could continue uninterrupted, on schedule and on budget. We then
went to work with our most impacted retail tenants, and in many cases, worked out arrangements to
provide deferrals and concessions to help them through this difficult period.

Turning now to our office tenants. We recognize this interim period as a moment of uncertainty. So we
injected flexibility into the conversation with short-term lease extensions and increased free rent, both
of which was met with a real appreciation for those tenants that wanted to take advantage of those
parameters, particularly those who had near-term lease expiration. So a lot of our activity recently, as
Steve can sort of expand upon, has been in the renewal area, much more so than in prior years.

Next, SL Green Chef Daniel Boulud established Food1st, a nonprofit foundation created to provide free,
nutritious meals to frontline medical personnel, first responders and the many food-insecure New Yorkers.
On the same token, the organization has helped the hard-hit restaurant industry reopened some of their
kitchens and reemployed staff who have been laid off due to closures. To date, we are proud to have
prepared and delivered 400,000 free meals to over 100 locations throughout the city, the logistics of which
are managed entirely by SL Green.

On the business front, SL Green continues to invest in New York in many ways that we believe create
long-term value for the company and there was no greater example of this than the completion of One
Vanderbilt on September 14, 3 months ahead of schedule and $100 million below budget. 50 invited
guests, industry leaders, civic advocates and elected officials attended the ribbon-cutting that we held in
the newly-completed Vanderbilt Plaza as we celebrated this great and permanent achievement for New
York, including $220 million of public realm and transportation improvements.

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Just 2 weeks later, we were a top 185 Broadway for the on-time topping out of the project, which is
the first new residential construction in downtown being built under the affordable New York housing
program. And just blocks away from 185, SL Green commenced demolition of 126 Nassau Street for $220
million fully committed development project for Pace University, inclusive of dorms, classrooms and other
school and educational facilities. It's a major project for Pace and for their expansion. And this project
is completely capitalized with joint venture equity and construction financing that we closed during this
quarter.

Finally, there were a number of other sale and DPE disposition transactions concluded during the quarter.
The proceeds of which fortified our $1 billion liquidity plan that we set forth back in April, reduced
corporate indebtedness and enabled us to continue our share repurchase program.

So you see that we've been quite busy these past 3 months over the summer and accomplished quite a lot
with much more to come in Q4. Yes, it's true that economic activity in New York City slowed considerably
in the third quarter. Leasing activity was sharply reduced, vacancies rose and investment sales declined.
However, this is entirely to be expected from a city on pause and a city, whose #1 priority right now is
containment of COVID to such a degree that the city is one of the safest cities by most COVID measures in
any city in the country.

Further digging into the data, there are encouraging signs. Wall Street profits for the first half of the year
were spectacular. Nearly $28 billion, which is much higher than an average full year of earnings for these
banks. After a seismic 820,000 private sector jobs were shed in April, nearly 1/3 of them have since been
restored, a rate of recovery that is actually faster than we saw after the tech crash in early 2000 and the
great financial recession in '07, '08, albeit recovering from a lower starting point. The office using job
recovery is somewhat slower, but there has been sequential office using job growth in July and August and
September, and we hope to see that trend continue in October and throughout the year.

Notwithstanding that the city projected a loss of $9 billion of tax revenues, its $90 billion budget is
balanced for fiscal year ending 2021. And the city is now working on balancing the budget for fiscal
year '22, helped by reduced interest costs, higher-than-expected profits from the financial sector that
I mentioned earlier, retail spending that is actually holding up fairly well and further aided by the prior
stimulus benefit that many of New York residents and businesses received and hopes for future stimulus in
the near term.

So while we read the analyst reports last night that we're fairly neutral on our results and somewhat
pessimistic on New York City fundamentals, we have an entirely different view on how we measure the
quarter. We think it was an extraordinary quarter. We think we accomplished much for the company,
for our employees, for our tenants and the local businesses and the city's economy, of which we are
inextricable part. And we take great pride in what we've done and what is yet to come.

So this city, we all know, has been written off many times before and has always rebounded stronger
than ever. New York City is our home, we are fully committed here, and we believe strongly in its future.
The city's future, in many ways, is so SL Green's future and we have conviction that its underlying
fundamentals, spirit, diversity and everything great about this city. We'll continue to set New York apart as
the greatest city in the world.

So before we open it up for questions, which we'll do momentarily, I wanted to talk about one further
piece of good news, which is our investor conference slated for December 7 of this year. After much
deliberation and input from the investor community, we have decided true to form that our 2020 investor
conference will be live and in person at the now iconic One Vanderbilt Avenue auditorium on our new
amenity floor, which will be sort of unveiled in December and open in January to tenants, and we will have
all COVID precautions in place. So at this event, we will obviously look forward to presenting our business
plan for 2021 and our outlook for the future of New York City.
With that, operator, I'd like to turn it over for questions.

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Marc, I was wondering if you can give us the breakdown of your 825,000 square feet of leasing in the
pipeline as far as how much is renewal versus new or expansion space? And how much of that is in your
new developments?

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

This is Steve Durels. I'll respond to that. So in the pipeline, we've got 825,000 square feet, 51% of
that are new transactions and 49% are renewal transactions. Heavily weighted by legal, financial and
publishing industries and heavily centered around the Grand Central area, where we see the most leasing
activity right now. In particular, a lot of activity at One Vanderbilt. And then our buildings at 45 Lexington,
750 Third, Graybar and 800 Third Avenue.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

As a follow-up, I'd like to ask about dispositions and how much you're looking to sell. And in particular,
the media reports on 410 Tenth Avenue, just given it's your foothold in the Hudson Yards area, it leads to
great tenants, why sell that asset at this time?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Well, Andrew will talk about why and everything else going on. But we have a -- we've been selling fairly
robustly our mature and noncore assets since 2015. 2020 is no different. We've been able to accomplish
much year-to-date. We have several assets in the market now that we can chat about, but this is all part
of a long-term plan. Volumes may be altered slightly by COVID, but really nothing new here. Everything
we talked about in December about recycling of capital, monetizing of gains and paying down of debt and
repurchasing of shares, which we're well along for this year, maybe not quite $500 million, but closing in
on it. So some of the specifics, Andrew, what we're doing?

Andrew W. Mathias
President & Director

Well, I mean, particularly with 410, it's an asset that is drawing a lot of interest given where interest rates
sit today, and the extraordinary job Steve and his team did leasing that asset up. So it -- we don't have to
sell it. We're evaluating bids. We actually closed the financing on the deal over the summer, $600 million
financing, which funds all the capital improvements, which was part of our business plan for the year. But
we did get approached with some interesting offers and decided to test the market. So 410 is out there in
the market, along with several other assets. Haven't made a decision yet about whether to pull the trigger
on a sale or not.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Is there an update as to how much in total are you looking to sell?

Andrew W. Mathias

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

No. I mean, I think the guidance for the year is unchanged. And if we were opportunistic sellers, if we like
prices for assets we have in the market, we'll transact. But otherwise, there's no pressure to sell.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And I appreciate all the color on SL Green's efforts to keep the city moving here. Can you just
talk about -- you had talked about your efforts to market the city and promote the city and bring people
back. Can you talk about the feedback from tenants, both large tenants and small tenants, just in terms
of -- are they changing their attitude at all on how soon they want to bring people back? And then as you
think about the leasing among both small and large tenants, what are they saying lately about their space
needs and maybe shrinking or expanding?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Well, let's handle the first part of the question, which is what are these business leaders? What are they
saying in terms of wanting to get their people back to work. I would say added the 900 tenants plus in
the portfolio and the hundreds we've spoken with directly at the senior levels, almost to a person, they all
express a desire to have their employee base back in the city. They recognize the benefits, they recognize
the need to do it. And I think they recognize an urgency to it. Surprisingly, what I read into it mostly is
a concern over liability, which surprises us because there's actually very little in the way of employer or
landlord liability, if you do things right, and right means following all the DOL, DOH, OSHA guidelines for
what you need to do in your space, which we and many other -- most other landlords in New York City are
doing.

So the buildings themselves are among the safest places. We know -- many people in our company
are using mass transit. Andrew and I and others use mass transit. The mass transit is clean, efficient,
much more so than it was previously because they're taking extra steps for sanitization overnight and
throughout the day. Everyone's wearing masks or most people are adhering to mask, by and large.

So there's -- it's hard to put a finger on it. It's always sort of right around the corner. We're hearing in
August, it will be right after Labor Day. And Labor Day, it's October. So it feels imminent, and yet the
numbers don't bear that out. We're still, as a portfolio, right around the city average of probably 15% to
20% back to work, back to office work, and that's out of 1.5 million office workers. So that means 80%,
85% of the people that work in office buildings are still home. And that's frustrating. And I think they will
be back.

The reality, whether they're back next month, December, Jan, Feb, March, that doesn't, in our estimation,
affect any of the long-term fundamentals of the things we look at. I mean the sooner, the better. And I
would expect by December to see those numbers be somewhere between 20% and 30%, up from 15%
to 20% today. And then hopefully, it just grows from there. But the important things are -- that we're
heading in the right direction and a lot of the stats I gave you earlier indicate we are heading in the right
direction, both from a COVID containment and job recovery and more and more people coming in and MTA
ridership, and that can go on and on, which I won't now, maybe I will in December. But the point is -- the
narrative is people want to be back.

Now how that's going to dovetail with some allowance, there's going to be allowance for larger spaces.
Everybody, as they're returning, is kind of de-densifying. And how long that de-densification trend will
last, don't know. But for now, that is. And how that will be mitigated by some work-from-home policy,
Steve, what do you think?

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Well, I don't think anybody out there has a clear picture as to exactly where the trend is going to head.
When lockdown started, there was a lot of conversation and speculation about how work from home is
going to sort of overtake all of our lives. And as time has gone by, that conversation has done 180-degree
shift, where almost every day, there's a constant barrage of discussions with tenants who continually
express frustration about being home, the isolation of being home, the inefficiency of working from home.

So whether or not it's a -- they're staying at home because of all the press with COVID and the short-term
fears, I think when they look past that, you're hard-pressed to find a business manager out there that
really has locked down a point of view as to how they're going to operate their space and manage their
employees going forward other than the fact that they all recognize they want to be back in the office.
So in the short term, it will mean changes to the furniture environment, some of the design elements of
spaces.

But I think looking past that, and if you talk a little bit more about the pipeline of deals that we're working
on with tenants, they're looking past the immediate disruption of COVID and saying, okay, we recognize,
there's now a lot of it in the tunnel, whether that's 6 or 12 months out, but they're starting to begin to
plan for their offices and how they're going to run their space. But I don't think they have a firm point of
view as to how much of that is work from home or how much of that is hoteling. It's just -- it's all over the
board right now.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then just a follow-up, small versus large tenants, are you seeing a change there or a difference
there just in terms of giving back more space or giving up leases or how they're thinking about their space
plans?

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

No. What you're seeing is it's in the second and third quarters of the year, there was a lot of renewal
activity. A lot of short-term renewal activity, anything from 1 year to 5 years. And I don't think that was
exclusive to large or small tenants. I guess you could argue that some of the very small tenants, and I'm
talking very, very small, a couple of thousand square feet. It was easy for those types of tenants to just
simply say, "I'll work from home." But our average size tenant in the portfolio is 25,000 square feet. And
things have started to decidedly shift.

In the second quarter, 77% of the transactions in our portfolio were renewals. In the third quarter, it was
56%. As we sit here today, 51% of my pipeline are new transactions. So clearly, we're -- the tides are
shifting where tenants are beginning to look past it, and they're now saying, "Let's talk about relocations,
and let's talk about longer-term planning," as opposed to what the thinking was earlier in the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis of Truist Securities.

Michael Robert Lewis
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. I wanted to ask for a little more color on 885 Third, which was a preferred equity investment. It
looks like the common now you don't ascribe any value to. It looks like there's also a large expiration right
around the corner. Maybe just your thoughts on keeping that building leased and the strategy there.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Well, I'll start off, maybe sort of follow in. We -- 885 is a great building, 53rd and Third, otherwise known
as Lipstick Building. It's very iconic, beautiful building that right now is going -- nothing to do with
COVID, but it was going through a transition because one of their larger tenants was rolling out, I think,
essentially now or over the course of the next few months.

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

Next year.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Next year is probably when they stop paying rent. So that building, from our standpoint, fits the category
of one that we will -- we have and will develop and will execute a full building repositioning and updating
and cleaning and COVID compliance of that building to position it as kind of the best or among the best
buildings on Third Avenue. Our basis is quite low. Our last dollar pref there is quite low. David, I want to
say around 6...

David Schonbraun
Chief Investment Officer

6-something a foot.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

6-something a foot, as we enter -- as we transition control to ourselves, we actually now have operating in
managerial control of the property. We'll be executing a redevelopment plan, which is -- I mean, it's really
modest, I call it redevelopment plan. But the building is a recent vintage, and it's in excellent shape. So
we'll go into it in more detail in December. But the goal is to invest an adequate amount of money to bring
it up to the standards of, as I said, best on Third and then have a leasing program that we will execute
over the next 2-plus years.

In fact, there's a lease-out on 2 floors already. So it's better laid plans. We have a 2-year lease-up plan,
but there is activity at the building right now, but that -- we still are committed to going in this direction.
And upon completion, I think you really got something that's kind of a world-class asset that would have
both domestic and a lot of foreign interest because it's just that -- it's that kind of icon building. David,
what do you want to add?

David Schonbraun
Chief Investment Officer

I think we're kind of taking over, given capitalization issues of the sponsor less the asset. The asset just
needs money to reposition, to a small redevelopment and re-lease and the sponsorship wasn't in the
position to do that. So we're stepping in. But the asset is iconic. As Marc said, there's lots of people in the
U.S. and internationally of interest. And in a couple of weeks, we've already had strong leasing demand
without even reintroducing the building to the market. So we're excited about what's on there for the next
year or so.

Michael Robert Lewis
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And for my second question, maybe give us a sense of how sublease space available in your
portfolio has changed. And even more broadly, what -- with the increase in sublease space available in the
city, what signal that's giving us? How much of a hurdle you think that is? What it all means?

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

Well, overall, in the market, the availability rate on sublease is 2.9% of the total availability. And between
the third and second quarters, sublease inventory as far as availability rate increased by 25%. We did
not see a similar increase of availability listings within our portfolio. In fact, since COVID, and I'm not
talking just since the last quarter, I'm talking about since the work-from-home mandate, so over the past
6 or 7 months. We've seen less than 200,000 square feet of sublease listings added within our 28 million
square foot portfolio. And I guess, on historical terms, we don't have any large blocks of space available

10

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

for sublease in our portfolio. It's a lot of more kind of 5,000 to 30,000 square foot type spaces. So I don't
really view it as competitive pressure.

And remember, even though there will be a lot of sublease, and I think there's more sublease inventory to
come on the broader market, it's always damaged goods. It's term constrained. The sublessors typically
are not funding work letters. They can't offer renewal and expansion options. The credit of the sub-
landlords is always a question mark. So there are going to be tenants out there to take advantage of that
marketplace. But there's always something more from a direct lease basis that we have to offer which is
why we always seem to do well irrespective of the sublease inventory.

Our next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore of Goldman Sachs.

Richard Wynn Skidmore
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Marc and Matt, can you just talk about how you're thinking about leverage in terms of debt to EBITDA.
Debt to EBITDA has gone north of 10x. If you annualize the third quarter, it's probably north of 12x. Can
you just talk about how you think about leverage and use of capital as you go forward between leverage
and share repurchase?

Matthew J. DiLiberto
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Rick, it's Matt. I'll hit the math first. I think if you're annualizing a quarter, you're going to come up
with a bad number. And of course, everybody does debt to EBITDA differently. And debt to EBITDA is,
of course, the most unreliable and least relevant leverage metric you can use in real estate, particularly
when you do a lot of construction. So we look at our leverage as still holding steady. We look at it on an
LTV basis and mid- to high 40s in a market that generally sees 70%. So 50-plus percent equity cushion is
where we feel comfortable. And we've been managing that very closely as we balance capital in between
debt repayment and share repurchases.

With the construction that we have and use debt to EBITDA, you're basically saying One Vanderbilt, One
Madison, 410 Tenth to 185 Broadway are all worth 0. And I don't think anybody in the call would actually
say that. So we look at leverage differently, and we feel we're comfortably protected.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Rick, I would just urge this. Consider what Matt says, I've been hearing we're over-leveraged for '21
years. And we're a company that's always got a large pipeline of active projects that we're going through
heavy redevelopment or ground-up development. And by its nature, we incur a lot of financing on those
projects. In the case of One Vanderbilt, something that's finished and yet are recognizing a little to no
income, and it skews those numbers.

So if you take the leverage associated with properties not in service out, our operating portfolio is widely
underleveraged. And then on an overall LTV basis, even including all the leverage on assets that are --
among the most, the irony is the most valuable assets in the portfolio are the ones that have the leverage
and aren't yet producing income. So right now, One Vanderbilt, soon to be One Madison, 410 Tenth, which
is fully leased, but we're not recognizing income yet. What else you got, 185 Broadway, which is going
to be, I think, one of the best rental buildings in downtown. But obviously, not yet leased up because we
don't have our TCO.

So you got to dig -- we don't have to, but we would suggest people dig way beyond debt to EBITDA and
really dig into property by property, loan-to-value, look at stabilized values, look at the quality of the
earnings. But we -- on an LTV basis, probably 45% or less, tons of interest coverage, a lot of capacity,
very little outstanding on our line of credit. And we think we're in a no near-term maturities, which I
actually think is more important than level of leverage is, is the balance of terming out your maturities.

Our next question comes from Peter Abramowitz of Jefferies.

Peter Dylan Abramowitz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes. I just wanted to ask about -- it looks like you have a couple of upcoming lease expirations with News
Corp at 1185, Sixth Avenue and then Fairchild Publications as well. So I just wanted to ask, with those
coming up, kind of how are those discussions going? Are they definitely renewing? And kind of how are
they considering are they considering changing their space needs based on the current environment?

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

No. The lease is at 750, Fairchild, which has been the largest tenant over there, they moved out of the
building years ago. 100% of that space was subleased to a variety of different tenants, probably, and I'm
going back in time, I'm going to guess 3 or 4 years ago. So there was never a chance -- they're part of
Condé Nast. So their whole operation moved down to the Trade Center a long time ago. We are in active
discussion with probably 25% to 30% of the subtenants that we think there's a good probability that we'll
be able to convert them over to a direct tenant basis.

And then was there a second tenant you asked about?

Peter Dylan Abramowitz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes. In News Corp.

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

In News Corp at 1185. No, they made the election probably 18 months ago that they were going to
consolidate into News Corp's headquarters. But that's a building -- the space that I'll get back from them,
it's upper floors, a building that we recently completed a significant capital program, redoing the lobby, the
entrance, the elevator cabs, corridors, bathrooms. So that building is very well positioned to be able to re-
tenant that space.

Peter Dylan Abramowitz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then from a high level, any other factors either from move-outs or from
incremental vacancy leasing to think about as we try to forecast your occupancy over the next 6 to 12
months?

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

Well, I don't think there's anything that's not already within our budget to date. I mean we've not been
hit with any big surprises. As we've said in the past, one of the silver linings of this whole experience is
that we've probably been able to have a fining shot to keep some of the subtenants and keep some of the
tenants, the direct lease tenants that were otherwise anticipated to be vacating, just through the natural
course of their business management.

So I can think of at least 6 or 7 tenants that we're probably going to end up keeping. The tenants have
decent size. Whether they're long-term or medium-term type tenancies, but clearly, it will preserve the
cash flow in some of these buildings that we were otherwise budgeting interruptions.

Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So just the first question is on the DPE book. One, clearly, congrats for being able to transact in the
current market. So I think it's a testament to the positions. But just to that point, you guys did take a little
bit of a haircut on the DPEs that were sold in the quarter. And then you had the write-off of your equity
position in the ground position at Lipstick as well. So I'm curious, there was no CECL impact. You guys
were clear that you didn't have to take any marks there.

How does it -- just for us because we're all getting new to CECL, how does it work as far as taking an
impact on the remaining positions? Do individual sales during a quarter not require you to reevaluate the
other positions? Or just how does it work as we're all sort of getting used to a CECL world?

Matthew J. DiLiberto
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Alex. So I just want to correct one thing you said. I think you said we took a mark somewhere on
885, taking back the equity position, which isn't the case. We did that this quarter, the mark we took. The
mark we took this quarter are only on assets sold. We sold 100 -- netted $122 million of proceeds, took $9
million of hit on those. Those had not been reserved previously, we took pricing mark on those to generate
the liquidity to put back into debt repayment and share repurchase on an accretive basis. We took 885 a
long time ago when we started evaluating that probably 12 months ago.

As to CECL, CECL is an ongoing analysis. We are required to look at the portfolio under CECL every
quarter. We were very conservative. You're looking at a whole bunch of inputs, a whole bunch of potential
outcomes and probabilities when you do that. You recall back in the first quarter, we took a significant
amount of marks. We were very conservative in looking out through COVID and the impact and erring
towards the side of conservatism. And when we evaluated the entirety of the retained portfolio, again, at
the end of the third quarter, there was no additional reserve required.

It's not impacted by the sales we do because, again, we're electing to sell things at a dollar price that
we feel is appropriate, so we can take those proceeds and go buy back stock or pay down debt. The
retained portfolio has looked at on a hold basis based on potential outcomes and no additional reserve was
necessary, and we'll look at it again at the end of the year.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Matt, that's helpful. And then, Marc, just going back, I think, to Jamie's question on the city and
COVID. There was that letter. And I'm guessing that you were part of it from a bunch of the city leaders to
the mayor's office about addressing concerns with the city's safety, trash removal, et cetera. And it seems
like a lot of -- just speaking to folks, it seems like a lot of the issues are people aren't necessarily worried
about the office per se, it's sort of getting to and from the office.

So in your dialogues or the best that you can say, how do you think that city hall is understanding it to
play case the letter that a lot of business leaders put out addressing those concerns, which, to your point,
is what seems to be the necessity to get people to feel comfortable coming back, commuting back in and
around the city?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Well, just a couple of points on that. One, there were 2 letters delivered. I think one from the real estate
industry, another from the partnership. And all the -- we work very closely with the city, with the state
on all of these kinds of decision mentioned, we were not signatory to the letter. But we have a very -- we
have a voice in that as others expressed. We may have different views as how to achieve it.

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

As it relates to mass transit, in particular, the notion out there that, "I want to come to work, but I don't
feel safe." From my -- this is a purely personal perspective I'm giving you now. It's not even necessarily a
company position or anything else, personal. I don't believe in that. I believe that if it's okay for me and
others and essential personnel and people who grind into the city, day in, day out and have been doing so
since March 1, mass transit is a viable alternative. I think there are people out there. I don't believe 85%
of the people not coming to work are not coming to work because they have concerns over mass transit.

I think that at its core, there's a lot of people who don't want to come back to work. Because I've given
the choice between, I can stay home in my room, get paid full and save an hour or 2 of commute a day,
there are some who will opt for that and maybe many. And it's just not something I believe in. So I think
that while the city has been and can do a lot more to make the mass transit safe and clean and hygienic
and I think the city and the state and the MTA, because really MTA working on that. I believe it's up to the
individuals to exit their homes, get into the city however, by whatever means possible and get to work.

People do it all day long. Our building employees, our construction workers, our employees at SL Green,
our executive team, I can go on and on. And like I said, we take cars, we take mass transit. And it just
depends on time of day, where you're going and what you're doing. And we're not a medical professional.
I'm not here to espouse the safety level of it. I can only give you anecdotally. I've been doing it since
March 1 along with many, many, many other people I know, and we've made it through fortunately and
safely, and we adhere to the protocols. And some -- COVID is very real.

But I'll just give you another example. Aside from mass transit, another thing I refrain we hear is well,
my kids' school is not in session. So we have to stay at home with them and proctor them for online
schooling, which is like a tragedy. So we implemented among our many incentives here at SL Green the
latest incentive, which kicked off about 2 or 3 weeks ago. It's something we're all very proud of. We were
fortunate enough to be able to take some unused space in this building that was built. And with very
minor modifications, we turned it into pods of classrooms.

And we went out and hired tutors from Ivy Tutors who are very good, qualified tutors that stay with small
groups of kids who are the children of our employees who have the choice of letting these kids sit at home
and literally, like forego in education for a lot of these kids because they're -- when you pull these kids,
they all say they're getting a horrible education at home and the participation rate is terrible. They come
here, we'll have on any given day, between 6 and 10 kids. We've got several tutors, the kids are entirely
engaged, they're online, they get extra help, they do some things during the downtime, and the feedback
has been extraordinary from our employees.

So business has to step up and give their employees some incentives, whether it's subsidized
commutation, which might include parking; meals for those that don't want to go out and get meals,
you got to box them up and deliver meals to the desks; subsidize child care at home if -- for primary
caregivers. If they're your employees, and they don't otherwise have already a means of childcare, I think
you got to look at that and we do that. And this latest thing, I don't even know what you call it, but I call
it, I guess, online school proctoring for students. And we've got 100% attendance, and I think morale is
good and people are happy.

So yes, you could look at you can look at government and say, government's got to do more, and it can
always do more, but I think you got to look at the businesses and the individuals, we've all got to chip in,
make some concessions, take some risks, get out there and get the economy going again.

to be back into a live in-person environment. And we spent a lot of time obviously talking about New
York because that's clearly where you're focused, but I guess if -- which also in New York has its share

of complexities. But you would look across everywhere, whether it's Boston, DC, San Fran, London,
Toronto, doesn't matter what country or what city, office densities are very low, right? Maybe there's
some differential 15% here, 10% here, 20% here, but it's not -- it's all within the same realm. So it feels,
obviously, much more of an office issue than maybe just a New York issue.

And so do you think there's a shift that comes with what types of jobs or industries end up in certain
cities or predicting a return to the way things were? I guess how do you sort of reposition or adjust for
potentially those types of changes?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Well, just -- well, first of all, Michael, glad to hear you're back in the office, first and foremost, because we
speak to a lot of folks out there that are, as we hear, prohibited either from coming to the office because
of company policy and/or prohibited from taking one-on-one meetings with people like us, and that's very
frustrating. So welcome back.

Just to make sure I understand the question. Your question is, how do we think the profile of industry
demand for space in New York is going to shift or change relative to other, let's call them, gateway cities,
is that -- is like a part of your question?

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Yes, part of it is -- yes. I mean part of it is just you step back, and all these markets are having
differences there, right? And how does New York adjust relative to those other metrics that are seeing
the same issues, and I think a lot of the things you talk about where the business have to step up?
Unfortunately, businesses right now, we're still in the pandemic. I think what's great what you're doing on
the child care, but not enough companies are doing, that's a real concern. Health care is still a concern of
many people of adding that risk. The commute, where they may be living right now.

I mean this is not just a New York thing. It's in every city, right? It's not like all of a sudden, Boston is
running at 80% density even in the suburbs. And so it just seems that this is a massive office issue. And
how is it going when things do come back? Does what the city has, is it going to change? Is the type of
roles and responsibilities that are in New York City going to change relative to where it was before?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Okay. I got it. So look, New York is a 400 million square foot office market. And I think it's probably 5x
larger than the next biggest city in terms of that density. And it got to be that because of sort of insatiable
demand for office space. It's not situation where there was just loads and loads of government-built
projects or spec projects that took decades and decades to fill.

There is -- work from home is not a new concept, right? This is a concept that's been around for a long
time and has been tried into or utilized companies for a long time. There just generally has been, and I
believe, continues to be a realization that in highly competitive markets, which New York is. I don't care
if it's tech or health care or finance or advertising or any creative work are certainly building out of the
business services, lawyers, accountants, whatever, that the work is more structured and efficient, the
teams are more bonded. The client relationships are stronger when it's face-to-face, in person, in the
office.

And I don't think this period of time is going to change at that paradigm, which has been proven out over
decades and decades of people wanting to be not only in offices, generally, but in very highly functional
offices, wired with state-of-the-art technology, high ceiling, natural light, sustainable, well-serviced,
amenitized, I can go on and on. I still believe that is the best way to conduct businesses for almost all
industries. And between now and December, we'll try and think about who we think are those outlier
industries that might actually do better from home because I can't think of them off hand, to be honest.

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

I know that I'll speak to, and I'll just broadly say, the lawyers. And they'll say, yes, I'm just as productive
at home, as I can often be in the thing. It's false and wrong from the client opinion. The attorneys
may believe that. I can tell you as a client that has closed like -- I mean, how many do I got here? 30
transactions in the past 7 months, leasing JVs, financing sales, whatever. It is not. And we now demand
our vendors to be in the office with us. If we are here, they got to be here. We're not going to do Zoom
calls with vendors who are sitting on the beach or at the lake house or anything like that.

Now it doesn't mean they can't. It's just -- we won't use -- we want a certain type. And I think people will
demand what we demand, which is real service, 100% all-in, face-to-face, at all times, morning, noon and
night. And to do that, you got to be in an office. You can't have 10 attorneys sitting around at 10 different
homes across the country, dialing in with technology. I don't think it works.

So your question was, who -- will the business change? I think it will change. And you know what, it will
change for the better. I said it with the densification. Densification, while it worked against SL Green
and other companies like us, it was a good thing for companies, viruses aside. It was efficient, use --
because companies were not using the space efficiently. And the way they change it, putting people closer
together by creating amenity spaces. That was a great shift even though it resulted in space that had to
be absorbed.

So now if companies look internally and they decide, 5% or 10% of their workforce maybe can work 3
days in the office, 2 days at home or I don't know, some variance of that. And if that works for those
companies and their company's clients or customers apart, have at it, and that's good. But if the notion
is that everybody is all of a sudden going to start sort of working from home because somehow it's better
than work from office, I don't buy it.

Michael Jason Bilerman

I know you probably have it. But just very succinctly, what do we have in terms of -- what percentage of

our tenants are open. Door is open, people coming into their spaces, whether it's 1% or 100% or nobody's
at 100% except for us.

Edward V. Piccinich
Chief Operating Officer

I think Marc mentioned it earlier.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Right. Except for us.

Edward V. Piccinich
Chief Operating Officer

Marc mentioned it earlier, 15% to 20%, we were both here when it dropped off to 1.5%, and we've been
counting each week as the percentages go up. And I could say that, that percentage will continue to grow.
He mentioned 40%, 50% by December. That's the trend we're seeing. And across the portfolio, when
you look at that attendance, it varies. Some of the bigger companies don't have as many as the smaller
companies and vice versa. So we have been seeing a trend throughout. And I think a lot of it in large
measure is due to the program we have in place, everything from PPE to the additional filters where we
went above and beyond what's called for by the executive orders and things of that sort.

So the activity, if you walk into any one of our lobbies, you'll see tenants going about their business. The
only difference is, is that they're wearing a mask. Now do we have situations where somebody is getting
turned away because they get picked off by a silent sentinel because of high fever? I could probably count
on one hand throughout our entire portfolio when someone was turned around. But otherwise, that growth
continues on a percentage basis. So...

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

And are there any general, as you can say where larger tenants have more or less population in their
offices or smaller tenants or by sector, like the business services firms are more in the office with the
financial services are home. Any trends like that, we can...

Edward V. Piccinich
Chief Operating Officer

I don't think there's -- like I said, the larger tenants, obviously, the numbers are larger because they have
a bigger footprint, so they're able to have more of their employees and then maybe some of the smaller
ones by dealing with the social distancing requirements and some are ahead of the game and putting up
what we did. They put a plexiglass so that people can still work within their cubicles, but the difference in
our lobbies is that you see the activity, but people are walking around with masks. Other than that, growth
continues.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Okay. I think as we need the financial firms and the lawyers back. I would say, just -- let's leave it at that,
Michael. We need those guys back. Once those guys are back and whenever they're going to come back
and each leader will make their own decisions about how much and when and on what time line and when
to mandate and when to make it optional. But if we can get financial services and lawyers back, I think
things will cascade from there. So can we move on maybe to next question, Michael? Thank you.

Just curious, you're kind of active here in the sales market. Just want to know what the feedback has
been. Kind of what bidding pools look like? And just how do you think people are getting comfortable
underwriting cash flows today given kind of expectations where you may have negative net effect as
people are trying to get their arms around CapEx. Kind of how are people getting comfortable on what's
pricing start to look like?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

So I think there's more focus on weighted average lease term than there was previously. So assets with
longer contractual lease streams sell with more -- there's a lot more liquidity for those assets, like you saw
with our sales of 609 Fifth Avenue, the PUMA retail condo. But the bidding pools are very strong, that even
large assets like a 410 Tenth got an enormous amount of tours and interest. Foreign capital, generally, if
they can bid without a site visit, they're interested as well. And then if anything, you do lose some foreign
buyers who aren't able to get to New York to do a site visit. But I think we see a fair amount of liquidity
out there. And financing rates are so attractive that people's levered returns are very significant even at
cap rates that people still -- we still find compelling to sell out.

Craig Allen Mailman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Do you think people are significantly changing their required returns to be in office or being the gateway
city?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

No, because I think you have this dual impact of much lower rates and they're fixing out 10-year interest
rates at 3% or sub-3%, in some cases. So they're able to achieve higher levered returns at -- not far off
of earlier this year's market cap rate.

Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So just building on that -- on the last question, I guess you've outlined jobs are coming back. Utilization
is inching upwards. You're hoping things look different in 3 to 6 months. Can you sort of maybe give us
your current view on where market rent growth or where market rents are going to shape out versus pre-
COVID and similarly, just values? What's your sense, kind of everything said and done, if we do see this
recovery or -- you're sort of starting to outline, where do -- where are the marks on both of those issues?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Vikram, I think December is the forum for that. I mean I know I don't want to -- I mentioned that
a couple of times, it's only 6 weeks away or something. We have -- we do not -- we have not given yet
our estimates or projections of rents and vacancies, all that, for '21. You know us, we will dive into the
detail in December when we have the fulsomeness to get up there and present what's going on in our
portfolio. We need to take a deep dive into our portfolio, which is part of the budgeting process that goes
on right now. It doesn't end until like mid-November. We roll it all up and then we run into the meeting on
December 7. And we'll have views on '21 for our portfolio, for the market generally.

It'd be premature right now, especially, as I mentioned earlier, this is a city in pause. And by the way, it's
a lot of cities in pause right now. And to try and take away anything substantive about trends in future
when the city is not fully back, I think is a little dangerous.

So if we're sitting here with 85% people at home, it feels one way. If by December, we're up to 30%,
40%, and it's something else. And we'll have a lot more discovery that really started just post-Labor Day.
So it's only been, I don't know, 7 weeks, really, since there's been people really to talk to. Because over
the summer, people's focus was in different areas, like hygienity and staying virus-free. So that's still a
focus, but people are now working through the questions you ask which are, what's the future of their
space going to look like? How are they going to de-densify? How are they going to balance work from
office, work from home if they're going to balance that at all and allow any work from home? And that will
all impact the trends in rents and vacancy.

So I think it's -- I don't think we're in a position to handle that now. It's not that -- we want to answer
that question as much as you want to hear the answer. But I would say, let's table that until December,
and then we'll have a quick discussion on that and hopefully, more discovery between now and then.

And just to our current rents, I mean, won't just be to our current rental levels, I mean, hasn't been
much, but it's -- the rents are down probably 10% plus or minus, but we've been getting a good traction,
I'd say, by and large.

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

Yes. We've answered this question a couple of times in the past. And where we've seen the shift in the
market is less on the rents and more on concessions. So I would say rents are probably down depending
on the building anywhere from 5% to probably less than 10%, but concessions are up. So if it used to be
$100 in TI, depending on the building, or if it was $80 in TI, they're probably up $20, $25 a foot. If free
rent was at 11 months, it's probably at 13, 14 months.

So as a percentage, concessions are getting more pressure and to no surprise. Every time there's a
disruption in the market and tenants are on the defensive. They want to husband their cash and they want
the landlord to fund the near-term cost of tending their space. So they look for the free rent in the TI, but
they're willing to absorb the rent cost over the life of the lease.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's fair. Just as a follow-up, just sort of the longer-term issue or potential issue, I should say. If you
hear what corporates globally are talking about now in various industries, not just financial, it's pretty
clear that some are thinking about their office footprint. And they may not have specific numbers or "Hey,
we're cutting by x percent, like Fujitsu in Japan has been very clear.

But I'm just wondering, in your portfolio, has anyone approached you to talk about spaces that they may
have where there's maybe longer lease terms, the shorter lease terms and think about a restructuring
over, call it, the next 6 or 12 months, especially driven by sort of a force COVID view?

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

No, because -- as I said earlier, so many of the tenants, and I think the vast majority of tenants don't
have a definitive point of view as to what their long-term needs are going to be. Until their employees
are all back in the office, they don't know the condition of their business. They don't know how their
headcount is going to be. They don't know what the impact from work from home is. They don't know
what the impact of densification or hoteling is going to be. So -- and the conversation is very fluid. So

much of the discussion 6 months ago, we've taken our queue off of where people were speculating at that
point in time would be radically different than where the conversations are today.

So I think the only thing you can say is that there's a great unknown out there. Nobody has really figured
it out. And I don't think we're going to know it until we're past COVID and people are largely back in their
office. And then business managers can really start to establish a game plan for the real estate.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on having a space allocated to the school and kids. I think that's a great effort and a great
gesture.

Operator

Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just 2 questions. I guess your largest DPE loan, I guess, went nonaccrual this quarter, Marc. I'm just
wondering if you can sort of provide any commentary around that. And sort of cure periods or how we
should be thinking about that?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Andrew is handling that one. Why don't you...

Andrew W. Mathias
President & Director

Steve, yes. So that position is a loan opportunity we saw in 625 Madison that, a loan on the fee, where we
control the leasehold separately. And we -- it was an opportunistic loan on a situation that's pretty fluid
given the ground lease reval, and we decided to take a conservative approach. And given that the loan is
pay in-kind, stop recognizing income, probably for the pendency of the revaluation, but not sure.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Sorry. So we should kind of assume moving forward until the ground lease was resolved that, that would
be kind of a noncash paying loan?

Andrew W. Mathias
President & Director

Correct.

Matthew J. DiLiberto
Chief Financial Officer

We'll keep it on nonaccrual, correct.

Andrew W. Mathias
President & Director

Yes. And the valuation date is middle of next year.

Matthew J. DiLiberto
Chief Financial Officer

Middle of '22.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

The redetermination is middle next year.

Andrew W. Mathias
President & Director

Middle of next year is determination.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

So whether we keep it on nonaccrual through the actual reset date, which is middle of '22 or through the
determination date because that's sort of rubber meets the road on the determination date. That's middle
of '21, I think, right? So another 6 to 9 months.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And then I guess just going back to the new leasing activity that Steve mentioned. I guess it's a
little over maybe 400,000 feet. Steve, are the tenants that you're talking to kind of in similar-sized space
today, so it's a similar-sized move? Are they downsizing and coming into the 400,000 if all those deals got
made or are they expanding? Just looking to see if there's any change in density on these -- on the most
recent set of new deals.

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

Well, most of them are -- I'd say it's a mixed bag. We've got 1 large tenant in that group that's actually
moving into New York. And I think that will be a big surprise to people. But there's a 100,000 square foot
tenant that plans to actually bring bodies from outside the city into the city. We've got 79,000 square feet
of leases out at One Vanderbilt. And all of those tenants are coming from smaller spaces. And then we've
got a mixed bag of renewals and smaller transactions.

So I don't think -- if your question is, are they -- are there size requirements being impacted by COVID? I
haven't seen it yet as based upon the deals that we're currently working on. Doesn't mean there won't be
a shift down the road, but in the current pipeline, it's not been part of the conversation. I think the more
-- the bigger conversation for these crop of tenants is just how are they going to use their space, how are
they going to design the space, how are they going to furnish it. And that, they're working through with
their architects.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

All right. I think we've -- it's going on an hour and 50 minutes. And I think we have one more question in
the queue. So we'll take the last question, operator.

Operator

Our final question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

So I just -- I guess one of the themes of the call is that you feel very optimistic. Cities have come back,
city's on pause right now. But you did talk about already, you're giving some more free rent. You're doing
some shorter-term renewals. There has been rents down. I guess the question is, how do you change
your strategy if you're wrong, right? If the city is not just on pause, but the city is -- has a structural
problem for the next 2 years. How does that change your leasing decisions? I mean is this an issue where
you can be more competitive on price? Does that make your portfolio more competitive? How should we

21

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

think about the scenarios where hopefully it doesn't happen, but the city is on pause for a while or just
structurally problematic for a couple of years?

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Sure. A couple of points of clarification. In saying the city's on pause and we'll -- and we're investing for
the future and it will recover. But what if it goes 2 years? This could go 2 years. I don't want to -- I didn't
want -- I don't know -- hopefully, the comment to income across is like there's going to be some kind of
V-shape recovery right after January because that's -- I don't -- in December, we'll have a form -- we'll
express a form view, but that's not our form view.

So this is -- but I look at, I guess, the difference, Nick, between how you pose and how I say it. I don't
look at 2 years is a long time. I look at -- if you said to me, there's going to be sort of a 1- to 2-year, not
pause in the sense we are now because every month, we see things improving somewhat. But I'll call it a
very slow recovery over the next 1 to 2 years before things get sort of cooking again. We don't want that,
and hopefully, it will be quicker than that.

But that's not something where we change. Fundamentally, these are -- One Vanderbilt is built for 100
years. And One Madison, we're going to deliver at least in 2024. So whether it's 1 or 2 years, the goal for
companies like us right now is to stabilize and get through this, you buy time, the way we buy time as we
renew our tenants. When you say the tenants are demanding shorter -- free rent and shorter terms. Nick,
we went to those guys. They didn't ask for it. We had a program.

I think we might have talked at the last call, we went to every single tenant that had a renewal in the next
1 to 3 years and proactively said to them, "Do you want some free rent in exchange for signing up for an
additional one, 3, 5 years?" And if they did, great, if they didn't, didn't. It was to help them because we
knew they needed and wanted that free rent most during the early months of this pandemic. And for us,
whether we get free rent right now or 1 year or 2 from now when they actually did their renewal, it didn't
matter to us because we have plenty of cash liquidity.

So we went to these guys and said, look, you need this help now. We'll give you this help now. And let's
talk about a short-term extension, so you don't have to make -- we could have pigeonholed them and
said, listen, fill or kill, you've got to either sign up or move out. And it's not what we did. And don't know
what the answer would have been, had we done that. It seemed much more prudent to us to go to them
almost as partners and say, "Listen, here's some free rent, sign it for an extra 1 to 3 years, which is why
you see shorter terms, and then let's work on a longer-term restructuring of your lease, whatever that
means, whether it's for more equal or less space," because they don't really know right now.

So what we're doing now is very proactive on this company's part. I don't know if other companies are
doing the same thing or not. You'd have to check away with those companies. But that's what we're doing
and we're sort of -- because we are 30 million feet in the city, we sort of drive that market.

If this sort of scenario plays out, we're making the earnings we're making and we're 96% collection, 94%
lease. We want growth as much as our shareholders do, but I wouldn't call another 1 to 2 years before a
sharp recovery. Anything that shouldn't -- that couldn't be expected or negative. I think that's positive for
the city after 2 years where sharply coming out of this. Hopefully, after 1 year, I mean, we'll have to gauge
that.

But again, it's really up to people. I think as soon as people come back in. So there's your mark. As soon
as the 85% that are at home are sitting in their offices. We started this pandemic in a very good, tight
market, and I think we'll be right back there. I don't know that I have the ability to -- or anyone here
around has the ability to project when people will come. And we thought it would be after Labor Day. We
were wrong. Now we're hoping after -- by year-end or shortly thereafter. I don't know. We hope so.

But the good news is, every month is more. So whether we get there quickly or slowly, our assets are the
best assets in the city. And this city is still highly sought. If you heard Andrew talk about the demand for
these assets, these investors who are buying these buildings and were bidding for these buildings. They're
-- they have form views. They're smart. They have a point of view. I don't think they're buying it based on

22

SL GREEN REALTY CORP. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

whether people come back 6, 12, 18 months from now, where the economy -- but their view is this city
will be back.

And if you want to be an investor in the city, you got to have a view, it will be back. And if you don't think
that, you're not going to invest in the city. But there are investors. We know that because we're selling
assets. We know that because we're marketing other assets. That changes and changes. But right now,
in kind of the worst of times, there's still, I would almost call it decent demand at an asset level. David
is selling DP assets at very strong marks. We've got multiple bidders for assets like 410 and others. So
investors are out there. Tenants are out there. Steve's got $865,000 a pipe, half of which is new. So that's
got to mean there's a lot of interest in signing them new. So I think the trends are good.

That's how I come to my -- people may differ. That's what makes the market. But that's how we come
to our conclusion that we'll get through this, New York will be back. How long it will take. It's a little bit
of a crystal ball, and we're not really in a position to give that right now. But we've been 31 years in the
business, exclusively in New York City. And this feels like one we can get through.

Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And that's helpful. And then I guess in terms of the portfolio then, as we think to next year, is it just a lot
-- is there still a lot of renewal activity, right, and the new lease activity stays challenged? If it is a market
where things are on hold and 50% of people are back in offices and not 100%? I mean, does that just hit
the scale to a lot more of this dynamic of renewals, shorter-term renewals, you offering free rent to keep
tenants, which makes sense as a strategy to hold occupancy?

Steven M. Durels
Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property

Nick, I guess, when we see you in December, we'll give more color commentary on it. But I'm sure you
heard me say earlier that 50% of my 825,000 square foot pipeline are new transactions. So to focus and
say, is it just going to be more of the same of short-term renewals, you're just not hearing what we're
saying is that it was short-term renewals earlier in the year. It started to change the corner. And as we sit
here in -- going into the fourth quarter, clearly, the new deal activity is ramping back up. And knock on
wood, that will continue to go forward as the month pass going -- down the road.

Marc Holliday
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thank you, everyone. I think we reached the end of the call. So operator, if there's no further
questions. We're going to sign off.

Operator
Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You
may now disconnect.
