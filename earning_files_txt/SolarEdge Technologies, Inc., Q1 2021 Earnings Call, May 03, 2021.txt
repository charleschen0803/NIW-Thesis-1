Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us on our conference call.

Starting with highlights of our first quarter results. We concluded the quarter with revenues of
approximately $405 million, just above the top end of our guidance. Revenues from our solar business
were $376 million, while revenue from our nonsolar business were $29 million. This quarter, we shipped
3.7 million power optimizers and 182,000 inverters.

Our solar business grew this quarter across all segments and geographies, including record quarterly
revenues in Australia, Italy and France. In North America, we saw 23% growth in revenues from Q4 to
Q1, representing increased demand for both residential and commercial products. Business in Europe is
continuing to grow, led by sales in the Netherlands where we had a record quarter of residential revenues;

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

as well as revenues from Germany, Italy and Poland. Also noteworthy is our continued growth in France,
where we had record quarter both in residential and commercial sales.

In the region outside Europe and the U.S., which includes Australia, Asia Pacific, Japan, Brazil, Israel and
several other countries, we had our third consecutive quarter of growth and record shipments. Noteworthy
among these countries is Australia, where we delivered close to 100 megawatts of products, representing
more than 50% of quarter-over-quarter growth. A big part of this momentum was due to the volume
shipments of our new 3-phase residential inverter optimized for the Australian market. When it comes
to new market opportunities, we see Korea as a particularly interesting one. We recently completed
certification of our 3-phase commercial inverter, for installation on commercial rooftops in Korea. As the
C&I market in Korea is more than 2 gigawatt in size and considering our strong local presence, we are
optimistic about the growth potential there and indeed already installed in the first quarter more than 10
megawatt of rooftops in a conditional certification setup.

As we projected in recent calls, this quarter, we began to see meaningful signs of recovery in our
commercial business across all regions. Our megawatt shipments of commercial products grew by 30 --
35% from last quarter. As we have anticipated and discussed in our last earning calls, the commercial
sector has been slower to recover from the economic downturn during the pandemic, but inventory in our
distribution channel is now back to healthier levels. And we are seeing a pickup in commercial installations
and opportunity pipeline. We expect revenues from the commercial segments to continue and grow back
to the pre-pandemic levels in the second and third quarter of 2021.

On the products side, demand for our battery-ready energy hub inverter continues to grow, and it is now
more than 20% of our residential shipments to the U.S. At the same time, we see growing interest in
our self-consumption devices such as our EV charger and water-heating product. Our plan to launch our
residential battery remains on track. We have active test sites already in the U.S. and will begin initial
shipments this quarter. These batteries will be shipped to the U.S., Europe and later to Australia. The test
period is aimed to validate the battery performance in the field and sharpen installation practices with
the help of some of our select installers. Additionally, the goal is to confirm the system-level battery plus
energy hub inverter self-consumption and backup scenarios.

In a recent study of our global installed base of more than 30,000 systems of SolarEdge backup inverters
installed with third-party inverter, we analyzed consumer behavior patterns and system performance
through more than 75,000 blackout events lasting more than 5 minutes. We characterized in detail typical
blackout frequencies, duration; the power and energy capacity needs; as well as practices to prevent
depletion of batteries in extended blackout events. We will be incorporating these learnings into our
system in conjunction with the maximization of self-consumption and financial decision-making algorithms
in order to enable smart, automated system decisions; and provide a flexible, easy-to-manage system for
the consumer.

As we have said in the past, we don't plan for meaningful battery revenues until Q3 of this year. Given
the growing demand for energy consumption and storage, which I referred to earlier, we are confident
that our storage-ready inverters fitted with our DC-coupled battery represent a significant milestone in
progressing our vision of a home system that is flexible to provide both maximization of self-consumption
and economic value where relevant and backup capability where and when needed. In the commercial
segment, we see good adoption of our 120 kilowatts energy inverter, including a dedicated version
for ground-mount installations in the U.S. This new high-power inverter is designed to support bigger
commercial fields and improved economics as well as simplify installation and commissioning. Our
customers can now set up and test the entire installation before even connecting to the AC grid.

As the C&I market continues to improve, our new high-power inverter, combined with our recently
released 1,100-watt optimizer, offer a means to reduce the cost per watt for installers and increase
adoption of our solution in larger ground-mount and rooftop installations.

I would like now to elaborate on our operational status. Cycles of component shortages are common
in our industry and we have experienced such cycles before. Based on our past experience, we have
adopted a methodology to closely monitor the procurement of components by our contract manufacturers
and at times manage the supply and demand of components directly from their suppliers. This allows

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

us to identify relatively early cycles of shortages. We also typically hold high levels of safety stock and
finished goods inventory that allow us to overcome temporary fluctuations of component availability. In
addition, we have developed alternate sources for critical components. As a result, at this time, based
on the current alignment and delivery schedules with our contract manufacturers and suppliers, we are
comfortable in our ability to support the increased demand we are seeing and our projections for further
demand increases later in the year, though at times this may come at a higher cost due to expedited
shipments and cost increase, as is reflected in our gross margin guidance for the forthcoming quarter.

On a related note, our Sella 1 factory in Israel is continuing to ramp. We are now employing over 480
workers and manufacturing inverters and optimizers from our own facility, which is on track to reach full
capacity by end of this quarter. The fruits of this investment are already being born, as thanks to a joint
project of our R&D and operational teams in Israel, we have been able to increase the output of our power
optimizer automated assembly line and copied this improved process to our contract manufacturers in
other locations.

In our nonsolar business, our e-Mobility division began delivering full powertrain units and batteries for the
Fiat E-Ducato in Europe. The ramp of the production line will be gradual, and several months will pass until
we reach full capacity. In our energy storage division, the Sella 2 factory for lithium-ion cells and batteries
in Korea is now well underway, with the groundbreaking work behind us and building establishment in
process. The factory is expected to start pilot production in the first half of 2022 and will enable us to
supply our own cells and reduce our dependency on third-party manufacturers.

In summary, we are happy with the results of the first quarter and with the progress our teams are
making across our regions and business units.

With this, I hand it over to Ronen, who will review our financial results.

Ronen Faier
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Zvi. And good afternoon, everyone.

This financial review includes a GAAP and non-GAAP discussion. Full reconciliation of the pro forma to
GAAP results discussed on this call is available on our website and in the press release issued today.

Total revenues for the first quarter were $405.5 million, a 13% increase compared to $358.1 million last
quarter and a 6% decrease compared to $431.2 million for the same quarter last year. Revenues from the
sale of solar products were $376.4 million, a 15% increase compared to $327.1 million last quarter.

U.S. solar revenues this quarter were $162.5 million and represented 43.2% of our solar revenues.
Solar revenues from Europe were $158.4 million or 42.1% of our revenues. And the rest of the world
solar revenues were $55.5 million or 14.7% of our total revenues, driven mostly by record revenues in
Australia.

Revenue this quarter represented strong demand for our products in both residential and commercial
segments in Europe and the rest of the world, with revenues in the United States continuing to be driven
by sales of residential products. On a megawatt basis, we shipped to the United States 573 megawatts,
to Europe 721 megawatts and to the rest of the world 397 megawatts. 45% of the total amount were
commercial products and the remaining 55% are residential.

Channel inventory remained healthy in all regions in anticipation for Q2 and Q3, which are typically
characterized as stronger quarters for the solar industry in general. Point of data sale -- point-of-sale data
received from our distributors demonstrate strength in all regions. In the United States, where commercial
sales were weaker over the last quarter, we see as anticipated strong point-of-sale data, which lowers the
inventory days within the channels. And new project discussions with our customers are expected to yield
an increase in our U.S. commercial sales in Q2 and the following quarters. This quarter, our top 10 solar
customers represented 62.2% of our solar revenues. One U.S. distributor accounted for more than 10% of
the solar revenues.

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

Pricing levels remained stable this quarter across all regions. Blended ASP per watt for our solar products
decreased by approximately 8% compared to the last quarter, driven by customer and product mix.

This quarter, revenues from our nonsolar products were $29.1 million, led by sales of lithium-ion batteries
to nonsolar customers by Kokam and increased sales from our e-Mobility business that delivered first full
powertrain kits to Stellantis.

GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 34.5% compared to 30.8% in the prior quarter and 32.5% in the
same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin this quarter was 36.5% compared to 32.5% in the prior
quarter and 33.6% in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the solar business was a
record 39.7% compared to 36.2% in the last quarter and above our long-term solar gross margin target of
36% plus, minus 1%.

This increase in the non-GAAP solar margin is a result of several factors. Primarily, we saw a higher
portion of residential products which are characterized by higher gross margins out of the total product
mix, improved exchange rate on sales in Europe and Australia, a reduction in the portion of Chinese-made
products shipped to the United States and that are subject to U.S. custom tariff as well as lower warranty
charges as a percentage of revenues associated with the support of our products and economies of scale.
86% of the products shipped to the United States this quarter were not subject to the said tariffs, as they
were manufactured outside of China.

As you can see from our Q2 gross margin guidance, we expect margins to be slightly lower in the coming
quarter. Over the last quarters, we experienced substantial increase in ocean freight prices as a result of
the effects of COVID-19 on trade and supply chains. Ocean freight prices have increased by more than
100% over the last months, and our prenegotiated prices have gradually expired and exposed us to higher
freights costs worldwide. Another element that affect our margin is increased costs of certain components
and freight costs related to the expedited shipments of such components. As Zvi mentioned, we are
managing these component shortages in a way that currently allows us to meet the annual operating
plan, but such management requires us from time to time to pay higher prices for component or air-ship
them to our contract manufacturer's facility as supply times always -- also fluctuate. Lastly, the seasonal
growth in revenues in Europe and increased sales of commercial products in the United States both are
characterized by lower gross margins products in our overall mix. Despite all these factors, our gross
margin target and our expectation to meet it remain unchanged at the range of 36% plus, minus 1%.

Non-GAAP gross margin for our nonsolar activities was minus 4.7% compared to minus 6.4% in the
previous quarter. The improvement is mainly a result of the growing volumes of powertrain kits supplied
this quarter, although volumes are not yet stabilized at the anticipated level that will get us to the low
single digits target gross margin on this project.

Our -- on a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the first quarter were $76.2 million or 18.8% of
revenues compared to $72.9 million or 20.4% of revenues in the prior quarter and $66.3 million or
14 -- 15.4% of revenues for the same quarter last year. This increase is a result of our recommenced
investment in talent acquisition in our research and development department as well as the expansion of
sales infrastructure in all businesses.

Our non-GAAP solar operating expenses as percentage of solar revenues were 17% compared to 18.9%
last quarter.

Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $71.9 million compared to $43.5 million in the previous
quarter and $78.6 million for the same period last year. This quarter, non-GAAP solar activities resulted
in an operating profit of $85.5 million compared to an operating profit of $56.5 million last quarter. This
number represent 22.7% of our solar revenues and is at the higher end of our 20% to 23% long-term
operating profit model.

The nonsolar activities resulted in non-GAAP operating loss of $13.6 million, relatively flat to an operating
loss of $13 million in the previous quarter.

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

Non-GAAP financial expense for the quarter was $6.3 million compared to a non-GAAP financial income
of $16.9 million in the previous quarter. This expense is a result of mostly unrealized foreign currencies
fluctuations related to intercompany loans between the group companies.

Our non-GAAP tax expense was $10.1 million compared to $4.6 million in the previous quarter and $12.5
million for the same period last year.

GAAP net income for the first quarter was $30.1 million compared to a GAAP net income of $17.7 million
in the previous quarter and $42.2 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was
$55.5 million, flat compared to a non-GAAP net income of $55.7 million in the previous quarter. However,
this net income this quarter is a result of a substantially higher operating profit.

GAAP net diluted earning per share was $0.55 for the first quarter compared to $0.33 in the previous
quarter and $0.81 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $0.98, the same as in
the previous quarter and a slight increase compared to $0.95 in the same quarter last year.

Turning now to the balance sheet.

As of March 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted cash deposits and investments
were $1.2 billion. Net of debt, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposit, restricted bank deposits and
investments were $515.2 million.

During the first quarter of 2021, we generated $24.1 million in cash from operations. AR net increased
nominally this quarter to $271.7 million compared to $218.7 million last quarter. Day sales outstanding
this quarter in the solar business was 73 days, a decrease from 75 days last quarter.

As of March 31, our inventory level net of reserves was at $340 million compared to $331.7 million in
the prior quarter. This amount reflects slightly lower finished good inventories and higher raw material
inventory in both our solar and nonsolar businesses as we are working through the component shortages
and ramp up our e-Mobility powertrain production line.

Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter of 2021. We expect revenues for the second quarter to
be within the range of $445 million to $465 million. Revenues from the sale of solar products are expected
to be within the range of $405 million and $420 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be within
the range of 32% to 34%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the sale of solar products is expected to be within
the range of 36% to 38%.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe just first talking about the gross margin guidance. You described the cost impact of, for example,
shipment costs, et cetera. And I was just curious. For the second quarter, are -- the sort of costs for those
sorts of I think of as inventory-related costs, is that fully reflected in 2Q? Or could you see further margin
impacts in subsequent quarters that could be a bit larger than what you're seeing in 2Q guidance?

Ronen Faier
Chief Financial Officer

So general -- first of all, the margin is relatively, I would say, a mix of various items other than, of course,
the logistic costs which are also related to mix of products and mix of geographies and currencies, so
therefore, spotting one specific element is always a little bit more complicated. And one of them may
move and actually overcast the others, such as exchange rate, for example, but from a perspective related
to the logistic costs, basically our prices are usually prenegotiated in advance. And we try to close them as
much as possible in order to hedge prices against changes that are happening, and we were able actually
to do it pretty well in the last few quarters. It's simply that over time the costs went up and our prices
elapsed, and therefore we had to pay the higher prices. So right now I think that we have a pretty clear
visibility for the ocean freight prices, at least for the quarter where we guided. We do not see a lot of
changes happening there. I think that, for the quarters to come, we do not have yet numbers to see. We
believe that the trend is going to be slightly downwards, but of course, as long as the traffic of boats in
and out from the United States and to China and the other areas is somehow disturbed because of COVID
and because of changes in the trade patterns, this may change. We do not expect major changes more
than we saw this quarter, however, in the next few quarters.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's really helpful. And then maybe just one follow-up. It's great to see the progress on your energy
storage business. And you talked about the residential battery being on track for deliveries in the second
quarter. Just in general, how are you feeling about the growth potential for that business? I mean it strikes
us that there should be tremendous demand for that product, but just curious: Compared to your original
expectations, how is that sort of process of development? And how would you expect rollout? In other
words, are you feeling more bullish because demand is very high? Are there sort of logistical issues that
would go on the other side of the equation? How are you generally feeling about the growth of the storage
business?

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Well, I think you hit the nail on the head. Demand is probably not the issue. So demand is very strong.
It's coming from multiple geographies all over the world in general for storage and in particular for an
integrated system as we provide. We will be ramping our production line. We'll make the introduction,
at the end of the day, gradual because it is a new product. And you want to be a bit cautious in how you
roll it out to the field, how you train installers, how you get it installed. And logistics are a challenge, but
they're not much more of a challenge than they are in other areas. So the outlook is very positive in this
area, but it's not going to be a very sharp hockey stick of a tremendous growth from 1 quarter to the
other. But we're very encouraged by the demand. And by the way, the product is shaping out and we're
excited as -- to bring it out to the market in the next couple of quarters.

And we will take our next question from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners.

Philip Shen
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Just as a follow-up on the storage question, was wondering if you could talk about what you think
meaningful demand could be in Q3. I think you mentioned that, that would be the first quarter. And then
perhaps put in context for us what kind of growth Kokam, the core business, could see in 2021 versus
2020. And if you can talk about pricing for the battery system, that would be fantastic as well.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

So I'll try to take them one by one, Phil. So again demand is very strong. In terms of how much we will
ship in Q3, we're not yet giving specific guidance as we iron out the plan. And as we said multiple times,
we believe it will be already meaningful quantities and revenue, but the exact numbers, we'll guide next
quarter. In terms of the pricing, we began to communicate pricing to select customers in the market, and
we're obviously aiming it to be competitive and reflect the value of the product. So we won't be on any
major edge in terms of significantly higher or lower than market prices for batteries today. And the last
question, Phil, I don't recall -- about the...

Philip Shen
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

So what kind of growth could we see with the Kokam business year-over-year?

Ronen Faier
Chief Financial Officer

Well, so I think that here, Phil, the question is mostly related to the capacity they have. Today, the
capacity they have in the older factory Nonsan is pretty much taken. And therefore, we do expect to see
a small growth year-over-year simply due to the fact that they are able to make improvements, but it's
not going to be something that will move the needle in the overall SolarEdge numbers for this year. The
biggest growth will come starting next year because, once Sella 2 will start producing cell, this will be
first sample sales in the first quarter and go into full production within the year. Then our expectation was
around $300 million, as we communicated in the past. However, we do see that this assumption that was
based on relatively large ASP erosion in the cell industry is not really materializing. And therefore, the
effects could be higher, but at least for us the way that we're planning is about $300 million of incremental
revenues in 2022.

Philip Shen
ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division

Great. As my follow-up question here, as it relates to litigation, was wondering if you guys could provide
an update on any of the risks and opportunities as it relates to what's going on in the lawsuits in China or
in Germany. What is the risk that you guys may be prevented from manufacturing in China? And if so, do
you have any contingency plans around that?

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

So as -- we discussed several times over the years that the litigation has been going on. These are
typically very long processes and usually don't end in a dramatic fashion in one way or another. So all of
this is still ongoing, as you mentioned, both in Europe and in China. Nonetheless, we obviously have set
in motion contingency plans based on scenarios that might evolve, but so far, also as we indicated in our
guidance for the quarter and our message for the subsequent quarter, we are comfortable with our ability
to deliver on the increased demand that we're seeing.

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

And we will take our next question from Colin of Oppenheimer.

Colin William Rusch
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Could you talk a little bit about what's going on with seasonality in Europe and sell-through in Europe both
in the commercial and the residential market and a comment on diversification of the geographic footprint
where you guys are selling through?

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Yes. So Europe was an interesting winter in the fact that the first couple of months were pretty tough
winter and installation rates were kind of slow. And then sometime from mid-February and on, things
opened up and installation rate is gone up. Sell-through is gone up. And most of our dialogues with our
distributors across Europe both for residential and commercial are about pull-ins and expedite these days,
as the market woke up very aggressively and inventory levels are relatively low, compared to the pull from
the installers.

In terms of the general breakdown, if that's what you're referring to. So we are stabilizing more on a 40%,
45% U.S.; 40% roughly Europe; and 15% rest of world. Rest of world is growing quite quickly, and that
pattern might shift later on. And we are investing a lot into places like Korea that I mentioned, Taiwan that
is a good-growing market. Thailand is a good-growing and interesting market, as well as the other places
that we are present already like in a strong way like Australia and Brazil's and even in our home court in
Israel. So the growth rate in these regions of the market are higher than that in the U.S. and in Europe,
and we are making the investments in order to capitalize, but still nonetheless, for the foreseeable future,
that mix of roughly -- or going, depending on the season, between 40% to 50% each between Europe and
the U.S., and the rest coming from the rest of the world, is probably going to be the pattern for the next
12 to 18 months continuously.

Colin William Rusch
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, could you give us a sense of how things are progressing
on your efforts to enter the utility-scale market and evolution of that market as we start to see some
evolution on the balance of system for the electrical elements of these systems? But just a little bit of an
update there.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

So we're continuing incremental penetration into the ground mount market, if you will, which wouldn't
be classified as utility in terms of we're not talking about the installation sizes of hundreds of megawatts,
but we are more and more installing systems based on the larger inverters that we are introducing;
and the lower-cost optimizers into more and more projects of the size of 5-, 10-, 15-megawatt ground-
mount installations all over the world. The next step improvement or the next step penetration from our
side will be, as we discussed several times, towards the end of this year, beginning of next year with the
introduction of a above-300-kilowatt inverter, which will take us a next step in terms of suitability for
larger ground-mount installations. And we'll continue to evolve from there.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Mark Strouse of JPMorgan.

Mark Wesley Strouse
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to go back to the component inventory, to Stephen's earlier point. Are you able to quantify
that at all? Or maybe put it in terms of, if the supply chain industry headwinds last for another 2 quarters

or another 2 years, 3 years, whatever, at what point does it become even more of a material headwind to
SolarEdge.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

So 2, 3 years is a tough question. We are in continuous dialogue obviously with the contract
manufacturers and the supply base for components. And based on that dialogue in terms of the
projections that we give them and the commitments that they give us, we don't see -- and we don't
see major issues, assuming everybody sticks to their plan. And i.e., our growth is the growth that we
are expecting and we don't see major de-commits. Now these are -- this is based on alignment that is
done recently and not based on -- and live within the crisis and not commitments or alignment that was
done prior to the crisis beginning. So what this translates to in our message is that we have a plan for
the foreseeable future that is aligned with the supply base to the component level, not only the contract
manufacturing, to which we can deliver on the optimistic growth expectations that we see. To extrapolate
that 2 years out and what could happen in the component industry, that's a bit beyond our capability at
this point, especially if you take into account that these type of cycles usually don't last that length of
time in terms of the ability of component manufacturers to add capacity within that -- those type of time
cycles.

Mark Wesley Strouse
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, sure, makes sense. Okay. And then just lastly for me: And not looking for you to name any specific
customers, but as you look at your U.S. customers that are providers of leases or PPAs that have maybe
safe harbored in the past, can you talk about any change in their buying behavior since the ITC was
extended a few months ago?

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Yes. And as you said, I will -- I can get into a specific name based on a press release that we issued
shortly after our previous earning call about an agreement that we reached in Sunrun for delivering the
energy hub to them. And we're very happy in terms of how that renewed relationship is evolving. And
part of that is obviously translating into our business now and our projections. I don't have full visibility
to them and the other large installers in terms of how much safe harbor they still might have in their
inventory and what type of product.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.

Brian K. Lee
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I had 2, 1 on gross margins. I know you had talked about, Ronen, a couple moving pieces here that are
kind of pressuring gross margins [ in ] the 2Q outlook. Can you help quantify a little bit just some of the
logistical costs, what sort of basis point impact it's having? Because obviously you put up a very good
gross margin in Q1 on the solar products. It seems like there's a headwind you're seeing on the logistical
costs from quarter to quarter. And then mix helped you a lot in Q1. It sounds like mix is still pretty good
in Q2 because you're expecting growth in the U.S. to continue to be robust, but can you kind of level set
us again? You've said in the past sort of what your margin delta is between different regions and then
between resi and commercial. I know it converged a bit recently, but could you level set us again as to
kind of what the margin delta you typically see is across some of your end markets and geos?

Ronen Faier
Chief Financial Officer

As we mentioned at the beginning, due to the fact that there are so many moving pieces to name and to
give the effect of all of them, it's relatively tough. I will say that, in this quarter, first of all, as I've laid

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

12

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

out, if you take the mid-range of our guidance, we are supposed to be at around 37% on the mid-range,
which means about 200 basis points of reduction compared to this quarter. This actually encapsulates the
vast majority of all of them because the ocean freight is usually, I would say, several -- I would say, not
more than 100 to 150 basis points in general usually, but again these kind of expenses almost doubled
over the last quarter. But this is something that -- again that is changing based on the routes that you're
shipping, whether you ship more from Europe, whether you ship more from China and Vietnam. And there
are a lot of fluctuations there, and you see a relatively large number. The exchange rate differences, of
course, are hard to predict. This quarter, they were above the usual rate, but at the end they worked a
little bit against us. So again I think that, if you take and you bundle all of the changes in the shipping
prices plus the effect of the mix, plus the effect of the exchange rate, you get to this 2%. And this is the
neighborhood not dramatically over this one.

Brian K. Lee
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay, fair enough. That's helpful. And then just a second question on -- there's a lot of questions around
the battery storage and the ramp here that you're contemplating here over the next several quarters.
I thought, in the past, you had talked about kind of the ability or at least the confidence around $100
million to maybe $150 million of battery storage revenue resi as you ramp in 2021, obviously mostly in the
second half given the time line of the ramp, but are you no longer of the view that you can get to that kind
of triple-digit millions of dollars of revenue this year? And if that's the case, it...

Ronen Faier
Chief Financial Officer

No, no, no. We still hold this view.

Brian K. Lee
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes -- you -- okay. So you're $100 million-plus, in the second half of this year, on the new resi storage
product. I just wanted to make sure that that's still your view.

Ronen Faier
Chief Financial Officer

Yes and again based on -- all according to the ability to ramp and no disturbance on the supply chain, but
in general there is no change. As Zvi mentioned before, everything is on track and there are no changes to
the plan.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Maheep Mandloi of Crédit Suisse.

Maheep Mandloi
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Could you maybe just talk about the split of commercial revenue and residential revenues in Q2; and how
that should evolve in Q3, Q4? And then I'm just trying to understand: You guided that commercial should
recover in Q2 and Q3, so I'm just trying to see if we should expect higher commercial demand run rate in
Q3, versus current levels, going forward.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Yes. So Maheep, as I mentioned in the comments, our commercial volume in megawatts from Q4 to Q1
grew by about 35%. This was primarily growth in Europe and rest of the world. Our commercial shipments
also in the U.S. grew quarter-over-quarter but to a lesser effect. And they grew quarter-over-quarter in
the other 2 regions as we characterize them, Europe and Australia. At the same time, we began to see
also in the U.S. higher installation rates and sales by our distributors and reduction in inventory levels, so

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

we do believe that the U.S. will begin to pick up as well; and following the pickup that we saw in Australia
and rest of world, not necessarily at that growth rate. So we are -- and we referred to this a few times in
the past. We expected -- barring the improvement from the economies and related to the pandemic, we
expected beginning of pickup in the second quarter. And usually commercial installations are back-end
heavy in the year, so it is a reasonable assumption that the commercial shipments will continue to improve
globally and in particular in the U.S., as I mentioned.

Maheep Mandloi
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it, got it. And it's in the freight costs, and thanks for the colors on the gross margin impact for that,
but I just wanted to understand if the higher freight costs or trade challenges is impacting your ability to
supply in any of the markets right now or if -- or other way to ask is if demand is much higher than what
you're seeing out there.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Yes. Demand is strong and becoming stronger. Our logistics operations are complex and global. We
manufacture at 5 sites in multiple locations around the world, and we deliver to many countries and
optimize continuously based on various elements. And that's not a simple operation, and I can give you an
example. In the Suez crisis of a month ago, we had more than 100 containers of products that were stuck
in this congestion, some of which were on the actual boat that was blocking the canal. And some were
at both sides of the canal. Nonetheless with all of that going on, we -- our delivery dates were intact and
our customer deliveries were not delayed because the complexity also gives us many options and a lot of
levers to play with. And we were able, with some expedition and a lot of effort, to still satisfy the demand
and meet our obligations. So we -- I think we're pretty good at this. And we -- with all the challenges
ahead, we believe that we will be able to execute on the demand both from a component availability and
the logistics constraints that are out there today.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Aric Li of Bank of America.

Aric Jiang Li
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Ronen Faier
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, we do.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Yes.

Aric Jiang Li
BofA Securities, Research Division

Perfect. Maybe first, on just in terms of the channel supply inventory levels versus target, can you talk
quantitatively about how much the extent of the increase in resi solar demand was relative to the extent
of the incremental supply you were able to procure for both the ASIC and the AC drivers here? In terms of
keeping up channel supply inventory base consistent with your [indiscernible].

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

[ Was that the question ]? [indiscernible].

14

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

Ronen Faier
Chief Financial Officer

So in general, Aric, it's, first of all, the level of inventory -- or the nominal level, I think, is sometimes not
the only number or, I will call it, factor that is interesting. It's more actually the inventory days that they're
holding, and that means for how long they can basically supply based on the inventories that they have.
Now in general I can tell you that, first of all, as Zvi mentioned, from a component and from logistic point
of view, we did not face any trouble, delivered our products. And therefore, we were not -- we were able
to supply whatever demand came. When the vendors are looking at their inventory, each of them make
their decisions based on what they see and project. And in general what you see is that, towards the end
of the first quarter, the absolute number or the absolute value of inventory is growing in the channels
because everyone is getting ready for Q2 and Q3. And also of course, the more you hear about component
shortages in the market, the more you hear about complexities of companies to provide [ and at time ],
you see those, I would call it, distributors trying to optimize the level of inventory that they're holding,
which is something that cost them money in working capital, with the, I would call it, desire to get as
much stability by simply holding the inventory.

So in essence what we see right now is that, when we talk to our distributors, we're very well aligned
with them on the lead times. As Zvi mentioned, even if there are logistic hurdles, we're able to meet
the delivery times. And we're able to communicate them well to the distributors, and we let them to
understand and decide what is the level that they have. This also means, by the way, that we don't
see a drag of orders coming or pulling forward simply to make sure that we have -- or they have more
inventories that -- and something that can affect them later. So it's a kind of a, I would call it, circular
process where the joint planning for us and them allows them to plan well the inventory. Our ability to
deliver related to all the hurdles and the complexities on time is something that make them comfortable,
which in turn allows them to be more precise in the way that they are planning the inventory and the
inventory levels. Right now at least, we see normal behavior for this time of the year. And again we do not
believe that there is any pull-ins or any deliveries that are done now simply in order to secure that they
have inventories for the rest of the year.

Aric Jiang Li
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And just as a follow-up question on storage. As you [ go through your products into the ] markets
in 2Q, can you talk about how you're planning to prepare and preemptively address any potential [ auto
net with sellers here ] just mainly around the lack of expertise and training to install your storage
solutions? Given that [ there seems to be a preemptive issue and being made ] by some of your peers out
there.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Well, yes, I'm not sure we understood all of the questions, but a big enhancement in the battery is the
communication, technology and ease of installation. So we invested a lot of attention in that in the design
of the battery and in particular the way it integrates with our energy hub system. So that training is
actually being initiated this week towards the installers, but I believe that -- due to the design and the way
it was designed and the simplicity, that after some simple installation, most of the installers, and we have
many experienced installers, will be able to deal with this with relative ease.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Jed Dorsheimer of...

Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Canaccord. From Canaccord Genuity. So I guess, first question. If we look at the, if I look at the 5x
cost decline in solar in general over the past 2 decades from a Wright's law perspective, it seems like
technology has kind of led the way. And it does leave the opening in -- or leaves labor as -- at least from

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

a balance of systems. And I'm just wondering how you are thinking about the reduction of labor cost as a
function of either as you talk about 3-phase sort of light commercial, if you will, in nonutility; or resi side
of things. Is that about lightning, reducing the weight of your inverters? Or how are you thinking about
that value proposition at this point?

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

Yes. It's an interesting question and worth spending more time than in this type of short discussion. It is
something that we are paying attention to at many levels. And generally, over the years, it was considered
a relative strength of ours, our position with the large installation companies. And some of that strength
was coming from a lot of joint efforts to help their installation efficiency and our -- the importance we
were putting in it and the willingness to discuss these type of items and working together on how we help
them in some cases in our small part. Obviously the big issue is theirs in terms of increase the amount of
installations that can be done per day or reduce the amount of time per installation. And there are things
that have been done over the years in terms of integration of elements that prior used to be installed
separately and incorporating them into the inverter and other elements of reducing time of commissioning
and downloading software and things like that. So in all of those areas, we are investing a lot of R&D and
doing that in cooperation with some of the large customers that we work with both in residential and C&I.
There are, as you suggest, also opportunities that are more related to the overall balance of system of
installations. And the direction that things are going, more in C&I, we are investing again R&D and looking
at these type of opportunities. And it's an area that we have a team that is focused on -- again it's not
something to get into right now, but I -- we concur that this is an area of growing importance in terms of
the growth of the industry and the adoption of these type of solutions around the world.

Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

Got it. And then, I guess, maybe just a longer term. I mean assuming you'll probably -- getting through
this tightness, there'll be a decent amount of overcapacity in the marketplace that would -- that you'd
benefit from, but as you think about the procurement of components, how are you thinking through the
competition that's increasing around electrification? Because for the past decade or 2, it's largely been
competing against different solar technologies, and today, it's now a competition amongst EV system
design or transmission and distribution of nonsolar-based technologies. So as you think through the
hierarchy from your system solution perspective and multiple facets to that, how are you thinking about
making sure that you have the capacity in a fabless design?

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

So it's again a bit of a high-level question. I'll answer with 2 elements. First is we -- from the beginning
actually, our optimizers were based on our ASIC. And we've expanded that level of vertical integration
at the component level to other elements of the system that are -- or basically components that are
designed for us and ordered by us. And obviously, yes, we are dependent on -- in some cases, on the
overall capacity scenario at the foundries or at other locations, but it's not -- we're not competing for -- in
some cases, not in all cases, obviously for the same components. And it's a trend that we plan to continue
and exercise also in some of our other businesses.

So the broader topic of the question is indeed -- and I think it's a good sign for our industry, is the
entrance of big technology players that are seeing renewables and solar and PV in particular as growth
opportunities and are -- as significant opportunities that are here to stay. So we welcome that, and I
think it's good for all of us. I think we are pretty aware of our strengths and at the same time aware of
our weaknesses. And now that we are in the e-Mobility space in some of the areas, it also allows us to
compare ourselves to other companies from other industries; and realize that, if you take the specific
topics of power electronics and high efficiency, high-reliability power electronics and the ability to mass
produce high-quality, high-efficient power electronics, that's what we know how to do. That is the core
of, the strength of the company. And we feel good about our capability and talent and compared to
most companies that we came across. And we came across some of the very well-known names around

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

the world in this area. So that's our strength, and it's a strength that we believe can provide us a lot
of opportunities in the future. And we are focusing on maintaining that strength and finding the way to
capitalize on it. And I hope that helps answer the question that you were aiming for.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company.

James Andrew Ricchiuti
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

A question I have relates to storage given that you're reaffirming your storage revenue targets for this
year. I'm wondering how we might think about this in terms of does this skew the revenue mix more
toward residential in the back half of the year; and presumably -- and tell me if this is -- if I'm not --
misinterpreting, but a higher mix in North America. And then I have also a follow-up on your installers.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

So the -- not necessarily. The -- especially since we began shipping the energy hub, there are many
inverters out there that have not yet been coupled with a battery. So it does not mean that every battery
that we will be shipping will be going automatically with an inverter at that time and, as a result, leading
to that type of tilt, a more dramatic tilt towards residential. Many will, but some will not. So I don't think
that this will skew the balance between residential and commercial or between specific geographies as
it relates to the solar installations. Yes, the majority of the batteries in the first phase will be coming to
North America and will -- so the initial surge in revenue generation will come from North America and then
spread to Europe and Australia and the rest of the world.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Kashy Harrison of Simmons Energy.

Kasope Oladipo Harrison
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So my first one surrounds supply chain. You mentioned you have enough supply to meet your anticipated
demand in the second half of the year. Just curious. Does this contemplate any excess demand that may
materialize if your major competitor doesn't have enough supply to meet their demand for the latter part
of the year?

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

We were projecting year-over-year growth based on different dynamics that we thought will come true
through 2021. We don't know -- I don't think we know how to quantify specifically if and what type of
opportunity will arise out of that dynamic. So we know that and expect growth, and we know that we and
believe that we can deliver on that growth. And if there will be such a component within that opportunity,
we should be able to deliver on it, but I have no way to confirm or to quantify something like that.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Tristan Richardson of Truist Securities.

Tristan James Richardson
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just quick question on the new product launches just on the storage side. I think in the past you've said
that, from a margin perspective, 25% could be a general high-level expectation. I'm just curious if that
still holds and maybe just the time frame to get there and in terms of what kind of scale you need to see
first.

Ronen Faier

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

SOLAREDGE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 03, 2021

Chief Financial Officer

So in general the gross margins that we expected there was indeed in the range of 25%. And I think
that there are 2 factors that we need to take into account here. The first one is that, when we made this
assumption, we believe that there is going to be a relatively sharp ASP erosion in the prices of batteries,
which actually did not happen due to the relatively high demand that we see in the market. And therefore,
there is an expectation that, at least in the short term, gross margin will be there. Now it will not be
there maybe much higher at the very beginning due to the fact that you still need to ramp up. There are
economies of scale related to the way that you ramp up, but we definitely see a potential to be there. I
think the next layer of potential is actually once we have our Sella 2 factory. And this is something that
will come at the later part of -- in '22, when batteries from Sella 2 will start arriving, because at that point
we will have our own factory with our own costs and with our own supply chain, meaning that we do not
need to leave margin maybe with the hands of a third party as well. So we feel that it's a -- there is an
-- achievable capabilities to gets to a higher margin. And of course, over the long term, once there is a
satisfied demand, we believe that we'll go back to this 25%.

Operator

And we will be taking our last question from George O'Leary from TPH & Co.

George Michael O'Leary
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just kind of a big picture question from me related to e-Mobility. I realize there's the Fiat E-Ducato that
you guys already have in the bag, but just qualitatively, what is the pipeline for incremental auto OEMs
that you guys see? And how has that been affected by kind of the recent events that we've seen in the
auto space? Is the pipeline still growing? Or have people kind of hit the pause button as they're dealing
with their own supply chain issues? Just curious for any color you could share there.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

I think we mentioned the -- our investments in play in this segment is long term, and the growth is going
to be gradual and long term. So we don't have in our pipeline for the -- and we said this in the last earning
call, in the next 12 or 18 months and -- equivalent in terms of scale and visibility like the Ducato. So we
have a series of smaller shorter-term opportunities and longer-term bigger opportunities that we are
working with and working on, and we will share them as they evolve and materialize. So one of the results
is that -- of that is that we are not really dependent on the type of current events and constraints that
are disrupting to some level the e-Mobility industry. And we are more there to execute and ride on the
long-term path of this segment which is showing -- or where the potential is growing every day. So we
don't have anything big other than the Ducato in the next year. So as a result of that, these events are not
going to impact us in -- positively or negatively in the next year to 1.5 years.

Operator

Thank you. And I will now turn the conference back over to our speakers for closing remarks.

Zvi Lando
CEO & Director

So first of all, thank you, everyone, for joining.

We are taking this call for the first time in the last 1.5 years from our California office, enabling us for the
first time to travel out of Israel to here. And in recent weeks, we've been able to visit our factories in Italy
and Korea as well. So we're encouraged by the direction that, that is going and wish everyone else in our
industry and other industries health and success and to come back to normal as soon as possible.

And thank you for joining.
