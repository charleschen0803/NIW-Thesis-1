Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Sharon, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2021 First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you
may begin your conference.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings
release earlier this morning, posted on our website borgwarner.com, on our home page and on our
Investor Relations home page.

With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences now in our next
earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations homepage for a full list.

Before we begin, we need to inform that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which
involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly from the
matters discussed today.

During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer
picture of how the core business performs and for comparison purposes to prior periods. When you hear
us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable
items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us say
organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. We will also refer to our market. When you
hear us say market, that means the change in light and commercial vehicle production weighted for our
geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market.

Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you
to follow along with these slides during our discussion.

With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Pat, and good day to everyone. We're very pleased to share our results today for the first
quarter of 2021 and provide an overall company update starting on Slide #5. I'm very proud of our strong
start of the year despite the components supply headwinds. With just over $4 billion in sales, our first
quarter revenue increased over 18% organically. This compares to a market being up less than 13%. So
our outgrowth was about 570 basis points for the quarter, which was ahead of our expectation and our
guidance for the year. We saw strong outgrowth in North America and Europe. Our earnings per share
increased year-over-year due to the impact of our higher revenue.

Our incremental margin performance was in line with our expectations, with an even strong free cash flow
of $147 million for the quarter, a good strategy towards our full year guidance. We also secured additional
new business awards for electrified vehicles, which I speak about in a moment.

And finally, during the quarter, we announced our planned acquisition of AKASOL. The key strategic
elements of the AKASOL acquisitions are detailed on Slide #6. Based on the last couple of years of
experience we have in this space, we're believers in the prospect of easy bet resistance and are very
familiar with the industry players. As a leader in this space, AKASOL had been on our radar for a long time
as a potential partner. We're confident that AKASOL is an excellent strategic fit for BorgWarner, and we
are really excited about adding their capabilities to our portfolio. In particular, we're attracted to AKASOL's

following strength. Flexible battery technology across multiple cell architectures, proven technology and
products with established manufacturing facilities already in serial production today, strong order backlog
of about $2.4 billion, primarily from leading OEMs and a focus on bus, CV and off-highway applications.
We're extremely excited and expect to complete the transaction during the second quarter.

Next I would like to highlight a significant new program win for electric vehicles on Slide 7. BorgWarner's
Integrated Drive Module, or as we call it, our IDM, was selected by a major non-Chinese Asian OEM
for its upcoming global S segment electric vehicle production planned to start in mid-2023. This is a
significant program for the company as it is our first IDM award combining BorgWarner's and legacy Delphi
Technologies portfolio. It is a validation of the potential we saw in bringing our 2 companies together. I
want to thank the team's intense efforts to get to such a significant booking only 7 months after the close
of the Delphi transaction. And there is more to come.

This IDM features our electric motor, our box and our integrated power electronics. It operates at 400 volts
and has exceptional peak power of 135 kilowatts. The IDM weight and space are reduced by integrating
our gearbox, our 400-volt silicon inverter and our motor. This results in a maximized power density and
functionality. The IDM also offers a scalable and modular inverter design making it easily adaptable to
customer requirements. This is an important step for the company with a great partner.

Next, on Slide 8, let me summarize our new strategical project charging forward that we unveiled at our
Investor Day in late March. With successful execution of this strategy, we expect to deliver over 25% of
our revenue from electric vehicles by 2025 and approximately 45% by 2030. That compares to under 3%
of revenue today.

Project charging forward as 3 pillars: one, we plan to profitably scale ELVs through our continued
integration of Delphi and our ability to capture synergies. The new IDM win is a great example. We would
also pursue other organic and inorganic actions; two, we intend to expand more aggressively into ECVs.
We will do that by leveraging our strong intimacy with CV customers as well as our position in ELVs. We're
building out a go-to-market product portfolio and operation capabilities organically and inorganically.
Our AKASOL acquisition is a key part of this expansion. And three, we plan to optimize our combustion
portfolio, reducing our exposure by disposing parts of the portfolio that we believe are lower growth that
don't ever pass to product leadership or that are not expected to deliver strong margins. We believe we
can fund the EV growth underlying project charging forward, primarily from the capital generated by
our existing operations. This is not a certain change in the company's direction. It is a logical extension
to what we've been building since 2015. We're excited about the acceleration of the market towards
electrification and about the momentum that we are building with our customers.

I want to take a moment to thank all the BorgWarner employees who are working very hard to both
manage the present and accelerate the future of the company towards BEVs.

Next, on Slide 9. I'm proud to announce that BorgWarner achieved The Great Place to Work certified
status for the second consecutive year. Great Place to Work is the global authority on workplace culture.
This certification validates BorgWarner's positive work environment. I've said before that the BorgWarner
secret sauce starts with our people: to lead, develop and attract the best talents. We strive to be an
employer of choice where we operate around the world. We cultivate a workplace environment that is
collaborative, transparent, inclusive and that promotes continuous learning and excellence.

So let me summarize our first quarter results and our outlook. The first quarter was a good start to
the year, particularly considering the supply challenges currently impacting the industry. We delivered
strong top line growth, and we believe we're tracking well towards our full year margin and free cash flow
objectives.

Our first quarter performance has led us to increase our full year revenue and adjusted earnings per share
guidance despite a lower industry production outlook, as Kevin will detail. As we look beyond 2021, I'm
extremely excited about our long-term positioning. We are continuing to take significant steps that we
believe will help us to secure our profitable growth well into the future.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

We are winning, in line with our expectations in the electric world, both from a component standpoint like
inverters and heaters, for example, and also from a latest generation system standpoint with our IDMs.
We're focusing on a disciplined inorganic investment approach, like the planned acquisition of AKASOL,
which adds great technology to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile.

With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Kevin.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to provide a
quick overview of the 2 key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, our revenue came in stronger
than we were expecting going into the year. This was driven by the fact that we delivered solid outgrowth
with both the legacy BorgWarner and former Delphi Technologies businesses performing better than
expected.

Second, our margin and cash flow performance in the quarter were strong, driven by the top line results
as well as our cost-saving measures.

So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1, we begin with pro forma
2020 revenue of $3.2 billion, which includes $945 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies. You can
see the foreign currencies increased revenue by about 6% from a year ago. Then our organic growth year-
over-year was over 18% compared to a less than 13% increase in weighted average market production.

That translates to 570 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: in Europe,
we outperformed by mid- to high single digits, driven by growth in small gasoline turbochargers and
strong performance in multiple former Delphi Technologies businesses, most notably fuel injection.

In North America, we outperformed the market by high single digits as we saw a nice benefit from the
ramp-up of the new Ford F-150 and other new business launches.

In China, we underperformed the market by mid-single digits against very strong outperformance in the
first quarter of 2020. Also keep in mind, Q1 was a very unusual quarter last year in the face of COVID-19,
primarily in China.

The sum of all this was just over $4 billion of revenue in Q1, which was a new quarterly record for the
company. Now we do believe that some of the strong outgrowth we delivered in Q1 was a result of the
production of build and hold vehicles by our customers in multiple regions of the world. That means it's
likely that some level of our reported outgrowth in Q1 is inflated due to a pull forward of production into
the quarter. This will have an offsetting impact on our expected outgrowth later in the year. However,
our outgrowth for the full year is still expected to be above our prior guidance, as I'll discuss further in a
moment. With all that background in mind, we're pleased with the strong start to 2021.

Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 11. Our first quarter adjusted operating
income was $444 million, compared to the pro forma $274 million in the first quarter of 2020. This yielded
an adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, which was up compared to the 10.3% margin for BorgWarner
only in the first quarter of 2020.

On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased
$145 million on $591 million of higher sales. That translates to an incremental margin of roughly 25%.
This solid performance was driven by conversion on higher volumes, restructuring savings and Delphi
Technology synergies in excess of purchase price amortization. We are particularly pleased with this
performance given elevated supplier costs that we experienced during the quarter.

Moving on to free cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $147 million of positive free
cash flow during the first quarter, which was roughly flat year-over-year despite increased investment in
working capital.

Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspectives of global industry production for 2021.
As a reminder, our market assumptions incorporate our view of both the light vehicle and on-highway

6

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

commercial vehicle markets. As you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial
vehicle markets to increase in the range of 9% to 12%, which is down from our previous assumption of
an 11% to 14% increase. This reduction to our prior market outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the
semiconductor shortage on industry production.

Looking at this by region, we're planning for North America to be up 17% to 20%. We see the largest
incremental impact of the semiconductor shortage in North America with our market expectations down
approximately 500 basis points from our initial assumptions.

In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of 9% to 12%, with that range being down approximately
200 basis points from our earlier planning assumption. And in China, we expect the overall market to be
roughly flat year-over-year similar to our previous estimate.

Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 13. Starting with our pro forma 2020 sales,
which includes $2.6 billion of revenue from the first 3 quarters of Delphi Technologies in 2020. As you
know, those revenues were not part of our P&L last year. But to provide year-over-year comparability,
we thought this pro forma revenue approach for the 2020 baseline would be useful. You can see that our
end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $0.9
billion to $1.3 billion.

Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 300 to 500 basis points,
which is a meaningful step up from our previous guidance of 100 to 300 basis points. Our higher
outgrowth guidance is based on the stronger-than-expected outgrowth in the first quarter and outgrowth
for the balance of the year being higher than our previous guidance based on better-than-previously-
expected revenue trends in a number of former Delphi Technologies product lines. Based on these
assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 12% to 17% relative to 2020 pro
forma revenue. Then adding a $400 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies, we're projecting total
2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.8 billion to $15.4 billion. That's up from our prior guidance by
about $100 million at both ends of the revenue range.

Even with weaker end market outlook, our stronger revenue outgrowth is driving an overall increase in our
revenue guidance from the guidance we gave last quarter. Also, you should note that we're maintaining
a wider-than-typical revenue range at this point of the year due to the wide range of potential production
scenarios that I discussed on the previous slide, which stems from the volatility and uncertainty in end
markets, arising from the industry-wide semiconductor issues.

From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.1%
to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 adjusted operating margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the
business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi related cost
synergies and purchase price accounting. From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes
$70 million to $80 million of incremental benefit in 2021. That puts us right on track to achieve 50% of
our total expected cost synergies in 2021. And based on our year-to-date performance, we believe that
we're tracking at the high end of this range.

Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4 to $4.35 per
diluted share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $3.85 to $4.25 per diluted share. I would
point out that this guidance now assumes a 31% tax rate versus our prior guidance of 32% as a result of
the successful execution of certain international tax planning initiatives.

And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range
for the full year. This is flat with our prior guidance as we expect the higher sales outlook to drive an
increase in working capital that largely offsets higher adjusted operating income. This would still represent
a record annual free cash flow generation for the company. That's our 2021 outlook.

Let's turn to Slide 14 for an update on the near-term actions related to project charging forward. On the
acquisition front, we believe we remain on track to complete the AKASOL acquisition in the second quarter.
We've now received regulatory approvals in all required jurisdictions. The tender offer is in progress
with the final acceptance period expected to be completed later this month and then with the closing

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

shortly thereafter. AKASOL represents an important part of Project CHARGING FORWARD as it represents
approximately 20% to 25% of the estimated 2025 revenue from acquisitions underlying our plan and it
significantly increases our exposure to the ECV space.

As it relates to portfolio optimization, we continue to target combustion-related dispositions with annual
revenue of approximately $1 billion to be executed over the next 12 to 18 months. The process for these
dispositions is underway. We would expect to update you on our progress there as we get closer to
executing those transactions.

So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a really solid start to the year despite the
industry supply headwinds. We delivered 570 basis points of market outgrowth, an 11.1% adjusted
operating margin and $147 million of free cash flow. And we increased our full year revenue and earnings
guidance despite moderating our industry production assumptions. Looking beyond our near-term
results, we're taking the necessary steps to accelerate the company's progression towards electrification.
The AKASOL acquisition and today's IDM announcement are great examples of our progression. And
importantly, we're executing our strategy from a position of financial strength. Ultimately, we expect that
the successful execution of our strategy will drive value creation for our shareholders.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] This question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore ISI.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I wanted to ask 2 high-level questions around EV demand. And the first is around lead times. The business
that you're winning in 2021, for the most part, is it fair to say that the start of productions for 2025 and
beyond. I was kind of surprised by the comments that you made about the IDM when being -- as early as
2023. Just trying to get a sense of the mega awards out there, what type of lead times you're looking at?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're talking about start of production in the second half of 2023. This is something that, depending
on the production ramp-up can be very well achieved. I don't see any issues with that at all.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

But is it sort of surprising that they're meeting that business out to be awarded so soon? Or is it maybe
you just were only able to actually disclose that you had that specific customer just now.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

No. We're disclosing that went pretty much at the same time we won it. We're not disclosing the name as
you've noticed, and we'll do that when we can.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Chris, I think it's fair to think that it's normally -- it's a 3-year type of a lead time. So most of the
production awards we would be looking to win in 2021 are probably more likely going to be in that '24, '25
time frame, but there's some fluctuation around that. And this one happens to launch later in the latter
part of 2023.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

No. It's super helpful. I mean the reason I asked is basically was that another European supplier that was
mentioning some of the mega programs like BW basically, we're only going to award business for '25, '26,
'27 later in the year. So I just wanted to check with you guys. It's super helpful.

The second question is maybe by region, and I know it's hard to be this sort of overarching question. But
where do you think specifically for the BorgWarner suite of products are you seeing right now the most
amount of interest when we think about it on a region basis?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

No. I think on an ESA, we see growth in all regions. In some regions, we'll be more on components. Some
regions we'll be more on systems even if that is not a clean cut. We see growth in all major regions. It is
also true that those -- the regions don't move at the same pace on electrification. So you'll see potential
growth in North America a little bit later than in other parts of the world.

Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great. And then if I could sneak in 1 last one just to be greedy. I mean the IDM one looks super
interesting. Since it's an A segment car, should we expect lower content per vehicle? Or can you still get
that 1,500-plus that you sort of laid out in some of the detail at the Analyst Day?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I'm not totally able to answer the price point at this point in time. I don't think you can adjust the price
point depending on the size. There is a little bit of that, but I'm not in the position to answer that in detail,
Chris.

Operator

Next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

James Albert Picariello
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

On the guidance, could you just provide some context on the second quarter in terms of what you're
seeing thus far in OEM build schedules related to the chip shortage and just how you foresee that situation
playing out in the back half relative to the market assumptions you laid out?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We're -- I mean as you know, we're not providing quarterly guidance, but what I can tell you is that
we do expect the bigger impact from the semiconductor shortage issue to occur really in the second
quarter and a little less so in the third quarter. If you look at -- the way I would help you dimension it is,
if you look at what's implied at the midpoint of our guide, for instance, about the last 9 months, it implies
that the average quarterly revenue somewhere in that $3.7 billion ZIP code, and you should assume that
probably, again, the semiconductor issue is more likely going to have a bigger impact in the nearer term
as opposed toward the back end of the year.

James Albert Picariello
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. So that makes sense. And then on BorgWarner's outgrowth, I mean, clearly, the first quarter came
in stronger. Could you provide color from maybe a product perspective, segment perspective, I mean,
what drove the quarter's strength because I mean I thought the first half year had a difficult diesel comp
from an outgrowth standpoint. So just curious on the upside and how we should be thinking about growth
over market the rest of the year and I guess also within the context of the chip shortage and lower
volumes maybe near term?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, I think a few of the things that we saw from a pure product perspective, the Ford F-150
launch was actually helpful in terms of driving some of the outgrowth that we saw in North America.
We saw gas turbo business in Europe, which was helpful. And we saw good performance across the
legacy Delphi Technologies businesses stronger than what we were anticipating as we started the
year, particularly in the fuel injection business. So I mean I think we saw it across a wide variety of
our businesses. And so as we look at the back half of the year, you saw that we took up the full year
outgrowth guidance I think before we were at 100 to 300 basis points for the full year. Now we're saying
the full year is 300 to 500 basis points based on both what we saw in Q1 as well as what we're expecting
in the back 9 months of the year. So in the last 9 months of the year, I think it stacks up to be about 200
to 450 basis points or so of implied outgrowth in that full year guide.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So the organic growth in the quarter, just year-over-year being paced by e-propulsion and drivetrain
at 36%, what were the major drivers of that growth? Just trying to get a sense if the segment is more
geographically weighted to last year's more affected markets, whether there was some significant e-
business growth, if you can just give us some color on the segment.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean we're not -- we haven't really disclosed outgrowth by segment. But clearly, when you look at
that segment, we do have a lot of business in that segment coming out of China, and the global markets
were simply up a lot more in China. If you look at our global weighted production, it increased about 80%
in China versus you look at Europe and North America, much smaller increases are even down in North
America on a blended basis. So that's part of the reason you see stronger revenue numbers year-over-
year in that business. It has a little bit more disproportionate skewing to the Chinese market than some of
our other businesses.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Sure. Makes sense. And then maybe just if you can comment on the drivers for the increased CapEx
outlook. Just curious to know. There's new programs getting pulled forward and the other factors to
consider in increasing the CapEx outlook for the year?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Not specifically. I think as we just rolled up our programs and rolled up our forecast, we've realized they
probably needed to take that up a little bit. Along with that, there are some of the investments we're
making associated with the Delphi Technologies integration, particularly on the IT side that are actually
being bucketed in capital that we didn't anticipate. We thought it would be in a different line item. So
we're bucketing that now in CapEx as well. So that has a little bit of an impact, although that's just a left
pocket, right pocket when it comes to free cash flow outlook.

Operator

Next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just wanted to start on the growth side. One of your key customers is highlighting a particularly
challenged volume outlook. So maybe you could just give us a sense for -- and I know you've given us
some ranges there, but to what extent is this end market guidance reflecting maybe some of the more
draconian outlooks that have been cited?

And also if you could just comment on the quarter, how much revenue growth did you get from maybe
partially built vehicle, vehicles that may not be reflected in the production builds but that you shipped
goods to?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

As we look at -- I mean, you can see our end market production assumptions, we've taken down about
200 basis points globally, which factors in the intelligence we have based on production schedules based
on conversations with our customers and based on other things that we see going on in the marketplace.
So based on the things we've seen announced or discussed with customers as late as last week, that's

contemplated in our full year guidance. And that's part of the reason we took our guidance down from
a production perspective, particularly in the North American market. Well, I'm sorry, Dan, what was the
second part of your question?

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Was there any growth benefit or revenue benefit in 1Q from partially-built vehicles?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. We think the answer to that is yes, although it's hard to tell for certain. When you look at that
outgrowth coming in at about 570 basis points. As we're trying to sort through the numbers, it's not 100%
clear, but our expectation is the amount of outperformance we're generating relative to, call it, that 300 to
500 basis points full year is probably the amount that's arguably linked to the build and hold vehicles that
we're seeing. But it's really hard to mention that for sure, but that's our assumption at the moment.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up is really just more of I'd say, a follow-up from the Investor Day. And it's
around silicon carbide and high-voltage inverters. So I think this is an area that you mentioned you have
some market leadership. You've obviously gotten some pretty chunky wins here. The content could be a
pretty material step-up over some of the base IGBT inverters.

Could you just maybe walk us through your view of how you see mix for yourself or for the industry of
silicon carbide or high voltage versus IGBT over time, maybe the margin and content differences? And
where -- how do the competitive environment is different? Wondering Is there -- as we get more silicon
carbide, does that incrementally favor you more versus some of your competition?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes. You see one of the advantage that we have is that we can do lower voltage silicon, higher voltage
silicon carbide, very high-voltage, 800-volt silicon carbide. And we are positioning ourselves more in
the high-voltage -- higher or, let's say, lower losses type of product, more efficient product with silicon
carbide. It -- the tendency is to increase efficiency. So the tendency is to go to those direction of higher
efficiency technologies. At the end of the day, it's the customer's choice who want to -- who's going to
decide what they want. And silicon carbide is primarily on high-end vehicles today. They might find their
way down to other ranges in the future.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And the competitive environment, your competitive positioning versus others on silicon carbide or high
voltage?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I really like where we are.

Next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

So it does look like the adjustments that you're making the global production and North American
production go beyond what we heard from Ford last week. And I'm just wondering if whether you think

your customers are providing transparency into the constraints that are kind of bubbling up through the
supply chain from Tier 3s to Tier 2s at this level. Obviously, some questions about that in light of what we
saw from Ford. And do you see other OEMs moderating their forecasts anywhere near what we're seeing
for one -- for that 1 customer?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So what I would say is that, for sure, we are very aware about what we are delivering, meaning that
we are on top of making sure that we can continue the flow of products, and we have a lot of 3-party
meetings with our customers ourselves and the semiconductor suppliers. And we manage that very,
very, very intensively and very as currently as we can. We see some customers that have announced
shutdown. Obviously, we are sometimes aware through schedule changes. But we're more aware through
the discussions that we have with our customers more than looking at the schedules, and that is informing
also our market intelligence on what is likely to happen.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And I was hoping maybe you just can elaborate on just 2 points. One is the strong turbo and GDI
mix. Are there any changes that are happening here? Obviously, we've seen very strong performance in
hybrids in Europe recently. But are you detecting any kind of durable strength that's happening there? And
any color on what you've experienced in terms of commodity costs and your outlook for that?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So obviously, Rod, there is a strong demand for efficient downsized gasoline engine and all efficient
downsized gasoline engine are usually turbocharged and include GDI injection, right? So that is 1 key
element for combustion-based engines as well as for hybrid-based engines.

The second part of your question is around raw material. We are seeing some increases. We are
incorporated. We have incorporated what we have seen so far in our guide. And the color I wanted to give
you is that on the biggest raw material purchases, we have about 60% pass through with our customers.
And when we go into discussing those items with them, we usually do a little bit better than that. So that's
the situation on raw material. And yes, we're seeing some inflation.

Rod Avraham Lache
Wolfe Research, LLC

What's the magnitude of that?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

We have -- we're not disclosing it. It's just embedded in our guidance. And so the good news is we're able
to offset that with the performance we're seeing in the business and able to actually even take up the
bottom end of our margin range for the full year.

Operator

Next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Maybe just to follow up on that last point, Kevin. So you are pointing to some weaker margins over
the balance of the year. Now as you pointed out, like the average sort of revenue is lower than the first
quarter. So is it really just a volume sort of flow-through dynamic? Or is there sort of less -- or a bigger
net raw material headwind or maybe some other things like freight has obviously been some that's been
called out as big constraint in the system?

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean it's really fundamentally linked to volume more than anything else. If you look at what's
implied by our guide about the back half of the year, it still suggests that we're going to convert in the low
20%, call it, 23% to 25% over the last 9 months of the year, pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1
on a year-over-year basis. So nothing beyond volume. Certainly, there's puts and takes in our P&L. You
have certain things going one way, certain things going another. But overall, what it comes down to in our
guide is really the conversion on incremental revenue.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Second question would just be on the IDM award, the first using combined BorgWarner and Delphi
Technology. I know you said it's for an A segment vehicle. Can you just spend a little time talking about
like how scalable is that of what you're showing there for larger vehicles? I mean is it actually like an
easier or harder or larger small vehicles? I imagine each comes with its own engineering complexities.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

It is scalable. It is modular -- from an inverter standpoint, the building blocks are modular. Same for a
motor standpoint. We have family of motor and the transmission that is hosting the whole thing. We'll size
up depending on the talk that we need to give. So it's fairly modular. I would not I think that smaller IDMs
or A-class vehicle IDM are more or less complicated than C-class vehicle IDMs. There are different types
of complexities. For sure, with the customers that we have wait perfect NVH and good power density, very
good power density was a key element for us to win this program as well as competitiveness, hopefully.
And I think this is the recipe for success for the others IDMs that we hopefully come in the future.

So you will see continuous booking both from a component standpoint, power electronics, combined power
electronics boxes, combining inverters and DC/DC converter or any that type of combination. And you will
see also hopefully, continuous booking on the system like this IDM.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. If I could just sneak 1 in. Any update on the $1 billion of dispositions or the market for that you
expect by the next year? And like can we expect some of that to occur in '21?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think the process is underway. Nothing to report. Obviously, we're 45 days removed from
announcing our Project CHARGING FORWARD strategy. And I think we still feel good about the ability to
deliver on that approximately $1 billion of dispositions over the next 12 to 18 months. So we'll update
you when we're closer to executing transactions but nothing additional to report at this point sitting here
today.

Next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just a first question to follow-up on the production outlook. Without naming names or maybe if you could
give us groups, how variable to the upside and the downside are the changes in schedule has been?
Because it just seems like some automakers, particularly the Japanese have gone through this with
the Tsunami in the past, had a better handle on this and had higher buffer stocks. Europeans maybe
somewhere in the middle, and it seems like the North American companies are less prepared for this. And

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

that's the reason there's maybe these extreme divergences as opposed to companies not being up to date.
I'm just curious what your perspective on sort of the variances between your customers' preparedness to
this and why we might be seeing these divergences.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

John, I think it varies a lot across region across customers. It depends upon their sourcing strategies and
things like that. And we -- and by program, it's very difficult for us to figure out those dynamics. We're not
in that detail of what OEMs -- what the OEM's issues and details are, right? So what I can tell you is that
it varies. And I don't have a way to ring-fence this either by region or by customer types. It's not possible,
at least for us.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the IDM. Congrats on the award. It's the kind of thing that
everybody was skeptical that you would ever get and it seems like you've gotten it pretty early on. So
it's a good sign. As you think about this transition towards the electric powertrain, there are sort of
skeptics on your company to believe the automakers are going to insource everything. And then there
are some optimists or realist, as I would call them, that they understand at least part of the parts will get
outsourced and maybe over time, full IDMs might be a way things go.

As you look at the shift in technology, how different do you think it is versus other shifts in technology
you've seen in the past where the automakers are trying to learn what's going on and sometimes they
might insource and sometimes, they might outsource? I mean how do you think this is going to shape up
differently or similarly to past transitions in technology?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So John, I think at the end of the day, product leadership and scale will prevail. The force of that will win.
There will be some in-sourcing. The market is very big and the content per vehicle that we have on E is
3x more than we have on C. And I gave some examples sometimes then than 1 inverter is equivalent to
pretty much what we can sell if we sell it all on combustion. So as you mentioned, the IDM is a very, very
good example. There is more to come on system outsourcing. And again, you will see some customers
that are outsourcing. They want to learn in order to buy better. Some customers will insource some
platforms, outsource some others. And that varies across customers and across region and that will also
vary over time, where I think when suppliers like us will have very good product leadership and scale in
an IDM, for example, but you have other products, I think the likelihood for us to be able to sell more
systems is becoming -- will become higher over time.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Securities, Research Division

But I'm sorry, just 1 follow-up to that. I mean how different do you think that is in the commercial vehicle
market? I mean it just seems like there's huge potential for outsourcing there, consolidation with the
AKASOL acquisition, it seems like you're right to play is pretty strong. I mean is there even a greater
opportunity on the commercial vehicle side, at least for the foreseeable future?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I would say that especially on the battery pack standpoint, there is obviously way more opportunities on
the commercial vehicle for us than on pass car. That is one of the reason why we went and focused on
commercial vehicle battery charging systems and battery systems. So on that front, there is certainly
more room for outsourcing than on the pass car side.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

And on the IDM?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Well, on the IDM, I think, generally, the likelihood of outsourcing in commercial vehicle by the volumes
of those industries and by the diversity of what is required is at the high level leading to maybe more
outsourcing than in other segments. You will see in the commercial vehicle, I think, maybe more
combination of motor and power electronics as those two go together, one controls the other, than IDMs
from a commercial vehicle propulsion standpoint.

Operator

Next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I was hoping to follow up on your comments about the in-sourcing versus outsourcing of electric
powertrain. So -- and wondering how much we can read into these specific first win. So are you able to
comment on whether this customer has other EVs either out or coming out? And what would the sourcing
strategy have been on those? So I'm wondering if there's a way to read into a shift towards sort of like
more insourcing or whether depending on which platform and which class of vehicle, the sort of like
different sourcing strategy within that one OEM?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Obviously, I won't give you -- I can't give you detail on the customer. What I can give you is that I think
what it means is that great technology is making it different. And in line with my prepared remarks, I want
to again thank the BorgWarner team that have been working since the closing of the Delphi transaction
together to get an award of this magnitude and that strategic impact. 7 months after close, I think is
pretty remarkable.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. Definitely. Are you able to comment on the volume expected for this program?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

No. I can't.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. So I guess on the different topic, so the volatility around the semi shortages. I was wondering how
do you manage this on the ground and I guess, in your operations? Not to keep picking on Ford, but I
guess I gave some pretty clear outlook last week. It feels like a lot of their factories may be shut for a
prolonged amount of time in Europe potentially 6 or 8 weeks or so. And so -- and with pretty low amount
of notice -- a little notice. So how do you manage this in terms of cost efficiencies and making sure that
things continue to run at the right level of margin?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So there is 2 facets to that. First is the facet of what we supply to our customers that have semiconductors
in. And we're working very well with our customers and with our semiconductor suppliers in order to keep
it going. Second is, when we're impacted by somebody else's shutdown, and you're taking Ford as an
example, well, we are excited enough to be able to manage that. And with the notice we have, this is

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

something that we do for a living we can flex. And this particular element is -- in the grand scheme of
BorgWarner is not going to move the needle to a point where it is impacting us too much. And the plant
managers know how to flex what they have to flex in order to cope with the latest schedules.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That's great to hear. And then the final follow-up on this topic is you were mentioning, I think in the
prepared remarks, some supplier elevated costs. Any way to quantify this and how material those were in
the quarter?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. There were 2 things that are really impacting us. One and the bigger item was really a troubled
supplier situation that we have impacting one of our segments in Europe. And you'll see that disclosed in
the 10-Q as well, and that had about an $18 million impact in the quarter.

And then the second, as we talked about earlier, is the impact of commodity costs on us as well. We
are seeing some escalation there. As Fred noted, we do have recovery mechanisms for the underlying
movements in the raw materials that are just a subset of our material purchases, but that does have an
impact on us and will continue to have an impact as we look ahead to the balance of the year. But again,
both those things are contemplated in the 11% margin performance in Q1 as well as the full year guide of
$10.1 million to $10.5 million.

Operator

Next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies.

David Lee Kelley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe starting with a follow-up on that last semiconductor point. Just given your electronics mix, you
referenced discussions ongoing with your semiconductor partners. I guess can you talk about if you're
currently seeing any price inflation in electronics or if you expect to see increases? And then also I was
curious to hear if you -- if so, if you see an opportunity to pass those through?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

We're not saying anything important so far. It is -- the situation is, as you know, still very volatile, but
we've not been faced with those types of demands yet.

David Lee Kelley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then maybe quickly shifting gears. You raised your commercial vehicle underlying
outlook. Just curious if you could talk a bit more about contribution to the quarter and how you're thinking
about the CV outgrowth through the balance of the year, that would be great.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean the main thing that we saw from a CV perspective was really China coming in a little bit
stronger, including a Q1 from a production standpoint than what we were previously guiding to. But that's
really all to comment on at this point. It's mainly coming from that.

David Lee Kelley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And Kevin, maybe 1 quick follow-up on that. Can you remind us of typical incremental
margin contribution from commercial vehicles?

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2021

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

We haven't broken it down between commercial vehicle and light vehicle. I think it's appropriate to think
of us just in totality as being normally in that high teens from a conversion standpoint. Obviously, our
guide this year, both what we delivered in Q1 and then what we're guiding to for the full year suggests
that we're in the low 20 percentile from a conversion year-over-year perspective, which will contemplate
anything in both the CV and the light vehicle space. And obviously, we're getting a tailwind from things
like the cost synergies in excess of purchase price amortization, getting a tailwind from the execution of
our restructuring initiatives, both on the legacy BorgWarner side and Project Pioneer at Delphi. And so it's
leading to conversion that this year is in the low 20s right now.

Operator

We have time for 1 final question, and that question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. Good day, everyone. It's a less glamorous part of the eDrive and power electronics business than
pure BEVs. But can you comment a bit on the pace of your business in plug-in hybrids and just how that
could unfold in the next couple of years before further inflection in that perhaps later in the decade or mid-
decade?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

We are seeing accrual, a strong pool actually for plug-in hybrids, especially coming from Europe, also a
little bit from China. And as you know, Brian, we're more into the high-voltage plug-in hybrids more than
in the lower voltages, and we see strong pull. We're very, very happy with the programs that we have and
the pool that we're seeing in -- especially in Europe.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And I think a few people fit on commodities. But In the past, there have been some special alloys.
I think forget which the alloy that bit you about 5 or 6 years ago was, is that going to be a particular
problem now in terms of the input cost of that alloy? And 2, are you now fully protected with pass-
throughs of that particular ally?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean when it comes to steel costs, we are seeing underlying inflationary pressures in the raw
material underlying our material buy. Remember, material spend for us runs around 55% of revenue
and the underlying raw material is a relatively modest percentage of that. But within that spend, the
bulk of which, from a raw material exposure perspective would be on the steel side, we are seeing some
inflationary pressures. But as Fred mentioned, we do have cost recovery mechanisms with our customers
associated with the underlying raw material increases. But there is an impact. It's hitting us this year, and
it's embedded in our guidance.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I'd like to thank you all for your great questions today. Sharon, you can go ahead and close out the call.
