Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to the Incyte Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike Booth, Head of Investor Relations at Incyte. Please go
ahead.

Michael Booth
Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Social Responsibility

Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call -- Earnings
Conference Call and Webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section
of incyte.com. I'm joined on the call today by Hervé, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our
prepared remarks, and by Dash, who will join us for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are
forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2020 guidance, the
commercialization of our products and the development plans and expectations for the compounds in our
pipeline as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners. These forward-looking statements
are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially,
including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, and from time to time in our
other SEC documents.

In addition, I would like to caution everyone that the COVID-19 pandemic is an evolving situation. And it
is still relatively early to be able to assess the full effect of governmental, business and social actions and
policies and overall economic conditions on our business. Accordingly, it is important to keep in mind that
our statements on this webcast speak as of today.

We'll now begin the call with Hervé.

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we continued to execute well
across the various facets of our business, driving strong revenue growth, achieving success in regulatory
actions and in key clinical programs, while further improving our sound financial position. Jakafi grew
16% year-over-year to reach $474 million in the second quarter. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties also grew
nicely, up 16% and 35%, respectively. And I'm also pleased to be able to report 6 sources of product and
royalty revenues for the first time with the approvals of Pemazyre and Tabrecta. Total product and royalty
revenues were $593 million for the quarter, up 16% year-over-year.

We announced 2 product approvals since we reported Q1, including Tabrecta, which is licensed to Novartis.
And just recently, we received our first approval for Monjuvi in collaboration with MorphoSys. Monjuvi
is the first FDA-approved therapy for the second-line treatment of adults with DLBCL, and we believe
it has the potential to transform the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory disease. We also
announced the positive results of REACH3, which is the largest randomized clinical trial ever conducted in
steroid-refractory chronic GVHD patients. At EHA, we presented encouraging proof-of-concept data from
our ruxolitinib plus parsaclisib trial as well as updated 2-year data from the L-MIND trial, which confirms
durability of responses to tafasitamab. Our financial position is also very strong with $1.6 billion in cash
and equivalents at the end of the quarter.

Slide 5 shows our ongoing revenue momentum over the last several years, and we expect recent new
approval to add further to our top line. During the remainder of this year, we expect to maintain the
momentum of Jakafi in MPN and look to drive additional growth in GVHD. Furthermore, we are focusing on
executing successful launches of both Monjuvi and Pemazyre, and we expect Tabrecta royalties to increase

following the approvals and subsequent launches by Novartis in both the U.S. and Japan. Before the end of
2020, we plan to submit the NDA for ruxolitinib cream seeking approval in atopic dermatitis, and we also
expect to initiate the pivotal program of ruxolitinib plus parsaclisib in patients with myelofibrosis.

Before I hand over to Barry, I felt it's important to provide an overview of COVID-19 impact on our
business. On the revenue and supply side, we have not seen any material impact to-date. And on the
regulatory front, there has not been any impact on key time line. With regards to clinical development,
there has been no change to key late-stage programs since we reported Q1. While the original shutdowns
due to COVID-19 affected certain studies, the impact has been largely transient, and we remain on track
with key time lines. For example, while new patient recruitment in our vitiligo study has experienced a
slowdown early in the quarter, recruitment has since rebounded to pre pandemic levels. Therefore, we
continue to expect results in 2021.

In summary, since the beginning of 2020, we have announced 3 products approval and announced
positive results from 2 separate pivotal programs, REACH3 and TRuE-AD. These achievements on top of
strong commercial performance and excellent progress in clinical development are important parts of this
transformational year for Incyte.

I will now pass the call over to Barry.

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Thank you, Hervé, and good morning. Jakafi sales increased 16% year-over-year. We continue to see
robust demand across all 3 indications and a number of patients on therapy continues to grow. In April
and May, new patient starts were negatively impacted due to regional shutdowns related to COVID-19.
However, since June -- since early June, we have seen a rebound in new patient starts. Despite the
challenges of the pandemic, I am proud of our team for their efforts to continue providing the level
of service and responsiveness that our customers have been accustomed to over the years. We have
expanded our multichannel engagements, and our field representatives are continuing, are conducting
multiple virtual and digital programs with our customers.

Turning to Slide 9. We have been successful in identifying the appropriate patients, and there are already
more than 100 patients on therapy. We have not had any unexpected reimbursement issues, and patient
refill rates are encouraging. We have maintained a good depth of prescribers in both academic and
community settings, and we are proud to be able to provide these physicians with a much needed therapy
to help their patients. We're also excited about the approval of Monjuvi, the first FDA-approved second-
line treatment for adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Monjuvi is an important nonchemotherapeutic
option that has a convincing clinical profile as reflected in the clinical data included in the U.S. prescribing
information.

With compelling response rates and a long duration of response while avoiding many of the toxicities
associated with other forms of treatment, Monjuvi represents a significant opportunity to transform the
standard of care for patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Our commercial
and medical teams are fully staffed with joint Incyte MorphoSys team of approximately 150 full-time
equivalents. We have identified 11,000 potential prescribers which -- of which approximately 80% are also
Jakafi prescribers, executing successful launches for both Monjuvi and Pemazyre, and we expect Tabrecta
royalties to increase following the approvals and subsequent launches by Novartis in both the U.S. and
Japan.

Before the end of 2020, we plan to [Technical Difficulty] -- oh, sorry. We expect broad market access
for Monjuvi and already have patient assistance programs in place. While the challenges presented by
COVID-19 pandemic are not ideal for new patient launches, we believe Monjuvi's strong clinical profile, the
significant unmet need in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our company's combined
expertise leave us very well positioned for a successful launch.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steven.

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Thank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. Recently, we announced the success of our REACH3
trial evaluating ruxolitinib versus best available therapy in patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-
versus-host disease. This was the largest randomized trial ever conducted in this patient population and
the positive data reinforce the importance of JAK inhibition in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease.
Ruxolitinib met its primary endpoint of superior overall response rate at month 6 and achieved statistically
significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both key secondary endpoints, the modified Lee
chronic graft-versus-host disease symptom scale and failure-free survival. The safety profile of ruxolitinib
was consistent with previously reported studies of ruxolitinib in graft-versus-host disease. Following these
results, we expect to submit the data from REACH3 for presentation at an upcoming medical Congress,
and we are preparing the supplemental NDA submission to the FDA.

Turning to our LIMBER development program on Slide 13. As part of our life cycle management, we
have multiple strategies ongoing, including the development of a once-daily formulation of ruxolitinib,
combinations with ruxolitinib and potentially new targets, and we are making progress on all fronts. The
most advanced combination within LIMBER is our ruxolitinib plus parsaclisib program, and we recently
presented positive proof-of-concept data, which showed the additional benefit obtained from adding
5 milligrams of daily parsaclisib to ruxolitinib in myelofibrosis patients with an inadequate response
to ruxolitinib monotherapy. Importantly, the addition of parsaclisib was well tolerated and treatment-
emergent adverse events common to PI3 kinase delta inhibitors were infrequent with the addition of
parsaclisib. These results warrant further study of the combination, and we have plan to initiate ruxolitinib
plus parsaclisib trial in both first-line myelofibrosis patients and in MF patients with a suboptimal response
to ruxolitinib monotherapy.

Turning to Slide 14. In June, at the European Hematology Association, we presented updated 2-year data
from the L-MIND study of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide. These data were consistent with
prior presentations. The overall response rate in this data set was 59% and 41% of patients achieved
a complete response. The median duration of response for complete and partial responders collectively
was 34.6 months, driven by the median duration of response for complete responders, which has not yet
been reached. We hope and expect that the data from the L-MIND are only the beginning for tafasitamab.
Working with MorphoSys, we believe that we have multiple near-term opportunities in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas as shown in the summary slide.

Later this year, we expect to have initial results from our first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma trial,
First-MIND. Based on results from the study, we expect to select the appropriate combination, either
tafasitamab plus R-CHOP or tafasitamab plus lenalidomide plus R-CHOP, and move forward into a pivotal
first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma trial in 2021. We also expect to initiate a proof-of-concept study
evaluating tafasitamab plus parsaclisib in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma before the end of this year.

Turning now to our development programs in inflammation and autoimmunity. As Hervé mentioned
upfront, our development time lines for ruxolitinib cream remain on track as we continue to collect long-
term safety data from our 2 pivotal atopic dermatitis studies and plan to submit the NDA at the end of
2020. The Phase III vitiligo trials are now recruiting very well, and new patient enrollment has rebounded
since a dip at the beginning of the second quarter. We remain on track for results in 2021.

We have made significant progress within our key development programs thus far in 2020. We have
announced 3 product approvals this year and have presented positive data from multiple programs. We
continue to expect to have data in-house from the ongoing pharmacology studies of once-a-day ruxolitinib
in 2020. While a transient COVID related delay means the external presentation of these data won't be
until next year, these data are not on the critical path, and we are still on track for an sNDA submission
seeking approval of once-a-day ruxolitinib in 2021. We also have decided to discontinue development of
our PIM inhibitor and its combination trial with ruxolitinib. Lastly, a reminder of the various COVID trials
that are underway, including studies of both ruxolitinib and baricitinib.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. The financial update this morning will include GAAP and
non-GAAP numbers. For a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, please refer to Slides 25 and 27 in the
backup section of the deck and to the press release we issued this morning.

Moving to our results for the second quarter. Revenue growth continued to be strong, with total product
and royalty revenues of $593 million, representing an increase of 16% over the second quarter of 2019.
This is comprised of net product revenues of $474 million for Jakafi, $23 million for Iclusig and $4
million for Pemazyre. Royalties from Novartis of $66 million for Jakavi and $1 million for Tabrecta and
royalties from Lilly of $26 million for Olumiant. We recorded revenue growth across both the products
commercialized by Incyte and those commercialized by our partners, with the exception of Iclusig, where
we recorded a 7% decline in revenues as a result of some stocking that we experienced in the first quarter
of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Total revenues increased 30% over the prior year quarter driven by both the increase in product and
royalty revenues as well as $95 million of milestone revenue related to the approvals of Tabrecta and
Pemazyre. Total cost and expenses for the quarter of $400 million on a non-GAAP basis represent an
increase of 5% over the prior year quarter, well below the growth rate in product and royalty revenues.
Ongoing R&D expense for the quarter was $250 million on a non-GAAP basis, representing a 6% increase
from the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to our 55% share of the global and U.S.-
specific development costs for tafasitamab, the clinical trials of ruxolitinib as a potential therapy for
COVID-19 and other pipeline programs progressing to later stages of development.

SG&A expense for the quarter was $104 million on a non-GAAP basis, representing a 12% increase
over the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to an increase in commercialization efforts
related to Jakafi and Pemazyre and preparation for the potential commercialization of ruxolitinib cream.
Collaboration loss for the quarter was $13 million, which represents our 50% share of the U.S. net
commercialization loss for Monjuvi. Our financial position continues to be strong as we ended the quarter
with $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. The decrease from $2.1 billion at 2019 year-end
reflects the upfront payment and stock purchase related to the MorphoSys collaboration, partially offset by
the cash flow generated during the first half of 2020.

Moving on to our guidance for 2020, we are reiterating our revenue and expense guidance for the year.
While there continue to be uncertainties associated with COVID-19, including risk of a broader resurgence,
we believe these are capturing the ranges provided. As a reminder, the R&D guidance excludes the $805
million upfront consideration related to our collaboration with MorphoSys. Finally, at this early stage of
their launches, we are not providing guidance on Pemazyre sales or on our collaboration net profit or loss
resulting from the commercialization activities for Monjuvi in the U.S.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Vikram Purohit from Morgan Stanley.

Vikram Purohit
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I had 2 questions on the LIMBER program. First, I just wanted to see if you could talk a bit more about
what you saw in the initial PIM plus RUX data that led you to the decision to discontinue that facet of the
LIMBER program? And then, secondly, for the RUX plus PI3K combination studies, you're looking to start in
the first-line and the refractory setting. I just wanted to see if you could talk a bit more about what those
studies would look like from a design perspective and how you're thinking about what the initial bar for
success there is going to be.

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Vikram, it's Steven. Thanks for your question. In terms of the PIM RUX program, as far as we know, we
were the sort of last PIM inhibitor left standing across R&D programs. And it's largely due to on target
effects in terms of the liver and transaminitis. And we weren't able to get the PIM dose much above 80
milligrams. And then if you look at that tolerability profile in combination with some of the efficacy we've
seen, although interesting and preclinically very interesting, it wasn't a program that we felt had high
chance of success going forward. So for those 2 reasons, both tolerability in terms of liver and reaching
adequate efficacy bars.

Turning to the RUX delta program, as we alluded to in our remarks, this is our lead program. We've shown
our internal proof-of-concept data. We explored various dosing and schedule regimens. And clearly, there's
a delta effect. If you go back to the biology, PI3-kinase delta as a pathway is upregulated in myelofibrosis,
with preclinical data that makes sense. And in terms of the clinical effect we've seen although very strictly
defined in our proof-of-concept that patients had to have been on 6 months of RUX and a stable dose for
a couple of months. Even with that, we saw increased spleen response as well as symptom responses. So
we're initiating 2 studies, a suboptimal responder RUX study, as we've spoken about for people who've
been on at least 3 months and they're not having an adequate RUX response as well as a first line study.
In terms of the endpoints, you're going to have to wait for the ClinTrials.gov listings to go up when we
start these studies before we make those public. They should be relatively obvious for the first-line study
and then the suboptimal responder study that will go up on that particular listing.

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.

Cory William Kasimov
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Wanted to ask you around GVHD. And can you just kind of describe next steps and time line we should be
thinking about on -- for the chronic GVHD opportunity and expanding the label for the syndication? And
would you expect more -- I know you're not going to market to, but would you expect more spontaneous
use in this setting, even ahead of approval, given the promising REACH3 data and the unmet need that's
out there?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

So Cory, I'll start off and then the second part of your question, Barry, will take. I assume you're alluding
to the REACH3 study that we have recently press released the outcomes. It's an outstanding outcome for
patients and for us in terms of hitting both the primary, very strictly defined overall response rate endpoint

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

at month 6, plus failure-free survival and the PRO, the patient-reported outcome, in terms of the modified
Lee symptom score. So a great outcome for that. Obviously, we will -- we filed REACH2 as well now. Now
we'll be going ahead with filing REACH3 as a supplemental NDA as soon as we can in terms of getting it
into the label. Just -- I don't know if you were talking also about steroid naïve chronic graft-versus-host
disease. That work with itacitinib continues this year in terms of dose exploration. We're looking at various
doses and schedules plus the steroid effect there before initiating further work with itacitinib there. So
across the entire spectrum of graft-versus-host disease, we're still very active, both with filing and then
with itacitinib in steroid naïve. In terms of your question, well, Barry?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Cory, yes, in terms of spontaneous use in chronic GVHD, obviously, we know that there's already some
use in chronic GVHD with Jakafi. And I think because we only released sort of the top line results from
REACH3, not until there's a full presentation or publication will the awareness increase. At that time, some
additional spontaneous use may occur. But we'll have to wait and see.

Cory William Kasimov
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And Barry, did you see any major impact from COVID on the GVHD front to your transplants that
were presumably taking place?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Well, we certainly saw a decrease in new patients. So as you know, Cory, new patient starts really
represents a relatively small part of the total number of patients that are on Jakafi. So we do know that
bone marrow transplants were delayed. We saw a decrease, perhaps, in April and May. And we know that
patients that need a bone marrow transplant have to come back when they're feeling more safe and when
their disease requires it. So as more bone marrow transplants go up then GVHD will go up.

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets.

Brian Corey Abrahams
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Maybe a follow-up question also for Barry. Can you talk about any shifts in growth patterns that you
saw with Jakafi maybe across the other 2 indications due to corona? I guess I'm curious if there's any
inventory impact that you're seeing or any patient level stockpiling, changes in compliance or persistence?
And then would you expect to see any changes now with the pandemic rebounding in July and August to
the overall patterns of Jakafi use?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Sure, Brian. Well, I don't think that the percentage of patients who are taking Jakafi for PV GVHD and
myelofibrosis has really changed at all due to COVID. Now we do know, as I said, particularly in certain
regions, you can imagine East Coast, particularly New York and New Jersey, you saw new patient starts for
each of these indications go down. In June and now in July, we have seen week after week small increases
in new patient starts, but new patients starts are relatively small in each given quarter and each given
month anyway. But we have seen week after week starting in June new patient starts coming back. So
again, we haven't really seen any movement in 1 area versus another in terms of total amount of bottles
sold.

Our next question is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Salveen Jaswal Richter
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So as we look towards proof-of-concept data from the oral PD-L1 inhibitor later this year, can you help
frame expectations on the type of data we'll see? And what level of activity you're looking for to move
forward?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Salveen, it's Steven. Thanks for the question. So in terms of our oral PD-L1 program, we've been
progressing well, and we're in this phase now where the second half of this year from our clinical program
we'll be able to present translational data from the actual clinical specimens to show directionally the right
degree of PD-L1 inhibition, T cell changes that we want, et cetera, that are supportive of continuing the
program. Substantive clinical data in its entirety will be more likely next year. But all the data we have in
hand and that we presented in the second half of this year and the appropriate median are supportive of
continuing.

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Evan Seigerman from Crédit Suisse.

Evan David Seigerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congrats on a really great week with strong results today and the approval of Monjuvi late last Friday. So
just on Pemazyre in the tumor-agnostic setting, can you just remind us of the status of this program? I
can't remember if you mentioned it earlier. Is it also delayed as with the bladder trial? And then any color
on the penetration into the eligible patient population in cholangiocarcinoma following the launch earlier
this year?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Evan, Steven, thanks. So in terms of your question, actually, the tumor-agnostic program has not been
affected by COVID much at all. It enrolled in extremely well, probably speaking to an extreme unmet need
there. So it's across various fusions in terms of the molecular biology as well as rearrangements as well
as testing if there's any activity in amplifications as well. So there are different buckets we fill up that are
histology agnostic, and that's progressing well. You spoke a little bit about the bladder program. The data
we will be getting in the second half of the year will complete the continuous dosing experiment. But in
terms of presenting the data, it will be next year. So that's the status of the bladder program. And then I'll
turn it over to Barry.

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Sure, Evan. So you talk about penetration. I think I said in my prepared remarks that there was over 100
patients treated already. And actually, we know that there's more -- most of those patients have come
back for refills as well. So they're continuing. So the duration of therapy is something that we'll continue
to follow. But even the $4 million that we reported in this quarter and the more than 100 patients on
therapy right now is ahead of what we predicted internally.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America.

Tazeen Ahmad
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I just wanted to get a sense perhaps on how you're thinking about the first-line study. Is there a particular
combination of the 2 that you're looking at that you would prefer as it relates to specifically lenalidomide?

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Is it somewhat of a priority to potentially avoid having that in the combo, given its side effects profile and
its possibility, or I'd like to hear your thoughts of how that might impact some patients' desire to be on
therapy?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Yes. It's Steven. Thanks for your question. If you look at first-line diffuse B-cell lymphoma, standard of
care remains R-CHOP with approximately a 40%, 50% care rate -- cure rates. Many have tried to beat
that and hasn't been easy historically in the past to do that. So it's really about upfront efficacy and
improving the cure rate. That's what you have to achieve to beat that bar. So -- and a little bit maybe
in terms of sacrificing tolerability because it's about cure upfront. So we'll see. The safety data, as we
said on the call yesterday, will be key, looking at either tafasitamab alone, plus the R-CHOP regimen
or tafasitamab plus len plus the R-CHOP regimen. If the safety ends up and we'll get the data by the
end of this year, being is mostly a wash, and there's no increased talks that's worrying from the doublet
with R-CHOP, that may be the way we end up going because it's about getting to the efficacy bar. As the
MorphoSys CMO said with us on the call yesterday, this is still subject to getting that data in-house and
then regulatory discussion on the appropriate endpoint. So those are the caveats there. But I just want
to reiterate. You have to win on efficacy here. You have to improve the cure rate in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma upfront.

Barry, just to follow-up on your comments about the Pemazyre launch and kind of the success relative to
your internal expectations. I guess, what learnings have you had on kind of a virtual launch about things
that are working, maybe some things that aren't working and how are those going to get applied to the
launch of tafasitamab?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Yes, Marc. I think we learned a lot, actually. And I think we -- despite this pandemic, we learned things
that really work that we'll keep doing. Virtual programs, virtual visits, virtual speaker programs, virtual
advisory boards, all of these things work. For Pemazyre, we really targeted the physicians that we wanted
to target ahead of time that we know are GI docs that specialize in cholangiocarcinoma, liver cancer and
so forth. And we were able to reach them virtually through our representatives. And then, of course,
before that, our medical affairs people had relationships with these docs and our oncology clinical nurse
educators helped them manage the dosing and side effects. And they were each able to reach out to
them. What we also learned about Pemazyre about a new launch during this time period and I think
it relates to Monjuvi very much is that docs want to hear about new launches and how to use drugs.
Particularly Pemazyre is being used for -- first approved drug for a patient population that's never had
anything that was really effective before. And in terms of Monjuvi, the first drug approved for second-

Okay. And then just on the initial demand you're seeing, is that all in cholangiocarcinoma? Are you already

tolerate the available inhibitor in the bladder cancer?

Our next question today is coming from Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.

Alethia Rene Young
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

Congrats on all the progress. I just wanted to ask you a question on the CITADEL program, and now that
you have the combination data. It looks interesting, kind of wanted to talk about your kind of focus on
monotherapy there. And then can you just kind of talk a little bit about kind of continued investment for
AD heading into the upcoming launch for the RUX cream thing?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

So Alethia, I'll start off. It's Steven, on your first question related to the CITADEL program. So all the
studies have enrolled really well, follicular, mantle cell and marginal zone. We presented data at various
points along the route for all 3 histologies. We have in the range of the high activity we wanted as well
as the durability of response that we wanted. So we will get that in-house, and we will proceed with
appropriate regulatory filings for monotherapy in the different parts of the world where it's relevant. They
are all likely to be under accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorizations. And we'll need,
as you allude to, confirmatory programs, and those are likely to be in combination, the designs of which
still need further refinement and discussion with regulators but they're likely to include combinations with
CD20 or even CD19 antibodies, given that we are treating lymphomas. And then I'll hand the question
over about the investment related to the launch.

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Yes. So Alethia, I guess you were asking about the continuing investment in AD related to the launch.
Obviously, it's AD and vitiligo because we anticipate vitiligo could be relatively soon after we get approval
for atopic dermatitis. But I think Hervé said multiple times that we're building a separate business unit
for dermatology or autoimmune diseases. So we already have on board a good part of our medical affairs
team, our market access team. We're building out the commercial organization. So that's our continuing
investment. And obviously, we're really getting ready because we believe that RUX cream could really
transform the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the United States.

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

Regarding just -- so that's for the U.S., where the situation is very clear. Regarding the rest of the world,
in Europe, we are looking at a scenario where, in fact, vitiligo could be the first indication that we would
be submitting. So the timing for Europe is slightly different from what we have in the U.S., like more than
slightly. It can be a few months behind. And we are still looking at the best commercial deployment there.

Mara Goldstein
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I had a question just on retifanlimab and the status of where you are from a clinical trial perspective. And
which data from the POD1UM program are we likely to see initially? And then, secondarily, is there an
update on the Jakafi COVID-19 program for CRS?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Yes. In terms of retifanlimab, our IV PD-1 inhibitor, the niche programs have, again, all enrolled incredibly
well. Squamous cell anal carcinoma, MSI-high endometrial and the Merkel cell program, we intend to
submit data from Merkel and anal cell carcinoma at a medical meeting second half of this year. And that's
when that data will be public. In terms of RUX in COVID-19, just a reminder. There are 2 programs.
There's 1 in conjunction with Novartis globally called RUXCOVID. Those -- that's in patients that are pre
mechanical ventilation, but have evidence of cytokine storm and is looking at RUX 5 milligrams twice
daily, plus standard of care versus standard of care. It's in 400 patients. The primary endpoint for that
study was the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure or require ICU care by day 29.
And that's progressing well. And obviously, we hope to have data, a complete study with an endpoint and
report out before the end of the year.

The second study we run in ourselves largely in the United States is the ventilator study. So it's again
adults with COVID-19 associated respiratory failure who are on ventilation. It has 2 dosage arms in terms
of RUX, a 5-milligram BID arm and a 15-milligram BID arm, both with standard of care versus standard of
care. And that is tracking a little bit behind in terms of enrollment, largely because there's less ventilation
than there was with people who are trying to avoid that. So again, we hope to have data before the end
of the year, but it's hard to tell you exactly when at the moment. The N on that study, just to remind you,
was a little larger. So that was 500 patients because there's 3 arms. And the primary endpoint was a very
clean one, was overall survival due to any course through day 29. So that's the status of those studies.

Our next question is coming from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer.

Jay Olson
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the progress. I wanted to follow-up on the LIMBER program where you've tightened up the
focus a little by discontinuing RUX plus PIM and you're moving RUX plus parsa into pivotal trials. But you
still have quite a few shots on goal. So I was wondering which of those are you most excited about with
the highest probability of success and the greatest clinical differentiation?.

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Yes, Jay, it's Steven. So it's an extremely important program to us for all the obvious reasons. Plus we
have a lot of scientific ownership of the myeloproliferative neoplasm space, just even beyond ruxolitinib,
the diseases we feel very passionately about. Just remind you, the LIMBER program has 3 pillars to it.
The first 1 is the formulation work, which we spoke about in our prepared remarks. And the once-daily
formulation work is going well, and we intend to file that sNDA next year. And we believe that is important
in itself and also potentially from a convenience point of view. And it may lend itself down the pike to us
doing fixed-dose combinations with other once-daily mechanisms.

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

In terms of the second arm, which are ways to either enhance efficacy in a particular disease setting or
safety or both, those programs, the lead 1 is the RUX plus parsaclisib program. Again, we spoke about
in the prepared remarks. We feel we have internal proof-of-concept data, and we're initiating both the
suboptimal responder to RUX study as well as the first-line myelofibrosis study this year. The other
programs that are really important to us are our resurrected BET inhibitor program, so we're doing in
monotherapy work this year, just to prove safety at the dose we've chosen. And then we'll very quickly
go to combination to work there. And we'll see where that leads us. Again, that could be potentially in a
second-line setting as well as in a first-line setting.

And then, very importantly, although on the surface, looks like a tolerability play in terms of the ALK2
inhibitor, and the hepcidin mechanism in improving anemia, either due to the underlying disease,
myelofibrosis or due to the effect of a JAK inhibitor, not only if that works, should it improve the anemia,
but then it will also allow patients to stay on RUX longer and should improve efficacy as well. So that is in,
again, monotherapy safety now and should also go to combination, hopefully, by the end of this year. And
then the third pillar, which for obvious reasons, we speak less about, but is all around discovery efforts
run out of Dash's shop looking at other ways, other new targets, epigenetic targets or other ways that we
may be interested in even in PVR itself. And those will obviously be announced if and when they get to the
clinic. So that's the entirety of the program.

Our next question is coming from Tyler Van Buren from Piper Sandler.

Tyler Martin Van Buren
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Great to see the quarterly results, especially in light of the ongoing pandemic. I had a question on the
Jakafi product revenue guidance, which was reiterated and seems very conservative. You mentioned that
new patient starts have rebounded in June. You have a growing pool of total patients and robust demand
in all 3 indications. Yet the midpoint of the guidance assumes relatively flat quarter-over-quarter growth
on an absolute basis. And if you look at the top end of the guidance, it's still lower year-over-year growth
rates or a deceleration in the second half. So it's just factoring in the ongoing uncertainty due to the
pandemic? Or are there any potential year-over-year pressures that the guidance is factoring that we
should also consider?

Christiana Stamoulis
Executive VP & CFO

Tyler, you are absolutely right. If you look at Jakafi in the first half of the year, we grew 19% when you
compare to the first half of 2019, with the growth primarily coming -- over 70% of this growth coming
from volume, from demand. So if you were to look at this, you would think that at this point in the year
we would be, if anything, bringing up the low end of the guidance. The low end of the guidance implies a
flat Q3 and Q4 to Q2. So given the significant uncertainty that remains around COVID-19, the risk for a
broader resurgence we felt that this year it's appropriate to keep the guidance to where we had set it to
keep a broader guidance at this point in the year to be able to address any potential impact that we may
see from a resurgence in COVID-19.

Was positive REACH3 data reflected in your long-term guidance for $3 billion peak sales of Jakafi? And are

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Hervé here, I'll take it. So obviously, the REACH3 results are very positive. And it's -- I won't say more
than expected, but it's certainly a very good study. You will have the opportunity to see the results when
they are published. And the question of what does it mean in term of long-term guidance came up when
we saw the results. So I think your question is totally appropriate. We have said in the past, $2.5 billion
to $3 billion for Jakafi. You can see where this year is going. So we are sort of ahead of the curve, if you
look at it from that standpoint. What we also looked at is political uncertainty and the fact that in the U.S.,
there are a number of questions still open related to the health care system in general and reimbursement
of products. So I think the best way to think about it is probably to see how this is evolving. Also see the
data that we have in REACH3 publicly, and then it will give us with both of them an opportunity to look
again at the long-term guidance if we need, and that's again, something that would be after the end of
this year.

The second question is dermatology. So you know we are very excited. I must say, over the past few
months, we have had a number of advisory board and sessions of feedback with dermatologists in the
U.S. and in Europe on the profile of RUX cream. And that has made us evolve our expectation from that
franchise. Because what we are hearing from them is that there are no other product that is providing
that level of efficacy that you saw in TRuE-AD and obviously, the lack of systemic exposure and the
level of safety that you can expect from a topical. So it's not really -- in the category of the other topical
product, it is a product that has the potential to be transformative. So we are looking at it now with a
new eye in term of how big it could be. We still have the vitiligo study that is, as Steven was describing,
moving very quickly. So it gives us a potential submission in 2020 for AD, approval in 2021, submission
in vitiligo and then approval in vitiligo. So there is already a sort of a cycle of new product that is coming
for the next 2 years. And we are obviously looking at other products that could be complementing the
franchise. Internally, we have programs ongoing with our own group of products that have potentially an
immunomodulating potential, so that could apply to many indication. And we are also looking at external
opportunities for what would be good science applied to dermatology that could be complementing the
portfolio. So there is literally a new division of insight that is being built now that will be starting with RUX
cream, and I think could have a very important potential over the next 5 years to add to the growth that
we have in cancer and oncology and hematology.

Our next question today is coming from Ren Benjamin from JMP Securities.

Reni John Benjamin
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. Can we talk a little bit about the patent extension strategies? I see that once-
daily can definitely seems to make sense and can extend, obviously, your patents there. But how do
we think about these combinations that are being evaluated, particularly in the LIMBER study? Do they
ultimately have to be developed as once-daily formulations as well to continue to extend the patents?

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

The patent instance from RUX, I would not comment on that. So what is, obviously, part of our plan is
to improve our ruxolitinib from the clinical and the patient benefit standpoint, and to do it in a way that
will help us extend the life of our franchise in MF and PV and potentially in GVHD. So the QD is very
important for 2 reasons, is that by itself, it has a longer patent than we have with twice a day. And it is
also a way to do combination with other once-a-day products that we have in our portfolio. And when
you think of 2 oral products being once a day, then you're obviously looking at the possibility of doing
fixed-dose combination. And if the product you are combining with has a patent life that goes beyond
the patent of Jakafi, ruxolitinib itself, it's obviously increasing the exclusivity that you have on this fixed-
dose combination. So you can think of ALK and parsaclisib and BET as potential partners for ruxolitinib
that we are testing in the clinic, first, to establish the superiority from the clinical standpoint, and then
that could give us an opportunity to develop fixed dose combination, if possible, that would be certainly
helping maintain the leadership that we have in the field of MF, PV and GVHD. So that's really the way we
are looking at it.

Aydin Huseynov
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

I have 1 on Monjuvi. So given this is a combinational agent given that REVLIMID is already expensive
drug, I think, more than $20,000. Do you expect any pay resistance or impediments, especially in budget
conscious EU pay environments such as [ Knights ] and French authorities?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

So I'll take the first part of the question, address the United States and Hervé can address outside the
United States. So we think the combination of this injectable and oral drug together is priced appropriately
for the benefit that the regimen provides. If you look to other analogs, for example, particularly in multiple
myeloma, injectable drugs that are combined with REVLIMID or approximately the same price per month
per year, and others are actually priced higher. If you compare it to CAR-T therapies, obviously, there are
many different complications there, but obviously, that's in the same sort of price range for per patient.
And Hervé?

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

Just to comment on the EU. The cycle of patent expiration for lenalidomide is different in the EU. There
are generics already available in a number of countries already today. And when we look at the approval
-- timing for approval and reimbursement timing for Monjuvi or tafasitamab in Europe, in fact, it is almost
coincidental that it is when lenalidomide is going generic in many of the large countries. So what we
anticipate is to be negotiating the price as we have to do in all of these countries in Europe at the time
where the cost of lenalidomide will be going down very drastically. So it should be -- it's a little bit by
chance, but it should be a good timing to be able to have a reasonable good price for tafasitamab in
Europe.

Aydin Huseynov
The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division

Appreciate it. And I have 1 follow-up regarding Jakafi. So how would you compare the performance of
Jakafi versus Jakavi in Europe? Because both showed 16% growth, but Jakavi actual sales only grew 9%.
And just was curious what's the MF growth in Jakafi -- Jakafi indications MF growth?

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

The comment on Jakavi in Europe versus Jakafi in the U.S., I think what we have seen since the launch
is sort of a classical curve where, obviously, the volumes are higher, the price are lower in -- outside of
the U.S. That's sort of a general statement on all of these products. And Novartis has done an excellent

16

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

job to ensure that Jakavi became standard of care in MF and PV. The GVHD launch has not been yet
done in Europe. GVHD, the decision was to submit together REACH2 and REACH3. So there are 2 large
-- largest ever pivotal studies that would be used for the submission Europe and outside of the U.S., in
fact, in general, that will be used together. The reason to do that is related to pricing because every new
indication is leading to price reduction. So the decision was made by Novartis to do it together. And now
that we know the results of REACH3 are fantastic, it is certainly a very good decision. So we will see the
GVHD expansion happen later than what we have seen in the U.S. But overall, I must say the growth ex
U.S. and U.S. has been, first, exceeding expectations for both sides and has been very parallel in term of
how MF and PV have been evolving. So it's a story of good partnerships that, frankly, now for 10 years has
been working very well.

George Farmer

Okay. Great. I'd like to talk more about your strategy with parsaclisib in RUX and in MF. And how do you
see that combination fitting in kind of with other JAK inhibitors?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

It's Steven. So again, just to reiterate, the program, as we're setting it up. So there will be 2 studies. The
first-line study would be in RUX plus parsa versus RUX. So if it ends up down the pike being successful,
then that particular combination would become the standard of care there. In terms of the suboptimal
responder study, that is for patients who've been on at least 3 months of ruxolitinib at a stable dose,
but are having a very carefully defined inadequate response in terms of spleen volume reduction and/
or symptoms. And then you add on parsaclisib to that particular patient profile and looking for added
benefit. The endpoint for that, as I said earlier, we will announce when the study goes live and will go
up on ClinTrials.gov. But it's a very different patient segment because these are people who have had
inadequate response to ruxolitinib. If you play this out in your head, if the first-line study wins and is more
efficacious, then there are less patients with inadequate responders down the pike. So that's how you
work out the patient flow through the various lines of therapy in myelofibrosis.

George Farmer
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Great. And then, Hervé, could you comment a little bit more on how we should think about
launching RUX for atopic dermatitis in Europe in the meantime? And you had said that maybe you'd file for
vitiligo or maybe launch ahead of -- with vitiligo ahead of AD. Can you just clarify that?

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I said that because there was a discussion on how the price will be impacted by the sequence of
launch. And what we believe today -- and I'm not -- you never know what can happen. But at this point,
what it looks like is that if we do a sequence of atopic derm followed by vitiligo, we will end up with
reimbursement that will be very much lower than if we do vitiligo first. So that's what we are now thinking

the U.S., if we start with vitiligo.

Our next question today is coming from Stephen Willey from Stifel.

Stephen Douglas Willey
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Maybe for Steven. I guess your comments around endpoint selection in the inadequate RUX responders
trial maybe implies like there's still some regulatory dialogue that's ongoing there. I think AbbVie just
posted details around the Phase III transform study in the relapsed/refractory setting, and it looks
like they're using SVR35 as a primary. I guess, should we think about this as a surrogate of regulatory
flexibility around the potential use of lower SVR thresholds?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Yes. I'm not going to satisfy you with my response because you'll have to wait for the outcome when we
publish it. But we did see they publish their endpoint at an SVR 35% decrease in the second line. That is
the established endpoint that we established in the first line, as you well know, and that's no secret likely
to be the endpoint in any further first-line studies at the moment. So you'll just have to wait to see what
we -- we have completed our negotiations with regulators, and we're all set to go, but you'll have to wait
until we put it up. Thanks.

An editorial associated with the recent Lancet publication on topical RUX and vitiligo, it does bring up the
acne side effect of the potential limitation, given a lot of exposure to the face. So I was just wondering
if there's any temporal nature of acne. Is it associated with similar exposure? Or was it more transient?
And then does this -- do you guys think this has any potential commercial impact mainly on duration of
therapy?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Yes. It's Steven. I'll comment a little bit. We haven't seen a temporal link per se in terms of the onset of
some acne, nor has it been particularly problematic, so from the data we have thus far in the proof-of-
concept study, that's the conclusion. Obviously, as we've been telling you, we're enrolling now 2 large
Phase IIIs. It'll be north of 600 patients total with longer follow-up, and we'll see how that plays out.
But it's just not something that -- other than the adverse event being reported, which is important for

Yes. Thank you for mentioning our bispecific program. No, there -- it's a very interesting doublet from a
biology point of view. It's 4-1BB or CD137 is the target coupled with PD-L1. So 4-1BB has a long history in
the past of other companies trying it on its own and ran into toxicity, particularly liver tox. So the coupling
with PD-L1 was done as a delivery mechanism to take that 4-1BB to PD-L1 expression areas. And the
theory bean would avoid the associated toxicity plus then get the enhanced efficacy either additive or
synergy wise. And the program is going well. We'll present data probably next year. We won't see data
this year from it. But it continues to go well. There is a tremendous amount of interest from people who
work in the field around it. And the sort of ball's in our hand, so to speak, to get to a safe dose and then
