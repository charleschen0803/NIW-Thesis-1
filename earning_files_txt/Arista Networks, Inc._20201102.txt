Operator

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Arista Networks Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the
Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Curtis
McKee, Director of Corporate and Investor Development. Sir, you may begin.

Curtis McKee
Head of Corporate & Investor Development

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call
are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief
Financial Officer.

This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter
ending September 30, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our
website.

During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking
statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2020 fiscal
year, longer-term financial outlooks for 2021 and beyond, our total addressable market and strategy for
addressing these market opportunities, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, our product
innovation, and the benefits of recent acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we
discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically in our most recent Form 10-Q and Form
10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.
These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our
views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call.

Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis
and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release.

With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Curtis. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our third quarter 2020 earnings
call.

To start with, we all hope that you and your families are safe during the global pandemic. At Arista, we
recognize our role and responsibility in supporting global communications and cloud infrastructure during
these challenging times. We are working closely with our employees, supply chain contract manufacturers,
customers and Arista Foundation to assist in business continuity initiatives and people's lives.

Back to Q3 2020. We delivered $605.4 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP earnings per share of
$2.42. [ New product ] services and software and support renewals contributed approximately 21% of
revenue. Our non-GAAP gross margins were 64.6%, influenced by software and services mix and a higher
Asia Pacific contribution.

We registered a record number of new customer logos this quarter and $1 million customers, a direct
result of our momentum in the enterprise vertical and campus traction this quarter.

In Q3 2020, cloud titans was our largest vertical. The enterprise is once again consistently our second
largest performer, followed by Tier 2 cloud service providers and financials tied for third place and
service providers in fourth place. With respect to sector trends, cloud titans are now approximately 37%;

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

enterprise and financials also are approximately 37%; and providers, which is our cloud service providers
combination, is approximately at 26%.

What is clear is Arista's cloud principles now apply to all sectors, and we are diversifying well across
customers and verticals.

In terms of geography mix, international contribution was 25%, with the Americas at 75%. The European
business recovered from Q2, and the Asia business has had a particularly strong quarter.

In the absence of a physical Analyst Day this year, we would like to shed some light on our strategy for
addressing our $30-plus billion TAM. The past decade can be best characterized by Arista's momentum in
cloud networking. But in the past 4 quarters, we have experienced a triad storm of cloud titan volatility,
COVID pandemic and deferred revenue-related comps. Despite this tough reset year, we believe Arista will
emerge stronger, not only returning to double-digit growth in 2021, but also aiming for consistent growth
in the years beyond. We expect our multiyear growth cycle from 3 major product line contributors: one,
our core cloud and data center products, our largest business, building upon our flagship Arista EOS, with
the hallmarks of leaf spine topology across our 5 major verticals.

Two, our second market is the network adjacencies, with routing replacing routers and our recent entry
into the Cognitive Campus workspaces. The routing market consists of core spine, edge and peering use
cases for Tier 1, 2, 3 service, cloud and enterprises. The campus brings a cognitive unified edge for wired
and WiFi endpoints as well as new IoT devices in a 2-tier leaf spine or spline network. We do expect to
disrupt the campus and router incumbency of the last few decades in the next few years.

Our third category is network software and services based on software subscription models, such as Arista
A-Care, CloudVision, CloudEOS router for multi-cloud, big switch monitoring and our latest entry into
advanced network detection and response with the acquisition of Awake Security.

Elaborating on our focus on subscription-based software, this product line is typically multiyear contracts.
Customers are driving mandates for network automation, monitoring, visibility across their data sets.
We believe the recent acquisition of Awake Security is a strategic contributor that transforms the silo
aspect of security into a seamless, secure network. The moment the cloud blurs the perimeter and the
increased use of IoT and shadow IT means that our CIOs and CFOs need a network [ ground of fruits ].
Simply storing the raw data or alerts isn't comprehensible data. A new AI-driven, data-driven, state-
driven software stack like Arista provides is foundational. In our opinion, the security industry is going
through a metamorphosis from point security to proactive, predictive, secure networking. CloudVision,
combined with Arista's 2020 acquisitions of Big Switch Networks for observability and Awake Security for
autonomous threat hunting are very natural software additions to this category.

The Cognitive Campus is a priority for Arista's adjacent product line. We are witnessing a massive
transition in the COVID era to work from home where the boundary between the office, the home, the
teleworker transit and the user is blurring into elastic and flexible workspaces. Arista's recent introduction
of the Cognitive Campus is a state- and data-driven model coupled with a unified dashboard for wired
and wireless edge for next-generation zero-touch campus deployments. This combined with the Awake
network detection and response security, feeds into our campus visibility flow tracker for both IoT and OT
applications.

We do expect our campus portfolio to double by the end of 2021 as we invest in both engineering and go-
to-market model. A fitting example is today's announcement of our flagship 750 Series campus chassis,
delivering a combination of industry-leading chassis, density, performance for high-definition video, fail
over resilience for rolling upgrades, cognitive PoE and secure encryption.

I would like to invite Andy Bechtolsheim, our Founder and Chief Development Officer, to highlight our
launch today. Andy?

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Yes. We like markets that are ripe for real innovation, and the campus networking market is a prime
example of that. With the launch of our 750 series modular chassis, we are introducing a next-generation
platform, which delivers more performance, more security, more visibility and more power capabilities
than any other product in its class. The 750 has 400 gigabits per second uplift throughput, which is 5x
the performance of our nearest competitor. This level of performance is key to support WiFi 6, where each
access point has up to 5 gigabit throughput.

With a single 750 chassis, we can support a full complement of 384 WiFi 6 access points. In addition, the
750 offers MACsec encryption on every port, which supports secure communication from the WiFi through
the entire campus network. The 750 also breaks new ground in density, being 3U more compact than our
closest competitor. Combined with the legendary reliability of Arista's EOS offering system, the 750 offers
unmatched performance, security, availability, visibility and power handling.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Andy. That was great. I'm excited. I could use one at home.

Next-generation routing is another key adjacent market for us, whereby we're bringing the union of 2
box-level approaches, layer 2 switches and layer 3 routers, together for rich protocol support, resiliency,
scale and programmability. This has been a 4- to 5-year endeavor for us to bring disruptive economics via
advanced merchant silicon and Arista's modern software stack EOS.

It's time to see the fruits of this labor. Arista customers now see us as a compelling and cloud and carrier-
grade routing alternative to expensive legacy routers. We're extending beyond classical leaf spine intra DC
use cases to multi terabit routing offering lower power and higher density interconnect, accelerating WAN
and inter-DC routing use cases.

Our investments in the simplification of Arista's routing stack with standards-based EVP and BTP and
segment routing are yielding early traction. We have won a few important Tier 2, Tier 3 service provider
customers for many of these use cases, including Spine interconnect, multi-access edge, layer 2, layer 3
VPNs and peering use cases.

Our core universal cloud network design for data center continues to expand with Arista as the pioneer.
We have been the market leader, driving to the #1 position in the 100 gigabit ethernet switching market
and early leadership in 400-gig with flexible software partnerships for SONiC open [ cloud network ] and
FBOSS with our cloud titan customers. We have been pushing the envelope of storage, compute and
AI clusters at cloud scale. This quarter, we delivered our vision managed in a time series state-driven
database as a network-wide service hosted in the cloud. Clearly, we're enabling cloud principles across
the entire enterprise, with 5 As of agility, availability, automation, analytics and an AI- and API-driven
network.

Anshul Sadana, our Chief Operating Officer, will add some more color on our cloud customer traction.
Anshul?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Thank you, Jayshree. Arista has been a leader in cloud networking based on our nimble execution, product
quality and ability to co-develop with our customers. Cloud companies are highly impressed with the work
we've done over the last decade and are engaging us more than ever to discuss their architectures for the
future. The advent of 30-gig 30s and related silicon is driving a product transition. We are winning new
RFPs for next-gen products, both 100-gig and 400-gig.

We have expanded our footprint from data center leaf spine and DCI to now encompass WAN and edge
use cases traditionally supported by legacy routers. While there is a lot of talk about white boxes and
400-gig, our customers have maintained status quo. We are not seeing a change in position from this
status quo. Customers who use white boxes are continuing to use white boxes, whereas customers who
use Arista switches are continuing to use our products today and for their future designs. If anything,

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

some use cases currently covered by internally developed white boxes may transition to our feature-rich
products in a few years.

Cloud companies operate at a massive scale, and they are continuing to grow. This scale makes them lean
more on us for technology and support. Our cloud customers see immense value in working with us, and
we have high customer satisfaction here. Our portfolio is highly competitive, and we are being told that we
are ahead of competition. Hence, it is unlikely that we will see significant share shift.

Savvy cloud titans are not influenced by pretty marketing slides. Our R3 Series products have now been
qualified by all our major cloud customers for several 100-gig and 400-gig use cases.

We will keep marching on. Back to you, Jayshree.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Anshul, and we will be marching on. Well said on the cloud titans success. So in summary, Arista's
vision now transcends LAN, WAN, cloud networking, with clear diversification across customers, products
and verticals. It's rooted in a more software data-driven network built across customer data sets and
managed by CloudVision. We have built a transformative architecture harnessing the new trends in IT
computing, unified edge, archiving data across the network. Our customers resonate with this vision, and
I couldn't be more upbeat on our strategy, our innovation, our quality, our support, and our customer
migration from legacy silo places in the network to cognitive clients to cloud networking, which we call
places in the cloud.

We have now deployed a cumulative of 40 million ports over the past 12 years.

With that, I will turn it over to Ita, our Chief Financial Officer, for more financial specifics. Ita?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This announcement of our Q3 results and our guidance for
Q4 2020 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all noncash stock-based compensation impacts, certain
acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items. Full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-
GAAP results is provided in our earnings release.

Total revenues in Q3 were $605.4 million, down 7.5% year-over-year, well above the upper end of
our guidance of $570 million to $590 million and up 12% from the prior quarter. While we saw some
improvements on the supply chain front, shipments remained somewhat constrained, with some expected
continuation of extended lead times into Q4. Service and software support revenues represented
approximately 21% of total revenue, down slightly from 22% last quarter.

International revenues for the quarter came in at $152.7 million or 25.2% of total revenue, up from
19.4% in the second quarter. While the shift in geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year basis was largely due to the location of deployments by our cloud titan customers, we did see some
incremental improvement in our in-region businesses also.

Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.6%, above the midpoint of our guidance of approximately 63% to 65%
and consistent with last quarter. We continue to recognize incremental COVID-related costs in the period,
including elevated freight and component costs.

Operating expenses for the quarter were $159.4 million or 26.3% of revenue, up from last quarter at
$144.1 million. We began to increase operating expense investments during the third quarter as our top
line performance for the year continued to improve. R&D spending came in at $106.1 million or 17.5% of
revenue, up from $91.6 million last quarter. This reflected increased employee costs and increased new
product introductions related to spending in the period. Sales and marketing expenses were $43.1 million
or 7.1% of revenue, up from $41.9 million last quarter, with increased variable compensation and other
personnel costs.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G&A
costs came in at $10.2 million or 1.7% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter at approximately $10.6
million. Our operating income for the quarter was $231.5 million or 38.2% of our revenue. Other income
and expense for the quarter was a favorable $13.2 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately
21.6%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $192 million or 31.7% of revenue.

Our diluted share number was 79.3 million shares, resulting in diluted earnings per share for the quarter
of $2.42, down 10% from the prior year. Please note that included in other income and expense for the
quarter was a onetime gain on the sale of investments of $9.4 million.

In addition, given current low interest rate environment, all other things being equal, we would expect
other income of approximately $3 million per quarter throughout the coming year.

The acquisition of Awake Security closed on October 7, and we are now focused on integration and
purchase accounting. The acquisition will not have a material impact on the financials for the fourth
quarter.

Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at
approximately $2.85 billion. We repurchased $167.3 million of our common stock during the third
quarter at an average price of $208 per share. As a reminder, we have now repurchased $661 million
or 3.2 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over 3
years commencing in Q2 '19. In terms of capital allocation, please expect us to continue to execute
opportunistically against the remaining authorization.

We generated $215.1 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, reflecting solid net income
performance and a consistent level of overall working capital investment. We expect to continue to
strategically increase inventory levels through the end of the year as we improve lead times and attempt
to buffer against any future COVID-related supply chain disruptions.

DSOs came in at 46 days, down from 65 days in Q2, reflecting linearity of billings in the period. Inventory
turns were 2x, down from 2.3 last quarter. Inventory increased to $438 million in the quarter, up from
$327 million in the prior period, as we continue to buffer certain components and products. Our total
deferred revenue balance was $562 million, down from $577 million in Q2. As a reminder, our deferred
revenue balance is now almost exclusively services-related. The level of services of our revenue is directly
linked to the timing and term of service renewals, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

Accounts payable days were 70 days, up from 59 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts
and payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $2.5 million.

Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond. While we remain cautious around the
impact of COVID-19 on the economy and our business, we have seen some incremental improvement
in underlying business trends. Activity in our enterprise and provider sectors has remained healthy, with
increased win rates across, for us, a relatively underpenetrated part of the market. In addition, we have
continued to solidly and consistently execute against the needs of our cloud titan customers. We believe a
combination of these trends, combined with favorable year-over-year comparatives, supports the current
consensus growth rate of 13% to 14% for fiscal 2021.

On the gross margin front, we will continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 53% to 55%,
with customer mix remaining the key driver.

Turning to spending and investment. While we will continue to carefully manage spending, we are
committed to making go-forward, results-based investments in the business. This includes continued
go-to-market expansion to support enterprise and campus growth and investments in R&D to support
innovation across the business. While it won't happen overnight, especially in an environment of resumed
top line growth, we would take this opportunity to remind you of our long-term operating margin target of
plus or minus 35%.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Finally, our outlook discussion above and our guidance for Q4 reflects our current understanding of
COVID-19 and its impact to our business and supply chain. This is, however, inherently uncertain, and we
will need to continue to monitor and attempt to mitigate new challenges as the situation unfolds.

With all of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results
and excludes any noncash stock-based compensation impacts and other nonrecurring items is as follows:
revenues of approximately $615 million to $635 million, gross margin of approximately 63% to 65%,
operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.9%,
diluted shares of approximately 79 million shares.

I will now turn the call back to Curtis. Curtis?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.

Samik Chatterjee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'll just keep it simple. Jayshree, I think everyone on the call would recognize that you sound a lot more
confident about returning to double-digit growth than you did 90 days ago. So I'm wondering what's
driving that. Is it some of the 400-gig wins coming in as you expected? Or is it the underlying customer
spending starting to improve, that's driving that increased confidence relative to what we heard a quarter
ago?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, thank you, Samik. I think when you look at the foundation and fundamentals of Arista, they didn't
change, right? We've always had superior products and very strong customer traction. And -- but I think
we got, our customers and Arista got used to the uncertainty of COVID, and COVID became a new norm,
and people have to start planning their spend.

So we saw a very balanced and customer traction across all our verticals and all our sectors in Q3.
Whereas I wouldn't say the same for Q2 and Q1, where we were still figuring things out. So I think the
combination of an unchanged strategy, a highly differentiated product, and we're just winning in every
sector. And there's no silver bullet, but humming on all 4 cylinders gives us a newfound confidence.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt from UBS.

David Vogt
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Good quarter. Great guidance. Maybe just a big picture industry question, if you guys could entertain me.
Can you share your thoughts on the proposed Marvell - Inphi transaction that was announced last week,
and maybe what it might mean for the industry holistically as we kind of move forward into 2021? That
would be great.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

I'll try. I mean, I came from the semiconductor world 2 decades ago. But as you know, there's been a lot
of semi consolidation: Nvidia-Arm, Maxim analog digital and now Marvell Inphi. I think the way to look at
this is semiconductor companies are all -- the large ones are trying to get larger, and the smaller ones are
producing some real innovative technology but need scale.

We are very impressed with Inphi. They've been an important partner for us, and they have both very
best-of-breed technology in the 30s and optic side. And it's something that Marvell lacks. So hopefully,
some of the strength they bring, especially to the cloud, will help Marvell.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri from Crédit Suisse.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

I just wanted to just check on a comment made by Anshul earlier in the transcript regarding white boxes.
And you made the comment that some customers may deploy white boxes today and then eventually
swap that out for a feature-rich Arista product in the future. Now is there maybe a rationale behind why
they would want to deploy data centers filled with white box infrastructure or white box equipment and
then eventually swap it out? Can you just explain to us the transition that would take place in design or
just in the thought process for why they would do that after they've gone down the white box route?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Sure. Sami, the world has talked about white boxes by just from one dimension for many, many years,
but remember, our customers do that analysis in both directions, not just one. And as their scale grows
and their needs grow, the network is getting more complicated. And in certain situations when they reach
a point where they need even more functionality than is easy to build internally and they want to stay
competitive in the market and not miss on timing, they do start looking out as well. But as I mentioned,
these are future trends that take a couple of years at least to happen. But these are certainly [ included
in ] discussions and issues going on in our space today.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Alexander Kurtz
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Glad to hear everyone's doing well and safe at Arista. And congrats on the quarter, Jayshree. Just on your
comments about software and maintenance becoming roughly 20% of the business. Can this growth in
your portfolio of software products, whether designed internally or acquired, to maybe accelerate that
software renewal base to where maybe in a couple of years, we're looking at 30%, 40% of the business,
if you can go back to these big cloud titans and kind of demonstrate the value of these bigger software
portfolios that you didn't have a couple of years ago and really expand that base of software?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Alex. Good question. I think very observant of you to note that when we say it's 20% of our
business, it's not just services. It's software renewals and subscriptions. So it's already starting to have a
contribution.

Can it be greater, greater than 20, 25? Yes, it would be harder to be 30 and 40, especially with the
cloud titans because cloud titans tend to think they can and they have the resources to build many of
these tools themselves. So I would say all the other 4 verticals are more likely to embrace our software
subscription, while the cloud titans may take it in bits and pieces. They would take it in components but
not in entirety. But I certainly think this segment where we can have subscription multiyear contracts is
an important part of our triad stool of core networking, adjacent networking and network as a service
capability.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America.

Tal Liani
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I have a question on the trends in the quarter. Product growth, so overall revenues are down 7.5%, but
it's not even between products and services. Product growth is down about 13.5% year-over-year and
services are up 26%. So I'm trying to understand both sides. I'm trying to understand the strong growth

President, CEO & Director

Yes. So first, remember, again, services includes many of our software subscriptions and multiyear
contracts. So it's not just services. So -- but -- whereas product is very clearly perpetual product, right?

So look, I think the comps with deferred revenue never helped us from last year to this year. And -- but I
wouldn't read too much into the trend, except to say we're getting stickier with services and software, and
we can only do better with product.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. I mean, I think, Tal, the services should continue to grow and continue to be a more meaningful piece
of the business and layer the software on top of that. And then product is recovering, but it is recovering.
You can see that in the Q4 guide and into our commentary for next year as well. So I think they're just
different drivers at this particular point in time, but they should both start to grow as we go forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam from MKM Partners.

Fahad Najam
MKM Partners LLC, Research Division

A couple of things. If I look at your working capital, it seems like your inventories have gone up
significantly, while your accounts payable are also [ awful ]. But can you just help us understand what's
happening, why the inventories are up so much? Are you expecting a significant forthcoming demand
ramp in the next couple of quarters?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. No, I think, Fahad, what we're really doing is we're buffering against some of the uncertainties around
COVID. And if you look at the Q when we file it, you'll see that a good portion of that increase is still raw
materials and components. There was some uptick in the finished goods right at the end of the quarter
for particular products, but we still have more work to do around expanding that to other products. But
our goal is to have sufficient buffers that if we do get some more shocks from COVID that we're able to
react and that we're in a better position to react than we were maybe on the first wave. So it really is just
a focus around making sure we've got more optionality and flexibility.

Jayshree, I think you kind of covered this during the call, but I'm going to ask you if you could -- in
your outlook for next year, the double-digit growth in your endorsement of the 13% to 14% consensus
number, to get there, I think I heard you say you expect your campus portfolio to double by the end of
2021. Are you saying you expect campus revenue to double? And can I ask you to go through what your
expectations are for the cloud, for enterprise and financials and for your service providers to get to that
double-digit growth?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Paul, thank you. Yes. So as you know, we said last quarter that we have achieved -- this is our first year
at campus. There are still young kids here, and we've achieved our first 100 million. And if you may recall,
we said it would take us 4 to 6 quarters to double. I don't yet know if it will be 4 or 6, but we are feeling

pretty good, particularly with our product announcement today and the campus traction we're getting,
that we didn't feel last quarter.

So yes, the goal is to definitely double that $100 million to $200 million by the end of 2021 in revenue,
and let's hope we can do better.

In terms of segments, I think it's too early to call a breakdown, but we're very comfortable with the
annual consensus for 2021. Ita, do you want to answer that?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. No, I think, Paul, we're not going to try to do it by vertical at this point, right? We feel like there is
-- between the campus stuff that you talked about between the growth and services, cloud has resumed
growth, and then the rest of the business has also been performing well. I think between all of those
drivers, you have multiple different ways to get there, and we'll see exactly how it plays out. And I think
we're not going to try to [ pick ] which verticals we're going to do what at this point.

Paul Jonas Silverstein
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Can I ask you this, I trust that to get there, cloud has to be healthy by definition.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

No, I think -- I hope you noticed our upbeat tone, especially Anshul's, we started the year saying it will be
flat to down, and then we said it will be flattish. And at this point, I think we're feeling like cloud can be a
growth -- cloud titans can also grow next year.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Wolfe Research.

Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal
Wolfe Research, LLC

I was wondering if you 2 wouldn't mind giving us a little bit of some of the thought process behind the
guidance. I guess, one part is you had -- there's another partner in the supply chain at one of your
customers that cast a pall over 2020. And I'm wondering if that particular issue in semi was resolved.

And then the other question is, could you help us a little bit with the assumption of 400 and when that
starts to layer in to the 2020 -- 2021 outlook.

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. No, I think -- so the -- again, the rationale for the guidance, I think if you look at the various
pieces, pretty much what we talked about with Paul a few minutes ago, right? I mean there are multiple
different pieces of the business, and we've seen positive trends across those sectors, right? Not all of
those reflected in revenue today. But in the enterprise vertical being good, solid wins that will drive some
revenue traction into 2021. And then for cloud, I think we feel like we've got -- we're in the window of
starting to understand their plans for next year and feeling more confident around those drivers as well.

And then obviously, the rest of the business continues to grow, looking at service software, et cetera,
the more ratable piece of the business. So I think those are the building blocks, and we like to put those
building blocks together in multiple different ways and feel good about the guidance, and that's kind of
where we came out for next year.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Yes. Jeff, I think Ita said it best. We expect cloud titan trends to improve in 2021, based on both the
CapEx projections, which for us isn't a huge indicator because we're a small number. But bulk of these
deployments will be 25-gig, 100-gig and even some 400-gig.

I think the white box and the overall competitive landscape, much as everyone [ sees ] it, is unchanged.
And we're seeing a status quo and look forward to share gains in new roles in campus, data center, routing
and cloud.

Your next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies.

George Charles Notter
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Very interested to hear the commentary about routing and all the different use cases you're pursuing in
that space. Maybe you can kind of talk about your definition of success in routing? And also, could you
give us a sense for where you are now in routing applications, percentage of sales or amount of revenue
you're driving there?

And then maybe looking forward, what use cases are you in today? And what use cases will you be in
going forward?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Sure, George. It's difficult to break it down, as I've always told you, because routing and switching
often go together. But what we saw as a trend is we've always sort of aimed for the big elephants or the
Tier 1 service providers, and those take time. But we started winning, particularly this year, we turned
the corner on winning a lot of Tier 2 and Tier 3 providers, not only in the U.S., but internationally. And
these use cases tended to be telco cloud. Some of them were just very happy with their multi-vendor
combination of vxlan, VPN, BGP staff from us. Some of them are peering use cases.

So these are all classical routing use cases with better disruptive economics, programmability, resilience
and routing features that they have come to know and love from others, but that they could get better
from us. So -- and then also, we're doing very, very well in the cloud customer base as well. We have been
for some time. So the combination of all this to say that routing is not just with the service providers, it is
now permeating all our 5 verticals.

George Charles Notter
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And is there one product delivery or feature delivery that has allowed you to turn the corner in the
service provider space? Or anything you can attribute that to?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

If you know the service providers as well as you do, it's never one feature. It's a long list of them. So
we've been working it for 4 to 5 years, and I think the culmination of it has led to more success. But
there's always one more feature to do, George, as you know.

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Yes. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just ask a kind of a housekeeping question and then the main
one. The housekeeping is, do you guys think deferred revenue will become an issue in '21 because of 400-
gig rollout? Do you think we'll see product deferred revenue building up again?

And then I also wanted to go back to enterprise. It seems like a time when enterprises, if anything, would
be slowed spending that you guys have really accelerated at least sequential growth there. And there's a
lot of absolute additional revenue in Q3. So just curious, do you think you're pulling any revenue forward
on enterprise? Or what -- how does that look like it continues the next few quarters for you?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Ita, you want to answer it?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. I think on the deferred, it's always difficult to forecast when we'll have customer requirements, et
cetera, for acceptance. I mean, it tends to be largely for some very differentiated or different product set,
particularly under the current accounting. So we'll see. It's hard to predict that there would be some of
that or not at this point, right? But it's definitely -- it's more difficult to get to a deferred bar. It would have
to be a very differentiated product going forward.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

But Rod, I'll just say it feels good to be back after a tough few quarters. The enterprises love our product,
and they want to buy more. And if anything, I would say, opposite of pull in, we're still slightly supply
constrained -- constrained versus demand and are experiencing some shortages that will hopefully
improve by the end of the year. So no pull-in for sure.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And really heartfelt congratulations to you and your team for very strong results and outlook during
COVID.

My question is regarding the outlook for 2021, when you mentioned consensus up 13% to 14%, you're
comfortable with that. Does that bake into the most recent CapEx outlooks that we were provided last
week? It's notable that like Facebook gave an outlook of up -- materially up [ in percent ]. And I know that
you're wrapping up and getting ready for earnings and things, but I believe their CapEx is supposed to be
30% to 40%. But would that be additive?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, Jim, no, I mean, this is our current view as of today of what we think we feel comfortable with
for 2021, and then we'll see. There's always going to be puts and takes and the CapEx to networking
correlation has its challenges, right? So we'll see where it goes from there. That's what we see as of today.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Jim, thank you for the question. As you know, the CapEx includes building leases, capital. So the
networking component is very, very small. Ita and I were talking earlier, as I was with Anshul, too, it's
generally less than or around 5%. So it's hard to make any specific decisions based on CapEx. But as

Your next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler.

James Edward Fish
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter, ladies. Ita, you went over the negatives of the higher freight cost but also the
positives of lower travel. To your best understanding, what was the net impact of COVID-19 on OpEx this
last quarter?

And then DSOs would imply a more front-end-loaded quarter, that either insinuates a slowdown in
September or was it just lack of needing to push more business that we have a strong backlog heading
into Q4?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. No. I mean, the DSO is actually the biggest driver this quarter was just we exited with a high balance
at the end of last quarter, right? We were very back-end-loaded last quarter, and then you can collect
against that, and that drives some good traction through the quarter.

So I think we were -- Jayshree mentioned, we still have some supply constraints we were still receiving in
inventory, and you saw that in the accounts payable as well, right? So we were still a little bit back-end-
loaded through the quarter, but we had a good balance to collect against coming into the quarter.

I don't know that I'm going to try to size exactly what the COVID impact is. There is a little bit in gross
margin, and you've seen that in the product margins. And there's travel, some marketing expenses, et
cetera, probably a couple of million or so that comes out of the sales and marketing line because of it as
well.

On the campus side, just wondering what types of customers are actually buying this stuff and then the
stuff working from home. It's just -- it surprised me that you're winning a lot of new [ volume ] there. So
that's kind of the first part of the question.

Second part of the question is the 750 series product, is this a big hole in your portfolio? And do you think
that it could actually accelerate some of your traction in the campus market?

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

First of all, you'll be pleasantly surprised as I am that even though people are not coming back to smart
buildings or their headquarters, it's really vertical-dependent, as you know. Some of the logistics and
health care and some of the business-critical ones do need to go back and do need connectivity and
performance, in a far more distributed elastic fashion.

So I think campus is back, just not the way we thought it would be. The emphasis on unified wire, wireless
rather than specific smart buildings is the change we're seeing.

And it also gives them -- what we noticed is it's also giving them a chance to plan better because if
everybody's in the building you can't plan, but now you can do a lot more proof-of-concept testing.

Yes, I'm very excited with the 750. There's a whole billions of installed base of some of my old products
called the Catalyst that are ripe and old in age. And Anshul, you want to comment on the beauty of that?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Absolutely. Jason, we're very excited with what they're doing, but a lot of this is driven by feedback from
customers. There's immense interest in the 750 series, and that's broadening our portfolio. When you
look at the Fortune 1000 type of enterprises, they absolutely need high density and high performance
even in campus. And yes, there are certain companies thinking that since the employees are not in the
office, let's not upgrade or refresh, but there are also certain companies thinking that there aren't enough
employees in the office, so let's go ahead and refresh. And that's really what's driving a lot of the change
in the enterprise as well.

But the feature set, consistent POS, CloudVision, automation, a lot of the visibility and the benefits to give
to people is important to them. If your videoconference has jiggered, you don't want to be debugging in
the middle of the day, you need the glitch to resolve by itself and move on, and those are the capabilities
we deliver with our products.

Jason Noah Ader
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Which is the catalyst comparable from Cisco? With the [ 75 750G ]?

out your channels and displacing the big incumbent there in terms of kind of influence over these larger
enterprise Global 2000 type customers?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Ryan. I think we have to understand that we are in our second year of campus. And if you look
at our competitors, they're in their 10th or 15th or 20th year. They're very mature. So definitely, we've
got work to do on go-to-market models. So our upfront first area of focus there is our existing customers.
When we have over 6,500 of them, some [ percentage ] of them love our EOS and CloudVision and want
to use us.

The second is we are making more progress on the channel side. We're not signing up everybody, but we
certainly see a strong international focus on channels. And I think that will be something we will continue
to invest in.

And the third is, for the last 2, 3 years, we have been investing in the enterprise go-to-market led by
Chris Schmidt and Ashwin Kohli under [ Ashwin ]. So we're starting to see the fruits of our labor and just
enterprise traction, whether it's in the data center or campus. And it's taken us the better part of 2 to 3

Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.

Ittai Kidron
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

A couple for me. Maybe just kind of to drill down some of the questions were asked. First, on the cloud,
clearly, you're more bullish here. So it's great to hear. Can you clarify whether this includes Facebook sort
of refresh? Is that finally back on track? And you've got a piece of that?

And then piggyback on the question that Jason had on the campus in new 750, congrats on that. Cisco
just refreshed 9400. I guess when I look at your solution right now online, it looks like you have a
couple of cool features there, always on POE, but a supervisor, data plane separation. But it was my
impression that this whole chassis campus category is on a massive decline. Customers moving into fixed
architectures, not modular at all.

So help me understand how much really is the opportunity here? And when you talk about your confidence
in doubling the campus business through next year, is this going to be a material contributor to that? Or
this is really for thereafter?

ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2020

Absolutely. I wouldn't say that the Facebook server refresh is in our guidance model, but all of our [ cloud
agents ] network plans for the next year are in our models. Let's decouple that a little bit, and we have
the data we have today from our customers for using that. So we're confident that there is growth coming
back next year on that side.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Right. And on the 750, having -- both Anshul and I have been involved a lot in chassis in our prior lives.

I think if there's anything that will be under constraint, it's the stackables. Customers are moving to more
and more distributed 1 RU. And one of the things that probably got a little unnoticed in our announcement
today is our 2 RU 96 port, which obviates the need for any stackable.

And then for the really high-density distributed buildings, which have large employees, large
headquarters, you do need a 750. You need the investment protection of 100-gig uplinks. You need the
density and footprint and power. You need the operational power management. You need the security. You
need the always on failover time for rolling upgrades.

So -- and I think what's happened, at least in our minds, is the CHAP-ing has gone from being a physical
cable plant discussion, to much more of an automation, visibility, security discussion. You need all the
properties that you had in the data center. So that market is coming to us.

So we feel good that there's -- it's a new product. It will take time to qualify, but it is a contributor to our
number in 2021.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.

Meta A. Marshall
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe wanted to touch on just kind of what sort of traction you're seeing with existing customers from
your Big Switch and Awake Security acquisitions and just whether that could be -- I understand it's not
material to Q4, but a more material contributor to 2021.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Meta. I definitely think it's a strategic contributor to 2021 in bookings. As you know, the
revenue may follow as multiyear contracts in software, network software and subscription models. So how
material will it be in 2021? Probably small.

But both those are very strategic to influencing our customers' decisions on the data center and campus.
And in general, helping with their operational -- their architectural experience and their operational
experience, it's a huge differentiator. So observability, monitoring, in-line data analysis capability and then
the autonomous threat hunting, it's so important now because the firewall or the perimeter for the firewall
is just collapsed. So the ability to do that is we just closed a Big -- the Awake acquisition in October. So it's
too early to tell. But the one thing we can tell is everyone's interested in it.

Anshul, you want to add to that?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

Jayshree, you're absolutely right, with IoT and sensors in campuses and work environments, the
monitoring is going to be very, very different. And there's an unmet need in this space today, and I think
Awake [ is the way ] with the AI technology [ on there ] as well as Big Switch in the market side.

Aaron Christopher Rakers

Yes. I want to go back to one of Ittai's questions. And I can appreciate that you're not factoring in kind of
Facebook and server refresh cycle in the context of your guidance. But if you go back in time, how do you
think about the context of server cycles and how that pulls through your business just to give a historical
backdrop? Because as we look into '21, you've got, obviously, a big refresh for Intel. You've got [ A&B
pushed into server CPU ] cycle. I'm just curious to how you think about that pull-through effect on Arista's
business?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Aaron, I don't think it's changed much. First, what happens is you've got to get the buildings and the
power and the cooling in, then you've got to get the servers. And there's typically a 1- to 2-quarter lag on
the network. And so clearly, the server cycle comes ahead of us, which is why we felt the pain we did last

Can we just hit on the telco vertical? It seems like it's still towards the bottom of the pecking order,
at least in your results. So what's going on there? When do you think you'll get that going? Is it just
increasing the routing use cases and further penetrating on that regard or maybe the addition of more
security features, which often do well in the telco networks?

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Tim. Look, I think unlike the cloud, where they will adopt our routing features even if we're
missing 1 or 2 and then operationalize it, you know very well, service providers want every bell and
whistle. And as I said in my opening remarks, it's taking us the better part of 4, 5 years. We're making
very good traction in Tiers 2 and 3. Tier 1 is still taking time. But in this year, we have won some early
design wins in Tier 1 as well.

that gives us a lot of room to make those investments. And maybe a little bit more than that, we'll see,
right? But we certainly have the growth on the top line to do that. My script did remind everybody that our
target model is 35% operating margin. And we're reserving the right to do that, should we find the right
investments to make. And we'll be very metric-driven around that as we go forward. But that's kind of
the target model longer term. In the meantime, we'll have the benefit of top line growth to help with the
investments in the near term.

Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James.

I wanted to take your sense on a scenario. If we assume an existing Arista customer wants to upgrade a
data center to 200-gig, not 400 but 200-gig, what does that mean for Arista? Is this a line card change or

a swap of chassis? And if it is a swap of chassis, you risk losing share in that kind of upgrade scenario for
one of your customers?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

So Simon, while we haven't talked about 200-gig broadly, there are certain customers looking at these
types of technologies. And since we're staying with the 4 lean architecture at [ 4550 ]. The good news is
all of the products we mentioned, the R3 series, some in the 7060 series, some in the 7300 series, all of
them support not just 400-gig, but also 200 gig. So we are aware of the need in certain cases of 200-gig
now very, very well poised to actually grow or benefit from that as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Woo Jin Ho from Bloomberg Intelligence.

Woo Jin Ho
Bloomberg Intelligence

Oh, great, thank you for squeezing me in. So an intermediate-term technology question here. So the
[ chip ] question has been asked. So NVIDIA and Marvell have been talking a lot about DPUs in the data
center. It sounds as if [ in can is ] starting to get a little bit more complex with the architectures at least.
Does DPUs present a core growth opportunity for you in the cloud that we may not have considered in the
past?

Anshul Sadana
Senior VP & COO

This is a bit too early to say whether DPUs will come disrupt or is it a lot of marketing in terms of offload
engines. Remember, offload engines, especially on servers, have been around for many, many years. And
these might have special instruction sets for the new types of offloads the world is looking at.

But so far, we don't see any major impact to networking like us, maybe even a benefit because that drives
the change in architecture and actually helps us compared from the incumbency.

Jayshree V. Ullal
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think they generally have been co-processors. They don't take away the need for a CPU.

Your final question comes from the line of Jon Lopez from Vertical Group.

Jonathan Doherty Lopez
The Vertical Trading Group, LLC, Research Division

I just had one clarification for Ita on the deferred side. The deferred has gone marginally lower
sequentially each of the last 2 quarters. And I just want to make sure I understand. Are there puts and
takes in that? Is that now more, say, dependent on larger renewals that happen periodically through the
course of the year? So if you can just talk a second about that?

And also, is there anything in that trending that we should think about as we think about services revenue
in 2021?

Ita M. Brennan
CFO , Senior VP & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. No, that's exactly what it is, right? I mean, it's almost all services now, and it's really going to move
around more by the term and the timing of just those renewals, right? Whether I renew 1 year, or 3 years,
it doesn't really make any difference in the business, but it will show up in that deferred revenue line item,
right? The revenue will still be pretty consistent, right, because you're recognizing it over time. But the

deferred line will move around, right? So if we have a big renewal on a multiyear contract, that number is
going to go up. If we renew just 1 year and come back to do the next later, it won't increase or it might
decline slightly because we're recognizing some of that revenue. So it's going to move around a bit, but
it's not a business driver, right? It's just more how are we negotiating and closing out [ the term ].
