KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Presentation

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

[Audio Gap] and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.

On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It
covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.

I'm now moving to Slide 3. This morning, we reported another strong quarter with net income of $616
million or $0.65 a share. We delivered positive operating leverage and expect to generate positive
operating leverage for the full year. We delivered record third quarter revenue, which was up 8% from
the year ago period. Our results were driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest
income. Noninterest income reached a record third quarter level, up 17% from the same period last year.
The increase was driven by broad-based growth across our fee-based businesses, including investment
banking, which was up 61%. I am especially proud of the way our teammates continue to serve our
communities and clients and in doing so, creating new and deeper relationships across our franchise.

In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in net new households in the first 9 months
of the year. Our Western franchise is growing at a rate of over 2x the rest of our footprint, and younger
clients continue to be our fastest-growing segment. Additionally, our consumer business generated a
record $4.2 billion in loan originations for the quarter, which reflects growth from our consumer mortgage
business and Laurel Road. Through the first 9 months of the year, our consumer mortgage originations
have exceeded 2020's full year record level of $8.3 billion.

Laurel Road had another strong quarter as we continued to add and expand high-quality relationships
through our national digital bank. Importantly, what really sets Laurel Road apart is our targeted client
approach, which results in high-value digital relationships nationally. Currently, 75% of our volume is
coming from outside our footprint. Laurel Road is part of a broader health care initiative across our
company that has established Key as one of the leading health care banks.

Moving on to our commercial businesses. We had another strong quarter. Our investment banking
business generated fees of $235 million, a record third quarter level and the second highest quarterly level
in our history. We experienced growth across the entire platform. Our broad and comprehensive platform
has enabled this business to grow consistently over the past decade. Our investment banking business
has grown at an 11% compound annual growth rate over the last 10 years. We are on pace to generate
double-digit growth again in 2021.

Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to
make in our franchise in digital, in analytics and in our teammates. Year-to-date, we consolidated 73
branches or approximately 7% of our branch network. These consolidations will drive future cost savings
and support ongoing investments. We will continue to look for opportunities to rightsize our footprint.

Shifting to credit quality. Our trends remained very strong this quarter. Nonperforming loans and criticized
loans were all down from the prior quarter, and net charge-offs to average loans were 11 basis points. We
continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to
position the company to perform well through all business cycles. Finally, we have maintained our strong
capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio
ended the quarter at 9.6%, above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. In the third quarter, we entered into
an accelerated share repurchase program facilitated by the capital relief from the sale of our indirect auto
portfolio. The accelerated share repurchase program is part of our previously disclosed $1.5 billion share
authorization. In total, we repurchased $593 million of common stock in the third quarter.

Dividends also remain a priority. Our dividend remains above 3%. Our Board of Directors will consider a
dividend increase at our meeting next month.

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

I will close by restating that it was another strong quarter. We generated positive operating leverage by
growing our top line and managing expenses while continuing to make investments for our future. As
always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and returning capital to
shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.

I will now turn the call over to Don, who'll provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on Slide 5. For the third quarter, net income from continuing operations was
$0.65 per common share. Our results reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses, which
was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and positive economic outlook. Importantly, we delivered
positive operating leverage this quarter. And as Chris said, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage
for the year.

Total revenues were up 8% compared to the same period last year. We had year-over-year growth in both
net interest income and noninterest income. Our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was
18.6%. I'll cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation.

Turning to Slide 6. There were 2 major items that impacted loan growth this quarter, PPP loans and the
sale of our indirect auto portfolio. Average PPP loans declined $3.3 billion this quarter as we helped clients
take advantage of loan forgiveness. We also sold our indirect auto portfolio last month. The sale impacted
our third quarter average results by approximately $800 million and $3.3 billion on an ending basis.
Average loans were down from the year ago period, reflecting the reduction in PPP balances and lower
commercial line utilization. Compared to the prior quarter, average loans were down 0.7%. Adjusting for
the sale of the indirect auto portfolio, our loans were up approximately $100 million on average and up
over $1 billion on an ending basis.

Adding to the comments on our core loan growth, adjusting for both the indirect auto loan sale and PPP
loans, our linked quarter total loan growth would have been 4.3%. We continued to see strong consumer
loan growth driven by Laurel Road and consumer mortgage. On the commercial side, we were pleased to
see a slight uptick in utilization.

Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $147 billion for the third quarter of 2021, up $12 billion
or 9% compared to the year ago period and up 2% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter and year
ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances. The growth was partially
offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. Total interest-bearing deposit costs came
down 1 basis point from the second quarter, following a 2 basis point decline last quarter. We continue to
have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately 60% of our
total deposit mix.

Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.025 billion for the third quarter of 2021
compared to $1.006 billion a year ago and $1.023 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin
was 2.47% for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2.62% for the same period last year and 2.52% for
the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the
significant growth in our balance sheet compared to a year ago period. The larger balance sheet benefited
net interest income but reduced net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by
strong deposit inflows. Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $2 million, and the
margin declined 5 basis points. Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and the benefit of the day count were
partially offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels.

For the quarter, total loan fees from PPP loans were $45 million compared to $50 million last quarter.
We've also included in the appendix additional detail on our investment portfolio and our asset/liability
positioning. In the third quarter, our sensitivity to rising rates moved higher, and we ended the period with
over $25 billion in cash and short-term investments.

Moving on to Slide 9. We continue to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited
from our ongoing investments. Noninterest income was $797 million for the third quarter of 2021

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

compared to $681 million for the year ago period and $750 million in the second quarter. Compared to the
year ago period, noninterest income increased 17%. We had a record third quarter for investment banking
and debt placement fees, which reached $235 million, driven by broad-based growth across the platform,
including strong M&A fees. Additionally, corporate services income increased $18 million, and commercial
mortgage servicing fees increased $16 million. Offsetting this growth was lower consumer mortgage fees
due to a lower gain on sale margin. Compared to the second quarter, noninterest income increased by $47
million. The largest driver of this quarterly increase was the record third quarter investment banking and
debt placement fees.

I'm now on Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.112 billion compared to $1.037
billion last year and $1.076 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect higher production-
related incentives and the investments we have made to drive future growth. The increase from the year
ago period primarily reflects higher incentive and stock-based compensation attributed to our higher fee
production and Key's increased stock price. The quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses was primarily
driven by 2 areas: the first, personnel expense related to 1 additional day of salary expense in the quarter
and slightly higher employee benefits; the second was an increase in other expense of $18 million, largely
related to a pension settlement charge and higher charitable contributions.

Now moving to Slide 11. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the third quarter,
net charge-offs were $29 million or 11 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs in the current
quarter included $22 million related to the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio. Our provision for credit
losses was a net benefit of $107 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics
as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production. Nonperforming loans were $554
million this quarter or 56 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $140 million or 20% from the prior
quarter.

Now on to Slide 12. We ended the third quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.6%, which places
us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to
support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we
continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. We repurchased
$593 million of common shares during the quarter, and our Board of Directors approved a third quarter
dividend at $0.185 per common share. Of the $593 million in common share repurchases, $468 million
were related to the initial settlement of our accelerated share repurchase program, representing 80%
of the $585 million authorization. The remaining $125 million were purchased in the open market. The
remaining 20% of the ASR will be settled in the fourth quarter.

On Slide 13, similar to prior years, we provide a guidance for the fourth quarter relative to our third
quarter results. Guidance ranges are listed at the bottom of the slide. Importantly, using midpoints of
this outlook would imply our PPNR is at or above our full year 2021 outlook provided last quarter. We
have adjusted our guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance, especially in our fee-based
businesses as well as the continued strength in our credit quality.

Average loans will be up low single digits, excluding the impact of the sale of our indirect auto portfolio.
We expect continued growth in both our core commercial and consumer balances. Average deposits
should remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is expected to be down to low
single digits, reflecting lower PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter and the impact of the auto loan sale.
Noninterest income should be relatively stable off our record third quarter performance with momentum
in most of our fee-based businesses through year-end. We will also benefit from what we expect to be
another record year for our investment banking business. We expect noninterest expense to be down low
single digits in the fourth quarter.

Moving on to credit quality. We expect our net charge-offs to be below 20 basis points for the fourth
quarter. Credit trends were strong in the third quarter, and we expect a strong finish to the year. And our
guidance for our GAAP tax rate has remained unchanged at 20%.

Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect
to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile in improving our

productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain
confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And first, from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to start. So on the IB and debt placement fees, right, this has moved from, I think, you were
$160 million per quarter pre-pandemic. Now you're running consistently over $200 million per quarter.
And we know this is an unusual year for debt issuance. How should we think about this line over the
intermediate term? And do we eventually just go back to $160 million?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

So Steve, it's Chris. As we look at this line, we always look at it kind of on a trailing 12 basis. I don't
think we're going back to $160 million. In the last decade, we've grown this, as I mentioned, at a
compound annual growth rate of 11%. We continue to add bankers. We continue to further penetrate
these niches that we're in. It's a unique business, 7 industry verticals serving the middle market. It is the
deal business. But having said that, we feel really good about the long-term trajectory of the business.

I'll give you one statistic you might find interesting. This year, we added 5% in terms of incremental
bankers, and the call activity is up 20%. So I think we're in the right sectors. I think we continue to invest
in the business, and I think it's a unique business. I don't think it's going back to $160 million. I do think,
over time, it will continue to be a double-digit grower.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. So we should consider this current run rate as a baseline, Chris, is that right?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

I don't know if I would consider it as a baseline. I mean we always look at it on a trailing 12 basis. But
I do think we can continue to grow it, Steve. As you know, you guys were in the deal business, too. You
can't sort of annualize 1 quarter, but I do think you can look at long-term trends and we'll continue to
grow it.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Got you. Okay. And on the PPP, can you guys give out what the fees recognized in the quarter were?
And maybe, Don, do you have the end of period balances on PPP?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sure can. The total loan fees realized this quarter were $45 million. That was down from $50 million last
quarter. The average balance for our PPP loans was $4.2 billion, and the ending was at $3.1 billion.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. If I could squeeze one more in for you, Chris. There's been quite a bit of activity
in M&A this year. It's actually a record year. Have you been active at all in exploring M&A opportunities,
either bank or nonbank?

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

We -- Steve, we're always out there talking to people, particularly in the nonbank space. We have a
pretty good track record of buying entrepreneurial businesses and integrating them. Obviously, this year,
we bought AQN, which is an analytics firm. We have a long history of investing in and partnering with
fintech companies. So we'll continue to be very, very active around sort of niche businesses, whether it's
investment banking, boutiques.

And then we're always out there. Our job is to always be out there in the marketplace and see what there
is out there that could create a lot of value. And so we're out there, but particularly focused on these niche
businesses.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess, if you could just follow up a little bit on the outlook. You've talked about positive operating
leverage this year. As we look beyond 2021, you mentioned an opportunity to rightsize the branch
footprint. Give us some perspective on how big that is. And as we look forward, some of the PPP revenues
tail off. How do you think about maintaining that positive operating leverage? We've heard other banks
talk about inflationary pressures impacting expenses. So would love your perspective on that.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Well, thank you for the question. First of all, operating leverage is very important to us. We're really
proud of the fact that we have operating -- positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis. We will
have positive operating leverage for the year 2021. We have not yet pulled together our plans for 2022.
We will share that guidance with everybody in our January call. But I can tell you, positive operating
leverage is a very important part of how we run the business. It's a huge area of focus. When we have
all of our business leaders in, we're investing heavily in these businesses, but we have to be able to get
the growth for the investment. And to date, obviously, we're getting that, but we'll continue to focus on
positive operating leverage.

You mentioned inflationary pressures. I don't think there's any question that there's inflationary pressures
in the financial services industry. And within our customer base, we clearly are seeing those. And those
will be a challenge, I think, for everyone in the economy.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And I guess one for you. So looking at your ALM slide disclosure at the end, just talk to us how
you're managing the balance sheet as we think about cash deployment given the steepening in the curve
we've seen? And where do you want the bank set up 12 months from now in terms of NII sensitivity to
100 basis points higher interest rates?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

It's a great question. And that's something we challenge all the time that you might see from the
materials that this quarter, we had some activity in our bond portfolio with purchases of traditional core
investments of about $3.7 billion compared to a runoff of $2.1 billion that we saw from the cash flows off
the existing portfolio. In addition to that, we bought some short-term treasuries of about $4 billion. And
also, the auto securitization transaction ended up increasing our overall bond portfolio by $2.8 billion as
well. And so we ended the quarter at about $49 billion of total investments, which is up from the average
of $43 billion.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

What I would say is that we've seen a nice tick up in rates that the purchases we made in the third quarter
had an average yield of 135. Those same types of investments at the start of the fourth quarter, in the
150 to 160 range. And so that would probably give us some opportunity to lean a little heavier into
portfolio purchases in the fourth quarter and beyond, and we'll continue to assess that.

We're sitting right now on $25 billion of excess liquidity compared -- with cash positions and short-term
treasuries, and we do plan to put that to work over time and probably see a clip of something in that $4
billion to $5 billion range near term instead of the $3.7 billion that we purchased in the third quarter and
maybe moving that up as we get more and more comfortable with where rates are positioned for the long
term.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's helpful. And any changes -- Don, on Slide 19, I think you lay out $36 billion in portfolio hedges. Is
that -- what's rolling off? Is that number expected to stay steady state over the next year?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. Of those hedges, $22 billion really are true asset/liability hedges. The remainder are both debt
hedges and also some very specific security hedges for the maturities for the next 12 months, for all 2022.
That's a $4.6 billion number as far as the maturity of those swaps.

And so -- and just to put that in perspective, the average received fixed rate for those $22 billion in swaps
is 1.2%, and the current go-to rate for us would be about 1.1%. So we're seeing markets start to -- rates
start to pick up and close that gap that we have as far as that rollover risk.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I was hoping you could talk about loan growth for just a second. You're certainly starting to see more and
more recovery. I'd say the magnitude of yours, once you sort of wade through all the noise, has maybe
been a little bigger than some others out there. To a degree, things like Laurel Road and mortgage, which
you guys have talked about quite a bit, offers you some flexibility. But I was hoping you could speak to the
commercial side and sort of what's differentiating you guys there. And maybe some comments about what
you're seeing in terms of pricing structure, those kinds of things, please.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Let me start, and then Don, I'm sure you'll have some comments on this as well. We are pleased
with the trajectory of our loan growth, Scott. You mentioned on the consumer side our 2 growth engines.
Those will both continue. So we feel good about those. As it relates specifically to the commercial side,
we've seen a lot of activity around energy, around affordable housing. We're significant players in health
care and technology. All of those sectors have been active, and the pipelines look strong.

As it relates to pricing and structure, we are not giving on structure at all. And I would say there's been
sort of a continued erosion of pricing. Think about sort of from pre-pandemic to current sort of a BBB
credit and erosion of maybe 25 basis points, that would be kind of a good benchmark.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I would agree, Chris. And as far as the commercial loans linked quarter absent PPP, we're seeing those
balances up over $1.5 billion. I would say of that, about $0.5 billion is coming from increased utilization
rates that we saw went up about 50 basis points. We saw a little bit of growth in our commercial real

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

estate portfolio, and that really is aided by our focus on affordable housing and some other areas there
that have been paying dividends for us.

Then the core commercial portfolio itself grew by about $0.5 billion. And I'd say that a good chunk of that
is coming from customer growth. And we're seeing the benefit of the additional calling efforts that Chris
mentioned and the addition of more bankers on the street to help us drive that growth.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then maybe, Don, just a question on the indirect portfolio sale. Does that have any
bearing on what you think about sort of the steady-state reserve level? I can't imagine it'll be huge just
given the starting size of that portfolio, but just would be curious to hear any of your thoughts.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

It really doesn't have a huge impact on it at all. If you look at the reserve levels we had there, they were
a little bit less than the average for the overall loan book, but generally in line. So not much of a change
there. The one thing we continue to watch is that our credit metrics continue to improve and exceed our
expectations as far as the relative performance there. And so that's been the main driver as far as some of
the adjustments we've seen down as far as our overall reserve levels.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Chris and Don, wanted to follow up on the operating leverage dynamics and specifically in the investment
banking fee income line item. Clearly, there's a relationship between that fee income and how you
compensate your producers. But how does the rate of growth in revenues in that line item compare to the
corresponding expenses over time? How accretive is it to your consolidated operating leverage?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. I would say that historically, we've seen that operating margin held in fairly well for that business,
even though we've been investing in it. As we see variances from quarter to quarter, we typically see an
increase in incentive compensation to about 30% of the change in revenues. And while it's not a strict
formula, it tends to work out to be about that range. And I would say as far as the efficiency ratio for
this business, it's a little higher than what the core would be overall, but isn't too dilutive to the entire
company.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. That's helpful. And then separately, can you give a little bit of color on how you'd expect Laurel
Road's mortgage volumes and mix to evolve in a higher mortgage rate environment?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So Bill, thanks for your question. So just as you step back and you look at our mortgage business
broadly, right now, about 20% of our volume is to doctors. So it's not an inconsequential piece across
all of Key. Additionally, our purchase volume right now is about 50%. We're up 60% year-over-year. I
think the MBA would say those are relatively flat. So I would expect that we'll continue to grow fairly
aggressively on the purchase side as it relates to Laurel Road. And obviously, as interest rates go up, the
refinance piece of it will obviously be impacted by that.

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

And also keep in mind, our target customer for this Laurel Road business, it really is those doctors that
are coming off their residency and locating to their permanent assignment. And so step 1 typically is to
consolidate their student loans, and step 2 would be to buy a house and establish more of a permanent
residence. And so even though if rates are going up, we would expect to see some strong purchase
volume coming from that targeted customer base as well.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. If I may squeeze in one last one. Was the strategic rationale behind the exiting of indirect auto
lending business simply a result of your desire to focus on direct relationships with your customers? And
with that sale, have you now fully exited indirect consumer lending?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So Bill, there's no question, you're correct there. I mean we are a relationship bank. And specifically,
we believe in targeted scale. And if you think about that, being really focused on who you do business with
and being a relationship bank, clearly, the indirect auto business just is not a relationship business.

And so we made the decision to exit the business. And then the transaction that we completed just
recently with the accelerated share repurchase just made a whole lot of sense for us because it freed
up capital, had a great IRR and frankly, enabled us to eliminate the tail risk at a time when the value of
used automobiles was quite high. So that was kind of the strategic logic between exiting the business and
executing the transaction we did recently.

Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Don, just a follow-up on the swap comment, you gave that 4.6% number and talked about it. But I just
wanted to understand the broader strategy with the swap book. The $22 billion now and that $4.6 billion,
just wondering just how you're thinking about either replacing some of those? And if you could remind us
what the benefit was from hedge income -- hedge swap income in this quarter and how you'd expect that
to traject?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sounds good. The whole thought as to the size of the swap book is really to get the end target as far as
our asset sensitivity that we have been biasing our position to be much more asset sensitive than we
typically would. We're now in our -- we talk about a 6% asset-sensitive position in our slide deck, and
that's higher where it would be traditionally.

But also available to us going forward in the next year is the redeployment of liquidity. So some of that
will be taking out the cash position, which is a variable rate asset, low earning variable rate asset but still
variable rate, and replacing it with long-dated investment securities. And we typically have about a 4-year
average life for those securities.

And so we'll have to take that in consideration as to whether or not we just do more of that or we do
additional replacements with swaps. Right now, we've not been replacing any of the swap maturities, and
we'll continue to reassess that going forward. So that's just generally how we would manage the overall
asset sensitivity position of the company.

As far as the benefit from the swaps in the third quarter, we had about $76 million of net interest income
coming from the swaps. We could see that come down slightly over the next couple of quarters. And then
the question will be going forward is what happens with rates. And as the short-term rates move up, you
would see that number come down, but we would have seen an offsetting impact from the rates on the
commercial loans going up, benefiting from those higher rates. And so that's, again, just a summary of
where we're positioned today and what impacts there might be going forward.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes. And as a follow-up, so if you were to just, let's say, that all of that -- the $4.6 billion go and not
replace, do you have an idea of where that 6% asset sensitivity would turn into?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I would say that, that would probably take us up as far as asset sensitivity, but I don't have the exact rate
there. And one of the things we've been monitoring is just what our outlook would be for rates overall
and what's the other changes in the balance sheet. So since those swaps are fairly short in duration, it
wouldn't have a huge impact in overall asset sensitivity. But it's just something prospectively that we'd
have to evaluate.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. And if I could just ask a last clarifying one. Don, can you just give us what the total PPP
income was this quarter versus last?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Okay. The total, which will include the interest on the individual loans, was $56 million, including the
$45 million in fees last quarter. That was $69 million, including $50 million of fees. And so that's just the
relative change from quarter-to-quarter.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just a couple of follow-ups on some individual fee categories. Service charges for you guys and others are
bouncing back nicely. Do you think that's -- obviously, there's some seasonality and just kind of inherent
recovery. But do you think it might also be a bit of a leading indicator that some consumers are spending
down their excess liquidity and could start borrowing more? Or what do you think is driving that?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Well, one, if we look at the individual balances of our retail customers, we're seeing balances maintained,
if not growing across the board, even the smallest customers as far as average deposit balances. And so
we're not seeing a lot of change there that I would say that, to your point, some seasonality, some activity
level. We're seeing activity levels pick up, and that's driving service charges up.

And more importantly for us is we're seeing household and customer growth. And we've had record
growth for the first 9 months of this year that exceeds what we had previously originated as far as net
new households in a full year. And so we're seeing strong growth there, which also does translate to
increased fee activity for us as well.

Chairman, President & CEO

And Matt, just to give you some numbers from the first quarter of 2020, our merchant business is up
49%; purchase cards, up 39%. Retail payments in general are up 28%. So to Don's point, there's a lot of
velocity.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then separately, the trust fees were down a little bit and flat linked quarter and flat year-over-
year. Obviously, a good backdrop in markets. Just what's going on there? And then remind us how much
money market waivers are embedded in these results as well for when rates rise and you recover that.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. As far as the trust fee income, that -- the biggest driver there really was commercial brokerage
activity, and that was down linked quarter and year-over-year. If you look at the core private banking
revenues, those were up for each of those periods, and retail investment sales are down slightly linked
quarter because of seasonality and -- but up year-over-year. And so those are the main drivers there. And
then -- I'm sorry, Matt, as far as your last question, I forget what that was. I apologize.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Any money market waivers that are embedded in that line that when rates rise, you'll recover?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Really don't have any money market waivers there at all. We don't manage any money market funds, and
so that really doesn't trip our revenues there.

Next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Chris, I wanted to ask on capital. I'm just wondering with the improved credit risk profile, the outlook for
the economy is getting better. Would you consider moving the capital target maybe to the low end of 9%
to 9.5% or even take it below the low end?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Peter, we still believe that 9% to 9.5% is the right number as we think about our business. There's
obviously a lot of variables. Could we be in the lower portion of 9% to 9.5%? Depending on the scenario,
we could, but we do not intend to lower the target of 9% to 9.5% of CET1.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then, Don, if I can ask just in terms of the fourth quarter outlook, could you talk about the
average loan growth and that net interest income excluding PPP and then also with the net interest
income, excluding the impact of the sale of the indirect auto?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Sure could. But as far as the average loan growth that we've talked about up low single digits, up 1% to
3%, excluding the impact of the indirect auto. If we added on the impact of the PPP forgiveness and loan
balance expectations there, that would add another $1.8 billion to the overall loan growth, so almost 2%.
So that would take it from a low single-digit to a mid-single-digit kind of growth expectation on a linked
quarter basis. And so something similar to what we reported essentially this quarter.

As far as the NII outlook, I would say that there's 2 things that are impacting NII outlook for the fourth
quarter. You hit on one, which is PPP. And we would expect probably in the neighborhood of a $10 million
or so type of decline in PPP revenues. The other is the indirect auto loan sale that as a result of the sale,
our net interest income will be down, but our fee income will be up. We essentially receive 75 basis points
for servicing those loans. And so you will see a decline in NII of about $10 million and an increase of fee
income in the range of $5 million to help offset that. And those are kind of the moving parts and pieces.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Eric Chan with Wells Fargo Securities.

Ming Yin Chan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I have a question that relates to tech. So as you guys have retooled the bank, I was just wondering if you
could speak a little bit about how the role of fintech partnerships has changed for Key. And if possible,
perhaps you could give us a number of fintech partners that you guys currently work with?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So our relationship with fintech partners has really been both
important and helpful for us. As a bank, we were in early, and I think it's really helped us successfully
execute our targeted scale strategy. Frankly, it's helped us kind of with our client service strategy, our
sales strategy. It's also clearly contributed to our thinking as we developed our technology road map. We
are clearly tied into the entire fintech ecosystem. And our unique strategy is both known and understood
by the fintech community, which is helpful.

Going to your question of how many relationships we have, I would say, today, we have probably 10
client-facing relationships. We literally have dozens of infrastructure relationships with fintechs. Because
we're sort of known in the whole ecosystem, we see a lot, maybe 15 or 20 opportunities every single
month that we kind of sort through. Kind of if you step back and take a look and think about kind of from
a strategic perspective, our targeted scale strategy just makes us a great partner because we have such
distinct client groups. And obviously, as you're developing software, that's really helpful.

What we have done at Key in Laurel Road is we've built this national digital affinity bank, which is a
relationship approach to digital banking. What fintechs really are best at is really solving one pain point
and doing it extremely well. So it's been a good relationship probably for -- I can certainly say for us, and
I'm sure it's been a good relationship for the fintechs as well.

Ming Yin Chan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes, that's helpful. And then just kind of a follow-up on to that. So how do you guys determine which
strategy to follow when it comes to actually building in-house or partnering with fintechs, so to say? Just
kind of like on a high level, what are your thoughts there?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

It starts with the client out. We are a relationship-driven bank. And so we have these distinct client
groups that we're pursuing. And to the extent we can partner, invest with a fintech that can make us more
impactful in the market serving that specific client set, we will enter into some partnership. We'll invest in

them. To the extent it doesn't help us compete and win in the marketplace and solve a specific pain point
for our targeted customers, we take a pass.

Now as I mentioned, that's on the client-facing stuff. In the infrastructure space, we have dozens and
dozens. And obviously, the criteria there is, is it cheaper and faster to buy it versus build it.

Operator

Next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can you guys give us some color? Credit obviously has been great for you and your peers. You've already
given us guidance for the second quarter net charge-off number, which is lower than your long-term
numbers that you have for 40 to 60 basis points through the cycle. When do you think we start creeping
up for a normality? And I'm not talking about a recession. But do you think you stay at this lower level for
another quarter or 2, and then we start creeping up later in '22 or into '23?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

So let me take a pass at that, Gerard. The answer is we don't know. We've got really good clarity.
Obviously, as we look into the fourth quarter, we gave guidance of 20 basis points. Interestingly enough,
our results this quarter, while we report 11 basis points, it's really closer to 2 when you take out the $22
million that relates to indirect auto.

I think we are in -- I can speak for Key, I think the derisking that we've gone about for the last 10 years
is going to serve us extremely well. We won't stay at a level this low. But I actually think, as we look into
2022, you're still going to see us below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Gerard, I would agree with Chris' comments. There are a couple of things to think about. One is that as
far as our overall credit quality position, for many of the metrics today, we're actually better than what we
were pre-pandemic. So if you look at nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, the delinquency stats
for consumer and commercial loans are all better than where they were pre-pandemic. Our criticized and
classified are a little higher than what they were before the pandemic, but coming down dramatically. And
we've seen incremental improvements this quarter that are outpacing what we've seen before that. And
so that would suggest that things are going to be good for some time. But at the same time, I would think
that you're probably going to see the consumers start to turn a little sooner. They've been the beneficiary
of so much stimulus. And if that starts to slow and go away like we would expect it to, you would start to
see some of that start to return to more normal levels over time as well.

And then the commercial customer, while it's still flushed with liquidity, but we just aren't seeing the early
signs of that there's going to be some challenges down the road. And so I think that we're going to be in
a period for some time where we're going to see charge-offs below the low end of guidance ranges across
the industry.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

I think, Gerard, one of the first things you'll see is in the small business sector, the inability to pass
through what are some pretty significant price and wage increases. And I think that will be the beginning
of a bit of a pressure on the commercial side, particularly with smaller customers that have less pricing
power.

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Very good. And then as a follow-up, Chris, 2 things. One, when you look at your investment banking
numbers, which, of course, were very strong, record levels, $235 million, can you give us a flavor for how
does that break out, M&A advisory versus DCM, et cetera, and compare that to first quarter last year?

But then second, in your prepared bullets, it looked like you pointed out that you retained 20% of the
business on the loans. And I thought that seemed high because normally, I thought you sold 90% of it or
more off, but if any of those 2 questions.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So Gerard, we've never broken out each of the different components, our investment banking fees.
I can tell you that our M&A business was extremely strong. And you can imagine the equity business was
very strong, given that we have a focus on technology. So those were a couple just bright spots broadly.

As it relates to our mix of what's distributed and what we put on our balance sheet, it's actually been very
consistent over a long period of time. We've always basically held -- of the credits that we take on, we've
always held about 20% on our balance sheet. So we really haven't dialed that up at all. We've been just
maintaining our moderate risk profile and taking advantage of what are some pretty attractive markets
out there.

Operator

And next, we'll go to John Pancari with Evercore ISI.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate the color you've given around the loan growth activity that you're seeing. I'm curious how
you're thinking that interprets into 2022 in terms of the type of on-balance sheet loan growth that you
could see. I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on how you're thinking about that
and curious how that could play into the full year.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

John, thanks for your question. We will be addressing our view on 2022 in January. But what's interesting
about our model is there's a lot of variables. And depending on what the market conditions are, you could
see us -- going back to the previous question, you could see us maybe putting more on our balance sheet
if some of the markets went in -- they're right now functioning very, very well, went into dislocation. But
we'll have a specific view for you when we report in January.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. All right, Chris. And then separately, on the expense side, I know you've talked about wage
inflation. And how are you thinking about what it could add to expense levels as you look at full year
expectations? I know you're not giving 2022 guidance, but around the wage inflation topic specifically, just
curious about annualized expense impact, how do you think about that?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So the biggest impact to date for us has obviously been those variable structures, principally in
investment banking and in our mortgage business that are driven by business flows and the fact that
those businesses have grown. Your question is a good one in that we have had to, particularly at the low
end of the entry level in -- throughout Key and also in the kind of the junior banker area, we have, in fact,
had to increase wages there. And Don, can you give us some specifics on what the impact of that is on an
annualized basis?

KEYCORP FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Well, our total salary expense each year is about $1.3 billion. And I would say that those 2 components
probably have cost us somewhere in the range of about $15 million to $20 million a year. So it's a little
over 1% cost as far as the impact there overall. But it's something we'll continue to evaluate.

And as Chris highlighted, we're seeing that in the entry-level type of positions. And we're also starting to
see some of that in other more specialty areas as well. And so we'll have to assess as we go into next year
what kind of targets we'll have as far as salary expense overall.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. But that $15 million to $20 million per year, that's mainly on the lower end wages in the junior
banker areas?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

You got it. Yes.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. All right. And then lastly, just one question around your tech side of the shops. Just curious
in terms of -- if you can update us on your -- the size of your tech budget and how that's been growing
annually? And then perhaps how much is split between growing the bank versus running the bank?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So broadly, our spend is about $800 million a year. Of that, about $200 million is spent on
development. Of the $200 million, about half of it is client facing. The other half is core. One of the great
things is we've been updating our technology over a long period of time, and we actually have to spend a
little less in that category, which frees up more dollars for some of the development on the front end.

The other thing that we also have been doing is we've been buying a lot of niche businesses that have
actually brought a lot of technology to us. Obviously, Laurel Road would be an example of that. AQN would
be an example of that. And that's really tech investment that is outside of what we would think about in
terms of our tech budget.
