VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Vulcan Materials Company Third Quarter
Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference call coordinator today.

[Operator Instructions]

Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan
Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.

Mark D. Warren
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental
presentation posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com.

A recording of this call will be available for replay later today at our website. Please be reminded that
comments regarding the company's results and projections may include forward-looking statements,
which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with other legal disclaimers, are described
in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and other information are available in
both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.

As the operator indicated, please limit your Q&A participation to one question plus a follow-up. This will
help maximize participation during our time together. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan
Materials Company. We hope you and your families are well and will continue to be safe and healthy. I
want to begin today's call by thanking our employees for their ongoing flexibility in the face of uncertainty
and change, and their commitment to our customers and their dedication to Vulcan and to each other.
Despite the difficulties caused by the pandemic, our company continues to thrive as a direct result of their
efforts.

Turning now to the third quarter. Our financial results can be summed up very simply. Our teams delivered
another quarter of aggregate unit margin expansion through improved pricing, disciplined operating
performances and solid execution. Our aggregate cash gross profit per ton increased by 5% despite an 8%
volume decline. Volume was obviously impacted by the pandemic, but also by severe wet weather across
the Atlantic Coast, the Southeast and Texas and wildfires on the West Coast.

We expanded our unit margins by remaining focused on what we could control and by making sure that
we were well positioned to respond to a rapidly changing environment. We've talked about our 4 strategic
disciplines for a number of quarters now, and we believe that they have been a critical part of our success
this year.

Our commercial excellence and our operational disciplines have been particularly helpful. On the
commercial side, our aggregate mix adjusted sales price increased by approximately 3% in the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, mix adjusted pricing increased by 3.5% despite a 4% decline in volume.
Operationally, year-over-year, our cash unit cost of sales was flat, both for the quarter and year-to-date.
Cost control, operating efficiencies and a tailwind from diesel mitigated the impact of lower aggregate
volume.

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Our 4 strategic disciplines continue to drive improvement in our unit margins. This is evidenced by our 7%
year-to-date improvement in cash gross profit per ton. Suzanne will review the quarter and year-to-date
results in more detail shortly, but first, I want to address the demand trends that we're seeing. Certain
leading indicators are showing signs of improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year. However, the
pace of recovery and the timing of shipments is not certain. Residential construction continues to be the
most resilient of our market segments. Starts and permits have rebounded, particularly in our footprint.
Single-family housing is leading the way, and we are especially well positioned in our markets to take
advantage of this trend.

Private nonresidential construction continues to be the most variable in use. Following the drop in the
spring, construction starts have remained weak as compared to last year. However, we are encouraged
by improvement in certain leading indicators, which could point to future growth. Dodge Data states
that warehouses and distribution centers, now the largest nonresidential starts category continue to see
growth. As a leading supplier in the majority of our markets, we are well positioned to serve all types of
nonresidential business regardless of the category.

According to Dodge, Vulcan-served states are expected to account for approximately 90% of the growth
in warehouses and distribution centers over the next 2 years. In addition, nonresidential demand for
commercial buildings, like gas stations and grocery stores has historically followed the build-out of new
housing subdivisions. We could expect this type of traditional nonresidential construction to follow the
growth we're experiencing in residential demand. As we think about these current trends, it's important to
keep in mind that unlike the great recession of 2008, nonresidential construction going into the pandemic
was not overbuilt.

The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic has weighed more heavily on this segment. With respect to
public highway construction, most Vulcan-served states have flat to increasing DOT budgets for their fiscal
year 2021 versus 2020. This, coupled with a 1-year extension of the FAST Act bodes well for highway
demand. Now that state DOTs have greater clarity around highway revenues, lettings are returning to
higher pre-COVID levels and are projected to continue to be consistent with state DOT budgets in 2021.

Timing of shipments to highway projects may start a little slow early in 2021 due to states conservative
approaches to lettings earlier this year, but will pick up as the year progresses. As a more recent data
point, aggregate shipments in the month of October were down 5% due to 1 less shipping day. While 1
month doesn't constitute a trend, we were still pleased with the outcome and attribute this performance
to better weather and pent-up demand from the third quarter. As we consider the remainder of 2020,
we now believe we have sufficient near-term visibility to provide guidance for the full year. We expect
that our 2020 adjusted EBITDA will range between $1.285 billion to $1.315 billion. This guidance range
is predicated on no major changes in COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions, it also assumes our normal
weather pattern. With respect to 2021, we are in the midst of our budget season and still have work to do.
Visibility continues to improve. Therefore, we expect to be able to provide 2021 guidance in February.

The key point to remember here is, while the pandemic has created uncertainty, our view of the
underlying fundamentals of our business remains unchanged. Our aggregates-focused business is sound,
resilient and adaptable to changing market conditions. We have a history of good operational execution,
and this increases our confidence in our ability to compound unit margins. We're in the right geographies.
Our balance sheet and liquidity position are a great source of strength and flexibility and will support our
operational initiatives and our growth plans.

Going forward, we will remain focused on the things that we can control, keeping our employees safe and
healthy, taking good care of our customers and ensuring strong execution on our operating disciplines. We
have confidence in our future success.

And now I'll hand the call over to Suzanne for additional comments. Suzanne?

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Thanks, Tom. I'll cover a few financial highlights and then comment briefly on our balance sheet and
liquidity position. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $403 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins
increased by 210 basis points as compared to the prior year despite an 8% decline in total revenues.
Significant contributors to our quarterly EBITDA margin improvement were: first, the aggregates unit
margin expansion that Tom discussed earlier; and second, a 6% or $5 million year-over-year reduction in
SAG expense. These metrics have improved on a year-to-date basis as well. Our aggregates cash gross
profit per ton increased by 7% to $7.15, while aggregates volume decreased by 4%. SAG expense for the
9 months declined by 5% or $14 million due to the execution of cost reduction initiatives and general cost
control.

Now I'd like to provide a little color on our quarterly segment performance. Starting with aggregates,
volumes declined in most of our markets, reflecting weaker demand resulting from the pandemic.
In addition, the key markets that Tom called out were particularly affected by severe weather as we
experienced a record-setting number of named storms. California shipments were impacted by wildfires
and resulting power outages, which interrupted the supply of cement or ready-mix concrete production.
This limited construction activity.

Aggregate sales price growth in the quarter of nearly 3% on a mix adjusted basis was widespread across
our footprint, reflecting a positive pricing environment. The combination of sales price growth and good
cost control more than offset reduced volume. And as a result, virtually all of our markets improved their
respective unit profitability.

Moving to our nonaggregates segments. Asphalt gross profit improved by $3 million as compared to last
year's quarter. A 13% volume decline was more than offset by improved pricing and lower liquid asphalt
costs. The concrete segment's gross profit was $12 million, a reduction of $3 million versus the prior year.
Shipments decreased by 11% due to wet weather, particularly in Virginia, our largest concrete market.
California's volume was also less than last year's third quarter due to the factors previously mentioned.

On a year-over-year basis, we were particularly pleased with our improving return on investment profile.
For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, ROI was 14.2%. And consistent with past practice, this
was calculated on an adjusted EBITDA basis. Turning now to the balance sheet and liquidity. We took
further steps this quarter to enhance our position. We renewed our revolving credit facility for another 5
years and took the opportunity to increase its size from $750 million to $1 billion. All other terms were
substantially similar to those contained in the previous facility.

At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 1.7x on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, reflecting $1.1 billion
of cash on hand. Approximately $500 million of this cash on hand will be used to repay a debt maturity
coming due in March 2021. And at September 30, our available liquidity was a very healthy $2 billion. We
also generated a robust $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in the trailing 12-month period. That represents
a 23% increase as compared to the previous period. We have been and will continue to be disciplined
about how we invest our cash and therefore, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged.

Capital expenditures for the 9 months totaled $229 million. And we now expect to spend between $300
million and $350 million this year, a modest increase from our prior guidance of $275 million to $325
million. I'll turn the call back over to Tom now for closing comments.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Suzanne. Before we go to Q&A, I want to thank the employees of Vulcan Materials Company for
taking care of our customers and each other. For making marked progress toward our longer-term goal of
$9 cash gross profit per ton and for driving our improved results through our 4 strategic disciplines.
And now we'll be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research.

Brian Biros
Thompson Research Group, LLC

This is actually Brian Biros on for Kathryn.

I wanted to start -- just really just with the election results or what it might be the election results. And I
guess, really, what does the outcome mean for Vulcan in terms of outlook and real demand? And does one
outcome in the election have of a greater relative impact versus the other in terms of outlook and demand
for future projects?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Well, looking back, I think I've seen 9 elections in my time in this industry and kind of the one thing
that is consistent is that highway funding is the issue that usually wins regardless of the election outcome.
So I think that our next congress will begin work on a new highway bill in 2021. And as it looks today that
the balance of power of both the house and the senate will probably pretty much remain unchanged. And
I would think this probably plays in our favor. As this house and senate has already done substantial work
on the next highway bill. So the fact that the balance of power doesn't change means that we start with a
really good foundation with drafts of bills that are already in place and a lot of work that's been done on
those bills.

So it may help us actually get a new bill faster because you don't have to go back and completely start
from scratch. And remember that the -- with the balance of power as it is, the congress that's in place
right now past the extension of the FAST Act with bipartisan support with the intent to come back in 2021
with a new better funded highway bill. So I think there's probably 2 likely outcomes, both of which should
occur in 2021. One is early in 2021, our new congress probably passes a stimulus package, which includes
added infrastructure funding. And then two, and really importantly, congress passes a new better highway
funded -- a new better funded highway bill in late 2021. So regardless, we believe we'll see improved
federal funding for highways next year.

Along those lines, most of our key states have now settled their budgets and understand what their spend
profile is going to look like from 2021. The vast majority of those have increased funding, few were flat. I
think the only one that we would see down somewhat would be probably Kentucky, which is not one of our
top 10 states. So I think overall, as we look at funding going into '21 and beyond, we should see it grow in
'21 based on the states DOTs budgets and outlooks. And then past that, we should see improved funding
from stimulus and also from a new highway bill.

Brian Biros
Thompson Research Group, LLC

Got it. I guess as a good segue to my next question. So I think you answered some of it, but I guess it's
really with the COVID impact in 2020 and a lot of stuff you just talked about. What does that mean, I
guess, for visibility for infrastructure funding and feature lettings? Really, our understanding of the outlook
is, as you kind of said, pretty bright for a lot of the states, California, Georgia, Illinois, kind of going into
even 2022. I guess, can you maybe give some color on those states specifically and maybe some of the
other ones, Texas, Virginia, Florida?

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Yes. So I think as we look at specifically, state specific, Georgia is budgeted up slightly in 2021 and '22
will be an exciting year because they are planning on 6 major projects in lettings in 2022. Tennessee, '21
will be flat with 20, but that's up 10% in both years from '19. Illinois is budgeting up $1 billion annually
starting next year. That's for 6 years. Now '21, they plan on preparing that with most of that spending on
engineering to prepare for the next 5 or 6 years, which I applaud them for doing that. So they don't have
the bottlenecks that we've seen in other states trying to put that money to work. Texas is up substantially
from 2021. And then Caltrans has announced that they're -- the keys to -- related to highway construction
and maintenance, which drive the aggregate demand will be up 6%.

So I think a bright future, I would -- as I said in my opening comments, remember these DOTs slowed
lettings in July, August and September, till they got confidence in revenues. Now they're starting to pick
lettings back up. So you may have a little bit of catch-up tail end of this year and beginning of next year.
But overall, I think we have a -- we can see a path to demand growth in the highway segment.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens.

Trey Grooms
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So on the margin front, you guys are doing a great job in a very challenging environment. Aggregates
cash gross profit per ton being up 5% even with the volume being down 8%. And of course, you had the
wet weather and forest fires. I mean, that's pretty impressive. But as we look at it, you've got -- diesel
was your friend, but you guys have been focusing on cost control and operational efficiencies for some
time. And Suzanne, I appreciate some of the color there. But could you walk us through some of the
successes you're having on that front outside of diesel? And maybe the sustainability there as well as the
improvement in SAG expenses, the thoughts on SAG leverage going forward would be helpful.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. And thank you for recognizing that. I think our teams have done an excellent job in the third
quarter, but also this year, and we saw really solid margin growth in both. And in spite of -- as you said,
in spite of volume challenges and cash gross profit per ton has grown from $6.71 last year to $7.15 this
year. So that's a year-to-date, we've turned in 7% unit margin improvement and the face of volumes
going down 4%. And to me, it's proof that our people are really hard at work implementing our 4 strategic
disciplines and that's working.

So we've seen solid pricing gains earned by our sales folks and our logistics teams. You couple that with
a disciplined operating performance by our quarry and procurement teams, and they're really improving
those unit metrics that drive cost. We do have the tailwind of diesel, but that doesn't make up for what
they've done, particularly in the face of some real challenges with that wet weather, it's just tough to
crush rock.

And this -- all of this continues to create value for our shareholders. And this is really important to
remember that as demand returns, we'll be able to compound these gains in unit margins over time. So
we're going to put it in our pocket and not let it go. I think that this year, we've shown marked progress
towards our longer-term goal of $9 cash gross profit per ton, trailing 12 months were at $7.15. So this
points to, we've got the right strategy, and I think our people have done a good job executing it and a
good job executing it in tough times. So my hat's off to them, and I thank them.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I'll just add to that, Trey. If you go back to our Investor Day last year, we had a slide that showed
what our cash gross profit had done since 2013, which we kind of mark as when we reached an inflection
point and return to growth after the Great Recession. And if you look at that compound annual growth
rate and cash gross profit per ton over time, it's up about 7%. And we were particularly pleased with that

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

performance, but really pleased with the fact that, as we've talked about, we've been able to move that
forward in 3 of the quarters this year.

And I think it's also important to note diesel was a tailwind. It helped. But even if you strip the diesel
tailwind out of that impact, both in the second quarter and in the third quarter, we still move cash gross
profit per ton forward. And I think that's really, as Tom said, a testament to the folks in the field who are
working very hard. It's not an easy job to keep your cash cost flat year-over-year. So again, we appreciate
everything that they've done. I think the other thing that is pleasing about that march forward is that it's
-- we're kind of getting ever closer quarter-by-quarter to the $9 per ton cash gross profit goal that we also
talked about. And to just illustrate that progression for people who want to be reminded of that or are new
on the call here, we've included a slide in the slide pack that accompanied the press release that actually
shows that progression over time and where we stand now in relation to that longer-term goal.

You also asked about SAG expense. And again, we had another quarter of improvement there with the
decline being about $5 million or 6% year-over-year. That really resulted as it has all year from some cost
reduction things that we did right at the end of fourth quarter, right at the beginning of the year in 2020,
and we are continuing to benefit from those cost reduction actions that we took as well as, as I said on
the last call, we've got some other ongoing initiatives. We're always looking for ways to be more efficient,
improve use technology, et cetera. And I think the important thing to think about as we talk about SAG,
is that the question we sometimes get and other companies get is, look, how much of that is temporary?
Well, based on what we did at the start of the year, those are more permanent cost reductions. I think in
terms of whether or not something is temporary, you look at T&E. And I think that for ourselves and for
other people, we've learned a lot about managing through the pandemic. And so I don't think for us or lots
of other companies out there, we will see a return to a level of T&E that existed before.

So I think that's going to be some money that we put in our pocket as we continue to use Zoom
Technologies and other communication technologies to our advantage.

Trey Grooms
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. And you guys and the team are doing a great job. So hats off from me as well. As my follow-up,
Tom, you mentioned that your expectation for highway demand in your markets might start a little slower
in '21, but then pick up as we go through the year. And understanding there's maybe more uncertainty
today than normal, but could you give us any high-level thoughts around your other end markets looking
into next year and maybe the first half versus the second half there. So just any color you're willing to
share with us there would be helpful as well.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Thank you. To answer your question, really about 2021, too early to predict. We're doing the work
right now. I think the most encouraging sector is residential. We think it was doing great right now. It
will do very well in 2021, it's to the point where now we're building new subdivisions, which are more
aggregate intensive, so very encouraging. Highways, as we said, the budgets are now set. And now we're
seeing highway lettings start to catch up to those budgets. The lettings were a little conservative in July,
August, September, but October, November, December and the first quarter of next year looks much
better. So looking better and a lot more clarity to the highway segment.

The big unknown is nonres. While it dropped -- leading indicators dropped as we talked about in the
second quarter, they started improving, albeit not back to pre-COVID levels. I think as we watch these
projects and watch COVID, it's going to be a matter of the market's confidence both in the economy and
most importantly, in the pandemic. The nonres sector wants to start. We see a lot of green shoots. We
see people -- we're actually seeing bidding activity up, which is a good sign. Now that's -- we're quoting
activity, where that's not booking yet, and there's a time delay. So we'll see if that continues. But we are
encouraged by it and it is encouraging, but we've still got work to do and still have some indicators and
some -- need some more signs to really understand what's going to happen in 2021. But much better
visibility today than 3 or 6 months ago, and that visibility is much more encouraging.

Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel.

Stanley Stoker Elliott
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Kind of stick on that -- the outlook piece. The increase on the CapEx, certainly, to us, is kind of a positive
indicator in terms of the views. What are you all looking to put that money to work with on? Is it the
greenfield? Is it other production your plans? Just curious for some color around that.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you. So you saw we raised our CapEx slightly from a range of $275 million to $325 million. It
goes up to $300 million to $350 million. So a modest increase of both ends for $25 million. Most of this,
at this point, is going to go towards replacement capital. That said, we are now starting up the growth
projects that we had paused on until we had clarity. I think that the team feels like now that we have
the appropriate visibility to demand in our markets that gives us the confidence to restart those growth
projects.

Now we'll spend a little bit of that increase this year, but most of that, you'll see as we march and as we
really get into those projects in 2021. But we're excited about that. And I think that the market would
tell us this time to get going, so we can finish them at the appropriate time. And that's the beauty about
greenfields. You can control the timing and you can speed it up or slow it down as you have market
visibility. But we're -- I think the whole team is glad that we're cranking those back up and glad that we
have been.

Stanley Stoker Elliott
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

In terms of pricing, last year, I believe you all had put out pricing letters, maybe a little bit earlier. The
commentary in the release and on the call sound pretty encouraging in terms of the outlook for price. With
that sort of outlook potentially for demand into next year, we shouldn't really assume much of a cadence
difference or difference in the cadence in terms of pricing or any context you could talk about some of the
early letters would be great.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I think let's look back and then look forward. As always, the most challenging environment for
pricing is unknowns or the lack of visibility to demand. And COVID-19 created a lot of those unknowns.
And while there's still some questions about timing and future demand growth, really mainly in the nonres
segment. Many of those unknowns that we were struggling with 3 or 6 months ago are much better
defined and are improving, primarily in residential construction and highway demand, where we're seeing
a growth or a clear path to growth.

So as always, aggregate pricing is resilient, it's just more resilient when you have visibility to demand
growth, which as I said, is a lot better today than it was a few months ago. And obviously, price is a very
important metric, but it's the most important metric for us or the most important controllable metric for
us is unit margin, where price is a big component, but cost is too. And as you heard me say, we've done a
good job growing that unit margin metric. We're having -- we're right now having the price conversations
with our customers. Our letters have already been sent out. I think those communications and those
conversations are going very well. Visibility to demand growth in residential construction, you couple that
with the DOTs outlook or growing revenues and their budgets for 2021 is encouraging to all parts of the
construction materials industry and the construction industry, period.

I would tell you, at this juncture, it would appear based on conversation that I think that all parts of the
construction sector will be able to improve pricing in 2021. And so that's encouraging. And I would tell you
that it's driven by improvement in visibility and confidence in the markets.

Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Tom, given the visibility you just talked about, and I guess, October volumes down 5% versus down 8%
in the quarter. Is it appropriate to think 3Q could sort of represent a year-over-year kind of trough in
demand and then given the strength that you've seen in gross margins despite volume declines, how
should we think about -- when you do return to growth, your ability to maybe outperform the 60% kind of
long-term target that you laid out for incremental margins?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

So let's talk about October first, and then we'll kind of get into those other pieces of this. October volume
was down 5%, but it was really driven by 1 less workday. So on a daily run rate basis, volumes were
virtually flat. And if you look at October, I would tell you that I think shipments were aided by better
weather in October than October of 2019, so an easier comp, but you probably also had demand push
from the third quarter in October. I mean, weather was rough. We had -- we saw markets that had 17,
18, 19, 20-plus more rain days in the third quarter in '20 than '21. I mean, excuse me, '20 than '19.
Remember '19 was an abnormally dry third quarter. So it's a little bit of a difference in comps. And so
you're seeing some of that work catch up in October.

What I think that leads us into a solid start -- good start to a solid fourth quarter gives us confidence in
our full year guidance and makes us feel a lot better about it. I do -- I would hope that, that is the trough.
It was just a tough quarter. Not just COVID, but -- and as we talked about wet weather, we talked about
just losing so many days, but in California, it wasn't just the fires. The fires caused daily outages of power,
which curtails cement production. So us and our concrete customers just had to shut down. We couldn't
supply the market even when we had days that would allow us to do it. Those cement problems are solved
and we're back shipping more normal in California. So that -- and that -- again, that volume doesn't go
away, and we'll catch it up over the coming months. So I think that as we look forward, as I said, based
on visibility and res and the settling of state budgets with increased funding, that coupled with incurring
news, albeit still below levels in nonres, I think that the future looks very encouraging for us.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on highway spending, I mean, I think most or almost all of your
major states that spending is in a lockbox, and you talked about state budgets being a bit better than
expected maybe 3 months ago, 6 months ago. Have you seen any efforts within your major states to
break the lockbox or other state needs, maybe trumping DOTs or being able to maybe claw some of that
funds away? Or just -- have you seen anything like that?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

We've seen nothing like that. I wouldn't -- I would be very surprised if we saw it. And remember that the
state DOTs and the states also recognize that like everybody else does, that highway construction is a very
good economic stimulus. And so it is a good way to put people to work, help the economy in those states.
And that work is needed as are those roads and highways. So I wouldn't expect to see an effort to rob the
highway coffers.

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Nice to hear your voices. I'm wondering if you can talk about the pricing cadence on the spot market
over the course of the quarter, you folks have spoken about essentially training folks for consistent price
increase on the spot market. But obviously, this was not a great environment for it. So any update on how
that tracked over the course of the quarter here.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

It's pretty easy to sum that up. It has been volatile, but then again, the world has been volatile. And
big swings on good news and questionable news. I would expect us going forward, which I think is more
important that as if you see clarity to the future and an encouraging future from a demand perspective,
and as we can kind of march along with that, keep improving a little bit, a little bit at a time, which I think
is going to happen, that will take some of the volatility out.

You couple that with what we've done very consistently quarter-in and quarter-out of improving our
unit margin, our gross cash gross profit per ton, 7% for the year. And that we have confidence that our
strategic disciplines will allow us to do that kind of as we've been trying to do, and we talked about during
September regardless of what happens to the outside world in controlling our destiny.

So I think that we internally have the confidence and the ability to turn consistent unit margins. You
couple that with that there is encouraging news about demand and shipments near-term and longer-term
continue to look better, I think, will help us out.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then, Tom, as you pointed out, I think in your prepared remarks, we've seen lettings slow in the
early part this year off of tougher comps.

I'm wondering in your business, can you talk about the length of your public construction backlog today
compared to a year ago, just put that into context for us, if you could, in terms of what has that meant for
visibility in your business?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I think there's a -- as the states were watching their revenues, and they felt like they were coming
back fast, but they had -- they couldn't count on it. So while they said, "Look, we think our budgets are
going to be okay for 2021." They didn't have the freedom just to keep the same letting schedule that I
think they had originally thought they were going to have. So they were conservative in lettings in July
and August and September. And so now they're playing catch up. I think you'll see letting -- you're seeing
lettings go up and a number of our states substantially in October, November, December.

I think their schedules that I'm seeing now in the first and second quarter will be up. So -- and that's
consistent with their spend profile and their budgets for 2021. So while there was some conservative in
the third quarter, you'll see lettings go up fourth quarter and first couple of quarters for 2021. So I don't
think that changes a lot. Maybe some timing, but that's it.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And sorry, Tom, can you just comment on the backlog part of the question, so what's the length of backlog
today? Can you just quantify for us for the public side of business? .

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I think what we're seeing is the backlogs are good in res. The backlogs and highways are solid, and I think
our backlogs in nonres have taken a hit, which you would expect. As I said earlier, I think one of the things
that's encouraging to me is on the private side, you're seeing quote activity improve. Now you got to --

once you quote it, you got to book it, and there has been some longer delays in bookings as people were
waiting to see, have confidence in the pandemic in the economy, but I think we're starting to see shoots
where that's starting to improve also. So encouraging.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I want to follow up on some of the pricing and maybe just get some relative comments because I think in
the -- on current state of play, I think in the slide deck you put, you've seen like-for-like pricing in most
major markets. Can you just give us kind of a rundown of where you're seeing the most price strength and
conversely it sounds like some markets are still weaker. Can you just give us a sense of which markets
may not be seeing growth right now?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Actually, we saw pricing pretty consistent across our footprint for the year. And I think if you look at the
vast majority of markets, we've seen price increases, if you mix adjust it. I think that where it's been a
little weaker of recent on a mix adjusted basis, would be California. We expect that with clean stone of
concrete aggregate not shipping. And base still going. But that, as I said, will correct itself. And I think
that's really a mix issue, not a price issue. But our pricing was pretty consistent across our footprint of
what we implemented in January and then what was implemented really from between April 1 and June 1.
We talked about that in the second quarter. We had a little bit of catch-up, but that was in -- it was -- it all
went through.

And I think as we look forward in the conversations we're having, I think it's easier to have those
conversations now and over the last month, and to get those letters out because everybody across the
segment has visibility in the pricing. But it's been pretty consistent across our footprint, and I don't see
any places that really have had a lot of pricing headwinds or that would affect us as we move forward to --
as those conversations go into '21.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

I think it's an important add-on to that, if we look across the footprint, we've also, as we said in the earlier
comments, we've also seen unit profitability improvement in virtually every single one of those markets
as well. So what you're looking at there is the combined effect of increases in price and good cost control
since our cash costs were flat year-over-year.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Mike, one thing to point out, I think that is -- and I've talked to most of our division presidents over the
last few weeks, the conversations, and this is really important for 2021, are pretty consistent. And I think
that across our footprint, I think the market is encouraged that 2021, we start to see -- res is doing great.
Again, we start to see confidence in highway revenue growth, and we're starting to see green shoots
in the nonres, which has been the weakest and that the fact that the nonres just wants to start. The
economy wants to get going and we've got election almost behind us, the pandemic. Hopefully, there will
be an end in sight. And I think people are getting confidence that the world is in a better place.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I think with respect to nonres, we talked about this on the last call and it still holds true today.
It's sort of the sector of some haves and have-nots, and I won't go through all of those, what's kind of --
what's up and what's down because it's relatively unchanged. But as we look across our business. I've got

a list of a dozen or so projects here that are -- you have data center related. For example, we spoke to the
strength in warehouses and distribution centers in our earlier remarks, but we're -- we continue to see it
in data centers from Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, I mean, all those big names are represented in
work that we're doing right now.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's good to hear. The second question, I guess, just a quick one, shifting gears to asphalt and
concrete. I think both were called out as having some regional issues associated with wildfires, but also
just overall weather. I know it's tough to pinpoint numbers like this, but could you give a sense of your
best guess on how much of those impacts were wildfires or weather and how those businesses were
shaping up in October?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. So remember, asphalt is going to be more private driven -- excuse me, more public-driven and
concrete is going to be more private-driven, but I'll take them one at a time. Our volumes were down
13% in asphalt, it was wet weather in our big asphalt markets didn't help us there and fires in Northern
California didn't help us. But -- and we had some jobs that didn't repeat. Some big jobs in Nashville that
didn't repeat. That being said, our gross profit was up 9%, over $2.5 million. And that was driven by, I
think, good cost control, solid pricing and liquid AC savings. I think looking forward, we continue to be
encouraged by asphalt. So it's a combination of fires, rain and just timing on some big highway work.

If you look concrete, we really did get hit. There's obviously a COVID-19 impact because of nonresidential
construction. That being said, our volumes were down 11%, and we had extremely wet weather in D.C.,
and then we have cement shortages in Northern California. So I think as we look forward, we'd definitely
be encouraged about Northern California as we got work to make up. And I think that as the residential
construction in Northern Virginia will help us in that and nonres will continue to march forward.

So some challenges from a nonres perspective on concrete. But I think the next couple of quarters, we
should see better volume performance.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Seldon Clarke of Deutsche Bank.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just given all the moving parts as it relates to pricing in the third quarter and some of the seemingly
transitory headwinds you talked about. Could you just give us a sense of maybe how pricing has trended
in October? And maybe just what's assumes in your full year guidance?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

So I would answer that question this way, I wouldn't expect a lot of variation in the cadence of pricing of
what we've seen this year versus what we're going to see in the fourth quarter. I don't see anything to
really change the direction we've been going.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Yes. I don't see a lot of change in what we've done for the year versus what's going to happen in the
fourth quarter.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then so you talked about cash gross profit per ton, sort of growing in line with that
historical rate of 7% per year, and it looks like OpEx per ton is also growing in line with your historical rate
at just under 1% per year, obviously, some help from diesel, but volume is a little bit tougher.

So if things do stabilize from here on the nonresi side, meaning don't get significantly worse and start to
show some improvement in the back half of 2021, is it fair to expect the sort of same relationship then in
2021, assuming diesel is flat? Or are there some potential offsets that might just cause this relationship to
differ from either a cash gross profit or OpEx per ton perspective?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

If you look at the slide that Suzanne referenced, it is in the deck, I think it's probably the last slide in the
deck, you can see over time, what's going on with our cash gross profit per ton. And you can particularly
look at it over the last 3 or 4 years as we've been implementing our strategic disciplines and maturing
those strategic disciplines which I would tell you, they're still in fairly early stages of maturing, but
working.

That was -- the reason we put those in was those disciplines in place and worked so hard on them is that
we felt like in good times, and always, it allowed us to live up to our potential. And in good times, when
volumes were growing, we would get all we could get. In tough times, with what we're seeing right now, it
allows us to make the most out of whatever the world deals us. And so you see consistent growth. What's
impressive to me is you see that growth in unit margins in the last 3 months or year to trailing 12 months
of this year and now volumes have gone down. And that's just hard to do. And that's just good work.

And I think that to answer the question about 2021, we've got work to do. We're going through those
plans and those budgets, whether it's price or volume or cost or operating disciplines and what we have to
do right now. So too early to call, but I think you can look back at history, and you can look at consistency,
and you can look at what's been accomplished over the last 3 quarters with really some tough headwinds
and regardless of that, we've been able to improve unit margins. And I've got tell you, I'm proud of
our teams and my hats off to them that they've done an excellent job with that. That's tough to do. In
particularly, it's tough to do with volume. Volumes particularly tough to do when you got a pandemic and
extreme weather.

So the goal here is month-in, month-out, quarter-in, quarter-out, year-in, year-out to improve those unit
margins regardless of what happens to outside forces. So obviously, easier when things are improving. But
we'll give you a lot of clarity to that in February about where we think we can go. To give you a number
right now would be premature as we're doing the planning.

Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Tom, it's really encouraging to hear letting starting to pick back up on the public side in September,
October and bidding activity picking up a little bit in nonres. But can you help us understand the lag when
you see that actually start to flow through your volumes? And when we start thinking about 2021 in terms
of the shape of the year, could you be in a position to grow in the back half of next year?

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

I think that I would profess that -- first of all, next year, too early to tell. I think that if you're talking
about the back half, it's a lot more possible than the front half. But a lot of -- if you see growth in 2021 in
volumes there's a lot of stars got to line up, particularly with timing of work in big highway work and even
more importantly, the timing of getting big nonres work, bid and bid and booked and started.

I think it's tough it would be difficult to have all those stars line up to see volume growth in 2020, not
impossible, but I think it's difficult. And I think that again, we don't know we've got to -- we're working on
getting all those answers, and so we'll put that together. I think, as we said, I think based on the highway
letting sequencing of lettings not being as strong in July, August, September, but picking up in October,
November, December and then scheduled to pick up in the first half. Those jobs are anywhere from 4
months to 9 months, usually. I would tell you that -- and -- but if they've got the work and they can get to
work, particularly with overlays, it can go faster.

If you look at nonresidential, historically, I would have told you 6 to 12 months, although 2020 has been
the great exception of that because we've seen work move all over the place. Again, as the private sector
gets confidence in the pandemic and in the market, I think we'll see those -- the timing of quote, to book,
to shipping improve, I think we've always seen some improvement in that, but work to be done. And --
but as I think that is what we've seen so far is encouraging and all of the above. And then res is going. I
mean, there's no question it's going and it's going well.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then from a pricing standpoint, I mean, we can all appreciate the pricing power in your
aggregates business even if demand is weak, we saw in the great financial crisis. What about your
downstream business? I mean, they're certainly in great markets. But if demand is a little softer start next
year, and we got muted inflation, how do you think about pricing, whether it's asphalt or your ready-mix
concrete business?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

So I'll take asphalt first, and I would point you to unit margins in asphalt as opposed to price just because
pricing can move around with indexing with liquid AC. As we've called -- as we talked about a year ago,
the liquid numbers have come way down, and we've been able to put that savings to unit margins. And
I think that, again, we're doing the plannings. I have not seen the plannings on liquid AC. I think that
the fact that you've got the DOTs with better clarity and improved visibility to growing revenues, that
helps. Because that gives everybody some headroom to be able to take risk on price in asphalt and on
aggregates and just on construction work. So encouraged there.

We've -- the markets we're in, in concrete are DC and -- the D.C. market and the Napa Valley market
have pretty consistent unit margins throughout, because they're unique concrete markets because
of abnormally high barriers to entry. And so I think that as we see res improve and as we see nonres
continue, hopefully, to improve. It will do -- will also help unit margins and volumes in the concrete sector.

early stages. And we're seeing -- we're looking -- as always, we're looking at some projects out there.
I think that all of the unknowns with the pandemic is just do a wet blanket on that. I think as that gets
clear, this will pick back up.

As always, sellers are going to sell when the time is right, whether that is for personal reasons, for family
planning for succession planning or strategic moves, and we'll be in the game. And as you hear me talk
about it all the time, we'll be disciplined about how we look at those acquisitions. But we've seen some
pickup, but not maybe back to pre-pandemic levels yet.

Jeffrey Stevenson
Longbow Research LLC

Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tom, unless I missed it, I don't think you mentioned what you're seeing in
Florida and Virginia from a DOT budget perspective. I was just wondering if you could provide any update
on those states.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Florida, I would tell you, has been a really good story and kind of flat to slightly up. I don't think we
see any change in Florida, and so good news from a fire perspective. And Virginia is a very good story.
Virginia's budget -- is budgeted to be up 13%. Now -- and that's where we had the increase in gas taxes
this year in Virginia. Now it has not been approved by the Virginia Congress yet. They're supposed to
do that in January, but -- so lettings will hopefully continue along that path, even though they haven't
approved the budget.

But so far so good, and I would expect us to see growth in revenues and budgets in Virginia from '20 to
'21 based on the proposed budget at 13%, and I think the revenue is going to be okay.

Adam Robert Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

Did the FAST Act, Tom -- what's the postmortem on that? Was that actually helpful for you, the extension?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Oh, yes, for sure. And that's what we talked about that we needed an extension, and we needed a decent
term in that extension of -- and the best what we had wanted was 12 months. So what that allows to
happen is, and it allows the state DOTs to have clarity through their fiscal year 2021, which is what
they all need, and they can't be going quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month because it chops up big
jobs because they don't know what's going to happen. I think that as I -- as we talked about earlier, it's
important to note that the new Congress, the new house and the new senate will pretty much have the
same balance of power is what we saw when we've passed the extension of the FAST Act.

And remember, that extension was passed with bipartisan support. And with bipartisan support, what we
heard from both parties was this was allowed in time, get through the election, come back and passed
a better funded new highway bill in 2021. So that's why we said that may be the fact that the balance
of power doesn't change, plays in our favor because there's already been substantial work done by the
subcommittees, both in the house and the senate, towards a new bill, some of that bipartisan, some of
that not bipartisan, but that we've got a draft and we've got drafts. And so now it's a matter of negotiating
and tweaking as opposed to having to start over with the new pen.

pretty quick because that was the bipartisan support and the intent when they pass the extension of the
FAST Act.

Adam Robert Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then on nonres, when did you guys actually start seeing volume declines in nonres? Because
the way that the indicators have been going. I would think that the real nonres downturn is actually in '21
before recovery in '22.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

So what we saw was it go down like immediately, March, April. And it sunk like a rock. What we've seen
coming out of the -- or coming since then is we've seen some sequential growth in leading indicators of
nonres, somewhat choppy and it, obviously, gets impacted by spikes and COVID-19. You'll also see, as we
talked about, we saw a lot of jobs push way back in the second quarter. Some of those came back in the
third quarter, some got pushed again. So it's quite choppy, and it's been -- yes, volumes have gotten hit
this year, and that's -- the majority of that volume drop, I think, is going to be in the nonres sector.

Residential, if you remember, it dropped kind of in April, and then it came zooming back in May, June and
has never stopped. So as you're on the street, nonres is still way down, shipments are still down. But
hopefully, we've got some of the worse behind us.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I'll just -- I'll add a little color to that is if you go back to the beginning of the year and sort of really
year-to-date through the end of February, our starts were up on the nonres side, kind of 9% to 10%. So
going into the year, it was a -- it looked like a pretty good performance ahead from a starts perspective.
And then when we got to the month of April after it was clear that COVID-19 was going to be here for a
while and was a big issue. Those starts dropped by about 50%. And by the time we got to May and June,
we had seen a little bit of improvement. Actually in June, we got about half of April's decline back.

And since June, as Tom said, July, August, September, we've seen little bits of sequential improvement. It
seems that it moves somewhat similar to what you see in the number of COVID cases and the number of
-- the level of surge that it's been out there. So that's why we said last quarter, and we still stand by this,
when COVID, the number of cases and the surge dies down a bit, you see those starts begin to pop back
up. I think we just need a few months of some certainty there because I think it -- there's a lot of interest
in nonres construction. I think people just want a little bit more certainty.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas of Vertical Research.

Michael Stephan Dudas
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Following up on the nonres side, certainly, you called out and others have been calling out data center
warehousing, distribution centers as a positive towards the mix and certainly like in the state of Virginia,
where -- certainly, that's a big investment that we're seeing from the big tech and distribution guys.

How does that change as a percent of your backlog in your business, maybe from what it was prior to
pandemic? And is there -- is that more -- is it quicker to market-type opportunities? And is the size or the
intensity of the aggregate use helpful with that end of the market relative to some to be able to -- have
been somewhat muted in 2020?

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2020

Yes. As Suzanne mentioned earlier, we've got over a dozen projects that were in some of warehouses and
distribution centers that we either booked or in the process of booking across our footprint. And those are
just ones that I can think off of the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. So it's had an impact on our
backlogs, a very positive impact on our backlogs. And as we said, the future of that will look very good
because of where we are and where those are, Dodge predicts that 90% of all of the new construction on
warehouses and distribution centers that construction over the next 2 years will be in our market.

So this is not -- this will be great demand to come for the next couple of years. So we're encouraged by
it. It's also, as you pointed out, it is wide and flat. So it is more aggregate intensive. If you think about
what has to go into those, is not high. It's more intensive in the parking lots for base and asphalt and
in the foundations of those warehouses where you pour concrete. So it is somewhat more aggregate
intensive than the total -- on the high end of aggregate intensity for the total nonconstruction -- excuse
me, nonresidential construction mix.

Michael Stephan Dudas
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

That makes sense. Appreciate that. And just a follow-up. Just generally, Tom, in California, looking out
to 2021 and maybe 2022, and certainly, the pandemic and the issues in California relative to some other
major states, do you think there's a better opportunity overall from all your businesses and what you
serve? Is there a better opportunity in '21 to surprise to the upside or maybe surprise to maybe the
downside relative to what the expectations might be? .

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think, as I said earlier, I think you're going to see some volume push from '20 into '21, based
on the rough, terrible third quarter and into the fourth quarter that we experienced in California with
wildfires. While the wildfires curtail business and were tragic, it also from our business, we got the double
hit because of power outages, it curtails cement production. So everybody was -- nobody could get
enough cement to supply the market. That demand doesn't go away. It just gets pushed back. So I think
we do have some catch-up in the last -- and that cement production or availability is just now coming
back. So you're going to have some of the -- some of the shipments push into the last couple of months of
this year and in the first couple of quarters of 2021, and while that hurt in '20, it will help in '21.

Residential construction, while it also got paused by all the reasons I just talked about has come roaring
back and starts are up, I think, in the trailing 1 month over -- between 20% and 30%. You couple that
with the news from Caltrans, the demand -- the revenues will be up 6% and the things that control. Some
that will help aggregates and asphalt.

As like many other places, nonres has taken a hit, and it's got a -- it's -- and we're feeling that hit, and so
we got to recover from that hit, and that will be -- that's really the unknown for us in California in 2021.
And we'll give you a lot clearer view of that when we get to giving you our projections in February.

Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Yes. I guess I want to start by just asking about an infrastructure bill as distinct from the highway bill.
And the answer you gave to a previous question, just talking about the likelihood of growth and volume in
2021 and maybe second half better than first half. But just to get an infrastructure bill early in the stage of
the new administration, how does that change your perspective on that volume profile through 2021?

And maybe as part of that question, just to the extent you could address just what you think is out there
in terms of shovel-ready projects and just how quickly that could come through into VMC revenues?

Chairman, President & CEO

So I think our focus is really is not to get lost in a major infrastructure bill. The important thing is a
highway bill. Now that may be part of a larger infrastructure bill, but the piece of this is, that's really
important is infrastructure is a broad category. And we're -- what I'm talking to is really about the federal
highway bill, and the extension of the FAST Act, the work that's been done on the federal highway bill in
both the house and the senate and it's got bipartisan support. And then we have a foundation moving
forward.

Now could that be rolled into a broader infrastructure package? Yes. I think it's more likely that it's
addressed as a specific highway bill. Now separate from that is there's been a lot of talk about stimulus
and the stimulus analysis discussions before the end of the year, beginning of 2021, whether that's --
the congress is in now or the new congress, I think somewhere over the next few months, you do get
a stimulus package. Hopefully, it will include some infrastructure funding, and that will be additive to
anything we're talking about.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Any sense you could share your expectations around that? Just is there any way to size that?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

There's -- I don't think we can at this point. If you look at the -- if you -- from a stimulus perspective,
that's hard to do, and there's a lot of conversations, timing and magnitude, I think it's tough to call. If you
look at the highway bill, I would look back at history, and look back at drafts of bills that came out of the
senate and draft the bill that came out of the house that showed funding up 30% to 40% range. And that
doesn't -- that gives you some kind of idea of how the authors of those bills were thinking about it. And
many of those authors are still in place in those subcommittees and staff that has been -- which is a good
thing because we don't start from 0. We don't start with a new piece of paper and a new pen so that we
have some momentum with this.

Now that being said, a highway bill that passes in 2021 will not impact shipments in 2021. It takes a year
to 2 years to get funding to work. And that's what we've seen as we saw the dramatic increase in states
funding. Many of those have matured into the or maturing into it. I would tell you that I would hope that
because the states, at least our states have broadened their capabilities and expanded their capabilities to
handle new funding. Hopefully, they can put it to work quicker than what we saw with the improvement of
the FAST Act and the new federal bill versus what we saw with the big jump in state revenues.

I'm sorry, you cut out on us again.

Xintong Ouyang
On Field Investment Research LLP

Sorry, can you hear me now?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Yes, we can hear you hear.

Xintong Ouyang
On Field Investment Research LLP

Yes. But can you hear me now?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we can.

Xintong Ouyang
On Field Investment Research LLP

Great. So I have a question on -- So my question is that -- yes. The European Cement Association
President suggested recently that the replacement of virgin aggregates by recycled concretes can take
up to 20% of the aggregate content in concrete. So we're thinking in an environment where recycling is
getting more important and especially in Europe, probably in the U.S. as well in the future, just wanted to
know what do you think of it? Do you think of it as a threat for aggregates business? Or you actually think
of it as an opportunity?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean, for today and for years, recycle has been an integral part of the construction.

Can you hear me okay? Okay. For years, recycle has been a part of construction materials, both whether
that is asphalt or those in concrete. And it does have limitations from a quality perspective and end uses,
but it's a part of the business today. We are in that business. And it's just an integral part of overall
construction, but I don't see it as a threat. I was thinking it's reality today in part of the business, and
we're in that business. So it's part of the core of construction materials.

Operator

And that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Tom Hill for any additional or closing
remarks.
