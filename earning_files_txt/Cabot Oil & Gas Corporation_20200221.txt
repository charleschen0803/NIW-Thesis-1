CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2019
Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]

Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go
ahead.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Gary, and good morning all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's fourth quarter full
year 2019 earnings call. I do have the management team here with me today. I would first like to remind
everyone that on this call, this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current
expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-
looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release.

For 2019, Cabot reported its best year in company history, while posting record levels of net income,
operating cash flow, free cash flow, production, proved reserves and operating expense per unit. Some
of the key highlights for the year include 41% growth in adjusted earnings per share, 90% growth in free
cash flow, a return on capital employed of 22%, a return of $665 million of capital to shareholders through
a combination of share repurchases and 2 increases in our quarterly dividend per share. This represented
a return of 118% of our free cash flow, far exceeding our target of returning at least 50% of our annual
cash flow. And 18% increase in production and 11% increase in year-end proved reserves. And an 18%
reduction in all-in operating expenses per unit to $1.44 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent and a reduction in
net debt to 0.7x EBITDAX.

I think, by all standards, a very good year.

Specific to the fourth quarter of '19, despite declining natural gas prices, we still generated $121 million
of adjusted net income or $0.30 per share and $110 million of free cash flow, while returning over 190%
of our free cash flow for the quarter to shareholders. We ended the fourth quarter with $200 million of
cash on the balance sheet, which coupled with our expectations for a fifth consecutive year of free cash
flow. And 2020 will allow us to continue to return a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders, while
also providing financial strength in a challenging market. On the operational front, in yesterday's release,
we provided the results of our Upper Marcellus test from the last 2 years, which delivered an average
EUR per 1,000 of approximately 2.7 Bcf. We believe these results highlight that our upper Marcellus, as a
distinct incremental interval and it generates return that exceed the majority of assets across the basin.
We plan to continue to test a limited number of upper Marcellus wells annually to further optimize lateral
placement and completion designs.

However, our recent results are relatively in line with the average EUR of 2.9 Bcf per 1,000 foot across
all of our upper Marcellus drilled to date, which is a much larger sample size of over 50 wells. In the
release, we also made reference to over 2 decades of remaining inventory life, which is consistent with
our measure -- measuring over the past few years regarding our ability to continue to primarily focus
on development plans on the Lower Marcellus through the latter part of this decade, before moving to
the full development of the Upper Marcellus, which provides inventory life into the 2040 decade. This
assumes a return to modest levels of growth in the future, if the price environment warrants it. In addition
to the Lower and Upper Marcellus, we have tested other concepts across our acreage position that would
be incremental to our multi-decade inventory life, while the testing of these concepts is still in the early
phase. The results we have seen to date are very encouraging.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2020

Moving on to our plans for 2020. Earlier this month, we announced our official 2020 plan, which included
the adoption of previously disclosed maintenance capital program of $575 million, representing a 27%
reduction in capital spending year-over-year. Our corporate strategy has always been centered around the
acute focus on disciplined capital allocation, and we believe this reduction in capital further demonstrates
our commitment to that philosophy. Our 2020 program is projected to deliver an average net production
rate of 2.4 Bcf cubic foot per day, up for the full year based on the current NYMEX future curve. This
plan is expected to generate enough free cash flow to cover our dividend, while also providing a modest
amount of excess free cash flow for further returns of capital to shareholders or debt repayment. At a
$2.25 average NYMEX price, the plan is expected to generate $275 million to $300 million of free cash
flow, while delivering a return on capital employed of 11% to 12%, not too many programs can represent
that. We believe our current plan is the appropriate level of capital investment in this market environment.

However, we will continue to assess the outlook for the natural gas market in 2020 and 2021 and are
prepared to discuss capital spending reductions further if market conditions warranted. Our guidance for
2020 includes modest sequential production declines in the first and second quarter, which we believe is
prudent given the weakness in pricing we've experienced during the first quarter and expect to experience
in the spring shoulder season. We are currently forecasting an increase in production beginning in the
second half of the year, which corresponds with improvement in prices across the NYMEX future curve. As
we look to 2021, while it's too premature to issue any formal guidance, given the likelihood of continued
volatility and commodity prices throughout the year, I would expect us to adopt a similar program next
year if natural gas prices were to remain lower for the foreseeable future

I would also add that while we are fully prepared for a continuation in this lower natural gas price
environment, we believe that current activity levels across the country are not sustainable at these
prices and ultimately, market forces should move natural gas supply and demonstrate a more sustainable
balance in the future. 2020 could prove to be one of the most challenging natural gas markets in recent
history. However, we continue to believe our business model is uniquely positioned to navigate through
the market environment, giving our combination of low-cost assets and lower leverage position. Giving our
free cash flow outlook, and our strong balance sheet, we remain fully committed to continuing to return
capital to shareholders through a combination of dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, while also
planning to pay down our current debt at maturity later this year. While it's impossible to predict when
the prices may improve even at the current strip prices for '21 and '22, we expect to expand our free cash
flow yield and return on capital to levels that exceed the medium of the S&P 500.
And Gary, with that, I'm more than happy to answer questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

I have two questions, both on the inventory. But first, starting with the Lower Marcellus. This is, I guess,
more of a housekeeping question. When you talk about 9 years of inventory, is that on the 2018-2019 run
rate of just under 100 wells a year? Or is that on the go-forward '20 rate of more like 65%?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

It's an average of those two, Charles.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then a question on the Upper Marcellus. And I appreciate what you offered
in your release, in your prepared comments. But I was wondering if you could take a little bit of time and
characterize for us the relative maturity. Or how far how along you are on the path of optimization of your
completions there? And if we look back at your history, it's several years ago now, but you guys moved
the EUR per 1,000 feet of the Lower Marcellus up a number of times to arrive at the point where you are
now. And I'm just wondering how much more optimization, you think there might be left, whether -- you
mentioned lateral placement and completion optimization. But where -- obviously, no promises, but where
could you see that 2.9% going perhaps in the Upper Marcellus?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, just a first set of facts on the Upper Marcellus. One, as we've referenced, we've drilled only 50 wells
in the Upper Marcellus. Compared to 700 or so in the Lower Marcellus. And in the Lower Marcellus, we still
look at efforts and tests on where we're placing the lateral and how we tweak completions. With the Upper
Marcellus, we drilled some early-stage Upper Marcellus wells that are in that 50% cap. With those early-
stage completions, we were just gathering the data with the completion -- generation completions we had
at that particular time. As we have moved forward with trying to utilize what we've learned in the lower
and apply it to the upper, we continue to tweak the results we've seen in some of the upper wells. With
the -- what we've used in the lower and trying to determine whether or not it's applicable in the upper
rock.

The upper, as a point of reference, is anywhere from -- the thickness is anywhere from, say, 140 to
almost 300 feet in just the upper. So the lateral placement is going to be important in that thickness of ice
pack. We have looked at the laying wells in various different sections of that thick interval. One test we
referenced was to look at that deck of interval. And ask -- we asked the question, do we need to stagger
and put well in the higher part of the upper and the lower part of the upper and see if we can maximize
drainage, effectiveness of return and so forth by doing so.

Couple of the wells that we laid got a little bit too low in the Upper Marcellus, and those were not that
effective wells and we're not that good of wells because we -- in 2020 hindsight, laid the laterals a little bit
too low.

But that learning curve, Charles, to your point, is going to continue for an extended period of time. And
when you couple that with a new legislative process that the Pennsylvania legislator have approved in the
fourth quarter of 2019, it's allowing us to look at the development of the upper a little bit different than
we're looking at the -- and that we had to implement in the lower. In the lower -- and I'm little bit long-

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2020

winded here, but I'll maybe cover other questions that others might have by the answer. In the lower,
we had unit designation sizes that had us at certain lateral lengths. We could only go so far with the unit
designations with the certain lateral lengths in the lower. And therefore, our -- for example, this last year,
our average lateral length was over 8,000 feet in the lower, but nevertheless, we have drilled some where
we could that extended that laterally, gain of efficiencies, a little bit lower cost per foot and things like
that.

In the upper, it's our expectation that when you look at the entire upper section, a very thick section, like
I mentioned, there are only in 170,000 something acres, there's only 50 take points in that upper section.
So when you look at that area entirely in the upper, it's undeveloped section. When we're looking at what
we're trying to do now by gathering the information and trying to tweak landing laterals and all, it's going
to help us lay out our development plan and with the new PAA that the legislation approved up there. It's
going to allow us to lay out the upper in a way that will facilitate probably plus or minus over 40% longer
laterals than the laterals we drilled this year in the lower. So that 10,000, 12,000 foot lateral that we're
going to lay out in the upper is going to create its own efficiencies, more so than we realized in the lower.
And with that development layout, it is our anticipation that we're going to narrow the gap on the return
profile, on the delta between the EUR per well that we see in the upper as opposed to what we realized in
the lower.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Dan, I appreciate the long -- you call it long-winded, but I'll call it as a lot of useful details.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Charles.

Operator

The next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I wanted to start on the reserve report and just see if you could comment on the drivers of reserve
revisions? And any color that you can provide on the reserve adds and the impact that upper wells that
may have had? Or you could try to kind of isolate the year-on-year effect of drilling and adding lower well?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. I'll now make a kind of 5,000 foot comment, Brian, and I'll turn it to Steve Lindeman. But in the --
our reserve revisions this year, we had our learning curve in the proximal drilling with some of our wells
out there on the parent child, kind of in the latter part of '18, beginning of '19. And we have -- when we
saw the impacts of that drilling, and we lost some wells not temporarily lose some wells or knock some off
with some of the frac hits. We take that learning curve, and we see how we can mitigate it in the future,
and that affected some of our PDP revisions down by these frac hits. One of the things that we've been
able to do with our learning curve through this period of time, is look at the results of now proximinal
drilling in all our future guidance and our program is laid out, taking in consideration that it's all going
to be a proximal drilling to existing wells. And the mitigating factors that have helped improve now our
expectations versus our initial learning curve is looking at our completion designs. We have looked at the
reduction in our fluid levels that has helped considerably. We've also looked at the increase in clusters per
stages that has helped significantly on the offset effects. We are also, as I've mentioned, in the upper, but
in the lower also, we're looking at lateral placements to see the impact and benefits of lateral placements
where we're taking in proximal development. We have also been using retrievable bridge plugs that has
mitigated the impacts on offset wells. We've also tested perforation hole sizes to accommodate our fluid
levels of pumping and how we're laying out the cluster. So all of this has helped mitigate the impacts

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2020

going forward. We did experience through, to your point, about revisions, and particularly on the PDP side,
some revisions on some wells, which we took off -- reserves off on some of those PDP. But some of those
wells that we've taken reserve off, we really haven't gone back and then work over on, say, a handful of
those wells. So that's kind of a higher level, and I'll let Steve add to how you handle some of our reserve
bookings.

Steven W. Lindeman
Senior Vice President of EHS & Engineering

Okay. Brian, just to divide the revision into categories, we had 420 Bcf of positive revisions associated with
our PUDs. That's a combination of drilling longer laterals and increase in what our average booking would
be for PUDs per lateral length. And then we had a 350 Bcf negative revision associated with some of the
data that Dan's discussed, parent-child relationships, a lot of those occurred in wells that were stimulated
in 2018 that we didn't realize the effect or see the effect into '19.

But as Dan indicated, we've taken a number of remediation steps to improve and to mitigate some of this
parent-child relationship. And then there was roughly about 30 Bcf or 10% that was impacted negatively
to short-term line pressure gains in the field from turning offset pads on. And like Dan indicated, that
should come back in future bookings as the line pressure levels out.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Great. That's really helpful color. My follow-up is going back to the Upper Marcellus versus the Lower
Marcellus, you mentioned the Lower Marcellus has that 9 years in inventory. But based on some of
your comments earlier, is ultimately the lower and the upper going to be co-developed once you fully
delineate the Upper Marcellus? And how do you think about that playing out from a percentage-weighting
perspective as you guys contemplate a medium- or longer-term plan?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, I'll let Phil kind of answer, as he plans the future development. But I would say at this stage, with the
development we have right now on, say, the 700 or so lowers and where we're going back on a pad, one
of the things you have to keep in mind is when we go back into an area, the amount of volume of gas that
comes from a full-developed pad in the lower is -- and will maximize the -- that local area of gas going
into our header system, our gathering system. So the marketing group, Jeff, is always allocating, when
we're going to bring on a large pad, is always allocating away from that particular area.

As we've mentioned in the past, we have multiple options to move gas around. You'll allocate away from
that as we bring on those lower wells.

But the majority of the future, I think, is going to be developed from the lower and moving up with some
mixed in there -- uppers mixed in there to gather additional data points. But I believe that's how it's going
to be developed. Phil?

Phillip L. Stalnaker
Senior Vice President of Operations

Yes, that's correct, Dan. I mean the plan is, like Dan said, is the go-forward is primarily focused on the
lower and get it developed out. We will have some upper test again, continue to try to optimize our upper
as much as possible, but the plan is really to focus on the lower and then move up to the upper.

Operator

The next question is from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.

Jeffrey Leon Campbell
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2020

My first question is kind of more of a thought exercise, but I'll explain why I'm asking it. The question is
if the nat gas market continues to be volatile for years, is it possible to design a contingency program to
ramp activity up or down in response?

Or is the efficiency loss such that maintaining a steady state at whatever level is preferable? And I asked
this because listening to all the calls most -- every E&P says that their activity can respond to lower prices
with lower activity, but the same reticent to increase activity should there be increasing prices?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, let me answer it this way, Jeffrey, when Phil is, say, looking out ahead for our future programs, we
-- today, we need to get out and -- you two, Jeff and Phil can correct me on this, but we need to be out
ahead about 3 years, if you will, in order to coordinate the marketing side of our program to allow Williams
to have the appropriate lines to evaluate the amount of gas that we're going to be bringing, and I'm
talking about a growth program and building up. It's going to be delivering gas at certain areas, certain
compressor sites to be able to move the gas without having negative effects of higher line pressure and
knocking wells off. So they are way out ahead on designing these pad sites, along with Phil's guys trying
to do the logistics on the ground of roads, pad site construction, the permitting side, looking at, of course,
the equipment and personnel necessary.

So I would say the ramp-up, yes, it's a hell lot easier to cut off the first strings and head down. It is a
little bit more challenging to ramp up less and except if you had maybe stranded capital and you had, say,
a frac crew or two teed up, but you weren't going to pull the string on those until a year from now, but
you were paying some kind of rate to have them ready and available at that, just in the nick of time. But
ramping up is more difficult bottom line.

Jeffrey Leon Campbell
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

Yes. Well, no, that was a really thorough answer. I appreciate that. And just going back to the Upper
Marcellus, briefly. Just kind of a conceptual question here. Particularly with the longer laterals that you
talked about, the ability to drill longer ones. Is the expectation that the Upper Marcellus development
maybe particularly on existing pads, will eventually provide returns commensurate with the current Lower
Marcellus development?

And if not, why exhaust all the Lower Marcellus inventory first, rather than blending them and trying to
extend the inventory life of the Lower Marcellus in that way?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the well count that we have right now in the Lower Marcellus is -- it's prudent to develop the deeper
as opposed -- first prior to the upper, as you might suspect. Take our 2020 program, it's a maintenance
program. It's 60 to 70 wells. We have a mix of upper wells in that program. And the -- how many pads do
we have in our program for 2020? 14 or...

Steven W. Lindeman
Senior Vice President of EHS & Engineering

14, 15.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Plus or minus 14, 15 pads in our 2020 program. And going back to my comment about how we handle the
efficiency of development, bringing on the gas, providing the best opportunity for a rate of return, we try
to move things through fairly, rapidly. And the development of the lower is -- it's more efficient to develop
the deeper. I understand your concept, and as we get deeper -- again, we have, at this current drilling
rate, about 9 years remaining in the lower. That's a pretty darn good runway when you think about it. And

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 21, 2020

as we get further out in that 9 years, to your point, Jeffrey, we might develop ways of augmenting more
of the upper into the pads that we can -- that we utilize to drill the longer uppers and use that as a tool to
maybe fully develop a pad here or there in our program up all the zones as opposed to just the lower and
having to come back. That's entirely plausible in the future. Kind of right now, our program, certainly for
2020, is designed for more lowers than uppers.

Operator

The next question is from Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil.

Holly Meredith Barrett Stewart
Scotia Howard Weil, Research Division

Maybe first to Scott, can we just talk about some updated thoughts around returning capital to
shareholders, just balancing the buyback, the dividend as well as maybe holding some cash, given we're in
pretty unique commodity times?

Scott C. Schroeder
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, all of the above. Again, thanks for the question. We -- obviously, we remained very committed to
returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. The level -- how much is covered by the
dividend is going to be obviously a function of what the NYMEX strip is going forward. But we're looking
at it exactly like you said. The other thing I would add in there, which I thought you were going to ask,
is we have two small maturities in the next 2 years, and our plan is to use part of that free cash flow to
just pay that debt off, which would further reduce our leverage about another $250 million, which, in this
environment, makes a lot of sense. But we'll be opportunistic on buybacks when appropriate. But at the
same time, I'm not opposed with my bent and Dan's bent to cord a little cash if it makes sense because
who knows where the strip is going to end up going.

Holly Meredith Barrett Stewart
Scotia Howard Weil, Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. And then, Dan, maybe the -- you mentioned this legislative change in your response
to Charles question. Will it allow you to drill more longer laterals in the lower? I know you mentioned it in
reference to the upper. Will that help in terms of drilling more longers on the lower?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it will. And when you look at the lower development case right now where we have pads, where we
have wells, the opportunity, because we have laid it out by virtue of the confines, we had in the past
when we've laid out the lower that the opportunity to drill longer laterals in the lower is certainly not as
readily available to us as it will be in the upper with the limited development that's taken place so far in
the upper. But yes, every opportunity that Phil and his guys have a chance to drill a longer lower, we are
doing so. In fact, one of these pads, recently, we drilled what was the length of the long -- this last year
we drilled?

Scott C. Schroeder
Executive VP & CFO

We just had a total measured depth of 25,800 feet. So that was a record well for us that we just recently
have drilled.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. That's the exception because of what I just mentioned, but where we have the opportunity to do that,
we are making that effort.

Scotia Howard Weil, Research Division

Okay. Well, maybe just to follow-up on that. You mentioned sort of an 8000 foot average, I guess, for
2019, is it -- will it be much longer than that on the lowers in 2020?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

No, it will be -- let's see -- Matt, what will it be, Matt?

Matthew P. Kerin

Our term lines for 2020 are expected to average somewhere north of 8,500, I think.

The next question is from Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research.

Joshua Ian Silverstein
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just on the potential -- just to ask a couple of questions on the maintenance levels and CapEx. You
mentioned that you could cut CapEx further, depending on where prices are. How does that work if
you're currently at maintenance mode right now? Are you willing to go into decline? Do you just reset the
maintenance bar lower? And how much CapEx would you be willing to cut?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Our history in the past, Josh, as you might be aware -- particularly, and I think this was during the
'16 period when gas prices were extremely low, particularly in the shoulder months. We took a lot of gas
off the market. We curtailed over 0.5 Bcf a day, and we're just not going to deliver gas at a -- below our
return profile that we would expect and what we'd need to see to be sustainable. So on our maintenance
level and looking at rolling forward, we have in our plan for 2020, we started out with 3 rigs, and we
currently have 3 rigs at this point in time. One of the rigs that -- and we've guided that we're going to go
down to 2 rigs. One of the rigs has been on a large pad, and it's working its way off of that large pad, and
that'll be laid down some time in March.

But we're looking at all of our contracts or service contracts that would provide the coverage that our
service providers need. But also provide us the flexibility that we need to amend our plan if, in fact, the
macro environment dictates, and we would absolutely do that if need be.

Joshua Ian Silverstein
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. And then just given the price decline that we've had recently, has this changed your corporate
strategy at all about staying a single basin, single asset focused company? Or would you want to add
some other exposure? Or conversely, what the basin feeling pain right now, is there opportunity for you
guys to add some slowing volume in inventory right around where you are?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, two-part question. I'll answer the second -- the first. We have always had strategic in boardroom
discussions on how we maximize shareholder value. That will continue. We just had our Board meeting
this week. We had thorough discussions about the questions that you asked, how do we enhance

shareholder value. In all -- every meeting we've discussed the market, the M&A, the activities that are
going on in the macro space, the expectation of commodity pricing in the future, both oil versus gas. We
look at the oil guys and how they're dealing with the issues that they deal with. We look at the gas guys
as on how they're dealing with their programs. And in the Northeast, we look at the -- the area around us
is having some very, very good wells.

Chesapeake has drilled some really good wells beside us. And if we could drill those wells, we would and
we do also. But to have an M&A transaction, it's just cumbersome. It's difficult up there. They're -- where
our area up there is about 100% operated. And the areas that are west of us, they're not 100% operated.
There's multiple partners that are in those wells. And that creates its own uniqueness to what you might
do if you had those assets or if you're the operator of those assets in the southwest part of the state. You
have a lot of production going on in the southwest part of the state. But the balance sheets on some of
those companies are admittedly stressed at this point in time. And they have maturities coming up that
they're trying to deal with through their programs and having that type of M&A conversation and all just is
extremely difficult.

When you look at a dual commodity split that there's circumstances that it would make sense. But you
also have to understand the area that you might go into, the capital allocation you'd have in the future,
the either accretion or dilution that you might have on that capital allocation. And quite frankly, the --
when you look at the strip price for oil right now and you look at the strip price for natural gas right now,
Cabot delivers a very, very good return profile compared to all the wells that are being drilled out there
and all the programs that are being drilled out there.

So do I think, at times, it would have a benefit? Absolutely, it would, if we had 2 environments to work in
and operate in and also 2 commodities to dial levers in also. But trying to make that come together to get
all the stars line up all at one time, it's a difficult proposition. That's why it's not done every day.

The next question is from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.

Michael Anthony Hall
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

I guess I was just curious, kind of more broadly on the 2020 program, if there's any particularly
substantial changes in just the character of the program as it relates to how it compared to the 2019
program, be it completion design, access to surface infrastructure location in the field?

Any other variables note that would maybe make the program a little different.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And I'm going to let either Matt or Phil kind of get their thoughts together on it. But when you look at
our program and if you're comparing '19 to '20, if you look at our program, by design, our '19 program as
a result of late innings, drilling in '18, we had to answer some of the questions, which I've already talked
about, about how we implement technique changes on completions, drilling laterals, things like that to
mitigate a proximal drilling. So our '19 program was designed to answer some of those questions, and we
had our learning curve and that showed up in some of our numbers. We've mitigated the numbers that
we presented in '19, even though a record year for Cabot. We've mitigated some of the concerns about
proximal drilling by what we did. But when you look at our differences in the 60 or 70 wells, we had 25
wells that we designed specifically for the upper to try to get ahead of our program and learn about how
we now -- because we had the daylight that the PA legislation created by the PAA decision and now the
longer laterals and then working into the opportunity that Josh asked, a while ago, how we can maybe
develop the upper in concert with lower. We had a lot of wells, and we were gathering a lot of data in the
upper purposely for that program. In 2020 compared to '19, we only have 5 wells designed for the upper.

And the placement of some of our wells in our field are also going to be slightly different because in the
queue of things when we have pads ready and then they jump all over the field, 2020 program is going to

have a less uppers and the locations of the well of the pads that we're going to drill in the 2020 is going to
be slightly enhanced in the geographic area that we'll drill compared to '19. So we do anticipate 2020 and
a lot of areas is going to be an enhanced program to '19.

Michael Anthony Hall
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

That's helpful color. I appreciate it. And just to be clear, the 25 in the upper, were those all in '19? Or were
some of that in '18 and just kind of the productions tailed into?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Drilling, for the most part, started in '18, and then it's both '18 and '19, almost 25.

Michael Anthony Hall
Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC

Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just kind of housekeeping on just the timing of completions.
Obviously, you talked about the sequential decline here in the first half. What are the kind of turn-in-line
counts look like as we start the year here? Any color you can provide there?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. In the first quarter, we anticipate turning in approximately 13% of our total years -- total well count
in first quarter. And in the second quarter, we're -- we'll have an incremental 35-or-so percent turned in at
various months of the fourth quarter, April, May, June. And then as we referenced -- and that's the reason
why we're forecasting our reduction in first quarter, second quarter. And then as those wells that we bring
in, in the second quarter, majority impact is going to start in the third quarter. We'll bring on another 30-
something percent in the third quarter, and then the fourth quarter, we're kind of scheduled for about 15%
or so of our turn-in-line wells.

The next question is from Kashy Harrison with Simmons Energy.

Kashy Oladipo Harrison
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

So just a quick follow-up to the earlier discussions on well performance. So as you think about the 2020
program, should we expect the longer-term well performance to be maybe more similar to 2016, 2017
levels on a lateral adjusted basis?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

It depends on where the wells are going to be located. If -- for example, if you -- and keep in mind,
we have forecast our program to take into account the proximal development, which you can look at
development as being drilling a well that is unbounded or bounded by wells offsetting you. And our 2020
program is going to have more wells that have the offsets than our 2016 program.

So on average, you will see a -- say, 2016 to 2020, you'll see about just an EUR basis, an assignment of
maybe 10% to 12% less in 2020 than we might have had in 2016 in the lower.

Kashy Oladipo Harrison
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then as my -- my second question, Dan, as you think about just the
various forces at work in the natural gas market, once you move beyond 2020, how do you think about
the appropriate medium-term gas growth rate in Appalachia and Haynesville necessary to meet incoming

demand? Do you think operators need to be growing by 1%, 2%, 3% just to make sure that the market
doesn't get out of whack so that we don't repeat a 2020 5 years from now?

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

I scratch my head often, and we have discussions in our boardroom often about the macro environment,
the supply-demand dynamics, both in oil and gas. Everybody has their -- an opinion and everybody looks
at what's going on in the market and the reasons for it. Everybody has the reasons why they might grow
any into a market that we live in today and looking at the realizations that are out there today. And I think
the financial numbers by the majority would dictate that if you had a vision that the current strip is going
to be what it will be perpetually into the future, to your point, about 5 years, 6 years from now, I don't
know why anybody would be drilling wells into -- as a growth measure into this market. I think it is a
difficult to -- for me to sit in every chair out there and the reasons behind it. I do know there's reasons
that are attached to debt positions and balance sheet concerns. I know there's reasons why maybe firm
transportation arrangements might be dictating how you allocate capital. There has been midstream
negotiations and separations, upstream from midstream. There's been changes in volume -- minimum
volume and commitments and different things that are affecting decisions out there. We look at it as how
we can manage the shareholder value in a way that is going to yield a return.

We've been able to point to the fact that at a $2 NYMEX, we still generate free cash flow, we'll generate an
earnings profile and so -- and even us, and there's nobody else that can make that statement. We are at
a maintenance level of capital because we don't think it is prudent to drill up all your core inventory and
push it out at a losing proposition. We don't think it's prudent to drill even at a marginal return profile and
use it all up in this particular environment.

So we're going to keep our balance sheet strong. We're going to manage our dividend. As Scott
has mentioned, we're going to manage our debt towers as we have to and will also reduce further
maintenance capital and reduce as opposed to have the growth out there in what we see in the current
environment and the foreseeable future.

So I have a hard time rationalizing why industry is growing into a market today.

Kashy Oladipo Harrison
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And hopefully, some of the -- we start to see some of these rigs come off on a
weekly basis.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan
Dinges for any closing remarks.

Dan O. Dinges
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Gary. Good questions, great questions. I know our '19 had had some noise. In our '19, we're
confident about our program. And I hope this has answered all the questions that -- I know that Matt has
been fielding all the way into the early mornings. But again, our macro outlook for gas is cautious at this
point in time. I do think, just like the last question-and-answer demonstrated, rationalization is going to
have to prevail in this market that's not sustainable, and the balance sheets are not sustainable out there
trying to push this market and grow into this market.

And we think we are the best position in our space to navigate. We're going to be the last man standing,
and we're going to take advantage of our position, maintain our balance sheet, serve our shareholders,
hopefully in a way that the long-term shareholders would appreciate and be good stewards of our capital.

So thanks, again, for your patience, for our 2019. I hope you all are looking forward to 2020.
