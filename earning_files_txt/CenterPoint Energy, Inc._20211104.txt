CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to CenterPoint Energy's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call with
Senior Management.

[Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Philip Holder, Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Investor
Relations.

Philip Holder
Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning & Investor Relations

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to CenterPoint's earnings conference call. David Lesar, our CEO;
Jason Wells, our CFO, will discuss the company's third quarter 2021 results. Management will discuss
certain topics that will contain projections and other forward-looking information and statements that are
based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These
forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially
based upon various factors as noted in our Form 10-Q on their SEC filings and our earnings materials. We
undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement.

We will also discuss non-GAAP EPS, referred to as utility EPS, earnings guidance and our utility earnings
growth target. In providing these financial performance metrics and guidance, we use a non-GAAP
measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share. For information on our guidance methodology and a
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in providing guidance, please refer to our earnings news release
and presentation, both of which can be found under the Investors section on our website.

As a reminder, we may use our website to announce material information. This call is being recorded.
Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. Now I'd like to turn the discussion
over to Dave.

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Philip. Good morning, and thank you to everyone joining us for our third quarter 2021
earnings call. Because we recently hosted our Analyst Day, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today.
As you know, we laid out our first ever 10-year plan back at our Analyst Day. We expressed that and
are reiterating today that we are a management team who can execute. We believe we will continue to
demonstrate that for you.

This marks my sixth quarter with CenterPoint and Jason's fifth. I'd like to first start by laying out how we
are building a consistent track record of delivery. First, if you recall, the CenterPoint value proposition
we laid out at our recent Analyst Day focused on our efforts to achieve sustainable earnings growth for
our shareholders, sustainable, resilient and affordable rates for our customers and a sustainable positive
impact on the environment for our communities. I believe we are continuing down the path of achieving
this value proposition.

Each quarter under the new CenterPoint leadership, we have met or exceeded quarterly utility EPS and
dividend expectations. We have increased our annual utility EPS guidance for both 2020 and 2021. And as
I will discuss shortly, today, we are increasing our 2021 utility EPS guidance once again.

Our 2021 through 2024 annual utility EPS growth rates of 8% are top decile among our peers, and we
also expect to achieve at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% utility EPS guidance range each year from
2025 to 2030. I am confident in our team's ability to achieve that growth.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Last year, we had a [ $13 ] billion 5-year capital plan. We increased that to [ $16 ] billion in our 2020
Analyst Day. In this year, we increased it yet again to $18 billion plus. We introduced our first ever 10-
year capital plan. CenterPoint remains ripe with opportunities across our footprint to expand and harden
our system to benefit customers and shareholders. Our current 10-year plan contains no external equity
issuances. We will fund the equity portion of our capital needs to internally generated operating cash flows
and our already announced strategic transactions.

We are also executing on our plan to become a pure-play regulated utility as we approach the closing
of the Enable ET merger expected by the end of this year and then our subsequent sell-down of our
midstream stake. With the recent settlement agreement among the parties in Arkansas, we are also
moving toward the completion of our LDC asset sale. The remaining steps include the Oklahoma approval,
which is anticipated to be received in November and the all-party settlement in Arkansas is expected to be
approved by mid-December.

And with our newest announcement around our industry-leading ESG targets, we are on the path to
executing our goals to be net 0 on direct emissions by 2035. We continue to believe that this is an
achievable path delivering for customers, regulators, investors and the environment.

In the third quarter of 2020, I said that I will not be satisfied until we are recognized as a premium utility.
In the theme of our Analyst Day was again establishing a path toward a premium. I believe we are making
tremendous strides down that path.

Before I get into the headlines for this quarter, I want to thank all of the crews for their hard work to
restore power after hurricane Nicholas down here in the Texas Gulf Coast. The storm headwinds of up to
90 miles an hour, leaving 470,000 of our Houston Electric customers without power. Within 3 days, we had
95% of the power restored for those customers. And within 5 days, the whole system was back online.

Now for this quarter's headlines. Our year-to-date financial progress has been strong. We are reporting
a utility EPS beat and are raising our full year outlook this quarter. For the third time this year, we are
increasing our 2021 utility EPS guidance this time to $1.26 to $1.28 for the full year. And for the first 9
months, we've already achieved nearly 80% of that full year goal. More importantly, we are still targeting
an 8% annual growth rate for 2022 to 2024. So this raises our guidance for 2022 utility EPS to $1.36 to
$1.38. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported $0.25 of utility EPS, which compares to $0.29 in the
third quarter of 2020.

In the third quarter of this year, we had a onetime impact to earnings of $0.04 per share related to our
most recent Board implemented governance changes. Jason will get into more detail on the variances
shortly.

Capital investments. As I mentioned earlier, we have increased our 5-year capital plans to $18 billion plus
over the next 5 years and $40 billion plus over the next 10 years. This is nearly a 40% increase in our 5-
year capital investment plan since the third quarter of 2020. This includes new opportunities that stem
from the latest legislative session in Texas. One of those opportunities was the ability to lease and put into
rate base mobile generation units. We move quickly on this opportunity and procured [indiscernible] 5-
megawatt and [ 3 30-megawatt ] mobile generation units, some of which we were able to deploy during
Hurricane Nicholas as backup while crews worked to repair our system.

And recently, during an ERCOT forecasted Texas [ wide load-shedding event ], the Texas PUC
[indiscernible] to make sure our units were ready to support customers. We were the first the utility in
the state to act on this legislative opportunity and had them in place to utilize them in the way the law
intended. We look forward to mobilize quickly on the other tools provided to us by the Texas legislature to
improve the resiliency of the electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages. We already have
an outstanding RFP for additional mobile generation, which could bring our total up to 500 megawatts and
hope to have this procured in the coming months. We believe that with the deployment of these additional
tools, we will be able to mitigate some of the impacts of future extreme weather events on our customers.

Due to recent weather events in both Louisiana and Texas, we are running slightly behind on our capital
spending plans on a year-to-date basis. These weather events pulled away many of our contract crews,

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

so they could provide mutual assistance to our fellow utilities, especially in Louisiana. Therefore, while
deployed elsewhere, they cannot work on our capital projects, but we have a catch-up plan in place and
anticipate making the short fall of.

In anticipation of continued labor shortages and as we ramp up our capital plans in the coming years,
we have now moved to procure additional contractor resources from multiple suppliers. We believe that
this will help to support continuity and crews on a long-term basis and reduce the impact of any labor
disruptions in executing our $40 billion-plus capital spend over the next 10 years.

O&M. Turning to O&M. We remain committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts
and our target of 1% to 2% average annual reductions. We've already realized the benefit of some of
these improvements this year. We stated in the second quarter that we could accelerate approximately
$20 million of recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into this year if we had the available resources.

So far, we've achieved approximately 20% of this goal year-to-date and remain confident around our
team's ability to continue to execute towards this goal for the balance of the year. This allows us the
luxury of reducing near-term run rate O&M costs which helps to mitigate rate pressures while maintaining
continued focus on reliability and safety of our service for customers, all while sustaining growth for our
shareholders.

Organic growth. In addition to O&M continuous improvement efforts, we are fortunate to operate in
growing jurisdictions. This combination plays a key role in keeping our growth plans affordable for our
customers. As we discussed during our Analyst Day, Houston is the fourth largest city in the U.S. and the
only 1 of those 4 that's growing. Houston's organic growth has been multi-decades long. That organic
growth rate continued for yet another quarter. We are also seeing strong growth in many of our other
jurisdictions as well. On a year-over-year basis, we saw about 2% customer growth for electric and 1%
for natural gas through September. Again, this organic growth is the luxury, most other utilities just do not
have.

Now let me shift gears and give a brief regulatory update. A recent highlight in Indiana happened just this
past week. As part of our long-term electric generation transition plan, we received the CPCN approval
from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the first tranche of solar generation, 75% of which we
expect to own and 25% due a PPA.

This approval shows the commission's alignment and support of our 2020 IRP, which bridges our coal
generation into a mix of lower carbon and renewable sources. We anticipate the CPCN decisions for our
Gas CT plant in the second or third quarter of 2022 and the incremental solar PPA in the third quarter of
2022. As outlined in our IRP, we are targeting to own approximately 50% of our total solar generation
portfolio. Our continued build-out of renewables is a key driver in achieving our net zero direct emissions
goal by 2035.

Shifting to gas cost recovery from the February winter storm. We continue to make progress. And as we
previously mentioned, we have mechanisms in place or have begun recovery in all jurisdictions. We are
happy to report that just this past week, we reached a settlement on the prudence proceedings supporting
securitization of 100% of gas costs in Texas, including all of related carrying costs. We look forward to the
commission approval of the agreement. We anticipate a financing order for the securitization bonds by the
end of the year. With this time line, we anticipate receiving the proceeds sometime mid next year.

In Minnesota, we started a recovery as of December and are working with stakeholders on ways to reduce
the impact on our customers. We filed a rate case earlier this week, and also proposed an alternative rate
stabilization plan to address the unique set of circumstances customers are experiencing. The full rate
case requests $67.1 million per year, while the rate stabilization plan requests $39.7 million per year and
an extended recovery period for winter storm costs. The proposed rate stabilization plan would resolve the
rate case and limit the bill impact on customers, in part by recovering the winter storm costs over a 63-
month period. We're asking the PUC to review and approve the stabilization plan by the end of this year,
which would allow rates to take effect on January 1. To summarize, we are working with stakeholders to
align our focus on safety and related investments while minimizing the burden to our customers.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Largely as a result of mechanisms in our Houston Electric in Indiana South gas jurisdictions, we have
recently received approval for $40 million of increased incremental annual revenue. As discussed in our
Analyst Day, we anticipate approximately 80% of our 10-year capital plans to be recovered through
interim mechanisms, which demonstrates the constructive jurisdictions in which we operate.

In Texas, our PUC is now appointed a fourth commissioner. Jason and I have now had the opportunity
to meet all 4 commissioners and are very encouraged by the dialogue and expertise that all of these
commissioners bring to the PUC. We look forward to continued engagement with the commissions in all of
our jurisdictions.

So those are the headlines for the quarter. I remain excited about what's to come for CenterPoint. We
have a growing track of execution and believe it more than demonstrates what we can do in the near
future and the unique value proposition that CenterPoint offers to you.

With that, let me turn the call over to Jason.

Jason P. Wells
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave, and thank you to all of you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call.
This marks my 1 year of earnings calls with CenterPoint and the story keeps getting better.

To reemphasize Dave's message, we are focused on establishing a track record of consistent execution,
and I fully believe the best is yet to come here at CenterPoint. I'll start this morning with the earnings for
the third quarter of 2021.

On a GAAP EPS basis, we reported $0.32 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 for the third
quarter of 2020.

Looking at Slide 5, we reported $0.33 of non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.34
for the third quarter of 2020. Our utility EPS was $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, while midstream
investments contributed another $0.08. Favorable growth in rate recovery, lower interest expense and
reversal of the net impacts from COVID last year, each contributed $0.01 of favorability. These amounts
were offset by $0.04 related to our onetime Board implemented governance changes recorded this quarter
and another $0.03 of unfavorable variance attributable to weather and usage.

For context, we experienced 73 [ fewer ] cooling degree day in Houston for the third quarter of 2021
compared to the third quarter of 2020. We estimate that each cooling degree day above normal has
approximately a $70,000 a day impact in our Houston Electric business.

Turning to Slide 6. For the first 9 months, we've achieved nearly 80% of our full year 2021 utility EPS
guidance, which we are now raising to $1.26 to $1.28. And as Dave said, we are also raising our utility
EPS guidance for 2022 to $1.36 to $1.38, which is an 8% increase from our new 2021 estimates.

Looking beyond that, we are focused on delivering 8% annual utility EPS growth through 2024 and at the
mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% annual utility EPS range over the remainder of our 10-year plan, strong
growth each year and every year, no CAGRs for earnings.

The last thing I'll mention for this quarter is the share count. Our preferred Series [ B ] shares converted
into 36 million common shares as of September 1, further reducing the number of share classes
outstanding. We expect the conversion will have no impact on earnings as the increase in shares is
effectively offset by the termination of our Series B dividends. Going forward, I want to reiterate we have
no external equity included in our current [indiscernible] and only expect our share count to modestly
increase from dividend reinvestment or incentive plans.

Now I want to offer some color on the capital plans supporting our rate base and utility EPS growth. We've
spent approximately $2.3 billion year-to-date on capital investments. As Dave mentioned, we had some
slight delays due to recent weather events and are focused on making that up over the coming months.
We outlined on our Analyst Day the 3 buckets that we are investing in, safety, reliability and growth and
enabling clean investments that are included in our $40 billion plus 10-year capital investment plan.

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

This investment profile should benefit our shareholders, our customers and the environment. We see those
opportunities weighted nearly 60% towards investments in our electric business throughout the plan.
While we are slightly behind the capital plan on a year-to-date basis, we are in the midst of ramping up to
a sustained increase in our capital investments and we are restructuring contract crews in a way that helps
support our labor needs to execute this level of investment. We are confident we will make up the shortfall
by early 2022.

Moving to the financing updates. Our current liquidity remains strong at $1.8 billion, including available
borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Our long-term FFO to debt
objective remains between 14% and 15%, aligning with Moody's methodology and is consistent with the
expectations of the rating agencies. As mentioned during the Analyst Day, it's our intention to stay within
this range throughout the course of our long-term plan.

Lastly, as we near the end of the calendar year, we are getting incrementally closer to the expected closing
of the strategic transactions we've announced. We recently filed a settlement in Arkansas that represents
an agreement amongst all parties. We anticipate that Arkansas Commission will issue its final approval by
mid-December. In Oklahoma, a hearing was held on November 3, and we expect a final order soon.

Finally, as Energy Transfer expressed on their earnings call earlier this week, the Enable and Energy
Transfer merger is also expected to close before year-end. Once that transaction closes, we will remain
absolutely focused on reducing and then eliminating our exposure to midstream through a disciplined
approach. As said on our Analyst Day, we anticipate being fully exited from the midstream sector by the
end of 2022. We will then be nearly a pure-play regulated utility.

As we continue to express, we take our commitment to be good stewards of your investment very
seriously and realize our obligation to optimize stakeholder value. And with that, we look forward to more
of these shorter earnings calls in the future. I'll turn the call back over to Dave.

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Jason. As you heard from us today, and others from our full management team during the
Analyst Day, the outlook for CenterPoint just keeps getting better. As I said, we now have 6 quarters of
meeting or exceeding expectations, but we believe there is much more to come. We are demonstrating the
pathway to premium, and we hope that you will be on board with us as a shareholder when that happens.

Philip Holder
Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning & Investor Relations
Thank you, Dave. We will now take a few questions being mindful of today's earnings schedule and the
upcoming EEI conference.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]Our first question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Hopefully, I contribute to the short earnings call, but just I think of the company maybe over the last year,
it was maybe more of a transition story and we got, I guess, 3 increases in guidance throughout the year,
including today. I mean, how do we think about going forward? Are we more now on steady state and the
guidance you gave is probably more set and we look to be in the middle of it? Or do we continue to get
maybe increases in guidance? And I have one follow-up.

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, look, I hope you got a sense today of how confident we are in the business -- the direction that
the business is going at this point in time. And I think that we're starting to hit on all cylinders. So I agree,
we were in a transition, but I think in a transition to what we believe ought to be a premium utility. So I
think if you listen to what we said today, and let me boil it down into pretty simple terms, whatever we do
this year, we'll do 8% more than next year, whatever we do next year, we'll do 8% more of the year after
that and et cetera, as we outlined during our Analyst Day. But we've got a lot of tailwinds behind us right
now, and we really, really like where we are.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. And just one follow-up. Dave, at the Analyst Day, you gave us some great insight into, I guess,
just commodity prices maybe from a previous job you held. Just thoughts on, are you seeing any type of
change in your view that you think maybe the commodity prices will end up coming down?

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

No. I think -- I assume you're referring to natural gas prices.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes.

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

And I think that if you look at the strip, it is starting to drift down. But I think more importantly, it's really
-- the focus -- if you look at gas prices on our business, specifically, we've got organic growth to sort of
absorb issues. We've got our ability on O&M. So if your question really is do we see an impact on sort of
customer rates. Certainly, it's going to be out there, but I think we've got some offsets that maybe other
utilities don't have. Jason, if anything you want to add to that?

Jason P. Wells
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Dave. Thanks for the question, Anthony. As we outlined at Analyst Day, we continue to work
within our defined gas procurement plans for each jurisdiction. And as of today, looking across all of our
jurisdictions, we're roughly 60% hedged now that we're going into the upcoming winter season. And
for almost all of those jurisdictions, we locked in kind of a weighted average cost of gas, so somewhere

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

between sort of the mid-$3s and high $3, [ $3 ] per MMBtu in the majority of our jurisdictions. And so feel
well positioned for this upcoming winter season.

Obviously, we continue to look at what we can do across the business to ease the burden on our
customers. And I think one example of that was the creative -- alternative rate stabilization plan that we
just recently filed in Minnesota. So we'll continue to look for ways to minimize the bill impact, but feel like
we're well prepared coming into this upcoming winter season.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. I'll see you guys EEI. And Dave, sorry about the [indiscernible] .

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, better luck next year, right?

Operator

Our next question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just on -- with the current CapEx plan, you're obviously more levered to electric side of the business and
the IRP in Indiana presents some additional upside beyond the 5 years for electric investment. Dave,
do you have sort of a target mix for electric versus gas contribution? What's the time line to achieve it,
especially as we're thinking about potentially further gas optimization funding, which seems to be a very
sizable electric decarbonization plan?

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think that if you sort of step back and take a look at 50,000 -- the sort of 50,000 foot level, the
spend and direction and strategy of the company is to bias us towards the electric side of our business.
Part of it is the coal transition certainly helps that because of the capital that it is going to absorb. And as
we've said at our Analyst Day and we've said it in some of our prior calls, we don't need equity to execute
this 10-year plan. But if other opportunities did come up, we know the inherent value of the remaining gas
LDCs.

And you could look to them as a source of liquidity. But I think bottom line is we're biased toward electric,
and that is the way we will continue to drift. I'm not going to put a prediction out there as to what that
ratio will be over time. But directionally, that's where we're headed.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just lastly, obviously, a little bit behind on the CapEx that you highlighted in the prepared
remarks, but still kind of targeting that $18 billion plus. Just, I guess, what are some of the governing
factors to increasing the upside or bringing that $1 billion into the base plan that we discussed during the
Analyst Day?

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think it's a couple of things. One is just getting sort of final resolution and clarity around the new
tools in the toolbox with respect to the Texas legislative process. We highlighted today, the temporary
generation. For instance, we've moved very, very quickly on. Those kinds of things would absorb some of
that additional $1 billion in sort of contingent capital that we laid out on our Analyst Day.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

And the other -- just the other issue is going to be just finding sufficient crews and labor and parts and
inventory and those kinds of things out there to accelerate it. So I think the message we tried to leave
at Analyst Day is we have $18 billion plus to spend in the next 5 years, $40 billion plus to spend in the
next 10 years. And we will spend that capital as fast as we can reasonably do so as long as it's consistent
with sort of rate pressures that we will have and to spend it efficiently. So again, we've got the wind at our
back on many, many things, and our capital spend opportunities is certainly one of those.

Operator

Our next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just first question going back to Shahriar's question on the CapEx and the potential -- or I guess the delay
currently. I understand the reasoning for the year-to-date delay and how you're going to make that up.
Just when you look out currently at the current environment, structurally, are you seeing any concerns or
challenges to get the current CapEx plan executed over the next couple of years, whether it is the labor
shortages or just from a -- maybe from a cost standpoint, labor costs or other items that could potentially
be a headwind?

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

And look, I mean, just like pretty much every other company and management team in the U.S., we're
dealing with supply chain issues, upward pressure on labor costs. But I don't think that we have seen it
to such an extent that we're going to say that we can't meet the capital plan. We have every intention,
and we have every confidence we're going to meet the capital plan. We tried to give a little color with
respect to that on the call today. We have moved aggressively to tie up more construction crews. We have
expanded our vendor base in and around that area. One of the tools that we got in the new legislative
process is the ability to put long lead time items into inventory and into rate base. So we're looking at all
of those.

I think the sort of small slip in capital spend this year really was unrelated to any of that. It really was
related to the storms that really pounded into Louisiana. And as all utilities do, we help each other when
those sort of situations arise. And we released a number of our crews that were focused on capital build
for us to help the people in Louisiana get back on their feet. Those crews are now coming back. And as
Jason said, we've got a short-term plan in place to catch up on that capital spend, but our longer-term
view of tying up crews and making sure we have the long lead time items ordered give us a great deal of
confidence that the capital plan we have is and it's going to be achievable.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Understood. And just quickly, the other question I had was, as we think about the closing of the
midstream transaction. Remind me, is there -- I know you've already priced a contingent sale of a portion
of it, but is there a limit on how much you can sell in terms of the units at any given time?

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

I'll let my very good CFO, Jason, answer that question.

Jason P. Wells
Executive VP & CFO

Insoo, thanks for the question. No, there's no direct limit. We had talked about previously the need to
register those units. Energy Transfer has already undertaken that effort. So we execute a contingent
forward up until the close as we have done. Once the deal is closed, to the extent that we want to execute
a marketed offering, we have to obviously coordinate with Energy Transfer. We have full flexibility to do

that after the close of the transaction. And then similarly, we'll have the ability to dribble the share. So I
think we're moving to a place of full control, no limitation on the number of units.

Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Sorry about the [indiscernible] there. I wanted at -- my condolences as well here.

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

I tell you, I didn't think this would turn into a [indiscernible], but I appreciate the condolence. There's
always a nice you remember that.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

We know they're close to your heart. There you go. Indeed. Listen, just wondering what's driving the
confidence still on the timeline for the ET deal here? Just -- I know you mentioned it here again. You
mentioned at the Analyst Day, but -- and maybe remind us where that process stands specifically with
respect to FTC. Obviously, they continue to put out their own headlines?

Jason P. Wells
Executive VP & CFO

Julien, it's Jason here. Look, as we said at Analyst Day, Energy Transfer enabled obviously taking the lead
with this and the conversations with the FTC. We're clearly a very interested party and everything that
we've observed just gives us confidence that this deal will get closed here in the fourth quarter. So I don't
think -- it's probably more of a direct question for Energy Transfer for how those conversations are going
by the day. But as I said, as we observe the progress, we continue to remain confident of a close here in
Q4.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. All right. Fair enough. And then on this alternate stabilization plan, can you talk a little bit more
about the mechanics? Obviously, it's early here, but has there been any feedback so far on the proposal?
Obviously, these are somewhat sensitive subjects. So I'll let you respond accordingly.

Jason P. Wells
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Julien. It's a really unique situation, obviously, in Minnesota with the incremental gas costs
[indiscernible] the fact that we've got a regular rate case schedule there. And so while we filed a typical
rate case, we thought it was prudent to bring forward, but we've deemed a rate stabilization plan. And I
think we -- what it tries to do is build off of what was just a recent settlement of the [indiscernible].

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

So just super quick there. I heard you guys comment on the back of [ gen in Texas ]. But any updates on
for instance, Texas transmission? Obviously, the PUCT seems to be moving fairly swiftly still here. Curious
if there's anything to be said on that front as a function of reforms?

Yes. I think maybe just to tease you a little bit. Yes, we're having some dialogue with them on additional
transmission lines, but it's really too early to talk about any specifics on it.

Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So just one for me. Just on the Indiana solar program, David, in your commentary, you mentioned 75-25
mix, 75 rate base, 25 PPA. Is that sort of what you're targeting going forward in your plans? And just
curious as to how you got there in terms of the 75-25 mix?

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

I'll let Jason can answer that.

Jason P. Wells
Executive VP & CFO

Durgesh, it's -- overall, as we look at this first sort of part of our coal transition plan, we're targeting a
50-50 allocation that is 50% owned renewables, 50% contracted through PPAs, the renewable portion for
the first tranche of the coal transition. We had filed originally, as you pointed out and as Dave mentioned
in his prepared remarks, an initial tranche of solar that was 75% owned, 25% PPA. We then subsequently
filed in the third quarter this year for 100% PPA solar projects. And so again, as you look through kind of
each of these individual filings, we're targeting a [ 50%-50% ] owned contract target mix for renewables.

Our last question is from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just had one kind of a broad question, just on draft federal legislation. And as you look at that, I know
that's subject to change and who knows what the final version will look like. But I was thinking in
particular about, I guess, 2 elements. One would be a tax policy and impacts in terms of cash flow,
customer bills, et cetera. And then the other was just broad support for clean energy, whether that might
change or enhance some of your resource plans and movement towards clean energy or accelerate some
of your plans. So just curious what you're thinking there?

David John Lesar
President, CEO & Director

I mean, I'll -- let me take the first crack at it, and I'll have Jason can talk about the potential tax impact.
But you're absolutely right. It's definitely a moving target right now and haven't been through many of
these sorts of efforts that wind their way through Washington. I learned a long time ago. You really -- you
got to just sort of watch the process happen, but you don't want to do anything sort of concrete until it is
set in law and then you can react to it.

I think directionally, from if you look at sort of the renewables and the ESG aspects of it, it's certainly
supportive of the direction that we're going. But based on what we see right now, I don't see it
accelerating or decelerating anything that we've got on plans. We have, as you know, sort of an industry-
leading goal out there of net direct emissions to 0 by 2035. And I think that's a good plan. We're going to
stick with it. That's the direction we're headed. If we get some incremental help with what comes out of
D.C., we'll take advantage of it. But it isn't going to bump us off course from the direction we're headed
right now. Jason, do you want to talk about the tax aspect?

CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Stephen. From a tax standpoint, we are a federal cash taxpayer.
Right now as you kind of cut through sort of our financials, there's a lot of sort of onetime items as we've
executed on this transition to a pure play regulated utility and we'll continue to see that. As you kind
of cut through that, for us, we are -- our effective tax rate from a cash tax standpoint is somewhere
between 8% to 10%. So clearly, a minimum tax of 15% would put a little bit of an impact or headwind
on the financing plan. We don't think it's certainly something that we can overcome. We don't think it's
an impediment to the CapEx plan that we outlined and still feel like we can continue to maintain a strong
balance sheet as we outlined and deliver on our $40 billion capital investment plan.

So early days, we'll follow it, probably not as big an impact to us as maybe some of our peers just given
the fact that we have been federal cash taxpayer, but obviously something we'll continue to monitor.

Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning & Investor Relations
