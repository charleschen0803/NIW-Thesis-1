Thanks, Todd. Good morning. I'm very pleased to speak with you today about the conclusion of another
extraordinary year for Charles River, our expectations for 2021 and the expansion of our early-stage
research and manufacturing support portfolio into a complementary high-growth sector.

2020 was an unprecedented year. COVID-19 pandemic challenged us in many ways. But to date, we've
navigated it successfully and reinforced our position as the leading nonclinical CRO. Our success in 2020
was due to the resilience of our business model, a comprehensive business continuity plan that enabled
us to keep our worldwide operating sites open and adequately staffed. Our broad scientific capabilities and
flexible outsourcing solutions that support our clients' needs and our employees around the world who met
client needs through their commitment and dedication.

As a result, we have now become even more integral to our value clients and more differentiated from the
competition. Despite the short-term impact of COVID-related client disruptions, we benefited from robust
underlying client demand across most of our businesses. This was largely driven by clients' intensified use

of strategic outsourcing to overcome challenges at their own sites as they partnered with us to move their
early-stage research programs forward during the pandemic.

In addition, the record biotech funding environment, which eclipsed $130 billion last year, is allowing our
clients to place greater emphasis on R&D investments, particularly in the early stage pipelines. We believe
these factors drove our exceptional financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year.

We are extremely pleased to report organic revenue growth above 10% in the fourth quarter and 7% for
the year. Both metrics are in line with or above our high single-digit organic growth target despite the
short-term challenges associated with COVID-19 last year. We also achieved our 2-year operating margin
target of 20% for the full year, 1 year ahead of schedule.

We are continuing to closely monitor COVID-19, but believe our strong performance in 2020 and a
continuation of robust demand trends, including record booking and proposal activity in the Safety
Assessment business position us well to get off to a strong start in 2021.

COVID-19 pandemic has also enhanced the global focus on scientific innovation, which is generating
biomedical breakthroughs across multiple therapeutic areas, including through COVID-19 vaccines. This
innovation has fueled continued investment in and the proliferation of more complex research techniques
involving advanced drug modalities, such as cell and gene therapies. The complexity of these new
modalities is increasing our clients' reliance on a high-science outsourcing partner like Charles River.

To enhance our ability to meet our clients' needs in these emerging areas of scientific innovation and
to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity that these advanced drug modalities present,
we are expanding our portfolio and scientific expertise through a combination of acquisitions, strategic
partnerships and internal investments.

This morning, we announced our intent to acquire Cognate BioServices, a premier CDMO partner for
clients comprehensive cell and gene therapy development and manufacturing needs. We believe Cognate,
which will become part of our manufacturing segment, is an excellent opportunity to enter the CDMO
market because it will allow us to participate in a niche value-added sector with a high-growth profile that
adds to our existing nonclinical development and manufacturing support capabilities.

Let me start by highlighting 3 key aspects of the strategic rationale. Cognate has solutions across the
major CDMO platforms for cell and gene therapies. Integrating manufacturing and required analytical
testing is critical to drive efficiency, and the cell and gene therapy sector offers exceptional growth
potential. Cognate's scientific expertise makes this particularly attractive transaction. It provides CDMO
services across both cell and gene therapies with its primary area of expertise in the CGMP cell therapy
manufacturing.

Cognate also has capabilities in the production of plasmid DNA, which is a foundational tool for the
development of gene-modified cell therapies and gene therapies as well as other inputs in the CDMO
value chain. Cell and gene therapies are emerging drug modalities. And as such, the science will
continue to evolve. However, Cognate's broad capability should enable it to better adapt to shifts in the
marketplace. Cognate has a track record of producing various cell types and technologies used in cellular
immunotherapy and immuno-oncology, regenerative medicine and advanced cell therapy.

The synergistic fit is the second pillar of the rationale. Cognate will be highly complementary to our
existing nonclinical capabilities, establishing a premier scientific partner for cell and gene therapy
development, testing and manufacturing and providing clients with an integrated solution from basic
research through GMP production. Biopharmaceutical clients are seeking to drive greater efficiency and
leverage scientific benefits by working with fewer trusted partners who have broad integrated capabilities.

As we are already a provider of extensive nonclinical services for cell and gene therapies, the acquisition of
Cognate will enable us to produce drugs in these advanced mobilities. We believe the strategic expansion
of our portfolio is particularly synergistic with our Biologics Testing Solutions business. It will be ideal for
clients to be able to seamlessly conduct analytical testing, process development and manufacturing for
advanced modalities with the same scientific partner, enabling them to achieve their goal of driving greater
efficiency.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,
2021

Our Biologics business is a premier provider of quality control testing, the cell and gene therapies,
including assay development, analytical testing and cell banking, which are all critical steps in the
manufacturing scale-up and commercial production processes.

Clients will also have access to our cellular products as the starting point for their cell therapy program
and will be able to work with Charles River through every step of the research and early-stage
development process before moving into CGMP production with Cognate, accelerating our clients' speed to
market for advanced drug modalities.

With Charles River and Cognate combined, we expect to effectively double the revenue base of our
comprehensive cell and gene therapy capabilities to approximately 10% of our total revenue. We believe
Cognate will also immediately enhance our growth potential by expanding our capabilities and scale into
this complementary high-growth cell and gene therapy sector. The addressable market for Cognate's
CDMO services, principally cell therapy and plasmid production, is currently estimated at approximately
$1.5 billion and expected to grow at least 25% annually over the next 5 years.

Growth is being fueled by the robust biotech funding environment. Approximately $20 billion was
invested in cell and gene therapy companies in 2020, fueling the rapid rise of cell and gene therapies in
the R&D pipeline, which now total over 2,000 programs. We believe the demand for Cognate services
will intensify as more of these programs progress into late-stage development and commercialization.
The companies that are successful in the market will be able to provide the science, the space and the
integrated solutions to broadly support clients cell and gene therapy programs. We intend to be one of
these successful companies.

The purchase price for Cognate is expected to be approximately $875 million in cash and the valuation will
be consistent with comparable high-growth, high-science transactions in the cell and gene therapy CDMO
sector. Cognate is expected to generate annual revenue of approximately $140 million in 2021, which we
project to grow at or above the estimated market rate of at least 25% annually over the next 5 years.

Because of the market growth potential and the emerging role of cell and gene therapies as treatments for
oncology and rare diseases in particular, we believe Cognate will meaningfully enhance our revenue and
earnings growth potential and the transaction will achieve our hurdle rates for investment returns. David
will provide additional financial details on the transaction, including the estimated 2021 financial impact.

We look forward to welcoming Cognate's dedicated employees to the Charles River family.

Now let me give you the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance. We reported
revenue of $791 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 14.4% on a reported basis. Robust
client demand across all 3 business segments drove organic revenue growth of 10.3%. The DSA and
Manufacturing segments reported low double-digit organic growth. The RMS segment's organic growth
rate rebounded to a mid-single-digit rate, recovering from COVID-related client disruptions principally in
the second quarter. For 2020, revenue was $2.92 billion, with a reported growth rate of 11.5% and an
organic growth rate of 7%. We're very pleased with this high single-digit organic growth rate, particularly
in light of the revenue headwind from COVID-19.

The operating margin was 20.8% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year.
Margin improvement in both RMS and Manufacturing segments was offset by DSA operating margin
decline. For the full year, the operating margin increased by 100 basis points to 20%, achieving our target
1 year ahead of schedule.

This was an exceptional performance, resulting primarily from the inherent operating leverage in our
business, our continued efforts to drive operating efficiency and build a more scalable infrastructure and
the benefits from the temporary cost reduction initiatives related to COVID-19. Despite achieving our 20%
target, we believe we are well positioned to achieve modest operating margin improvement in 2021.

Earnings per share were $2.39 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 18.9% from $2.01 in the fourth
quarter of 2019. For the full year, earnings per share were $8.13, a 20.8% increase over the prior year.
We exceeded our prior guidance range of $7.75 to $7.85 due primarily to robust, low double-digit organic
revenue growth and favorable below-the-line items for the fourth quarter, including a lower tax rate.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,
2021

We are very enthusiastic about the outlook for 2021. We believe our exceptional market position, the
strategic expansion of our unique portfolio and our focus on operational excellence, combined with
continuing robust client demand position us extremely well for the year ahead. Excluding Cognate, we
expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $9.00 to
$9.25, or an increase of 11% to 14% year-over-year. The acquisition of Cognate is expected to be neutral
to non-GAAP earnings per share in '21 and add approximately 400 basis points to the reported revenue
growth rate, which equates to a reported revenue growth outlook of 16% to 18% in 2021.

I'd like to provide you with additional details on our fourth quarter segment performance and our
expectations for 2021, beginning with the DSA segment's results. DSA revenue in the fourth quarter
was $495 million, an 11.3% increase on an organic basis, driven by robust demand from global
biopharmaceutical and biotechnology clients in both Discovery and Safety Assessment.

For the full year, DSA organic revenue growth was 9.4%. We expect organic revenue growth will be
approaching 10% in the DSA segment in 2021 because clients, both large and small, are increasingly
choosing to partner with a large, reliable CRO like Charles River. Clients know that utilizing our science,
our broad, early-stage portfolio and our flexible outsourcing solutions will propel their research efforts
faster and more efficiently than they could do it alone. This was amply demonstrated during the pandemic
when they face challenges at their own sites. Robust biotech funding also continues to fuel a healthy
demand environment.

Our Safety Assessment business continued to perform extremely well driven by higher study volume and
price increases in the fourth quarter. Bookings and proposal volume reached record levels in the fourth
quarter across all regions and major service areas, which we believe positions the Safety Assessment
business favorably for a strong first half of 2021. We're pleased with the extensive depth and breadth
of our Safety Assessment portfolio and remain intently focused on continuing to enhance the value we
provide to our clients.

We're also seeing greater opportunities to conduct safety and efficacy testing on cell and gene therapies.
We believe there is meaningful growth potential inherent in the more than 2,000 programs currently in
the cell and gene therapy pipeline, approximately 2/3 of which are in the preclinical phase. The testing
requirements of cell and gene therapies vary by molecule from complex combination pharmacology safety
studies to certain cell therapies to safety programs that are similar to a traditional large molecules for
gene therapies.

We've already built one of the largest, early-stage testing platforms to support this emerging high-growth
sector and intend to continue to adapt and enhance our capabilities to meet the specific needs of these
emerging drug modalities.

We are continuing to add new capabilities across many of our businesses, including through strategic
partnerships. Our partnership strategy has proven to be very successful to stay current with cutting-edge
technologies and add innovative capabilities with limited upfront risk. In the last several months, we have
added new partnerships or expanded existing ones across several businesses, including with Cypre for
3D tumor modeling and screening immuno-oncological compounds in our Discovery business. And with
PathoQuest and JADE Biomedical in our Biologics business.

In addition, last month, we announced the acquisition of Distributed Bio, formerly a strategic partner,
through which we established our integrated large molecule discovery platform. This platform filled the
gap in our portfolio and expanded our early discovery expertise in the complex drug modality that few
CROs can successfully offer. We believe our clients' willingness to outsource more of their discovery
programs will be predicated on our ability to continue to add innovative capabilities to meet their critical
research needs.

We believe the combination of the strategic outsourcing trend, deep scientific expertise and our willingness
to forge flexible relationships with clients led to the tremendous performance of the Discovery business,
which had another exceptional quarter and year. Broad-based demand for our suite of early discovery,
oncology and CNS services drove the fourth quarter performance. To achieve our goals in 2021 and
beyond, we will continue to strengthen our portfolio by expanding our scale, our science and our

2021

innovative technologies. By doing so, we are enabling our clients to remain with one scientific partner from
target identification through IND filing and solidifying our position as the leading, early-stage CRO.

The DSA operating margin was 23.2% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 240 basis points for the fourth
quarter of 2019. The decrease was driven by increased costs due in part to performance-based bonuses
and a slightly less favorable study mix in the Safety Assessment business. For 2020, the DSA operating
margin improved by 140 basis points to 23.4%. We are pleased with the full year margin expansion in the
DSA segment and believe there will be incremental opportunities for improvement.

RMS revenue in the fourth quarter was $156.7 million, an increase of 5.2% on an organic basis. For the
year, RMS organic revenue declined by 3.3%, reflecting an impact of approximately 7% from COVID-19,
principally in the second quarter. Our outlook for RMS organic revenue growth will be in the high teens
for 2021 as a result of the recovery from last year's COVID-19 headwinds and the incremental benefit
from adding the high-growth cell supply businesses to the organic revenue base following the respective
anniversaries of the HemaCare and Cellero acquisitions.

As anticipated, global demand for research models improved in the fourth quarter both on a year-
over-year and sequential basis as clients returned to normalized order activity in all geographic regions
following COVID-related disruptions earlier in the year. Demand accelerated nicely in the fourth quarter,
particularly in China.

We believe that we benefited from market share gains in 2020, especially with academic clients
as research sites reopened and not all suppliers could meet the clients' needs. We will continue to
monitor the evolving COVID-19 situation globally, but at this point, it appears that most academic and
biopharmaceutical clients have adapted their protocols to continue working during the pandemic.

The Research Model Services also continue to perform well. GEMS is benefiting from renewed outsourcing
demand due in part to COVID-19 challenges at our client sites earlier in the year as well as scientists' use
of more complex research models. We're the natural partner for our GEMS clients since we have extensive
animal husbandry expertise, which enables us to manage their proprietary model safely and efficiently.

We're also continuing to generate client interest for Insourcing Solutions through both our CRADL
initiative, where we provide turnkey research capacity to our clients as well as through more traditional in-
sourced staffing arrangements.

Revenue for our cell supply businesses, HemaCare and Cellero, increased in the fourth quarter on a
comparative basis, but remained at a growth rate below the targeted 30% level. We anticipate that this
growth rate will accelerate as COVID-19 constraints ease, and we expect to achieve our growth rate for
these businesses in 2021. We continue to work diligently to expand our donor base in the U.S. and add
more comprehensive capabilities at all our sites to accommodate the robust demand in the cell therapy
market.

The acquisition of Cognate also positions Charles River as a trusted partner that can move cell therapy
program forward using the same cellular product through each step of the research and early-stage
development phases and into CGMP production at Cognate.

The RMS operating margin was 25.1% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 50 basis points from the fourth
quarter of '19. The increase was driven by operating leverage from higher sales volumes in the Research
Model Business as well as the benefit from operating efficiency initiatives. For 2020, the RMS operating
margin declined by 420 basis points to 22% due almost entirely to the impact of COVID-19. With the
financial impact of COVID-19 believed to be largely behind us, we expect the RMS operating margin will
rebound well above the 25% level in 2021.

Manufacturing revenue was $139.3 million for the fourth quarter, a growth rate of 12.4% on an organic
basis, driven primarily by the Biologics businesses. The Microbial Solutions and Avian Vaccine businesses
were also meaningful contributors to the fourth quarter revenue growth. Organic revenue growth for the
year was 10.4%.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,
2021

Microbial Solutions revenue growth rate improved again in the fourth quarter due in part to year-end
ordering trends for Endosafe testing cartridges. We continue to have delayed instrument installations
resulting from COVID-19 restrictions at certain client sites. We expect this will constrain the Microbial
Solutions revenue growth rate well into 2021, primarily because the incremental revenue stream
associated with corresponding sale of consumables, including cartridges, reagents and Accugenix microbial
identification services that generally follow the installation of our high-throughput systems will be delayed.
This is the primary factor that is expected to cause the segment's organic growth rate to be slightly below
10% in 2021.

Beyond the COVID-19-related impact, we continue to firmly believe that our ability to provide clients
with a comprehensive, rapid and efficient microbial testing solution as well as a high-quality and accurate
testing platform are key differentiators from the competition and will lead clients to continue to choose
Charles River for the critical quality control testing requirements.

The Biologics business reported an exceptional quarter in the year with strong double-digit revenue
growth. We believe that robust market demand will continue to support Biologics revenue growth in 2021,
due largely to demand for testing of cell and gene therapies. We've developed a comprehensive suite
of new assays required to support the unique needs of cell and gene therapies and will continue to add
assays in 2021 to accommodate the robust demand.

The acquisition of Cognate is also expected to be highly synergistic to our Biologics business as clients
will now be able to outsource GMP cell and gene therapy production and required analytical testing to one
scientific partner, reducing the bottlenecks and inefficiencies of utilizing multiple outsourced providers. We
also expect to derive a benefit from COVID-19 testing.

We believe our Biologics business will be providing required reduction testing as many of the vaccines
move into the commercial production phase and some of the early-stage testing activity subsides.
Given the strength of the demand environment, we are continuing to build upon our extensive portfolio
of services to support the safe manufacture of biologics and ensure we have available capacity to
accommodate client demand.

As part of this strategy, we were pleased to recently announce that we have expanded our partnership
with PathoQuest to build a next-generation sequencing lab at our Pennsylvania site and partnered with
JADE Biomedical to enhance our biologic testing capabilities and geographic reach in China.

Due to the leverage from strong revenue growth, the Manufacturing Support segment's operating margin
was 37.3% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10 basis points. For the year, the operating margin was
37.4%, above our mid-30% target and consistent with our expectations for 2021, excluding Cognate.

As I mentioned earlier, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that we are even more
integral to our clients now. We have been intently focused on accommodating their evolving needs during
these challenging times, and many clients have told us that they couldn't move their research forward
without us. Clients have outsourced incremental work to us across multiple therapeutic areas because of
our deep scientific expertise and the ease and flexibility of working with an integrated, early-stage CRO
like Charles River.

As a result, we generated approximately $60 million of revenue last year from our work on COVID-19
vaccines and related therapeutics. We're proud to have worked on all of the COVID-19 vaccines that have
been approved for emergency use by the FDA and in the U.K. to date, including the AstraZeneca and
Moderna vaccines. AstraZeneca and Moderna are 2 leading biopharmaceutical companies that we have
worked closely with under our respective strategic relationships for many years as they have embraced the
benefits of outsourcing and driving efficiency through their R&D organizations.

Our relationships with Moderna and AstraZeneca demonstrate how we can work together towards a
common mission to bring breakthrough treatments to market to save lives, which has been particularly
critical now as we strive to find a solution to the pandemic.

As 2020 has demonstrated, we are operating in a robust business environment with excellent growth
potential. To continue to successfully execute our strategy to maintain and enhance Charles River's

position as the leading, early-stage CRO and expand our manufacturing support to CDMO capabilities,
we will continue to make investments in our scientific capabilities through M&A, strategic partnerships
and internal development, expand capacity and staff to accommodate demand and exploit our digital
enterprise to provide critical data for internal use and to enhance connectivity with our clients.

We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities across our businesses and across a number of
drug modalities and scientific capabilities. We will invest in a disciplined manner, strengthening our
portfolio and focusing on speed and responsiveness as we meet our clients' individual needs and promote
a more efficient drug development model. Our goal is to enhance our position as a trusted scientific
partner for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, and government and
nongovernmental organizations worldwide. By providing exceptional value to our clients, we believe we
will continue to deliver greater value to our shareholders.

In conclusion, I want to thank our employees for their exceptional work and commitment, especially
during the COVID-19 pandemic. And our shareholders for their support.

Now I'd like David Smith to give you additional details on our financial performance and 2021 guidance as
well as additional details on the acquisition of Cognate.

David Ross Smith
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Before I begin, may I remind you that I'll be speaking primarily
to non-GAAP results, which exclude amortization and other acquisition-related charges, costs related
primarily to our global efficiency initiatives, our venture capital and other strategic investment
performance and certain other items. Many of my comments will also refer to organic revenue growth,
which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation.

My discussion this morning will focus primarily on our financial guidance for 2021, which principally
excludes the impact of Cognate BioServices. We expect 2021 reported revenue growth of 12% to 14%,
excluding Cognate, and organic revenue growth of 9% to 11%, which includes a benefit of the favorable
year-over-year comparison to last year's COVID-19 revenue impact.

Sustained client demand, including record fourth quarter bookings and proposal volume in our Safety
Assessment business and a robust biotech funding environment support our growth outlook for 2021.

Based on this strong revenue growth and with modest operating margin expansion in 2021, we believe we
are well positioned this year to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share between $9 and $9.25. This equates
to year-over-year earnings per share growth of approximately 11% to 14%, which is similar to our top line
growth outlook as higher revenue and margin improvement will be partially offset by a higher tax rate.

Foreign exchange is expected to provide a 200 to 250 basis points benefit to our reported revenue growth
guidance for 2021 as a result of the weakening U.S. dollar. Our FX rate estimates are based on the bank
forecast for the year, which are currently very close to spot rates.

We have provided information on our 2020 revenue by currency and the foreign exchange rates that we
are assuming for 2021 on Slide 40, and we'll continue to monitor fluctuations in the currency market as
we progress through the year.

From a segment perspective, our revenue outlook reflects the strong business environment and the fact
that most of our businesses have recovered from COVID-19-related disruptions in 2020. The RMS segment
is expected to achieve high teens organic revenue growth in 2021 as client order activity for research
models rebounds from COVID-19 and the growth rate of HemaCare and Cellero cell supply businesses
accelerates to targeted levels.

We expect the DSA segment to deliver organic revenue growth approaching 10% in 2021 and
Manufacturing to grow slightly below 10% on an organic basis as Robust Biologics demand is partially
offset by the continuing impact of COVID on Microbial Solutions. We were very pleased that the operating

margin improved by 100 basis points to 20% in 2020 and that we achieved our target of a 20% full year
operating margin 1 year ahead of plan.

Building upon this performance, we believe that we are well positioned to drive additional margin
improvement for the full year 2021 despite modest pressures on Manufacturing due to Cognate as we
continue to leverage strong revenue growth and maintain our focus on operational excellence.

On a segment basis, RMS is expected to be a primary contributor to margin improvement in 2021,
increasing from the COVID-suppressed levels of 2020 to well above 25% this year. The DSA operating
margin is expected to continue to make progress toward the mid-20s target, and the Manufacturing
operating margin is expected to be similar to the 2020 level before Cognate.

We expect unallocated corporate expense in 2021 to be in the mid-5% range as a percentage of revenue
or similar to 5.6% of revenue last year. Our scalable infrastructure enables us to drive greater efficiency,
even as we periodically reinvest to meet our goals and the needs of our clients.

Total adjusted net interest expense is expected to decrease to a range of $66 million to $68 million in
2021, excluding Cognate compared to approximately $74 million last year. We expect the decrease driven
by lower average debt balances as well as lower variable interest rates.

The non-GAAP tax rate for 2021 is expected to be in the low 20% range, an increase from 18.9% in 2020.
The increase in the tax rate is principally an issue of comparison to 2020 because last year's tax rate was
reduced mainly by discrete tax benefits associated with state tax returns and foreign tax credits.

As a reminder, the first quarter tax rate has been meaningfully lower in recent years due primarily to the
excess tax benefit related to stock compensation. Given our current stock price, we expect this to be true
in 2021, resulting in a non-GAAP tax rate in the mid-teens in the first quarter.

We remain intently focused on driving strong free cash flow growth as a key measure of our financial
performance. In 2020, free cash flow was $380 million, an increase of 12% from 2019, but below our prior
guidance. The decrease in the fourth quarter resulted primarily from higher capital expenditures, which
totaled $166.6 million. This was above our prior outlook of $130 million due to 2 factors: paying capital
invoices ahead of schedule in order to give a discount as well as the timing of capital projects. Some
projects that were slow due to the COVID-related challenges in the second quarter resumed in response to
the reacceleration of growth and business activity.

At the end of the fourth quarter, our total debt balance was essentially unchanged sequentially at $1.9
million, but our gross leverage ratio decreased to 2.3x, primarily because of the strong fourth quarter
performance.

With our leverage ratio below 2.5x, we will benefit from interest savings on our variable rate debt,
reducing the rate by 12.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points.

For 2021, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $415 million to $435 million based on the
anticipated strong operating performance of our business and our continued focus on working capital
management.

Capital expenditures this year are expected to total approximately $180 million, excluding Cognate.

Currently, we do not intend to repurchase any shares in 2021 and expect to exit the year with a diluted
share count slightly more than 51 million shares. The FX benefit is expected to largely offset the earnings
per share dilution from the higher share count.

A summary of our 2021 financial guidance, excluding Cognate, can be found on Slide 49.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2021, we expect year-over-year revenue growth will be in the low
double-digit range on a reported basis and approaching 10% on an organic basis. We expect earnings
per share to increase at a high-teens rate year-over-year from $1.84 in the first quarter of last year. As I
mentioned earlier, the first quarter tax rate is expected to be in the mid-teens, primarily due to the excess
tax benefit from stock-based compensation.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,
2021

Before I conclude, I'll provide some details on our financial outlook, including the acquisition of Cognate.
Assuming the acquisition closes by the end of the first quarter, Cognate is expected to add approximately
$110 million to revenue for the partial year, resulting in a revenue growth outlook of 16% to 18%. We
expect Cognate to be neutral to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2021, so do not expect the acquisition to
have a meaningful impact on our current guidance.

The acquisition is not expected to have a meaningful impact to Charles River's consolidated operating
margin this year so we continue to expect to generate modest margin improvement with Cognate. We
believe there will be opportunities to improve Cognate's operating margin over the next few years as we
deliver acquisition synergies, enhance the scale of the business and drive operating efficiency. We intend
to update our full guidance and other financial metrics to reflect Cognate next quarter once the acquisition
closes.

From both strategic and financial perspective, we believe the acquisition will deliver a compelling benefit
that will generate value for shareholders. As a premier cell and gene therapy CDMO, we expect Cognate
to boost the growth potential of our business and be increasingly accretive to non-GAAP earnings after the
first year.

Due to the high-growth nature of the emerging cell and gene therapy sector, we expect to pay 23x
adjusted EBITDA for the next 12 months after the close. We expect the transaction will achieve our return
on invested capital hurdle rate, which is to meet or exceed our cost of capital by year 3 or 4.

We plan to finance the Cognate acquisition through our current revolving credit facility, and we will
also evaluate opportunities to further optimize our capital structure given the attractive interest rate
environment. Our pro forma gross leverage ratio at closing is expected to increase into the low 3x range,
which is consistent with the levels after other recent transactions. Also consistent with prior deals, we will
focus on repaying debt in a timely manner following the acquisition and reducing leverage to our targeted
level below 3x.

In conclusion, we are very pleased with our 2020 financial performance and believe that we are positioned
to have another strong year in 2021. Over the past 5 years, we have achieved compound annual growth
of 15% for revenue, 16% for earnings per share, 15% for operating cash flow, and 10% for free cash
flow. With Cognate and future acquisitions as well as continuation of the robust underlying demand
environment, we believe that we will be able to achieve similar growth metrics over the next 5 years. We
intend to provide a business update and more details on our longer-term outlook, including our updated
financial targets at a virtual Investor Day in the spring. Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Just 2 quick ones here. First off, and I think we could probably triangulate based on those last comments.
But David, could you tell us what the cost of capital you're using for the Cognate deal? It looks like you
might be exploring some options on your debt structure related to this.

And then secondarily, there were some comments on mix and safety being slightly disfavorable in the
short term. I'm curious if we could get a little more detail on what the driver of that was and what the
outlook is for the mix going into 2021?

David Ross Smith
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Eric, in terms of the cost of capital for our return on invested capital calculations, we use our
WACC, which is around 7%. But I think your question is also about how we might fund it. So we know
the interest rates are very low at the moment. If that holds, then we will be looking to see how we might
structure our long-term debt to finance Cognate.

So we'll say more, of course, in a few weeks or a months' time when we come to do that. But yes, I think
it's definitely on the cards that with a low interest rate environment, we ought to take advantage of that.
And so although we can fund the investment initially through our revolver, and we'll do that, we will be
keeping a close eye on actually what markets might do in terms of longer-term interest rates for our
bonds.

In terms of the DSA margin, there were 2 aspects that drove that. But if I just step back a moment, you
-- as everybody knows, we've been trying to get to the 20% overall margin for Charles River for some
time now. Really pleased that we've achieved it this year. Really pleased that we did it 1 year ahead of
schedule. And DSA was a meaningful contributor to that.

So the margin grew 140 basis points over the full year. But we did have a slight decline in Q4. And that's
partly to do with higher performance-based compensation. I mean we had the 9.4% organic revenue
growth. I just mentioned, the 140 basis point margin improvement so the wider DSA team absolutely
deserve the compensation that they've got there.

Secondly, to your question on the steady mix. And we've had this conversation a few years ago, where
we have a situation where we've got a disproportion amount of studies that have large models and so did
additional costs initially when those studies kick off. But if profitability improves over the course of the
study and overall, you end up with similar sorts of margins.

So mix is to tend to fluctuate. Sometimes it balances off to get the portfolio occasionally, you get like we
have in Q4, like we had a few years ago, where we've got a particular heavy load and the like on studies
that have larger costs at the beginning.

So overall, yes, we're very pleased with the potential for DSA. Still striving to move that towards the 25%,
which I think Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks as well. So this Q4 impact is mostly transitory.

Your next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,
2021

I wanted to focus on cell and gene therapy with my question in your Cognate acquisition, I guess, a 2-
parter. Jim, in the WIL acquisition, there was a small CDMO that came along with it, and you decided
to sell that, kind of decided that you didn't want to be at least in that CDMO business. So Part A of the
question here is elaborate a little bit on why the CDMO opportunity in cell and gene therapy is more
attractive to you for Charles River to get into.

And then Part B, the question is to flesh out a little bit more of the pieces that you've now assembled
with your cell supply, your complementary biologics testing capabilities, et cetera, a little bit more of the
continuum? And are there -- is that fairly complete at this point? Or are there other additional capabilities
that you feel like you need to fill into white space in your C&GT business?

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Thanks for that, Dave. Yes. So many years ago, we did acquire a small molecule CDMO. And it was
a perfectly good business. And you'll recall, kind of we told that we -- we told you and other analysts and
shareholders that we had done an exhaustive analysis of the industry, and we had decided that it was --
there were some very, very big players and it would be difficult for us to achieve scale. And since we like
to be, if possible, the premier player in the spaces in which we work, we just -- we thought it was best to
exit, which we did. And at that time, perhaps overstated, I desired to remain out of it.

But as you know, over the last couple of years in conversations with us, I think several things have
happened. Number one, cell and gene therapy has heated up dramatically. Number two, that brings with
us both an opportunity to make a niche play in the CDMO space and be minimally a leader, which we're
entering with this asset as a leader in the space and potentially the leader over time. So we -- so that sort
of dovetails with the original comments that we made.

You've got this $20 billion of investment in cell and gene therapy. Just in 2020, you've got 2,000 drugs
that have been filed. The vast majority, over 2/3 or 3 quarters, I think, are in preclinical and Phase I. So
the demand has heated up dramatically. We have a lot of inbound. Our M&A is derived from requests from
clients for products and services that they need that they'd like us to have, either because they trust us
more or they're unable or incapable of getting these elsewhere. So this feels like -- it fills a very important
gap in the portfolio. I don't think it would be lethal had we not done this, but it would cause clients to have
to go outside to get their drugs manufactured.

So just to continue to comment and answer your second question. We now have an extremely broad
portfolio. So you're starting with us literally with the cells via research and development. We're going to be
able to do process development for you of your drug. We're all obviously going to be able to test that drug
in our Discovery and Safety business. We're going to be able to manufacture that drug for the clinic and
hopefully, the commercial purposes. And our Biologics business is going to test those drugs before they're
going to the clinic or into the marketplace.

So it's a very, very comprehensive suite. As you heard us say, cell and gene therapy is going to move
with this deal from about 5% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal '21 to 10%. So it's a major move
for us strategically, but we're doing that entirely in response to our clients. So clients can stay with us
through the development of the cell and gene therapy products, particularly cell therapy products where
the preponderance of this business is focused and an opportunity to be a leading player in this segment.

Operator

Your next question is from John Kreger with William Blair.

John Charles Kreger
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Jim, just a quick follow-on on what you just said. I assume the work that Cognate is doing is clinical at this
point, but are you set up for commercial scale production? And can you maybe comment on the -- kind
of the capital footprint and investment needs that you think you're going to need to make in the business
over the next few years?

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,
2021

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. They've got a good geographic footprint. It's U.S. and Europe. They have -- definitely have
incremental capacity, some of which has been added relatively recently, which will provide the capacity,
both to do larger clinical trial lots and if and as those drugs move into commercial, into a commercial
domain, obviously, to do that work as well, which the clients will want to do that also. Obviously, there's
very few commercial products that exist in cell and gene therapy period, although so many being worked
on right now.

So that certainly would be the goal and the strategy we anticipate. We certainly have the technical ability,
regulatory ability, knowledge of CGMP production in cellular therapy from people that have come from a
host of different company backgrounds to form a very strong management team there.

Capacity, like all of our businesses that are growing, will be important as we built out somewhat in
advance of having the demand and anticipating the demand. I do think the clients of Cognate's will be
very pleased to see it in our hands because there's the uncertainty of being private equity owned and
what's the future and what's the investment portfolio. So I do think that clients who are working with this
company now in the clinic, whose drugs are progressing nicely, will have a high degree of confidence if the
drug makes it that we could and perhaps should be their commercial producers. So we like that sort of
entry point here with a bunch of increased business with our access to clients with their footprint and with
this being part of our overall portfolio.

Operator

Your next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats, Jim, on completing the acquisition. I know you talked about it, I think, over a year at our
conference and your intent to enter the area. So congratulations. My question is around the margin
profile. Clearly, you exceeded your margin expectations by a year. But from everything I'm hearing, it
sounds like there's a real nice opportunity for long-term margin expansion, right? You talked about the
complexity of the projects that you are working on. And even when I think about sort of the strategic
outsourcing, it seems that we're starting to hear from some companies that they're looking to downsize
their own facilities and their own sort of workspace, which I equate to kind of like 5, 10 years ago, what
we saw in the talks were kind of like capacity was coming down, which gave you an opportunity.

So how should we think about that margin expansion and opportunity? And when you give us those long-
term goals, is it going to be kind of like a 2-year goal? Or are we thinking longer-term here, especially
given kind of like the Cognate acquisition that really opens this new and growing market opportunity?

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

I'll give you a general comment. David may want to give you a slightly more specific comment. And I think
we'll leave sort of the overall deep dive on this important subject with you entirely until we give longer-
term guidance. But I think as a bottom line proposition, we are organized to drive efficiency throughout all
of our businesses. We are organized to keep our G&A load as flat as possible as the business continues to
grow and could -- we've demonstrated that over the last few years. We've also demonstrated our ability
to drive efficiency. We're going to be doing some more work on the digital front, which will provide greater
connectivity amongst our sites internally and externally, and we'll certainly take time out of the process
that should generate better returns also.

We certainly will continue to have pricing power across all of our businesses, which I think you are alluding
to with the outsourcing demand. There's basically biotech. We have a big pharma footprint. Biotech is the
principal driver of our growth. Biotech is extraordinarily well funded, and biotech has no internal capacity
and doesn't want to have it.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,
2021

So I would say, first and foremost, our biggest business segment, which is DSA, definitely has meaningful
margin opportunity going forward. We still have some major acquisitions in that business that have
improved nicely but still have more margin to contribute. And I think efficiency across all of those
businesses will be significant. The company that we just bought will continue to have improved margin
opportunity. You've got to see RMS get back to kind of historical levels to '21. And then I think it should
improve, particularly since it has that attractive cell product aspect to it. I think the Manufacturing
segment can always get better. We'll see how we decide to say about that. The margins being at 37% are
obviously quite extraordinary.

Having said that, I think there's probably still opportunity in the Biologics business to drive growth. So you
should see some modest improvement in '21, as we said in our prepared remarks and certainly more on a
forward going basis, and we'll give you a deep definitive dive on that in the not-too-distant future.

David Ross Smith
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

I think you've covered all the main bases there, Jim. And the only thing I would add is that we constantly
give some deep thoughts about where to invest versus the margin expansion. And it's always a balancing
act to look for the medium term. But despite that comment, as Jim said, we do feel we can get margin
expansion this year. And we'll say more when we have the virtual Investor Day in the spring.

Operator

Your next question is from Juan Avendano with Bank of America.

Juan Esteban Avendano
BofA Securities, Research Division

I have a few questions on RMS. I guess the first one is the pent-up demand in research models, do you
foresee that to be a multiple quarter event? And related to that, it seems like the supply of nonhuman
primates has been severely impacted by COVID-19 and export bans from China. Are you seeing a benefit
in your Research Model volumes as clients might need to migrate towards smaller volumes in the absence
of the bigger models? This is a dynamic that I've been sort of tracking.

And then the last thing is on HemaCare and Cellero, it seems like the revenue that came in, in the quarter
was a little bit lighter than expected. And so just curious if you're seeing a lingering impact from the
pandemic on the donation centers? I'll leave it there.

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. There's probably a slight lingering impact as you put it on the government side through the fourth
quarter. We had shutters down, and then we opened it in May. It's been improving steadily. There's still
some -- obviously, some social distancing going on, and we're always looking for new donors. So probably
some slight drag coming out of the year. As we said in our prepared remarks, we anticipate that we'll
continue to improve both as COVID becomes less severe, hopefully. But even if it doesn't, we feel we have
the operational knowledge to structure this in a way that we should achieve the goal. So we had next
year's targets, which is north of 30%. So that will continue to participate -- to grow nicely.

In fact, you're going to ask another question on nonhuman primate. So I'll answer the one I thought you
were going to ask and answer the one that you did ask, why is that the supply is definitely constrained
around the world? I think we've done an exceptional job in adding, ensuring, tightening up, expanding our
supply sources so that we have multiple supply sources for multiple countries such that we can support
the demand, which is quite significant. The sort of changing out of species and moving to smaller species,
maybe we should have an offline conversation on that. I just don't think that's -- I don't think that's
happening. Work on large molecules really has to be done on larger species to get the sort of quality
results that we're looking for. So I think NHPs will continue to play a critical role.

In terms of pent-up demand for RMS, I think we've seen much of that play through the academic medical
centers that were totally or partially shut in -- basically in all 3 geographic locals. Asia, Europe and the

U.S. have essentially all opened. We don't believe, regardless of the level of infection with COVID, that
they're going to go down -- go back in the lockdown. The research is too important. They're sorry that
they shut them down, and they definitely now had to work with other agents around and given that their
laboratories are usually all gone down.

So we think that we're back in kind of a normal cadence in RMS for the products, which is principally what
you're talking about, the services, obviously, we're not only unaffected, but I think benefited from some of
the COVID disruption that our competitors saw. But in terms of production sale of research models, I think
we're back to normal cadence, both in volume and price, enhanced by the cellular products of business
that continues to grow.

Operator

Your next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.

Robert Patrick Jones
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Jim, I wanted to go back to the comments around the delayed instrument installations in Microbial. It
seems like you're expecting that, I think the language you used was to affect revenue growth well into
'21, but it seems like you saw some improvement towards the end of 2020. So just wanted to understand
a little bit better what needs to kind of change at the client front in your mind to see a reacceleration of
these installations? And then relatedly, I think you gave some commentary on margins by segment, but
overall, it looks like 20 to 30 basis points improved EBIT margins. How could that look if, in fact, these
installations start to come back in faster in 2021 just to the overall enterprise margin?

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. So it's an imperfect world to predict this, but we feel pretty confident in what we've told you, which
is that, for sure, we have had difficulty accessing clients to install our largest and most complex systems.
And in a few cases, we have been able to do this with some of our larger systems on a virtual basis. So
the clients really were -- really needed these systems and were willing to dedicate the people and the time
to do with us. And of course, we had to be creative and facile to do things virtually.

Now having said that, we've had the FDA and other regulatory agencies auditing us virtually all year, all
of 2020, and clients have done that. And we've done virtual audits of lots of things ourselves, including
some aspects of the company that we're in the process of buying. So we're in a virtual world. So it's hard
to predict how comfortable people will get doing things virtually or whether they're just going to want to
wait. We think it will be a similar cadence to what we're on. The virus is pretty rough right now, obviously.
So limitations in many of the countries in which we work and we place these systems in many of the
states in the U.S. are severe. We're not letting outsiders into our facilities, for instance.

So the impact of that is as follows that we don't place the systems which are large systems. They got
large ASPs, and they're quite profitable. But even more importantly than that, every one of these big
systems generate substantial amount of revenue of cartridges, reagents and to some extent and in some
instances, our Accugenix ID business. So we're losing all of that associated incremental revenue on all of
these systems that weren't placed and still haven't been placed in fiscal '20.

What you saw in the end of '20, which is, I think, confusing you and I understand why, is less that the
sites opened up and more that there was just a surge of demand for cartridges at the end of the year,
pretty much with people that have -- we have a large installed base of thousands and thousands of
systems, most of which are relatively small. And those -- that's probably a commentary probably to a
small extent that people who couldn't get large systems that they're going to use their smaller ones more
readily. But more importantly than out of commentary on just how much work is out there on testing all of
these drugs before they get into the market enhanced slightly by COVID and somewhat by cell and gene
therapy.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,

So the business -- the demand for the business frustratingly has probably never been as good as it is now.
We'll do the best we can being created in installing those systems. But as they are not installed, we don't
get the incremental revenue, and that's why we're projected to be slightly below the 10% growth.

The answer to the second part of your question, margins are exceptional in that business, both in
the Microbial business and the whole Manufacturing segment. Having said that, they have steadily
improved. We think there's a lot of improvement in Biologics. And there has been some improvement in
our manufacturing capability in Microbial, which has improved the margins as well. So stay tuned.

Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

A couple of follow-ups here. Jim, starting with Cognate. I want to go back to John Kreger's question on
CapEx. If we look at some of the other CDMOs, whether it's Catalent with Paragon and MaSTherCell or
Thermo with Brammer, the cost of building out facilities here are not insignificant in the kind of $150
million to $250 million range for commercial cell and gene therapy facilities. So in the context of your
CapEx guidance being $180 million, I'm just curious how we should be thinking about your willingness to
take on maybe more -- much more significant investments.

And then 2 quick follow-ups for David on guidance. I'm curious if you can break out any COVID
contribution. I know it was $60 million in 2020. So what's baked in for 2021? And then on the margins,
it does seem like there's a couple of potential drivers to the upside here. You did have the DSA price
increase you flagged. RMS recovering from COVID suppressed levels and then the Manufacturing
installation tailwinds -- sorry, headwinds wearing off. So all of those seem like they could get you above
modest improvement, but I'm just curious if there are more meaningful offsets that would continue that.

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

So the CapEx will not be insignificant in this business. It will be meaningful, but I don't think we'll be
disproportionate to the growth potential of this business. This will be amongst, if not the highest growth
aspect of our business. So we'll have to invest ahead of it, as we've said earlier. Obviously, there's
a substantial installed base already that we're buying. This business is principally GMP cell therapy
manufacturing. And secondarily, the production of plasmid DNAs. And while the CapEx is substantial, it's
less substantial in some aspects of contract manufacturing.

So we're not really going head-to-head, for instance, with Thermo and Catalent that are more gene
therapy manufacturing businesses. And -- so it's difficult to get sort of what the spend is versus what
actually will be. They won't be -- it won't be insignificant, but it will be a lower order of magnitude, one
that we're pretty confident we'll get substantial returns on and that we've already obviously baked through
our model, and we'll give you clarity on it as soon as we close this deal.

David, you can take the second question.

David Ross Smith
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes, sure. So short answer in terms of COVID and the sort of headwind tailwind here, the short
answer is we've contemplated a sensible approach, at least we believe, a sensible approach to what
COVID will do in our guidance. So that's baked in. Of course, we don't know what we don't know. Just to
unpack that a little bit. So we -- obviously, we had some significant losses because of COVID, particularly
in RMS. And we did say at the last earnings call that we expected RMS to be broadly exiting the year with
COVID behind us, and we still believe that to be true. In academics, clients seem to be open, and we're
not expecting that do a U-turn, but we'll keep an eye out for that.

We generated $60 million of revenue that was COVID related, both in DSA, some vaccines and some other
aspects. Not all of that will go away. We expect to see some of that continue into '21. And that's also
baked into the guidance. So there are puts, there are takes. Broadly, we feel, the way we're looking at it,
we've broadly got COVID behind us other than the things that's already been called out late. We've just
been talking about Microbial, for instance, that's a lit bit of a headwind.

Moving ahead to your margin question. Just want to call out a few potential opportunities. I just want to
make sure that you're cognizant of the unallocated corporate costs. So historically, we've seen a 50 basis
point improvement as a percentage of revenue. This year, we're guiding towards pretty much flat 2020.
And the reason for that is that we have got some investments that we are contemplating or in the process
of putting in.

In fact, when Jim talked at the JPMorgan conference, we talked about 5 different strategic imperatives and
1 of those strategic imperatives was to champion technology. And indeed, I think Jim's just mentioned a
few moments ago, the desire to put in best-in-class technology should help our clients essentially access
scientific data in real time. So there is some set-up costs associated with that, which means that the
unallocated COVID cost is not giving that 50% basis points that we've historically had, but we would
expect to have that behind us this year.

Your next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Jim, maybe a follow-up for you on the RMS business. It certainly proved more resilient, even while the
pandemic has lingered here. Can you just talk through what changes you've seen in customer behavior
there? And then I know in recent quarters, this one included, you talked about some academic share
gains. How much of that is increased penetration versus taking share from competition?

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. We definitely have seen a change in demand, outsourcing demand on the service side of our RMS
business, almost entirely from the academic sector, who really were up against it with COVID with facilities
that literally were shutting prematurely and a significant amount of research was at risk. And the fact
that we were open, that we were capable of doing this and have been able to do it so well for them
for this amount of period of time, I think it demonstrated sort of the frailties of them continuing to do
this internally. So there's no question that we've seen incremental work that was done internally be
outsourced. And we're highly confident that a meaningful amount of that has stuck.

And just a quick side. Similarly, you asked the question about RMS, we saw some of this in Discovery and
Safety in the second quarter with clients who either they were using another provider who was incapable
of supporting them during the sort of -- kind of initial outbreaks of COVID and/or their own facilities were
shut for some meaningful period of time, and that caused them to either contemplate outsourcing for
the first time and contemplate more outsourcing that they had done historically. And definitely, based
upon the feedback we've gotten from these clients, really pleased with the services that we provide and
the speed with which we're doing it and the price points as well. So there's no question that we've got.
It's an incremental share that was perhaps not available to anybody, that was being done by the clients
themselves. And for sure, some work that was outsourced to competition, both in RMS and in DSA where
they were unable to do that. And that incremental share gain and expectation of continuing to gain share
in certain aspects of our business is certainly baked into our 2021 numbers.

CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17,
2021

Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe just 1 quick follow-up on the microbial
testing. And maybe looking at the other way, less about what getting pulled forward in margin impact, but
are there any capacity constraints, Jim or David, when things clear up? I'm just trying to think, could this
be a bolus of revenue that than for 4 quarters is higher and then normalizes? Or do you think it would just
sort of return to a normal level? I'm just trying to think through what would have to happen. Is this just
-- you start to ship it out and put people out? Or is there a point where you can only go so fast and so it's
just going to get back to a normal level?

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. I don't think there'll be a bolus of activity. The machines will have to be installed virtually or for real,
probably most real. And then the clients will have to start to utilize them. Obviously, that installed base
of whatever X number of machines that have either been delivered and not hooked up or waiting to be
delivered by us to the clients who's not letting us in, as I said earlier, sort of every day, every week, every
month, they don't have those systems. They're not buying the associated disposables. It's unlikely we're
going to install all those systems at once, and then they're going to suddenly expect to use them at once.
Obviously, it's beneficial once we install them because they are larger, and they use a disproportionately
large amount of disposables that will be beneficial.

But I think it will be gradual. It will be persistent. We're continuing to build -- our inventory will be in
enough shape. I think you're inferring, is that going to be a problem or an opportunity? I think our
inventory will be appropriate shape to accommodate demands in those associated disposables. But I think
it would be steady. Maybe it's slightly beneficial in a particular quarter or 2, but I don't think there's going
to be a surge in demand.

Your next question is from Dan Brennan with UBS.

Daniel Gregory Brennan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. Congrats on the quarter. I've had 2 questions and a margin follow-up and then 1 more on Cognate.
On the margins, I was hoping you could just help us on some of the segment margins. I know for
Manufacturing, obviously, exited the year at a great level, but I'm just wondering, what is the guidance on
Manufacturing margins for '21? It's a little unclear from the deck and from the comments. And similarly,
on RMS, I know you talked about well above 25%. Are we talking 27%, 29%? Any help on those 2
numbers? And then I have a follow-up.

David Ross Smith
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

Great. So in the Manufacturing, if you exclude Cognate, we would expect the margins to be similar to the
way we exited in 2020. However, Cognate will be a little bit of a drag. So we are expecting, with Cognate,
for just this year, to be somewhere in the ZIP code of the long-term guidance that we've particularly given
out, which will be in the mid-30s. We'll say more about where we think that's going to go at the Investor
Day.

In terms of RMS, okay, so well above 25%, that's a fair call out. Where's the ceiling on that? I think last --
if you look at last year, we were a little bit above the 25% to 26%. So I would say somewhere in the mid-
high teens would be about -- sorry, mid-high 20s would be about right.

Daniel Gregory Brennan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay, David. And then just maybe 1 more on Cognate. I'm just wondering, could you give us any
color on -- obviously, it's still a nascent market, any color on the competitive positioning, Paragon and
MaSTherCell. I'm sure WuXi Advanced and the big players are all focused here as well. So just any
color, whether it be number of clients? Or just any color you can give on that front? And then I'm just

wondering, in terms of the senior executives of Cognate, are they locked up given how critical talent and
expertise is to run these complex CMOs. I'm just wondering what the deal terms were on that front?

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

So you should think of our principal competitors in this space, being Lonza and WuXi and not Thermo and
Catalent. And number one, you should consider that our -- the size of our business, the business that
we're buying is comparable to those 2. So in the same ZIP code. Specifically with regard to the sort of
manufacturing capabilities that we're acquiring if you look at the totality of our portfolio in cell and gene
therapy from the cellular product businesses we bought last year with this business that we're teeing up
now across our whole portfolio, cell and gene therapy capabilities are vastly more significant than those 2
players and across the continuum where they can continue to use our services.

So we feel really good about our competitive position. I said earlier in answer to someone's question,
we're entering as a leader, specifically the CGMP part, and I think our aspirations and I think high
probability that we could be the leader with this in the midst of Charles River's larger portfolio, our
reputation, our client contact.

And with regard to the management, we've always been successful in keeping key management. And
obviously, we'll be proceeding to get contracts in place as -- now that we just signed a deal. So we're quite
confident that we'll keep the key management team in place.

Operator

Your next question is from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc.

Donald Houghton Hooker
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Great. I guess a lot of questions have been asked here, but maybe the big picture. Jim, would love your
broader perspective, kind of with your leadership position in the space, kind of on the topic of using
artificial intelligence and machine learning and drug discovery. I know you had one partnership there with
a company called Atomwise. You have a bunch of other partnerships. I'm not sure if you're dabbling in
that area in other ways. What are your evolving views there? I know you've mentioned in the past, but
just curious if your viewpoint on that topic has evolved?

James C. Foster
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. We think that artificial intelligence and machine learning will increasingly have a role in drug
development, both in predictability of successful preclinical trials and predictability of success in clinical
trials. And then, obviously, have a role in the design of those trials and some linkage between the animal
work and the human work. Theoretically and practically utilizing, if you take a look at the data that we
have on thousands and thousands and thousands of molecules some of which have succeeded and many
of which have failed, is -- can be highly important and predictive.

How robust that technology is, how quickly regulators adopt it, how quickly our clients embrace it is really
hard to tell. What technology do we utilize as we make these small investments in these technology deals,
we're going to definitely get access to multiple different ways of utilizing that data. And we may use them
in combination or we may just have one that prevails. We've done a lot of work on this internally and with
a bunch of world-class experts. And while we think there's an ongoing role, we want to be very careful in
terms of how we invest the shareholders' money and the assumptions that we make on sort of adoption
by the users and not either invest in a wrong technology or invest too aggressively prematurely.

So on a very measured but very thoughtful basis, we're going to continue to play in it. And I would say
that it's more than use the word dabble. I don't really feel that we're dabbling in. I think that we're --
we're seriously investigating the best way to utilize our capabilities in concert with some powerful AI tools.
I suspect we will have additional AI technology partnerships going forward.

Your next question is from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So quickly, anything to be mindful of from a phasing perspective in your 2021 guide, given your comments
on the first half outlook for DSA? Is first half a larger than typical proportion of your full year outlook given
the visibility you're messaging on the DSA side?

David Ross Smith
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

We don't normally see big gating differences in DSA throughout the year. We see that case in Biologics,
sometimes in RMS, but nothing particular to call out on DSA. We try to give you quite a lot of the pieces
and give you a little bit of a hint for Q1 as well. But other than that, no, we don't look at DSA and feel that
there are types of incidents that happen that would make that funky other than things like we can often
have a mix issue. And that's not to do with the calendar. That could be at any point in the year.

Operator

And your last question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Just to conclude, I was hoping you could give a little more color on DSA margins. I was wondering,
obviously, the full year was strong, but fourth quarter underperformed a little bit. Are you seeing any
inflationary pressures just given the amount of demand out there, either on wages or on some of the
supply constraints around the large models? And what's embedded for 2021 in terms of those points?

David Ross Smith
Corporate Executive VP & CFO

So we've never really called out that we've had like wage pressure. That is atypical from what takes
place in those countries. So there's nothing specific to call out for Charles River vis-à-vis wage inflation,
et cetera. And believe, we take a very close look to what's going on country-by-country and try to stay
competitive there. And there was an exception in 2018 midyear when we felt that we wanted to bring
Charles River to a living wage type organization, which we called out. But there are no real surprises in
terms of wage inflation or in terms of supply costs that we feel that we should be calling out other than
what we've already said in terms of Q4 was really to do with the timing issue. Other than that, we feel
that we will get -- start working -- will continue to work towards the mid 25% that we've been striving for
some time. And we don't have much more to say.

Todd Spencer
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations

Great. Thank you for joining us on the conference call this morning. We look forward to speaking with you
