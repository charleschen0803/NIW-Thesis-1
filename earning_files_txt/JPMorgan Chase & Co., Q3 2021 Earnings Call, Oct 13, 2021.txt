JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.
This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand
by.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer
to the disclaimer in the back.

Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $11.7 billion, EPS of $3.74 on revenue of $30.4 billion
and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 22%. These results include a $2.1 billion net credit
reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly as well as an income tax benefit of $566 million.
Adjusting for these items, we delivered an 18% ROTCE this quarter.

Touching on a few highlights. It was another strong quarter for Investment Banking, including an all-
time record for M&A. And while loan growth remains muted, we see a number of indicators to suggest
it has stabilized and may be poised to begin more robust growth across the company and particularly in
Card. And consistent with last quarter, credit continues to be quite healthy. In fact, net charge-offs are the
lowest we've experienced in recent history.

On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $30.4 billion was up $500 million or 2% year-on-year.
Net interest income was up 1% with balance sheet growth and higher rates primarily offset by mix and
lower CIB Markets NII. And NIR was up 3%, driven by solid fee generation across Investment Banking and
AWM, largely offset by net securities losses in corporate versus gains in the prior year and lower revenue
in Home Lending.

Expenses of $17.1 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments and higher volume and
revenue-related expenses, predominantly offset by lower legal expense and the absence of an impairment
in the prior year. And credit costs were a net benefit of $1.5 billion, driven by the reserve release. But it's
also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $500 million were approximately half of last year's third
quarter number.

Let's cover reserves on the next page. We released $2.1 billion this quarter, driven by less severe
downside scenarios as the macro environment continues to normalize. Reserves stand at $20.5 billion,
which still accounts for elevated uncertainties surrounding COVID and the current labor market dynamics,
including the expiration of expanded unemployment benefits.

Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.9%,
down modestly, primarily on higher RWA. The firm distributed $8 billion of capital to shareholders this
quarter including $5 billion of net repurchases. And the common dividend was increased to $1 per share.

With that, let's move on to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 5. CCB
reported net income of $4.3 billion, including reserve releases of $950 million on revenue of $12.5 billion,
down 3% year-on-year. Deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, indicating some deceleration as excess
deposits are stabilizing.

Notably contributing to this growth, we ranked #1 in retail deposit share based on the FDIC data, and
we're the only large bank to show meaningful share growth, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Similarly,
client investment assets were up 29% year-on-year. And while market performance was a driver, retail
flows in both adviser and digital channels were strong.

Touching on spend. Combined credit and debit spend was up 24% versus the third quarter of '19 and in
line with last quarter. Within that data, travel and entertainment spend was up 8% versus 3Q '19 and very
closely track the patterns of the Delta variant within the quarter, softening in August and early September
and reaccelerating in recent weeks.

Card outstandings were up 1% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from higher new
account originations. And while the payment rate is still very elevated, it's come down from the highs,
and revolving balances have stabilized. And when we look inside our data, we see evidence of excess
deposits starting to normalize in segments of the population that traditionally revolve. So as a result,
we're optimistic about the growth prospects of revolving card balances.

Moving to Home Lending. Average loans were down 6% year-on-year, but up 2% quarter-on-quarter with
portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments. It was another strong quarter for originations totaling
nearly $42 billion, up 43% year-on-year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi
market.

And in Auto, we had $11.5 billion of originations, second only to last quarter's record. So overall, loans ex
PPP were up 3% quarter-on-quarter on the growth in Card and Home Lending I just mentioned.

Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 5% year-on-year, driven by investments in the business, including
marketing. And more generally, we continue to see that the acceleration in digital adoption during the
pandemic has persisted with active mobile users up 10% year-on-year to almost 45 million.

So with that, looking forward, we are encouraged by our household growth and balance sheet trends.
However, we expect it to take some time for revolving credit card balances to return to pre-pandemic
levels given the amount of liquidity in the system. In the meantime, credit losses and delinquencies
remain extraordinarily low. In Card on a year-to-date basis versus 2019, low charge-offs more than offset
lower NII.

Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $5.6 billion on revenue
of $12.4 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3 billion was up 45% versus the prior year and down
12% sequentially. IB fees were up 52% year-on-year, driven by strong performance in advisory and equity
underwriting, and we maintained our #1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 9.4%.

In advisory, it was an all-time record quarter benefiting from the surge in M&A activity, and we almost
tripled fees year-on-year in a market that doubled. Debt underwriting fees were up 3%, driven by an
active leveraged loan market, primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in equity underwriting, fees
were up 41%, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the overall pipeline is healthy, and the M&A market is expected to
remain active. And if so, IB fees should be up year-on-year but down sequentially.

Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.3 billion, down 5% compared to a record third quarter last year.
Notably, we were up 24% from 2019, driven by the continued strong performance in equities and Spread
products.

Fixed income was down 20% year-on-year due to ongoing normalization across products, particularly
in Commodities, as well as an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in our derivatives portfolio. Equities
was up 30%, a record third quarter, with strength across regions and reflecting higher balances in prime,
strong client activity in cash as well as ongoing momentum in derivatives.

In terms of outlook, keep in mind that it will be a difficult compare against a record fourth quarter last
year but the current environment continues to challenge our ability to forecast revenues.

Wholesale Payments revenue of $1.6 billion was up 22%, or up 10% excluding gains on strategic equity
investments. And the year-on-year growth was driven by higher deposits and fees, partially offset by
deposit margin compression.

Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in fees on higher market
levels. Expenses of $5.9 billion were flat year-on-year as higher structural and volume and revenue-

related expense as well as investments were offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net
benefit of $638 million, driven by the reserve release I mentioned upfront.

Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion.
Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year on higher investment banking and wholesale payments
revenue. Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.3 billion was up 60%, primarily driven by
increased large deal activity with continued strength in M&A and acquisition-related financing across
both corporate client and middle market banking. Expenses of $1 billion were up 7% year-on-year,
predominantly due to investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses.

Deposits were up 4% sequentially, mainly driven by higher operating balances, and loans were down 1%
quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 3%, but up 1% excluding PPP, driven by higher originations. And
it's also worth noting that consistent with last quarter, we are seeing a slight uptick in utilization rates in
middle market. And those among larger corporates seem to have stabilized albeit at historically low levels.

CRE loans were flat with modestly higher originations in commercial term lending offset by net payoff
activity in real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $363 million, driven by reserve
releases with net charge-offs of 6 basis points.

And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net
income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 37%. Record revenue of $4.3 billion was up 21% year-
on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by
deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by higher
performance-related compensation as well as distribution fees. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of
$33 billion continued to be positive across all channels, asset classes and regions, with notable strength in
equities and fixed income.

AUM of $3 trillion and overall assets of $4.1 trillion, up 17% and 22% year-on-year, respectively, were
driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter
with continued strength in custom lending, securities-based lending and mortgages, while deposits were
up 5% sequentially.

Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $817 million, including $383 million
of the $566 million tax benefit that I mentioned upfront. Revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion, down $957
million year-on-year. NII was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $372 million, primarily on limited deployment
opportunities as deposit growth continued. And we realized $256 million of net investment securities
losses in the quarter compared to $466 million of net gains last year. Expenses of $160 million were down
$559 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment in the
prior year.

On the next page, let's discuss the outlook. Our full year outlook for 2021 remains largely in line with
our previous guidance. We still expect NII to be approximately $52.5 billion and adjusted expenses to
be approximately $71 billion. But as you'll see on the page, we've lowered our outlook for the Card net
charge-off rate to around 2% as delinquencies remain very low.

So to wrap up, we're pleased with this quarter's performance as we approach what we hope is the tail end
of the pandemic. The strength of the company, both in terms of our diversified business model as well as
our fortress balance sheet, talent and culture, have enabled us to perform well through this difficult period
while continuing to serve our clients, customers and communities.
As we look ahead and the environment normalizes, new challenges will undoubtedly arise, but we feel
confident with the position of the company and the strategy going forward. With that, operator, please
open the line to Q&A.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research.

John Eamon McDonald
Autonomous Research LLP

Jeremy, I wanted to ask about the net interest income guidance for the year. It seems to imply a nice
step-up in NII for the fourth quarter to roughly $13.5 billion. Was wondering what do you expect to be the
drivers of that sequential step-up? And would you see the fourth quarter NII as a good starting point for
us to think about our 2022 NII forecast?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, John. Good question and good catch there. It's true. That is quite a bit of sequential growth. If you do
the math, it suggest about $350 million. And in reality, if you think about what we've been saying about
the outlook for increased revolve and deployment and so on, the increase is not intuitively high.

And so just to explain, within that, there are a couple of factors. So one, there's actually a meaningful
amount of Markets NII growth between the third and the fourth quarter, which in general, we would
sort of encourage you to ignore. And there's also some sequential increase in NII from PPP forgiveness
contributing to the fourth quarter number. So if you strip those 2 out, you still see a little bit of modest
growth, which is a little bit more consistent, I think, with the overall story that we've been telling, which is
that the real acceleration in NII, especially from higher card revolve is a 2022 item.

In that context then, if you take that sort of lower number and think about annualizing that, I think it's
fair to assume that, that would be a sort of lower-end estimate for the 2022 number in light of what we
believe will happen in terms of especially card revolve. But obviously, we'll give you a little bit more color
about 2022 next quarter.

John Eamon McDonald
Autonomous Research LLP

Okay. And as a follow-up, your cash balances continue to grow, and you've been conservative on liquidity
deployment. Could you update us on your thinking around liquidity deployment, pacing that and what
factors you're balancing?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, totally. So at the highest level, I would say that nothing's really changed, meaning we're still all else
equal, happy to be patient. We still believe in a robust global recovery. We still are a little bit concerned
about inflation, I think relative to the consensus. And all of that contributes to a willingness to be relatively
patient about deployment.

But it's also fair to say that relative to last quarter, rates were obviously higher. We start to see central
banks around the world normalizing their policy stance a little bit. So the market implied rates are coming
a little bit more in line with our view. And given that, it wouldn't be surprising if we saw some more
opportunities for front-end deployment, cash and cash-like activity as well as possibly some duration
management.

Operator

Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.

Seaport Research Partners

Just first on loan growth. As you noted, Auto has been strong, Cards starting to show signs of life. But it
looks like outside of acquisition finance, C&I still seems a little weak, and we've got ongoing supply chain
issues. So as we think about the big picture, how are you seeing, I guess, loan demand trends playing
out? And what are you expecting as the next 12 months progresses?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So let's go through loan growth because obviously, that's one of the areas that everyone is interested
in. So if we start with Card, which is obviously the one that's going to matter the most in terms of NII
impact. As you said, we see some signs of life, and we believe that recovery is strongly underway. And it
seems, hopefully, like Delta is really fading, so that's going to help.

If you just look forward just to the holiday season, we would expect to see normal seasonality and normal
growth there. And the question, really, for Card, as we've talked about a lot, is whether that growth in
spend and in card outstandings translates into revolve.

But as I noted in the prepared remarks, when we look inside the data and we look at the customers who
have both deposit accounts with us and our card customers, and we look at those who would typically
be the ones that are most inclined to revolve, we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the
excess deposit balances there. So that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for Card
outstandings to grow with higher spend, but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into
next year. It's going to take time, obviously, but that is the core view.

In Home Lending, broadly, we expect that this quarter's trend with portfolio additions outpacing
prepayments to continue. And then in C&I, which you mentioned, just a reminder, right, that as you go
to the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the size of the C&I customers, we're eager to lend to them.
It's a key part of the franchise, but from a financial performance perspective, that's more of an outcome
rather than a goal.

But we do, as I noted upfront, see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates among smaller corporates. So
that's kind of consistent with the theme that we've been seeing, which is that the smaller you are and the
less likely you are to have had -- to have benefited from the wide-open capital markets, the more likely
you are to be borrowing. We do hear a lot about supply chain issues from that customer segment. So it's
going to be interesting to see how that plays out.

And then in CRE, we see quite a robust origination pipeline as we have sort of fully removed any
pandemic-related credit pullbacks. And we're leaning into that, and we do expect to see a little bit of net
loan growth going forward.

And then finally, I would note that we do see some loan growth in Markets, actually. And we generally
discourage you from focusing too much on NII and loan growth within Markets. But it is an indicator that
there are some opportunities there that we're taking advantage of in the usual kind of nimble way that
you would expect us to do in Markets.

James Francis Mitchell
Seaport Research Partners

Okay. That's all very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the expense side. You and your peers have all
seen higher expenses this year, higher capital markets and incentive expense and increased investment
spend. But as we think about going into next year, if capital markets activity normalizes as many expect,
can we start to see expense growth slow? Or are there other considerations to think about, whether it's
investment spend or inflation pressures that we should think about?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

Yes. So it's a little bit of an all of the above story, I would say. So first of all, we're still in the middle of
budgeting. And it's sort of a little early to be giving you 2022 expense guidance. We'll do more of that next
quarter. But realistically, expenses are going to be up next year.

Now to your point about capital markets-related expenses, it's obviously true that we pay for performance.
And in light of the very strong performance over the last couple of years in both banking and markets, we
have seen increased compensation expense on the way up. And therefore, as a function of the amount of
normalization that you see in 2022, you're going to see that come down in line, all else equal.

Obviously, I would point out that I think that the amount of growth in that number that we've seen
through the pandemic is less than a lot of people would have expected actually. And therefore, on the way
back down, you would also potentially expect less participation, not to mention just the timing dynamics
associated with the treatment of stock-based compensation vesting.

So all of that aside, at the same time, we are still investing. We still see significant opportunities. We still
see marketing opportunities in Card. And yes, labor inflation is a question. You saw us raise wages in parts
of the U.S. at the entry level that just came into effect this September. And as we look out, we see a lot of
churn.

And as Jamie was saying, it's good stuff. It's normal. It's understandable in this environment. But labor
inflation is definitely a watch item for us. So when you put all that stuff together, as I say, we'll update you
more next quarter. But that's sort of how we see the expense outlook for next year.

Operator

Next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

There are a couple of events during the quarter that I wanted to ask about. And specifically, how has
the tech strategy evolved? One, you made the announcement that you're changing the retail bank
core system entirely to the public cloud, and that's a big change. And Jamie, I would love to hear your
comments on that.

And then second, your expansion in the U.K. with digital banking, what metrics are you shooting for?
And third, your recent fintech acquisitions, to what degree are there synergies among the acquisitions in
addition to JPMorgan?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Mike, hang on, I'm writing down your questions because I don't want to lose track. Okay. So let's
start with the cloud first. So yes, you will have seen some press coverage around our partnership with
Thought Machine. At a high level, there's actually nothing new here. We've actually been committed to the
cloud for a long time.

And by the way, when I say cloud, I think we're talking about both private and public cloud. Our core
strategy involves really leaning into both and being very nimble across both. And I think that's very
important for us as a regulated institution from a resiliency perspective. But the reasons for -- and that's
all part of our overall tech modernization road map and a lot of the investments that we're doing that
you've heard all the leadership of the company talk about.

When it comes to Thought Machine in the consumer space, there are 5 main reasons why we did that. And
it's all the normal reasons why you do cloud stuff and you do tech modernization. We want to be able to
innovate quickly and bring products to consumers faster. We want to be able to run multiple products on
the same platform.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

As I mentioned, resiliency is critical. Increasingly, we want to be able to run the bank much more in real
time rather than based on batch processes. And obviously, APIs are central to the entire strategy in this
environment. So that's what I would say about that. Now -- yes, please, Jamie?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I'll just say this real quick. Thought Machine is basically the core general ledger. It's not all the other stuff
around consumer. And when you do these conversions, different than conversions in the past, you can do
them -- you can schedule pieces -- do part at a time, not all at once, like a big bank, which we used to
have to do when we did big merger and stuff like that. So it's a -- I put it as a lower risk for the company,
but the core strategy hasn't changed at all.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Okay. And then, Mike, international consumer and acquisitions, I think you asked about. So in
terms of international consumer, you will have seen that we launched -- it's obviously early days to
give meaningful updates on that, but you will have noted actually that we just rebranded Nutmeg as a
JPMorgan company just a couple of days ago. So all that's proceeding apace, and it seems to be pretty
well received. I think the offering is seen as differentiated and innovative. So we'll have more to say about
that over time. Generally...

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Can I just -- again, just to add. This is a 10-year game plan. This is not -- they're going to worry that
much about metrics in the next month or 2. And with -- this is a long-term work to try to get this thing
right, because if we ever going to be retail overseas, it's going to be digital. And so we're going to be very
patient. And at one point, Mike, we will report some metrics so you can see them. But they're not going to
be material to the firm's numbers for years.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It's going to take time for sure. So -- but just more generally, in terms of the acquisition strategy,
we've talked about this a little bit before. We're not claiming that we have some overarching top-down
acquisition strategy. I think broadly, we're just doing things that make sense. But there are some themes
that you can detect around bolt-on and adding capabilities.

Just for the sake of argument, if you start with AWM, you see a pretty consistent theme in there of ESG-
related capability additions. You've mentioned already international expansion and the potential for
growth, and it will be a long game, as Jamie says. And then, yes, there's definitely a fintech narrative a
little bit in terms of some of the stuff that we've done in the CIB.

And then within consumer, most recently, the collection of things that we've done, I think, is unified by the
theme of providing more integrated and holistic experiences to our customers. We've always been very
proud of the value proposition that we offer, especially in the Card product. But we think we can take it
up even another notch with some of the stuff that we're doing around lounges and cxLoyalty and stuff like
that. So I think I touched on everything there, Mike.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

You certainly did. And just a follow-up. I mean we see the results. The marginal efficiency in the
businesses where you're growing has improved, and we just don't have the why. So how much of that is
tech driven versus other reasons?

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

I mean I guess you have metrics internally that we just don't have. But your marginal efficiency is
what? Or your unit costs are going down or any additional color as to the why the marginal efficiency is
improving.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I mean I think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff, especially in terms of
what parts of the expense base you see is a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating. I would
have said that in reality, marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are
actually lower than a lot of people think. So the sort of operating leverage that you see, especially in the
type of environment that we've had with really big increases in revenue in the capital markets areas in the
NIR side, is actually relatively consistent with what I would have expected.

But a little bit to your point, Mike, what's also true is that we're a big organization. There's a scale play
here. We have a big fixed cost base. And a lot of the modernization agenda is about making sure that,
that doesn't creep and that it's as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as possible. And that
marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible, but that's a long play there.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I'll just add, Mike. One of the things as you think about -- one is you -- people worried about the forecast
for next year and stuff like that. We're playing the game for 10 years here. So we're going to -- and we're
not going to disclose certain things like margin by product or something like that because it's competitive
information. But the long game, we are competing with some very large, talented global players who are
not even in banking today. And we are going to compete in that. So even some of these acquisitions are
more around that than around just what I consider traditional banking.

And so -- and my whole life, just so you know, we've been modernizing technology. Every year of every
month of every quarter, that's like a permanent state of affairs. Obviously, now it's to the cloud and stuff
like that. Those things are critical to do to be competitive going forward. That was true, by the way, 20
years ago.

Next up, we have a question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask if you can expand a little bit more upon Card fees and Card revenue rate. We all certainly
expected the marketing expenses to kind of go up inside that line. And just wondering if you can help us
understand how much of that was captured in the third quarter. And just what your general outlook is for
the fee line and the underlying overall revenue rate?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Ken. So you're right. Part of the drop in the revenue rate this quarter is a function of higher
Card marketing spend, which you would have expected as a result of what we said last quarter in terms
of the importance of getting our fair share of the growth in spending as we emerge from the pandemic.
And the fact that we're out in the market with a lot of offers that are seeing good uptake, and we're
seeing nice growth there. So that's expected. And I think that Card marketing number will actually remain
elevated and if anything, tick up a little bit sequentially just based on how the amortization there works.
So you should expect to see that continue.

But in addition, this quarter, we have just an adjustment to the rewards liability, which is contributing to
the drop this quarter as well. So that is not something that we see continuing. So that should come out of
the run rate as we look forward.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Can you help us understand like what the magnitude of that is and what you think about overall Card
revenue rate going forward?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean as you know, we don't really manage the Card revenue rate. So it's not a number that I'm
eager to guide to. But I think the -- if I remember correctly, I think the rewards liability adjustment this
quarter was of the order of something like $180 million. So we'll confirm that, but I think that's right.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. If I might just ask Jamie. You made a comment yesterday about the supply chain hopefully easing
by next year around this time. What are you just hearing from your partners around the world in terms of
the log jams and the potential for that to open up from here?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'm not hearing much different than you're hearing. I'm just -- I know that the overfocus over time is
so extraordinary sometimes from the press that people forget the big picture. The economy is growing 4%
or 5%. What people are buying has changed, which has also hurt supply chains a little bit. There's not one
company I know that's not working aggressively to fix their supply chain issues. Sales are still up, credit
card, debit card spend still up, consumers in great shape. And capitalism works.

I doubt we'll be talking about supply chain stuff in a year. I just think that we're focusing on it too much.
It's simply dampening a fairly good economy. It's not reversing a fairly good economy.

Next up, we have a question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, 2 questions. One, just following up on the Card discussion that we just have regarding the fees and
the $180 million on the -- roughly $180 million on the rewards adjustment. I mean it still leaves us with a
pretty big decline Q-on-Q. And I'm just trying to think through that a little bit, because I know marketing,
rewards, et cetera, is up. But was there anything in particular that would have driven a one-timer that is
unlikely to persist or not?

I realize that cash back is a little more expensive. So maybe that's a piece of it, and it's a onetime move.
Or is it more a function of, hey, we're going to be ramping our offerings here. And so you should expect
that the forward look is a step down from what you had been seeing in 2Q?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So Betsy, in short, it's really the latter. So the only thing that is onetime-ish in nature, for lack of
a better term, is the rewards liability adjustment. And the rest of it really is marketing spend, and we
see that as a critical investment in this moment. It's a moment of high engagement with the product,
and we're very committed to making those investments. And so that is going to remain elevated, and if
anything, tick up a little bit as we look forward.

Okay. And then separately, I think today is the last day of the Vice Chair for Supervision, Randy Quarles'
term as Vice Chair of sup and reg. So the question is, how should we be thinking about how you are
positioning for an environment where maybe these rules don't change, right, like the LCR, the SLR, other
things that we had been hoping might have some changes in them. Should we be anticipating that in
order to help deliver the growth that you're looking for? That we should anticipate more pref issuance
going forward?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I think obviously, we're a little disappointed that we haven't seen some of the changes on the non-
risk-sensitive size-based constraints that we'd expected. But we're still hopeful that, that will come soon.
We know the staff is hard at work on the Basel III endgame, and that's complicated stuff. And it may be
the case that some of those things are connected.

And our strategy on pref issuance has been to try to balance giving ourselves the capacity that we want
to deal with the SLR constraint without overissuing and, therefore, being stuck with high-cost prefs that
aren't callable for 5 years. So that's part of the reason why we're operating a little bit above our CET1
target right now, and we're just going to continue to be nimble in that respect.

Next up, a question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So in the spirit of your thought on not overly focusing on the near term, I heard your comments on
payment rates in Cards, 4Q seasonality, optimism about revolving card balances. So is there an implicit
comment within there about buy now, pay later and the impact it may or may not have? I mean I'd love
to get your perspective on how this old, but I guess new, payment option might have on the card industry
overall.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So yes, BNPL, everyone is talking about it. It is funny how layaway is back in the e-
commerce checkout lane. But -- and obviously, we're looking at it. Everyone is talking about it. And it's
a moment for us as a company where even though for any given thing that's emerging, you can easily
convince yourself that it's kind of not a threat.

We're in a moment of taking all types of potential disruptions, especially fintech-y type disruptions quite
seriously. And in the case of BNPL, it's obviously particularly high profile because of the growth that we've
seen, although, it's a relatively small portion of the overall market.

I'll remind you that we have our own very compelling offerings that speak directly to the installment
payment experience in the form of My Chase Loan and My Chase Plan, which we get really good feedback
on the customer experience there in terms of the kind of post-purchase experience. You can select eligible
purchases on the app and then move that to the installment plan, if you want. But yes, we acknowledge
that it is downstream of the point of sale, which potentially raises some questions about whether we
should be looking at moving a little bit more upstream there.

But even more generally, when you take a step back, what we're really trying to do in the consumer
business here is think about what is the actual customer need that is driving the growth in BNPL. And how
can we respond to it in a strategic, holistic way across all of our customers and not sort of too narrowly
and too reactively just respond to BNPL? But it's obviously a thing that we're looking at, and it's quite
interesting.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

I think it's another example of a fintech company -- because you saw a firm come out, and it's no longer
just about BNPL. They're going to have a debit card and a cash banking account. So these are all different
forms of competition, which we have to respond to. And so that's why when we talk about like expenses,
we will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate all that. Maybe one other comment or to get your thought on the right perspective to think
about China and Evergrande. And what people care about most is, is there an expansion across border?
Meaning, is this contained within their market? Is the funders that will have some marks within their
market? Or do you see any domino effect in crossing borders?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So look, obviously, everyone is looking at Evergrande. Let me start by just saying that for us, in
terms of direct Evergrande exposure, it is absolutely de minimis. So that's one piece.

As you would expect, we've also looked at sort of more indirect exposures in terms of the broad China
property sector as well as exposures of financial institutions that we deal with to the China property sector.
And in general, those exposures are all very modest. So we're obviously watching it closely and continuing
to look for read across and do what you would expect us to do. But we're not terribly concerned right now
about the impact on us.

I think in terms of cross-border contagion, I don't hold my own opinion on this in particularly high regard.
But it does seem like this was pretty well telegraphed by the Chinese authorities when they talked about
their three red lines. So it's a process that's being managed. And I would say the better view right now is
that it will be contained. But of course, it's the market, so we'll see what happens.

Next up, we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess just wanted to follow up on 2 themes that we discussed. One around fintechs and the regulatory
changes, a lot of focus on the change in leadership at the regulatory agencies. Jamie, you've talked about
in the past in terms of the regulatory arbitrage when you look at big tech, nonbank players. I think BNPL
is a good example of that. Do you think as we have new leadership at the regulatory agencies, they are
alert to this arbitrage? And do you think we see a climb down? Or is it too late for really them to create a
framework that would level the playing field?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

I don't expect that there will be beneficial changes that help banks. And I think that we just have to
compete with what we're -- the hand we're dealt and not expect anything like that. And I think that you're
going to have some people clamp down more on banks, and maybe some people regulate fintech based on
products or services, something like that. But I'm not expecting any relief.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Yes. And I was wondering if there would be increased scrutiny of the nonbank players relative to
the banks, but point noted. And I guess, just on a separate question there, Jeremy. We didn't see any
build in the CET1 when I look at the numerator. Anything going on there this quarter that impacted it? And
with the stock where it is at 2.4x tangible book, just you remind us of how important are buybacks here as
opposed to just keeping some dry powder as the economy gets better.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I mean, the answer to how important buybacks are is that they're at the end of our capital
hierarchy, as we often say, right? So organic growth, including acquisitions, sustainable dividend, and only
then do we look at buybacks. And in light of the SCB environment that we're in, where we don't have a
Fed-approved buyback plan anymore, and if we just simply have to comply with the minimums and BAU,
that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness, which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world where
we do hope for loan growth next year and where acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon.

So nothing really going on this quarter other than a little bit of RWA growth in the denominator. And we're
just really going to stay nimble there.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

But is there a case to be made, Jeremy, in terms of just holding some dry powder and excess capital given
your macro outlook as opposed to buying back stock at current valuations?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the valuations -- as the stock goes up, you're going to -- you should expect us maybe one day,
buy less. And we don't need dry powder. We have an extraordinary amount of capital liquidity, I mean,
extraordinary. And we earned $40 billion pretax a year. I mean how much dry powder do you need?

We have $1.6 trillion of cash and marketable securities. We have 200 -- well over $200 million of equity.
We can issue preferreds, we can issue debt. We can issue stock, if we had to do something. So I don't
think we need dry powder. I think our capital cup runneth over where it is.

The next one is from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research.

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Jeremy, you provided some helpful detail on the drivers of loan growth by category. Just looking ahead,
is your expectation that loan growth begins to keep pace with GDP or economic growth? Or is there
anything that would actually justify more meaningful acceleration in lending activity, whether it's just
greater pent-up loan demand, normalization of the card payment rates or something else?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Good question, Steve. But I think you're sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan
growth guidance for 2022, which I'm not really in a position to do. But let me see if I can answer this at a
high level. I mean we've talked a lot about spend, which we believe in, driving Card loans higher. So that's
one piece.

And the revolve story within that, as a function of the spend down in cash buffers, especially in our
revolver -- the revolving segment of our customers. And obviously, as you know well, if you kind of think
about our NII as the sum product of the NIM and the outstandings in the various loan categories, it is
really disproportionately Card that drives things.

In the meantime, if you move a little bit away from consumer to the larger wholesale system, in a world
where even if tapering starts relatively soon, if that plays out over roughly 8 months at $15 billion of
decrease a month, you still -- if you do the math, wind up with another $0.5 trillion of QE. So we are
dealing with a system that has a lot of surplus liquidity.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

And so in that context, realistically, it's hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan growth at a
minimum. But frankly, that's not really a big driver of performance for us. So I don't know if that helps,
but it's a good question.

Steven Joseph Chubak
Wolfe Research, LLC

It absolutely helps. And just one clarifying question on the FICC commentary. You noted this quarter's
result included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio. I'm assuming you could
help unpack what that adjustment actually entails? What prompted it? And could you help size the impact
in the quarter?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

I could help unpack it, but it would take another 20 minutes, which we don't really have. It's just bog-
standard liquidity evaluation-type stuff in the derivatives book in terms of -- as we revise our assumptions
about what the potential transaction cost would be associated with transferring certain types of positions.
It's normal-course stuff that just happened to be a little bit bigger. I think fixed income was down 20%.
And I think without that, it would have been down 15%, so if that helps.

Next question is from Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I was hoping to follow up on the capacity to deploy liquidity. And I guess just to kind of lean in a little bit.
If we look at the growth in deposits -- and I know some of them are kind of considered noncore. But take
out the loan growth and the growth in the securities book since COVID, you've got about an extra $500
billion of deposits. And how much of that do you think can be deployed into securities? And understanding
that you expect loan growth to pick up, so that will go to some. But is there a way to size that $500 billion
capacity in terms of bond securities?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I think there's a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is in any given moment.
Obviously, as you said, loan growth. But also we will always make these decisions on a long-term
economic basis, not for the purpose of generating short-term NII.

And so when you do that, you have to think about capital volatility, drawdowns and, frankly, whether or
not you see value. And that, if anything, is probably the biggest single factor right now, as I talked about
earlier. It is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views, at least from a rate
perspective, and that may lead to a little bit more deployment, all else equal right now.

But when you start talking about Spread product, for example, in light of the liquidity environment that
we're in and the QE numbers that I mentioned a second ago, that remains very, very compressed. And
there's just not a lot of value there. So we're always -- we always try to be long-term, economically
motivated there considering all the scenarios, considering risk management, considering the convexity of
the balance sheet and looking at value and being tactical there. So that's really how I would think about
that.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. I mean I understood on the near-term basis. But I think a lot of investors are sitting here saying, if
the 10-year or really any part of the curve hits that magic point for you, what is just the capacity? So for
example, if the 10-year gets to say 3%, and you're confident it's not going to go to 5%, do you have $100

billion of capacity? Is it $300 billion? Just any way to frame it longer term, appreciating that it's not what
you're looking to do at this moment at these levels?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. No, I get the question and...

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

We can easily do $200 billion.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean I get the question. I get why you want to know. I guess I just feel -- think like for a company
of our sophistication and given how carefully we think about this stuff, the idea of a particular target
at which we would deploy a particular amount, of course, Jamie's right. But it's always going to be
situational. It's always going to be a function of why the rate is where it is. I mean in your question, you
alluded to it. It's like if the 10-year notes are at 3% and we're sure it's not going to 5%, but then where is
the rest of the yield curve? What are the other options? What's going on in that moment? So it's -- there's
-- we're always going to be situational and tactical about it.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then can I just squeeze in? You've announced a bunch of kind of what most of us would
characterize as relatively small acquisitions, some this quarter and, obviously, looking back for the full
year. Is there something -- is there a way you can kind of size the capital impact of that? I know most of
the terms weren't disclosed individually. But any way to frame kind of the capital and financial impact?
And then just lastly, remind us like what is the driving force when you look for a deal? Because some of
the deals you kind of look at and you're like, how does that fit into broader JPMorgan Chase?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I think it's...

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

The capital impact in total isn't that big a deal. No, we're not going to disclose any more, nor is the
immediate financial impact. And each one is different. So in consumer, Jeremy already said, it's more
about lifestyle, travel, lounges, millennial, stuff like that. In asset management, it's products. There was
tax-efficient products, ESG products, timber products, stuff like that. And then between Nutmeg and C6
and stuff like that, that is the longer-term view about us trying to get positioned into retail overseas over
10 years if we can.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Jeremy, you were saying that when we were talking earlier about the potential SLR changes and such, and
we haven't seen anything in Quarles' leaving today. But you mentioned about maybe the Fed is focused on
the Basel III endgame that's coming very soon here. Can you share with us, from your guys' perspective,
what are you focusing in on with the Basel III final rules and regulations that could affect your growth
going forward?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 13, 2021

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I think -- I mean, the thing about the Basel III endgame is that you need to essentially deal
simultaneously with the Basel floors, the Basel standardized floors and the Collins floor. So you need
to simultaneously -- so from the perspective of the staff that's working on this stuff, they have a tough
challenge to simultaneously put in place a U.S. rule, which is Basel compliant, while also complying
with the Collins floor standardized RWA minimum. And so that's complicated, and it's hard and it's
quite technical. And that sort of explains why it's taking a little bit longer than we might have otherwise
thought.

In terms of the impact of that on our long-term growth, I mean, at a high level, it's unlikely to be
significant. I think that the related point is whether or not there are some changes as part of that or
contemporaneously with that to these sort of non-risk-sensitive size-based constraints, like G-SIB and
SLR, where obviously, most prominently in the case of G-SIB, it's really getting pretty extreme in terms
of the growth in the score for reasons that really have nothing to do with what the original design of the
metric was and to a very significant degree, are driven by the expansion of the system that we've seen in
the last 18 months. So that's why we believe that, that should be addressed as was contemplated in the
original rule.

And so across all of those potential changes, you could see us doing a little bit of optimization in response
to those. You can imagine that Basel III endgame in terms of standardized and advanced and the impact
on different products might make some things a little bit more capital efficient, and others, a little bit less
capital efficient at the margin. But we're a big, diversified company. We're pretty good at navigating this
stuff. So when we have clarity, we'll make the necessary tweaks.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Very good. And then obviously, you and the industry have seen really good deposit growth on a year-over-
year basis. I think your deposits are up 20% all in. You talked specifically about retail being the #1 market
share in retail deposits.

When the Fed ends QE, assuming it does sometime by the middle of next year -- and I'm not asking you
guys to forecast where your deposits are going to be. But just higher level, should we anticipate that
deposits could actually decline? Or no, that they are going to be so sticky, even with the liquidity that
everybody carries, that we shouldn't really see a decline in deposits after QE ends, let's call it, second half
of next year?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I think there's a couple of factors in here. So let's, for the sake of argument, set RRP aside for
a second and hold that constant. If you just look at the impact of QE on system-wide deposits -- we
talk about tapering, but as I said earlier, tapering still involves another $0.5 trillion of system expansion
between now and the end of tapering or rather between the start of tapering and the end of tapering.

If the Fed follows the same type of trajectory that it followed last time, there would be an extended pause
between the end of QE and the beginning of QT. And again, setting RRP aside for a second, it would
only really be with the beginning of QT that you would expect the size of the system deposit base to
start shrinking. And I think the timing last time, if I remember correctly, was something like 22 months
between the end of QE and the beginning of QT. Now of course, RRP could bounce around, and there could
be other factors. But at a high level, that's how we're thinking about it.

And I -- I would just add my two cents. I think they'll have to go quicker than that, and they'll have to
reverse some of it. So you're talking about -- we're still going to increase deposits for a year, and then
there'll be a fairly large reduction over a 2- or 3-year period, which we should be prepared for.

Next question is from Charles Peabody from Portales Partners.

Charles Peabody

I wanted to sort of get a progress report on your new headquarter building. Specifically, what's the move-
in -- projected move-in date? Or has that been affected by the pandemic? Secondly, are there costs
-- noticeable costs running through 2021 expense structure for that build out? And does that tick up
noticeably when you move in? And then thirdly, what's the plan for unloading the properties that you'll be
vacating? And how is that being affected by the current real estate market?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So the plan is on schedule, move-in date, 20 -- I think 2025. There are no material expense. Of
course, there's duplicate expenses, and we have to sell the building and stuff like that. But there's nothing
material to our shareholders we need to disclose.

Operator, any other questions?

That is coming from Andrew Lim from Societe General.

Andrew Lim
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

And so you talked, Jamie, about how you're focusing on inflation. Just wondering if you could outline
what you're looking at exactly metric-wise across your businesses to signal to you that inflation is actually
materializing as a concern. And how would that pan out versus your expectations? And in terms of like
how we deal with it, so if it does materialize as a concern, is there anything that you can do to try and
protect the bank against inflationary forces there?

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, I mean I think we should look at the big picture here, which I think it's always important. I
mean 2 years ago, we were facing COVID, verging a great depression, global pandemic. And that's all in
the back mirror, which is good. So by, hopefully, a year from now, there will be no supply chain problem.
The pandemic will become endemic. And I think it's very good to have good, healthy growth, which we
have. And I think it's -- be good to have unemployment at 4%. It's good that their jobs are open. I think
it's going to waste window? And I think there's too much focus on -- and none of this changes how we
run the business. Which we add clients all the time, consumer, card, auto, deposits, real estate, small
business, large companies and stuff like that, which is really the underlying thing that drives JPMorgan.
It's not whether they take the revolver from 25% or 27%.

So having said all of that, yes, and I'm not focused on inflation. We simply are pointing out, well, first of
all, you have inflation. It's 4%. It's been 4% now for the better part of a couple of quarters. And in my
view, unlikely to be lower than that next quarter or the quarter after that.

The only question is, does it start to ease after that with supply chains and wages, more people looking for
work. Or does it continue to go up? And of course, we prepare for probabilities and eventualities. And one
of those probabilities is that it might go higher than people think, that they'll have to tamp down. I doubt
that will happen before late 2022.

In the meantime, I think it's unbelievable that we're getting out of this thing and have 4% unemployment.
And you can have good growth with some inflation, and that's okay. I think the people are always focusing
too much on immediate concerns. If you have inflation of 4% or 5%, we're still going to open deposit
accounts and checking accounts and grow our business.

I also should point out because this is always in the back of my mind, of our $30 billion of revenues, $20
billion is subscription revenues: Asset Management; Commercial Banking; Consumer Banking, which is
pretty good; wholesale payments, security services, custody. And so we're pretty proud with the people
who accomplished all this. If you look at the actual underlying numbers we're getting earnings per second,
more customers, more accounts, more share. And at the end of the day, that is what drives everything.

Andrew Lim
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

Okay. That's great. So it seems like you're taking a benign view that it's a manageable -- it's not going to
get out of hand.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

No. No. It's the opposite. I'm telling you I don't -- no, it's the opposite. I'm telling you, I don't know. We're
prepared for all eventualities. There may be a fat tail of inflation. And one of the things about our balance
sheet -- you guys talked about liquidity and stuff like that. One of the fat tails a bank should be -- the
banks should be worried about is high inflation and high rates. And have -- being very liquid protects us
more against that than other things.

Andrew Lim
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

Right. Got it. And just a short follow-on question really. Could you update us on the amount of excess
provisions you've got versus your base case economic scenario? You've given that number in the past. And
perhaps a bit of color also on how that base case has changed over the quarter, if it has indeed.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I think the base case -- the central case has probably actually gotten a tiny bit worse quarter-on-
quarter in light of the revisions in GDP outlook. But as you know, the framework also involves looking at
probability-weighted scenarios. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the sort of less extreme downside
scenarios contributed a bit to the release this quarter.

In terms of sizing the overall balance, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, they remain a little bit
elevated relative to what they would be if we had this type of economic performance with none of the
COVID-related unusual features, i.e., uncertainty about the virus as much as we are optimistic about
that right now, or uncertainty about labor market conditions. Or the fact that even though a lot of the --
essentially all the federal-level unemployment assistance has now rolled off and most of the states have,
too, there's still some forms of assistance.

The mortgage foreclosure moratoriums, student loan stuff, rent moratoria, stuff like that, that don't roll off
until later in the year. So there's a number of factors in the environment that are still unusual, which do
contribute to slightly elevated reserves relative to what we would otherwise have. And as things play out,
those will develop.

James Dimon
Chairman & CEO

Jeremy, just to interrupt real quickly. I got to go because I'm out of town. I have meetings I have to go to,
but you guys should continue. And folks, thanks for listening to us, and we'll talk to you all soon.
