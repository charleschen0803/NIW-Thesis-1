ALBEMARLE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019
Albemarle Corporation Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's
conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Dave Ryan, Vice President,
Corporate Strategy, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.

David Ryan Terrence
Vice President of Corporate Strategy & Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome to Albemarle's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday, and you'll find our press release,
earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at
www.albemarle.com.

Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Tozier, Chief Financial
Officer. We also have Raphael Crawford, President, Catalysts; Netha Johnson, President, Bromine
Specialties; and Eric Norris, President, Lithium, who will participate in the Q&A portion of the call. As a
reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about our outlook, expected company
performance, production volumes and commitments as well as lithium demand may constitute forward-
looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language
about forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.

Please also note that some of our comments today refer to financial measures that are not prepared in
accordance with GAAP. A GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings release, in the appendix of our
earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.

Now I'll turn the call over to Luke.

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everybody. On today's call, I'll provide a recap of our 2019 strategic
accomplishments and address the 2020 milestones that we'll be focused on to ensure we deliver on our
vision. Scott will give you an update on the financials, our cost savings program and our full year 2020
guidance.

Despite a challenging back half of 2019, we grew fourth quarter and full year revenues, adjusted EBITDA
and adjusted earnings per share year-over-year. That reflects our ability to address a dynamic market
and to deliver solid results across our businesses. In addition, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA for the
corporation margin of 29%.

2019 was another strong step toward our long-term vision. As you can see on Slide 6 of our earnings
presentation, we made significant process on a number of strategic milestones. Importantly, we made
significant improvements in our safety program. Lithium reduced its injury rate by 50% from 2018.
Catalysts achieved its lowest recordable injury rate in 4 years and bromine surpassed 2 years with no lost
time injuries. Our OSHA injury rate in 2019 puts us in the top quartile of our peers.

2019 marked our 25th consecutive year of dividend increases. And we are now included in the select
group of companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. We've demonstrated our
commitment to return cash to shareholders through increasing the annualized dividend from $0.10 in
1994 to $1.47 in 2019. That's a 22% CAGR, and we'll continue that commitment well into the future.

ALBEMARLE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

In 2019, we also conducted a materiality assessment to identify sustainability topics that support the
execution of our strategy and ensure Albemarle maintains its strong financial position in a responsible
manner for decades to come.

As you can see from Page 8 of the investor presentation, we're focusing on 4 key areas: people, natural
resources, community engagement and our sustainable business model. In 2020, you'll see us establish
baselines and long-term targets for improvement. We look forward to updating you on our progress.

Consistent with our efforts to manage the portfolio and maintain a strong balance sheet, we announced
last quarter our intent to divest the Fine Chemistry Services and Performance Catalyst Solutions
businesses. The process for both businesses is going well. Our first priority for the use of proceeds from
these transactions will be to reduce debt.

Also last quarter, we announced a program to capture sustainable cost savings. This program is well
underway, and we expect to deliver $50 million in savings this year and reach a run rate of over $1 million
in annual savings by year-end 2021. The new ERP system we implemented last year will enable this
program with better real-time visibility into all of our operations. Scott will provide more detail about the
program in his session.

To support our Lithium growth plans, we continued to make progress on major capital expansion projects
during 2019. We successfully commissioned our Xinyu II lithium hydroxide unit in China, with the start-up
and operating teams exceeding their 2019 targets and reaching full nameplate operating rates in less than
12 months.

We also increased our lithium carbonate production in La Negra I and II by about 5%. The La Negra III
and IV lithium carbonate expansion in Chile is on schedule for commissioning by the first quarter of 2021.
Finally, the Kemerton lithium hydroxide unit in Western Australia is targeted for commissioning during the
latter half of 2021.

We also continued to develop our best-in-class lithium resources. The Talison joint venture completed
Phase 2 of the Greenbushes expansion in the fourth quarter, bringing their annual capacity for chemical
grade spodumene to approximately 160,000 metric tons on an LCE basis. Albemarle has rights to half of
that production.

In addition, Albemarle secured access to the world-class Wodgina spodumene mine through our MARBL
joint venture. This joint venture has the resources and ultimately, will have the conversion assets to
annually produce 100,000 metric tons on an LCE basis of battery-grade lithium hydroxide.

Keep in mind that we are currently using less than 25% of our available lithium resources, which gives us
the ability to respond quickly to support the lithium demand growth for at least the next 10 to 15 years.

Turning to our long-term lithium contracts. Currently, about 90% of our battery-grade carbonate
and hydroxide volume is under contract. To date, we have reached agreement with all but one of our
contracted customers on 1-year price concessions for 2020, which results in a mid-teen percentage price
reduction compared to 2019 with technical- and battery-grade carbonate seeing higher reductions and
hydroxide being generally lower. Otherwise, the basic structures of our long-term agreements remain
unchanged.

We will continue to manage these agreements to evolve with the individual needs of our customer. Each
customer has unique value drivers that are critical to them. We remain committed to leveraging our
world-class resources and low-cost conversion processes to meet the growing demand and deliver a
differentiated value proposition to each customer.

As we outlined at our Investor Day in December, while we are slightly adapting some aspects of our
execution, our strategy remains largely the same: invest in growth and focus on cash generation in lithium
through smart investments and our advantaged resource position; maximize the earnings and cash of
bromine and Catalysts through sustainable cost savings and investments in systems, people, processes
and operational excellence; assess our portfolio for opportunities to divest noncore businesses and acquire

or build lithium conversion assets at a lower capital intensity; and take a thoughtful and disciplined
approach to capital allocation, while preserving financial flexibility.

By executing that strategy, by 2024, Albemarle should generate revenue in the range of $4.7 billion to
$5.3 billion, a 5-year CAGR versus 2019 results of 6% to 9%; adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion to $1.8
billion, a CAGR growth of 8% to 12%; adjusted EBITDA margin between 32% and 36%, a 300 to 700
basis points improvement; and $1 billion of annual sustainable free cash flow.

In December, we also outlined the many inputs we used to build our lithium demand forecast. These
inputs include historical and forecasted technology advancements, cost projections, OEM model
announcements and a number of other factors. We continue to see the advancements of these variables,
which further reduce impediments to wide-scale consumer adoption, namely range anxiety, infrastructure
and cost parity.

The global average range of new EV models launched is expected to exceed 200 miles, with some models
exceeding 300. To support mobility, there are now almost 1 million public EV charging connections
globally, and the number will continue to expand, especially in Europe and China.

And cost improvements through technology and scale are also accelerating. In their most recent survey,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that the average cost for a lithium-ion BEV battery pack was in
the range of $150 per kilowatt hour in 2019. The $100 per kilowatt hour milestone is now within reach
in the 2022 to 2024 time period, well ahead of estimates just a year or 2 ago. In fact, upfront purchase
parity predictions are also being pulled forward into the 2022 time frame.

All of these trends are consistent with the projections of our model, leaving us even more confident in our
demand expectations. I remain very confident in the lithium market demand we will see over the next 3 --
4 to 5 years and in Albemarle's ability to seize that opportunity. Albemarle has the best lithium resources
in the world. Converting those resources into battery-grade carbonate and hydroxide cost effectively will
be absolutely critical to support that demand growth. Remember, there is no EV revolution without lithium.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to provide greater detail on fourth quarter performance and full
year outlook.

Scott A. Tozier
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. Albemarle generated unadjusted U.S. GAAP net income of
$90 million during the fourth quarter, bringing full year 2019 net income to $533 million compared to $694
million in 2018. Increased charges for the MARBL acquisition during 2019 were a factor. However, 2018
benefited from a $170 million gain on the sale of the polyolefins and components business, creating a
difficult comparison.

Full year 2019 adjusted earnings were $6.04 per diluted share, an increase of $0.63 or 12% over the prior
year on a 2018 pro forma basis. Our businesses delivered about $0.58 per share of that growth.

2019 also benefited from a favorable tax rate and from our 2018 share repurchase program. The gains
were partially offset by currency impacts, higher depreciation in lithium and increased corporate expense.

Net cash from operations was $719 million in 2019, an increase of just over 30% versus the prior year,
driven by the strength of the businesses, a reduction in lithium working capital and improved working
capital across the rest of the company.

Capital expenditures in total ended 2019 at $852 million after approximately $90 million in expenditures
shifted into 2020 based on invoice timing. As Luke mentioned, all our major growth projects remain on
track, and we will continue to update you on their progress throughout the year.

In November 2019, we closed the note offerings on the equivalent of about $1.6 billion, which we used
to pay the MARBL joint venture cash payment and restructure the short end of our maturity curve. As a
result of the bond offerings, we were able to reduce our annual average interest cost by 70 basis points to

2.7% and get our investment-grade ratings reaffirmed by all 3 agencies. We closed 2019 with a net debt-
to-EBITDA right on track at 2.4.

Now let me move on to the business performance. During 2019, bromine delivered sales of just over $1
billion and adjusted EBITDA of $328 million, a year-on-year growth of 9% and 14%, respectively. Full year
adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 33%. Although there is continued weakness in the automotive
sector, the other markets for flame retardants and bromine derivatives remained healthy, supporting year-
on-year volume growth and elevated prices. Volume growth was supported by the tetrabrom expansion
in Jordan that came online in mid-2018. Pricing continued to be buoyed by constrained production of
elemental bromine by Chinese competitors.

Full year Catalysts sales were $1.1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $271 million, approximately flat
compared to 2018, excluding divested businesses. Refining catalysts provided mid-single-digit percent
adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding onetime insurance settlements that were received in 2018. Strong
sales volumes in HPC and low single-digit price increases in FCC helped to offset lower FCC volumes.

During the fourth quarter, lithium volumes were up 27% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Average
pricing was flat in the quarter, and customer mix hurt sales by about 5%. Increased tolling to meet
customer commitments and the negative customer mix resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%.

For the full year, lithium generated net sales of $1.36 billion, an increase of about 11%. Adjusted EBITDA
was $525 million, down by about 1% compared to 2018, and the full year adjusted EBITDA margin was
39%.

During 2019, we grew lithium LCE volume by 14% versus the prior year. Our average prices remained flat
under a backdrop of an overall industry prices being down 28% to 30% year-on-year, demonstrating the
strength of our customer relationships and contract structure.

As we mentioned at our Investor Day, the lithium market has been more volatile than we expected. So
we are adjusting our approach. We have access to the world's lowest cost resources in both bromine
and lithium. But to succeed in a volatile marketplace, we need to have low-cost operations and business
processes as well.

As Luke mentioned earlier, our sustainable cost savings program is well underway. We have identified over
70 discrete projects, assigned project ownership and instituted a tracking dashboard. We have included
$50 million of anticipated sustainable savings in our 2020 guidance. About 40% of the savings will come
from selling and administrative costs. For example, we have identified savings of more than $10 million
that we can achieve through the reduction of outside services.

About 40% will also come from reduced factory spending and operational efficiency. For example, an
operational excellence project at one of our production facilities is expected to generate $6 million to $7
million in savings this year.

And the last 20% of savings will come from supply chain activities like procurement and logistics. For
example, one program will consolidate the number of freight forwarders that we use across the globe.

We are confident in our ability to achieve this milestone in 2020 and reach our targeted run rate of $100
million by the end of 2021, and we'll provide periodic updates on our progress throughout the year.

Execution of our capital projects continues to be a focus in 2020. Due to the timing of payments that
pushed from 2019, capital spending in 2020 will be higher than previously anticipated. You can expect
total CapEx of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, with over 70% of that dedicated to lithium growth.

We are certain that our businesses will continue to perform at a level that generates the cash needed for
this growth plan. Net cash from operations is expected to range between $700 million and $800 million in
2020, up modestly from 2019 due to lower working capital. Free cash flow is expected to remain about the
same as 2019.

Note that on Page 18 of our earnings deck, we have provided some additional data points on our forecast
that may be helpful when you're doing your models.

ALBEMARLE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Now let me turn to our business unit outlook for 2020. I'm going to begin with the coronavirus and
the impacts from that. Our thoughts are with the families who have been impacted by this virus. For
Albemarle, we've had 0 confirmed cases among our employees. We are diligently managing the situation
to protect our employees and the local communities and are complying with all government and health
agency recommendations and requirements.

In addition to our Chinese lithium hydroxide conversion facilities in Xinyu and Chengdu, we occupy offices
in several cities across China. Employees in these offices have been working from home and are expected
to return next week on a limited basis. In lithium, we continue to operate safely but at a reduced capacity
at our production sites and in cooperation with the local government offices are determining the next steps
to resume our normal operations.

To date, we've experienced minimal order reductions from our customers and have been able to produce
the quantities needed to fulfill orders. However, each businesses is experiencing logistics delays.

The potential impact on deliveries to our customers and deliveries of raw materials to our facilities remains
an area of concern. In lithium, there's a risk that the automotive OEM slowdown in China will have ripple
effects. For example, the potential of inventory building up at the battery manufacturers could impact
us later in the year. And our lithium hydroxide conversion plant construction at Kemerton in Western
Australia relies in part on equipment sourced from China. The start-up of the plant could experience delays
given the uncertainty for Chinese equipment deliveries. To date, though, project construction has been
proceeding as expected.

In Catalysts, our largest risk is lower FCC sales to customers who export fuel into China to the degree
that transportation within China continues to be restricted. And a secondary risk is that raw materials that
we source from China, but we currently have sufficient inventory to cover our requirements well into the
second quarter.

In bromine, the primary risk is related to logistics, caused by a shortage of drivers and depends on the
duration of restrictions on people movement to manage virus containment.

Overall, we expect a weak first quarter in China. And depending on the continued length and severity of
the outbreak, our operations could be further negatively impacted.

2020 will be a pivotal year for lithium. EV growth in Europe is expected to accelerate driven by fleet-wide
CO2 reduction targets. Growth in China is still uncertain. We saw the market begin to stabilize at the end
of 2019 and expect growth to return in 2020. However, the impacts from the coronavirus adds a measure
of uncertainty on how the year will play out. We anticipate the total lithium demand to increase by about
50,000 metric tons and inventories to begin to tighten as we go through the year.

Our volume growth will be about 3% in 2020 and will be limited until we commission the La Negra III/IV
lithium carbonate expansion in early 2021. As Luke mentioned, we have reached agreement with all but
one of our contracted customers and are sold out on battery-grade materials. Although the prior inventory
buildup and additional supply availability put pressure on pricing for 2020 versus our prices in 2019, we
believe that market pricing has stabilized. Unfavorable pricing will be partially offset by lower costs as a
result of reduced tolling volumes, higher operating rates, lower royalties in Chile and the impact of our
cost savings program. Consequently, we expect a year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA of about
20%.

For bromine, we expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA performance to be flat to slightly down compared to 2019.
Demand for flame retardants and other bromine derivatives is expected to remain stable. However, slightly
increased supply across the industry could put price pressure on the business in the second half. We are
operating in a sold-out position, meaning we have little to no headroom to make up any price degradation
with volume growth. However, we will continue to optimize our sales into markets that provide us with the
highest margins.

We expect Catalysts adjusted EBITDA to be flat to slightly up year-on-year, with the second half somewhat
stronger than the first. FCC catalysts are expected to benefit from strong demand and an improved

ALBEMARLE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

product mix. However, our FCC units are also operating at full capacity, limiting our ability to benefit from
additional volume upside.

Clean Fuels Technologies (sic) [ Clean Fuel Technology, ] our hydroprocessing catalyst, is expected to be
slightly down based on our incumbency mix and a lower year for distillates turnarounds and changeouts.
Since we'll be operating bromine, lithium and FCC catalysts at sold-out utilization rates, our operational
excellence teams will be focused on reliability and productivity improvements to get the most we can from
these assets.

Driven by the pricing pressure in lithium and bromine, modest low single-digit volume growth in all
divisions and the high utilization of our manufacturing assets, we expect 2020 net sales to be $3.48 billion
to $3.53 billion. Adjusted EBITDA should range between $880 million and $930 million, with an overall
corporate adjusted EBITDA margin of around 26%. In total, this is expected to result in an adjusted
diluted earnings per share between $4.80 and $5.10.

With lithium sales and catalysts HPC shipments weighted to the second half, we currently expect the
cadence of earnings to ramp up through the year. Due in part to the impact from the coronavirus on
global logistics on each of our businesses and lower lithium volumes while our customers make inventory
adjustments, the first half adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be 15% to 20% below the first half of 2019
and Q1 could be down as much as 20% to 25% year-over-year.

In closing, the actions we've taken give us confidence that as are heading into -- as we head into 2021,
we will deliver sustainable savings, actively report on our sustainability goals and support notable volume
growth in lithium and be positioned to achieve positive free cash flow.

And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Luke, I wanted to ask about the contracting approach. I guess, you characterized as a onetime concession
in 2020. Can you talk about maybe why you took that avenue as opposed to maybe just repricing every
year?

And then secondly, I think you talked about range, which would seem to suggest, again, a trend towards
hydroxide. But maybe there's been some more news about LFP and some other cathode types gaining
some momentum. Can you just talk about how you see that developing over the next couple of years?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I'll take the first one, and I'll turn it over to Eric to talk a little bit about the hydroxide versus
carbonate. And I'm assuming you're talking about the LRP (sic) [ LFP ] that they talked about with...

Unknown Executive

LFP

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

LFP -- I'm sorry, I'm thinking about a long-range plan here -- the LFP that Tesla announced with [ CATL ].

So I think that the idea on the contract is that -- there is a situation that is occurring today that we want
to address, but we believe that, that dynamic will change over the next 3 to 4 years. I mean it's a long-
term contract, so it doesn't make any sense for us to reset that contract for 5 or 6 years when we think
we've got a short-term disconnect here between supply and demand. So we thought it was in our best
interest to address the concerns that the customers had today, yet keep the overall structure of those
contracts where they are.

Now that's not to say long term we might not see modifications of our plan on the contracts. But this is
why you have a long-term contract. You set those prices. We've got a short-term issue. We address it
short term, and then it goes back to the way the contract was, and we have to renegotiate in 2021. We'd
do the same thing again.

So that's why, Bob, we took that approach as opposed to just set -- it doesn't do us any good to set the
price when the market is low. I mean that doesn't make any sense at all. So we were trying to preserve
the integrity of those agreements, while adjusting to the marketplace for the short time, for that short
window that we see that there's an issue.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric to talk a little bit about your question on LFP.

Eric W. Norris
President of Lithium Global Business Unit

So Bob, it's Eric here. With regard to LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, cathode, as you may know, the China
market has used that as a workhorse for a variety of applications for some years now, and that supply
chain is well developed in China. As you, I think, also know, we've talked about the development of high
nickel chemistries, which would shift from carbonate, which is used in iron phosphate predominantly to
hydroxide for high nickel. That tends to be a range-driven technology, get higher energy densities to

provide higher driving ranges. And that's a phenomenon that appears to be most prominent outside of
China with large, established global automotive OEMs and also Tesla.

What Tesla has announced recently is the adoption, it appears from the press releases, of working with
iron phosphate to provide a compromise of reduced range for a lower cost. That market we view being
a China market today. We still believe in the U.S. and in Europe and for that matter, other developed
countries like Japan, that range is an important consideration for the adoption rates we're seeing. But the
reason we've talked about the value we have as a player in both carbonate and hydroxide is that we can
play in both opportunities.

I think the Chinese subsidy changes or the reduction of subsidy changes has maybe strengthened the
movement to LFP because it helps -- it's not putting a -- it's not giving an incentive to move to higher
range. And I think the characteristics of the Chinese consumer support potentially a lower-range, lower-
cost vehicle. And that's the market that, I think, Tesla sees.

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. This is Luke. Just one other thing. If you go back and look to our Investor Day presentation we did
in December, we were still talking about carbonate production doubling between now and 2025, going
from about 195 to about 410 and hydroxide going from 70 to 525. So we still -- we believe carbonates is
going to continue to grow. We think there's going to be a higher growth in hydroxide. But we do have the
flexibility to go either way.

There seems to be some scraping on the phones. I'm not quite sure what that is. But operator, could you
check on that, please?

Operator

Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.

P.J. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

So the 1-year price concessions you're talking about in mid-teens, what happens after that? Do we go
back to the old price [indiscernible] from current levels? Just in terms -- and just in terms of timing, this
negotiation happened before the coronavirus hit? Or was it after?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

So the -- it's a 1-year amendment. So in 2021, it back to the original agreements. And if we have to
negotiate from there, in some instances we will, but you go back to the original agreement.

The discussions took place before and during the coronavirus.

Great. And just one quick question on bromine. You mentioned that you're seeing some -- there could be
some pricing impact in second half because of increased supply. Can you just sort of elaborate on that?

Luther C. Kissam

Yes. I'm going to let Netha handle that, please?

Netha N. Johnson
President of Bromine Specialties Global Business Unit

Yes. If you look at the import data, people who are importing bromine into China, you can see from the
data very clearly that there's more supply going into China than what we have last year. So we expect that

pricing.

Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Luke, I know you have at least one more quarterly call coming, but good luck with your treatments,
and thank you for your service. And could I ask, do you have any covenant issues if you don't get the
divestments off okay?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Scott?

Scott A. Tozier
Executive VP & CFO

No. We'll be okay. We're monitoring that carefully. But given our outlook and given even a lower risk or a
higher risk type of scenario with the coronavirus, we'll be okay.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then there's been a lot of news recently about stationary storage. Are we reaching an inflection
point where that could actually start to become material?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Eric?

Eric W. Norris
President of Lithium Global Business Unit

John, this is Eric. So I would reference the Investor Day presentation. We talked about the demand that's
there. It's still a small part of the demand picture. It's growing rapidly. That said, I see the same as you
see about the continued push towards these sorts of installations. So we're watching it closely, but we still
don't view that as being quite the mover for our strategy and driving the capacity growth that we see and
the volume contracts we have with our customers. It doesn't look -- it's still EVs that really drives that
equation for us.

Our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets.

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So for my 2 questions -- first one, thank you for the update on how coronavirus may be impacting your
business. When you set your guidance here for 2020, what did you assume were the impacts from
coronavirus in the first half year, second half year? I understand all the uncertainties here, especially
around OEMs and auto sales in China.

ALBEMARLE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Yes. So I think, Joe, that's the big point is that it is really difficult to know exactly how this is going to play
out. Every day, there's a new data point out there in terms of is it getting worse, is it getting better. China
is trying to get back to work, and how long that's going to take -- so it's -- it's difficult to know.

I think as you look at our first half, there's certainly a component of coronavirus that's built into that.
So particularly in the first quarter, with the expectation of EBITDA overall being down between 20% and
25%, part of that's coronavirus, part of that's inventory adjustments happening with -- within the lithium
business. So as we get out further in the year, we'll just -- we're just going to have to continue to adjust
and keep you updated.

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

But suffice it to say the way we're looking at coronavirus is it is a delay. It is causing the first half to be
weaker. We were already talking about a week of our first half to begin with. It's making it weaker, but
we're not projecting now for it to have an impact on full year.

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. So just my second question was -- first, going to be a follow-up. So then it sounds like what you're
saying, it's impacting first month of the year, and it sounds like you're expecting then to all come back to
the second half of the year.

And then my second question would be inventory situation right now for feedstock and for the chemicals.
How is it looking right now, both for Albermale and for the industry? And what are you seeing in terms of
closures or curtailments for some of the spodumene players some of the conversion plans in China?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, are you talking specifically about lithium or across our portfolio?

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I'm talking about for both Albemarle and what you see in the industry for both feedstock, spodumene and
also for the chemicals.

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

So to date, we have not seen any input on the raw materials for us. We've been able to secure the raw
materials that we need to run in the first quarter. As we referenced on our calls, we've had lower run
rates in China than we had anticipated for our lithium, but it hadn't been an issue to date of getting raw
materials in our other businesses.

We have seen some -- and if you listen to the calls, and I know you have, you've seen a number of
chemical industries, companies talking about the ability to get raw materials. But we're pretty well okay
for that from a raw material standpoint right now. We don't see there's issue from where we are and the
kind of time frames they're talking about on the coronavirus.

I do think one of the issues that we don't know about is as -- if you look at the automotive OEMs, some of
them are not running today. But some of the batteries are running today, both inside and outside of China.
So what remains to be seen is for the full year are the automotive OEMs going to run fast enough to soak
up the inventory levels in that lithium that we would expect over the year? Or is there going to be a ripple
effect later in the year, which would put our full year kind of some downward pressure on that?

We've got contracted volumes, so we don't expect it to be a significant risk. But that's one of the things
that we're going to really keep our eyes on is what is the real impact not only on our products, but on our
supply chains, and particularly in bromine and in lithium, as these and in product OEMs, either ramped up

13

ALBEMARLE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

or ramped down during the course of the year. That's the biggest unknown issue that we'll face, and we're
not -- we don't sell to the -- we're not a Tier 1 supplier, we're further back in the chain. So that causes a
ripple effect to be even more.

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

What do you think of the inventories for spodumene, carbonate and hydroxide right now in the industry?

Eric W. Norris
President of Lithium Global Business Unit

Overall -- Joe, it's Eric. Overall, we would say that we're about 6 months inventory across the supply
chain. And so as you look at that, it's probably closer to 4 months for refined lithium, and the additional
couple of months is excess spodumene. The excess spodumene that's in inventory now, a great deal
of it is not economic at current prices, meaning it's not at 6%. It's not of the grade to be able to cost
effectively be converted at current spot prices. So it's -- that is what we'll watch very carefully this year,
right? We expect demand growth of 50,000 tons. So it's going to be an overhang for the year.

Supply growth, as you referenced in your question, it's already been curtailed. We see very little supply
growth year-over-year. It's going to be stocks, and the drawdown of the stocks will be important to the
stabilization. And we'll look for that over the next 12 months and give you updates as what that we think
that means for pricing later in the year as we approach 2021.

Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Luke, you mentioned that one customer had not agreed to the, I guess, down 15% in lithium. How large is
that customer? And what's the expectation for those negotiations?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

So Dave, you know the answer to that question. I'm not going to get into a conversation about a specific
customer. Our expectation, obviously, is we're going to meet and find a resolution that meets that
customer needs and meets our expectations. And if not, our position is we've got a validly enforceable
contract.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Understood. And on the -- nonbattery-grade -- technical-grade lithium, what's your expectations for
pricing in 2020 versus 2019?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

For technical-grade lithium?

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Correct.

ALBEMARLE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Yes. So if you look at both carbonate and -- as I said on the call, the technical-grade carbonate will be
down more than mid-teens average that we talked about as I said in our prepared remarks. It is down
more than that.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Actually, I meant the nonbattery-grade lithium.

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Oh, my apologies. I'll turn it over to Eric.

Eric W. Norris
President of Lithium Global Business Unit

Yes. I think Luke said it, but let me summarize it. So as Luke said, on the battery-grade side, carbonate is
probably down a little more than hydroxide. And on the technical-grade side, all technical-grade products
are down a bit more than battery-grade. And so in specialties, mixed, very mixed. It's not as price-
sensitive an area, although there are -- the input lithium -- is input lithium materials in that business, and
that does have a mild effect on price. So that would be the least affected.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

James Michael Sheehan
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

In Catalysts, your outlook for flattish earnings in 2020, can you describe what impact IMO 2020 regulation
is having? And what is the underlying growth you're seeing in that business, excluding the IMO 2020? And
also, what is your outlook for FCC pricing in 2020?

Raphael Goszcz Crawford
President of Catalysts Global Business Unit

Jim, this is Raphael. So to give you a view, I mean, the -- as Scott and Luke have indicated, we're
expecting a fairly strong year on FCC catalyst and a slightly weaker year on HPC catalyst. The reason
for that, as explained in Investor Day, is that HPC catalyst is about changeouts. And the changeouts
happen to be smaller in 2020 for distillates than they were in 2019, and that's an area of strength for our
business.

Now overall, the industry will see IMO 2020 as a tailwind. For our business, higher diesel production to
blend to be able to meet the sulfur specs is favorable. It might not be as favorable as it is for others
because our business is weighted more towards distillates than it is towards resid. And resid is the area
that will benefit the most from IMO 2020.

Again, it will be positive, perhaps not as positive as it could be for others, but we have a very strong
business in distillates and in specialty catalysts for hydroprocessing, and the trends in the industry are
favorable overall for the long-term in that business.

As you -- it's a little bit too early on FCC pricing. We did have positive pricing in 2019. It's too early to say
in 2020. Crack spreads are a little narrower than they have been, so that could have an impact. But our
business is about value creation for our customers, we continue to do that. And where we can get value
pricing for that value creation, we will.

And on the $50 million in cost savings for 2020, could you just discuss how those savings will be realized
by segment?

Scott A. Tozier
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Jim, this is Scott. So as you look at just kind of the split out, roughly, you're going to get about 2/3 of
that savings in the Lithium business, about 10% in Catalysts and bromine, and the remainder is going to
be in the corporate functions, is how it will play out in 2020.

Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You said that you thought that global lithium demand would grow about 50,000 tons in 2020. How fast do
you think it grew in 2019? And wouldn't 50,000 tons imply about 1 million incremental electric vehicles for
2020? Or how big is the component tied to electric vehicles? And how do you calculate it?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Eric?

Eric W. Norris
President of Lithium Global Business Unit

Jeff, this is Eric. So yes, the growth of 50,000 tons was a similar growth rate last year. The issue last year
was we had a lot of excess supply and a lot of excess inventory. So a lot of our customers didn't buy. They
didn't actually buy that -- or a lot of people in the market didn't buy that volume. They actually drew down
their inventories instead. But their real consumption was in that same order of magnitude.

For us, looking forward then, yes, it does imply a growth and -- a significant growth in electric vehicles.
Our view on 2019 was that it was -- production was about 2.6 million electric vehicles. And we're looking
for that number to be close -- go up to 3.5 million to 4 million. So it's over 1 million electric vehicles in
growth. Most of that's going to be driven out of the European producers -- automotive producers.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then in your financials, your equity income in the lithium business dropped sequentially from
maybe roughly $30 million to $15 million. What's going on at Talison, such that the equity income is
dropping so sharply? And how do you see that for 2020?

Scott A. Tozier
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Jeff, I think you're referring to the fourth quarter.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes.

Scott A. Tozier
Executive VP & CFO

And the equity income for Talison and in the lithium business is largely driven by the volume that's
being taken by both Tianqi or Albemarle out of that joint venture. And so we did see reduced shipments,

primarily going to Tianqi, in the fourth quarter. Expecting that it will be roughly flat as we go into --
roughly flat to slightly down as we go into 2020, overall.

Flat to down from the fourth quarter? Or year-over-year versus the previous year?

Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

I was wondering, on Slide 7, the assessed box there. Can you give us an update on the opportunities that
you're seeing to acquire lithium conversion assets as opposed to building additional conversion capacity,
maybe how you're thinking about that buy-versus-build strategy to date versus how you might have been
looking at it a few quarters ago?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. It's the -- from a matter of pricing, I think the reduced price that we've seen of carbonate in the
marketplace and the inability to get some of the spodumene rock as a raw material supply has brought
some prices down to a level that, it appears to us, you could have a lower capital base. And if you build
your own, then you'd be in the market a whole lot sooner.

So for us, it all comes down to is there a price at which -- when you look at our all-in cost of acquiring,
modifying where necessary to meet HSE standpoints and converting for me to, call it, hydroxide or what
have you, what's that return on capital, how will we lay that out versus what's the return on capital and
the timing for building. It's a mathematical equation for us, and you got to negotiate it and be able to
close it as well. So that's how we're looking at it. And there are opportunities out there. Because of our
tolling relationships, we're familiar with many, so we are in active evaluations.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

All right. And then in terms of lithium customer mix, you mentioned that, that was a negative in the fourth
quarter. Can you talk about how that plays out during 2020? Is that something -- is mix something that
maybe improves as we get later in the year, maybe we'd get some additional hydroxide demand growth?

Eric W. Norris
President of Lithium Global Business Unit

Well -- Michael, this -- it's Eric. I would say it's -- we have -- 2019 was -- had a lot of moving parts to it.
In 2020, we're going to have an equal amount of growth in production out of La Negra and out of Xinyu
for hydroxide, and at the same time, a big reduction in toll volumes we sell into the marketplace.

As Luke said and Scott said, we've contracted out 9% of our business. We endeavor each year to try to
keep the mix fairly constant. So we don't have swings from period-to-period. The simple fact of the matter
is, is that we tend to produce a lot more carbonate at the end of the year than the beginning, so there's
sometimes some product mix factors and some customer mix factors. I don't know -- it will probably be
similar throughout the year, but it's -- again, we try to manage it so it doesn't cause these swings as best
we can, but I think it will be fairly similar.

ALBEMARLE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.

Colin William Rusch
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Can you talk about what's going on with your customers in terms of potential consolidation? And how
do you think about that, not just in 2020, but as you move into 2021, 2022 or some of the production
schedules that you're getting from the OEMs?

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. If you're looking at -- you're talking, I'm assuming, about lithium and the battery producers. What
we've said is that we've seen the decisions moving from the cathode producers to the battery producers,
and then in some instance, all the way to the OEM. So we've seen those big battery producers making
the purchasing decisions and the volume decisions and then allocating some of that volume for in-house
production and then some of it to be directed towards certain of the cathode producers. So we are seeing
that. That will, in effect, consolidate the decision-makers about these purchasing decisions and who you're
contracting with down to a lower number.

I think long term, as you look across the spectrum, you're going to see a consolidation even further
of battery producers. You're going to have -- the Koreans and Chinese and the Japanese are going to
consolidate into the bigger producers. That's the typical of what you've seen in other industries, and I
don't think this is going to be any different.

Colin William Rusch
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then we're seeing OEMs with various challenges in terms of getting into production and ramping
up production on EVs as it's a different manufacturing process. Can you talk a little bit about the CapEx
plans and your ability to modulate the spend this year and early next year as you see those schedules
adjust? Because obviously, there's a fair amount of variability there.

Luther C. Kissam
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I think on carbonate -- if you look at carbonate, we've got La Negra III and IV. That's going
to come online in -- by the first quarter of 2021, and it will be commissioned. Most of that spending is
already done, so it's kind of hard to do anything there. On La Negra -- I'm sorry, on -- further at La Negra,
we have the ability, we have the plans where, if necessary, we could expand that. But it would be kind of a
2- to 3-year process at La Negra for our carbonate plant.

If you're looking at a hydroxide, from a Kemerton standpoint, we believe we're on track for the second half
of 2021 for a start-up. It will be difficult to rattle that back much because of the cost we've got in there.
And anything else we build is going to be a lower capital intensity, so that's why we're looking at a build
versus buy in an area like China. You could probably get it done in China in -- from start to finish in about
2 years.

We have teams in our engineering, working right now on taking the plans and the designs that we have
and building a lower capital intensity and a lower operating cost, looking at what our opportunities are
there, so that the next asset that we build from a hydroxide conversion standpoint, we will build more
efficiently, more cost effectively and operate it with lower cost than the ones we have today.

We've got to continually drive that down.

In addition to that, I know that you can take, as you know, take carbonate and convert it to lithium
hydroxide. We also have teams looking at what is the most cost-effective way. If the market goes that
way, what is the most cost-effective way? Would we build that in -- close to our carbonate facilities? Would
we convert that -- convert the carbonate somewhere else? What is the best way to do that? And the idea

of modularizing that is a concept that we're looking at. But we need to be prepared to pull the trigger on
that if and when the market calls for that.

Again, that would take you -- probably, if you're building it in China, it's probably 50% of the capital and
probably a year off the timing to get it built, to get it permitted and get it up and running.
