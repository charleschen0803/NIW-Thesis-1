[Operator Instructions]

Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. 2019 solidified the pivot from growth to capital discipline in
North America and marked another step on the road to recovery in the international markets. I'm pleased
with the way the Halliburton team executed our value proposition, delivered exceptional safety and service
quality and stayed focused on generating healthy returns and strong free cash flow.

I thank our outstanding Halliburton employees for their hard work and execution in the entire year.

2020 opens a new decade and a new century for Halliburton. It brings new opportunities that I will
address in a few minutes. But first, some headlines for the full year and fourth quarter of 2019. We
finished 2019 with total company revenue of $22 billion and adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion.

I am pleased with the continued recovery in our international business. We increased revenue 10%,
outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row. North America revenue declined 18%
as a result of customer activity and pricing reductions and our decision to focus on those customers that
provide the best returns. Systematically improving our service delivery immediate cost reductions and the
growth in non-frac product lines allowed us to stem the margin erosion.

We delivered over $900 million of free cash flow for the full year, demonstrating our ability to generate
consistent free cash flow throughout different business environments.

Finally, 2019 was an exceptional year for our safety and service quality performance. Our total recordable
incident rate and nonproductive time, both improved by over 20%, historical bests across our business.
This is a result of our employees' continued commitment to safety and process execution.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

And now a few points about the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of
$5.2 billion, a 6% sequential decrease and adjusted operating income of $546 million, an increase of 2%
quarter-over-quarter.

Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 13% sequentially, and operating margin
remained essentially flat. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter. We grew revenue
4% and improved operating margin 300 basis points sequentially. D&E international margins grew
significantly, offset by margin decline in North America.

While our North America business declined due to the significantly lower activity in U.S. land,
internationally, we delivered 10% revenue growth this quarter. This underscores the versatility and global
reach of our business.

In the fourth quarter, we took a $2.2 billion largely noncash impairment charge and made strategic
decisions to market for sale our pipeline services and well-controlled product lines.

As I mentioned, 2020 brings plenty of opportunities. The oil price is more constructive as we enter the
year. The imminent global recession fears have abated with the help of economic easing from the leading
central banks.

U.S. production growth is slowing because of constricted capital flows. The increase in non-U.S. non-OPEC
supply coming into the market is limited. The geopolitical instability in the key oil-producing region of the
world should add an incremental risk premium to the commodity prices in the near term. That said, oil
prices are still supported by the OPEC+ cuts and will fluctuate based on the group's resolved to continue
limiting production.

Gas prices in the U.S. are below breakeven levels. U.S. Drilling and Completions activity may be biased
lower due to the consolidation and restricted access to capital.

Halliburton is no stranger to navigating choppy waters. We entered 2020 and our next century with a clear
sense of purpose. We will continue to do what we do best. Collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize
our customers' asset value, while generating industry-leading returns and sustainable cash flow for our
shareholders. We will do this with attention to the sustainability of our business, minimizing environmental
impacts and acting as a responsible corporate citizen.

The international markets presented plenty of growth opportunities in 2019. We grew revenue 10% year-
over-year, closing stronger than anticipated.

All regions increased revenue, led by Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe. Both our divisions
meaningfully contributed to the international growth. Completion and Production led the charge with 13%
expansion due to higher activity in mature fields in Europe and unconventionals in Argentina, the UAE and
Australia.

Drilling and Evaluation grew international revenues 8% as we increased activity levels in all markets,
specifically in Norway, Mexico, China and Nigeria.

In 2020, we expect the international spend by our customers to increase by mid-single digits, making it
the third consecutive year of spending growth.

We have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete and win across the
international markets. We expect to grow at or above the market rate this year consistently focusing on
profitable growth and improving our international margins. Continued gas activity expansion in the Middle
East, resolution of political issues in Latin America and several pending project awards may enable us to
outgrow the market again in 2020.

Our Drilling and Evaluation division is poised to grow faster as we get the benefit of the full year in our
Norway-integrated contracts, the iCruise directional drilling platform rollout continues and new offshore
drilling activity starts up around the world.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

The international revenue growth should follow the historical cyclicality. In the first quarter, we expect
international revenue to decline due to normal seasonality and the elimination of year-end sales.
Thereafter, we should see steady growth that would peak in the fourth quarter. This year, we expect to
increase our international margins. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy
markets like the North Sea and Asia Pacific.

Our project pipeline is strong. The incremental activity will help tighten tool availability and absorb
the existing cost structure. We intend to be prudent with capital allocation, driving our organization to
have the right pricing discussions with customers. Given the tool tightness in some product lines and
geographies, we are strategically reallocating assets to the best-returning opportunities.

Pricing in certain international regions is improving, and we expect this momentum to continue throughout
2020. About 1/3 of our book of business is awarded every year. The remaining 2/3 are existing contracts
and contract extensions. We are gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, and we are
making strategic choices about the work we pursue.

I believe the capital and pricing discipline across all geographies will allow Halliburton to deliver rational
returns-driven growth in the international markets.

Turning to North America. The U.S. shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn, with
both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production.

As expected in the fourth quarter, customer activity declined across all basins in North America land,
affecting both our drilling and completions businesses. The rig count in U.S. land contracted 11%
sequentially and completed stages had the largest drop we have seen in recent history.

While holidays and weather were the usual factors, other reasons for this air pocket inactivity included our
customers' free cash flow generation commitments and an oversupplied gas market. With this backdrop,
Halliburton followed our playbook and continue to proactively manage our fleet count.

As announced last quarter, we also proactively cut costs and started the implementation of the strategy
to sustainably improve our service delivery. Those actions allowed us to curb margin declines in North
America and deliver lower decrementals year-on-year, even though the industry sequential activity drop
was much more severe than in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In the fourth quarter, the market saw clear public evidence of the long-awaited equipment attrition. This
is just the beginning. We believe a lot more equipment will exit the market as lower demand, increasing
service intensity and insufficient returns take their toll.

As service companies cannibalize idle equipment for parts and use sideline pumps to beef up working
fleets, the available horsepower supply in the market may be smaller than something.

Halliburton has continued doing what we said we were doing, stacking equipment to improve our returns.
We exited 2019 with 22% less available fracturing horsepower. We have rationalized our equipment supply
to the anticipated level of demand in 2020. The size and scale of our business in North America give us the
ability to rightsize without sacrificing our market leadership position and the value that comes with it.

In the fourth quarter, we started the implementation of our $300 million annualized cost savings and
service delivery improvement strategy. We moved quickly to execute the initial personnel reductions and
real estate rationalization, all with an eye to improving on our near-term financial performance.

We've achieved about $200 million in savings on a run rate basis in the fourth quarter. While this impacts
our business globally, the majority of the savings are geared towards North America. We are looking at
2020 with pragmatism. Early indications are that our U.S. land customers will reduce capital spending
approximately 10% from 2019 levels.

I believe that the current level of DUCs in the market will allow operators to spend less money on new well
construction and direct more of it to completions.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

Depressed gas pricing is negatively affecting the activity outlook in the gassy basins, which will likely bear
the brunt of the activity reductions in 2020.

In the first quarter, operators will reload their budgets, and we expect modest improvement in completions
activity as a result. That said, the calendar cadence where some operators are biased to spend more
earlier in the year will likely remain.

Halliburton will continue to be proactive in taking actions to generate industry-leading returns and strong
free cash flow in this environment.

Here are the more significant actions. After systematically rationalizing equipment in 2019 to adjust to
changing activity levels, in 2020, we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall
fleet. This should also allow us to be efficient about our workforce and maintenance planning and to
achieve higher utilization of existing fleets throughout the year. Pricing pressure was considerable during
the year-end tendering season.

Consistent with our capital disciplined approach, we've taken on contracts that are expected to allow our
portfolio to earn acceptable returns and decline those that are not.

I like the slice of the market that we're choosing to participate in this year. Our high-graded customer
portfolio gives us confidence in a more sustainable demand level and a mix of pricing and volume that
generates returns for Halliburton.

Make no mistake, we will continue developing technologies whose value accrues to Halliburton and not
just to our customers. Our integrated completions offering and the iCruise rotary steerable system are
prime examples of such technologies. They should allow us to reduce our capital outlay and deliver better
margins, all with the purpose of generating strong returns.

We plan to continue strategically growing our share of services per well by increasing the competitiveness
of our nonhydraulic fracturing businesses in North America.

Our Wireline and Perforating, Artificial Lift and specialty chemical product lines all posted strong double-
digit revenue growth in 2019, despite the overall market softness in U.S. land. We intend to keep this
momentum and spread it to other services.

Finally, we will continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy. Halliburton is
redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services in order to lower our unit cost and improve margins
and returns in the long run.

2019 closed a decade of the shale revolution that transformed the United States into the world's top
hydrocarbon producer. Halliburton was an early participant in this development and has been investing
in it and innovating ever since, hand-in-hand with our customers. As unconventionals enter maturation
phase, Halliburton is committed to the North American market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in
the new environment.

I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then I will return to
discuss digitalization, a topic that will define the next decade for our industry. Lance?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to
the third quarter of 2019. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion, a decrease of 6%, and
adjusted operating income was $546 million, an increase of 2%.

During the fourth quarter, we recognized $2.2 billion of pretax impairments and other charges to further
adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted largely of noncash asset
impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment. They also included
approximately $100 million of cash costs primarily related to severance. As a result of the charge, in the

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

fourth quarter, we recognized the benefit of approximately $35 million from a reduction in depreciation
and amortization expense, which reflects 2 months of DD&A impact.

The after-tax impact of this reduction in the fourth quarter is approximately $0.03 of EPS, of which
$0.02 is included in our completion and production results and the remainder in drilling and evaluation
numbers. As Jeff mentioned, we have also accomplished a significant portion of our intended annualized
cost reductions with the remainder to come in the first quarter.

Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production
division, revenue was $3.1 billion, while operating income was $387 million, both decreased 13%.

Reduced activity and pricing in multiple product service lines, primarily associated with stimulation
services in North America land, coupled with lower activity for stimulation services in Latin America and
well intervention services in the Middle East drove our results. These declines were partially offset by
higher pressure pumping activity in the Eastern Hemisphere, coupled with year-end Completion Tool sales
globally.

In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4%, while operating
income was $224 million, an increase of 49%. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in
all product service lines in the Middle East/Asia, coupled with higher drilling activity in Europe/Africa/CIS
and year-end software sales globally.

These improvements were partially offset by lower drilling activity in North America and reduced testing
activity in Latin America.

Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $2.3 billion, a 21% decrease. This
decline was mainly due to lower activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with
pressure pumping and well construction. This decline was partially offset by higher year-end Completion
Tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico.

In Latin America, revenue was $598 million, a 2% decrease, resulting primarily from lower activity in
multiple product service lines in Argentina, coupled with decreased testing activity across the region.
These results were partially offset by higher activity for all product service lines in Colombia, increased
project management activity and cloud infrastructure installations in Mexico, and higher year-end
Completion Tool sales across the region.

Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue was $883 million, a 6% increase, resulting primarily from increased
well construction activity in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in multiple product service lines
in Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower pipeline services across the region.

In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.4 billion, a 19% increase sequentially, largely resulting from
increased activity in multiple product service lines across the Middle East, India and China, higher pressure
pumping activity in Australasia and higher year-end Completion Tool sales across the region. These results
were partially offset by lower well intervention services in the Middle East.

In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million, and we expect it to be the
same in the first quarter of 2020.

Net interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and should remain approximately the same for the
first quarter.

Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 22%. Based on the market environment
and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2020 first quarter effective tax rate to be
approximately 21%, with a projected full year tax rate of approximately 23%.

We earned approximately $1.2 billion of cash from operations during the fourth quarter. As expected, we
improved our working capital and generated strong free cash flow of approximately $827 million for the
quarter, delivering approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year, excluding the cash impact of
the restructuring charges I discussed earlier.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

As a result, we ended the year with $2.3 billion in cash. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $340
million with our 2019 full year CapEx ending just above $1.5 billion.

As we look ahead to this year, we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by approximately 20% to $1.2
billion. We believe this level of spend will still allow us to invest in our anticipated international growth
while continuing to rationalize our business to the current market conditions in North America.

Within this reduced CapEx budget, we will continue investing in and growing our production group
businesses, namely, constructing a chemical manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia and expanding our
Artificial Lift footprint.

We will also move forward with the iCruise system global rollout but at a more normalized pace than what
we accomplished over the last couple of years.

Our digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating
costs will also get an appropriate share of spend.

We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for
our investors regardless of the market environment.

Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical,
our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end sales, which will
mostly impact our international business.

North America will see a modest increase in completions activity as Jeff described earlier. We will continue
to pull the levers that allow us to mitigate margin declines across the business this quarter. As such, in our
Completion and Production division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4%, with margins
declining 125 to 150 basis points.

For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue will decline 4% to 6%, with
margins decreasing 200 to 250 basis points.

I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Thanks, Lance. One of the key trends that will define the new decade in our industry is digitalization.
The next 10 years will see digital technologies and artificial intelligence going mainstream, just like the
smartphones did in the last decade.

In the oil and gas industry, digitalization unlocks the potential to structurally lower costs, shorten the time
to first oil, increase optionality and exploration and production and enhance performance across the entire
value chain.

Digital is not a separate strategy at Halliburton, rather, it is an integral part of our value proposition. Our
ability to collaborate, engineer solutions and maximize customers' asset value is evolving through the
seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations.

Digital permeates everything we do and has the same goal as our business strategy, deliver value for our
customers and returns for our shareholders.

At Halliburton, we are hard at work on the next frontier solutions that will shift the balance in the people,
process, technology triad by replacing labor and reducing capital investments through automation and
self-learning processes. We believe this will allow us to harness the transformative power of digitalization
and make a quantum leap in productivity, similar to going from horses to horsepower.

It takes time to build the scalable software and hardware infrastructure required to fully capitalize on
digital solutions. We are well along that path and have been building up our digital capabilities for a
number of years with a long-term view of how digitalization will evolve.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

I'm pleased with the internal and customer adoption we're seeing. Halliburton is in a unique position to
reap the benefits of the industry's move towards digitalization.

Our landmark product line is an established leader in petrotechnical software with a powerful cloud-
enabled DecisionSpace 365 software platform.

In 2019, and the cloud-native software was our fastest-growing business within Landmark, increasing
revenues 50% year-over-year. Landmark provides us a solid foundation, established through decades
of investment in software development, people, domain expertise and processes to create and scale
digital solutions. This benefits all of our product lines. In addition, we have strategic partnerships with
Accenture, Microsoft, AWS and Schneider Electric, all of which validate and expand both our vision and our
capabilities.

We now have over 100 customers with thousands of users across the globe, leveraging our iEnergy
digital ecosystem to integrate software and workflows across their organizations, regardless if they're
Halliburton's, third party or internally developed.

This open-architecture platform is unique in the industry and, in our view, is a necessary condition for the
successful adoption and scaling of digital solutions.

True to our DNA, we are also bringing to market practical, smart and interconnected products and services
that help unlock value for us and our customers.

We are pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding, well construction and reservoir recovery.

Let me spend a few minutes on each. First, we transformed subsurface understanding using big data,
digital frameworks and evergreen models. We have created a unique geological model of the entire earth
to provide insights into the origin and productivity of reservoirs.

Once drilling starts, we deliver improved field measurements with next-generation wireline and Logging-
While-Drilling tools, fiber and sensors. We then translate these measurements into faster, more informed
decision-making using a new class of models made possible by digital technologies. For example, our
EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity sensor automatically feeds into our industry-first scalable earth model that
updates in real time. Customers can now make faster decisions about their development programs and
reduce cycle times by a factor of 10.

Second, we improved well construction through collaborative well engineering and drilling automation.
Landmark's digital well program enables seamless collaboration between operators and service companies
across a multitude of software platforms. The iCruise drilling system increases the number of built-in
sensors by a factor of 5 and offers self-guiding capabilities.

Working with our rig partners, our digital twin technology delivers better collaboration and faster decision-
making. All of these solutions boost efficiencies and lower costs, while demanning the process of well
construction.

Last but not least, we improved recovery in production by using our digitally enabled tools to connect
customers' assets and leveraging this to monitor and enhance performance outcomes.

In Completions, we use our intelligent completions for monitoring production trends and connecting them
to broader reservoir management studies.

In Artificial Lift, we leverage digital to monitor ESP health and extend run life.

In stimulation, we use our industry-leading fracture modeling software and full-scale asset simulator to
model fracture propagation and frac hits. These are examples of how we deliver digital innovation today
with a focus on specific domains and aligned with the customers' buying behavior. They provide immediate
value to customers, increase customer loyalty and generate returns for Halliburton.

Over time, we believe digitalization will seamlessly connect subsurface, drilling and production, enabling
customers to make asset-level decisions at the speed of execution.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

We have a solid foundation, the tools, the open architecture and the domain expertise to successfully
deliver this vision.

Let me summarize what we've talked about today. In 2020, Halliburton is focused on delivering margin
expansion, industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow.

In our view, international growth will continue. Increased activity, disciplined capital allocation, pricing
improvements and our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services, we believe, will lead
to international margin expansion in 2020.

As North America customer spending declines again this year, Halliburton will continue to execute
our playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. We plan to provide the service capacity that we
believe will maximize the returns on our overall fleet, continue to invest in technologies that improve
margins, keep strategically growing our nonhydraulic fracturing product service lines and continue the
implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy.

We believe digitalization will define this decade in our industry. Halliburton continues to move full steam
ahead on digital journey and is uniquely positioned to reap its benefits.
And now let's open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.

James Carlyle West
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So Jeff, towards the end of your prepared comments, we talked a lot about international and international
margin progression. I wonder if we could dig into a little more detail there with mid-single digits, it sounds
like growth would -- you may be able to outpace that touch here as well, plus you're seeing some pockets
of pricing strength. How should we think about the margin expansion as we go through the year, what
type of incremental should we be expecting?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, thanks, James. Look, I think I spent a fair amount of time on the catalysts themselves,
obviously activity improving, rational project choices and technologies. I think the key is it's going to
be shaped -- we're starting at a higher point going into Q1 than we certainly did last year. And I would
expect the shape of that to look similar, where we start, and it moves up a little, it's that shape of the
international margins should stay consistent, but obviously starting from a higher point.

James Carlyle West
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe for Lance here on the free cash flow next year. Looks like it's
going to be pretty significant based on some growth but also lower CapEx here. How should we think
about when we're going to see the free cash flow start to show up, will it be similar to this year or it
should be back-end loaded? Or would it be more even throughout the year?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Look, I think you're right in terms of the expectations to grow free cash flow this year. You're right
around the -- I don't think that the -- our ability to drive sort of the working capital consumption is going
to remain in the first half of the year like it has historically for us. I expect some of the extreme volatility
that we saw last year to not repeat this year, but there still is a consumption of cash from a working
capital perspective. But overall, with the reduction in Capex, the improvement around margins and some
stability around our working capital, we expect free cash flow to grow in 2020.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.

Sean Christopher Meakim
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So you touched on the margin progression internationally. Can you maybe just talk about how that
translates into D&E in 2020? So we had the margin ramp in 4Q, maybe 70 basis points or so comes from
the D&E benefit that will help you year-on-year in '20. But can we see 2020 margins on a full year basis
get back to 2017, 2018 levels? Do we think we can get back to a double-digit type of outcome for the
year. Just -- I'm just curious how you think investors will get comfortable with a trajectory like that, just
given it's been a difficult business to forecast the last couple of years?

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

Yes. Sean, it has been difficult to forecast, but we've done a lot of things during that time. So the
platform around our iCruise technology and EarthStar has been rolling out at the same time. We've seen
international, a lot of international choppiness. Now we see some recovery, sort of, happening, which
obviously lends itself towards D&E. And so I think these are multiyear efforts that we view -- and we view
them that way, I'd say digital as well will contribute to probably early days to D&E. So for all of those
reasons, I don't think it's unreasonable at all to expect that we get back to 2018 looking kind of number or
beyond.

Sean Christopher Meakim
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then just -- so on the digital strategy, you have a competitor that's made a lot more
noise about their strategy maybe than you have so far. But the [indiscernible] and Repsol contracts sound
pretty similar in terms of the offering. Can you maybe just expand a little bit in terms of the scalability
that you see for those types of avenues, maybe like across a broader set of customers and where you see
the most opportunity?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I think I tried to describe today our vision around digital and then the mechanics for realizing that
vision, which then quickly becomes, in today's market, what are the things we actually do. So I used an
example of some of the tools that are in the market as we integrate those. Obviously, the moat expands
around those. And so I think it will take many forms over time. Again, it will be big projects, which we've
talked about. A few of those, where it's either cloud infrastructure and the cloud environment that we
either install or operate, and we've got examples of each of those.

But equally important will be the day in, day out march around how this work really gets done, which
is around drilling, production and reservoir filling in those spaces with tools that all contribute to that
vision. And so I think that there's a lot of scalability here. And I think what's most important is really the
production capital that Halliburton has invested in Landmark that really makes it scalable.

In fact, to do these things at scale, there's a lot of discipline and practice and agile DevOps that are
required at scale to reliably develop software and then operate, maintain and then ultimately, continue to
advance, so -- and we have that. So I'm really confident in how that rolls out over the longer term. And
I think the thing to focus on is what are those tools that we're doing now that deliver returns, obviously
they contribute to the vision.

Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs.

Angeline Marie Sedita
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

So Jeff, on C&P specific to North America, can you talk a little bit about the cost-cutting that's unwinding
here? You said you have $100 million left. Is there more that could be done beyond that $100 million, it's
for Jeff or Lance? And then if you could talk also about the pricing, have you seen the market starting to
stabilize on the frac side for pricing? Are you still seeing pressure in frac and across other product lines?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Angie. Look, the $300 million in savings, and we've moved quickly on that. And I think the
$200 million that we've taken out on an annualized basis already, expect to get the rest of that done in
Q1. And I think that really speaks to how that team in North America executes, and we execute very
quickly and with a lot of purpose and so obviously that contributes.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

Beyond that, we've talked about our playbook and how we expect to execute our strategy in North
America. And I think over time, that continues to drive improvement in margins, less concentrated in a
moment, but obviously a set of activities that yield value over time.

From a pricing standpoint, it's still very -- that's competitive information. Obviously, Q4 was quite
competitive. And so I think the market, in spite of attrition, is still oversupplied. What's important, though,
is that we make our own choices around how to maximize fleet profitability. And by virtue of doing that, I
view it as more stable in that respect.

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Angie, I might add a comment too on the $300 million in cost savings, just to be clear too to add to Jeff,
that's sort of cash structural savings.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes.

Angeline Marie Sedita
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then maybe staying along the themes on pricing, it's obviously the reverse
internationally. Maybe you could talk a little bit or give more color on the pricing power or momentum
you're seeing in the international markets, is it fairly widespread? Is it by specific regions or product lines?
And do you think there could be a little bit of momentum going into 2020 or is it slow and steady?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Look, I'd more describe it as slow and steady, Angie. I mean, I think, what the key is that the setup is
constructed. And so managing capital in a more prudent way, focusing on profitable growth as opposed to
growth, all of those things conspire to create an environment where we're able to get better pricing.

Is it widespread? I'd say it's generally widespread, but there's probably pockets who are more
concentrated than others, sometimes driven by availability and complexity of work and things that would
normally and rationally drive higher pricing.

And so I think that's what we're seeing in the market. And yes, it is getting traction.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons.

William Andrew Herbert
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Lance, you talked about it conceptually, but I'd like to kind of refine it, if you will, with regard to the
discussion of the evolution of working capital for this year, less pronounced seasonal trends. You were a
huge consumer cash, working capital was in the first half of 2019 and a nice contributor to cash in the
second half?

I'm trying to kind of peg the order of magnitude of the reduction in cash consumption during the first half
of this year versus the first half of last year.

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think what you see, Bill, is sort of a year-over-year comparison as we don't have -- I mean last year,
we were carrying a lot of inventory associated with the boost in the iCruise rollout and in some of our CMP

14

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

product lines, but I don't think that you see that consumption taking place again this year as we consume
more of that inventory as opposed to build it.

The collection cycle is still going to be very similar, albeit, as the international business becomes a bigger
part of our business that typically has longer DSOs, so we may see some impact there. But still a view
where we build receivables early in the year and then unwind those as we get into the later part of the
year.

William Andrew Herbert
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Okay. And so just to take a stab at it, would you expect that your cash consumption from working capital
in the first half of this year, would it run at like half of what it did in 2019? I mean is that a reasonable
starting point?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

I think that's probably a reasonable starting point.

William Andrew Herbert
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Okay. And then secondly, again, a lot of moving parts, but a kind of a 20% reduction in CapEx, you should
have better working capital improvement for this year. Net income should be up as well. So at least on my
numbers, I'm getting to kind of a free cash flow yield, assuming a $24 stock price, of kind of 7% to 8%,
which is getting pretty sporty. And I'm just curious with regard to the priorities of the deployment of that
surplus cash flow? Is it still a reduction of net debt, first and foremost?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think it is. I think with the excess cash, I think we do have a near-term priority on reducing debt.
The reality is, Bill, as -- while we're focused on that debt reduction in the near term, what it does and
what it offers us as we continue to chip away at it, is give us more flexibility to return cash to shareholders
in the future. And I think today, our business, we need to address the $3.8 billion of debt that we have
coming due over the next 6 years. So I think we'll do that, do some of that in the near term but also with
an eye on ultimately returning cash to shareholders.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Kind of staying on a similar line of questioning, Lance, you mentioned the $1.2 billion of CapEx in 2020,
which is good to see. Can you just provide some color on how you think about the sustainability of CapEx
around that level? There's a few moving pieces year-on-year in '20, and there'll be a few more in '21, in
particular, with the Saudi chem supplying investment not recurring.

But just how should we think about kind of broad strokes on that level of Capex, and feel free to frame it
as a percent of sales if it's easy?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Scott, this is Jeff. The -- I think the key is around prioritization, and we are focused on the best-
returning opportunities. But we were able to fund international growth in 2019 and expect with that level
of CapEx can continue to fund the growth that we see in 2020. So it isn't that we are starving anything.
The reality is we're feeding things appropriately and around our return expectations.

15

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

We think about spending this year, it's probably 2/3 international, 1/3 U.S. But in our view, very
sustainable, and so we're comfortable with that level of CapEx and also what it means to making better
returns.

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would add. In an environment, an increasing pricing environment that generates the appropriate
returns, we may spend more, but it will be commensurate with the focus on returns and overall driving
better free cash flow.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Got it. And then just a question circling back on the domestic frac market. With pricing, hopefully
stabilizing here in early 2020. And Jeff, you had mentioned a focus on maximizing returns on the frac
fleet. But broad strokes, does that strategy likely mean that your frac business trends with the market in
2020 or they had lagged the market to a degree in 2020 as we focus on returns? How should we think
about it?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I think that it will -- I would expect we stay consistent with the market, but we don't feel like we have
to just because we mostly focus on the returns and free cash flow out of that business.

But I wouldn't think we would be out of the market at any point in time. But that said, we're focused on
the slice of customers that make the best returns for us, which gets to a number of factors, efficiency but
also calendar cadence, pace of spend. And this year, going into Q1, for example, we're 95% committed on
the fleet, which is the best we've been since the downturn.

Operator

Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.

John David Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Jeff, going back to your comments on the digital side. As we move beyond the proof-of-concept and it
becomes more broadly accepted, you had kind of talked about sort of 2 different types of customers
out there. I guess it was sort of maybe on the E&P side, is those who've kind of realized they can't do
this themselves, and you're providing certain discrete operations, different applications, like you just
mentioned in some of your tools. On the other side, you have other bigger, broader customers or which
you can implement your ecosystem across the organization kind of the announcements you made today.

How do you see those 2 sets of customers evolving over the next, let's say, next several years? Is it fair
to assume it's kind of the former and the former is a majority of that business, and then hopefully, it
kind of evolves more into more of the broader implementation? Can you just talk about how you see that
customers' acceptance?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Look, I think customers do this at the pace at which they can digest it realistically. And that is the
reason why I think you see that bifurcation today, it's more apparent just because customers that can
actually operate and execute at that level of integration are fewer and far between today and I kind of
view it that way. It gets implemented at the pace it can be absorbed. And that's why I tend to talk about
the vision and then bring it down to, okay, here are the more digestible groupings being drilling production
and reservoir and then even down into the tools. Because the reality is a number of these tools, they'll
have to be integrated, but they can be and they're more effective when integrated. And so if I use a

16

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

fairly simple example, like in EarthStar tool. It's a tool, it's metal, it runs in the well, it's a fantastic tool.
But what's most important about it is the answer product, which is the 3D inversion. That 3D inversion
becomes even more valuable when integrated in an Earth model and likely yet again more valuable when
integrated into the entire ecosphere. But that's difficult for everyone to do that at one time, and it's very
hard to do that in the sort of the proliferation of different systems. So the key, in my view, is we continue
to advance the platform, the ecosystem, as you describe it, while at the same time, driving immediate
returns around these tools. And they're available to be integrated into that ecosystem. I don't know if
that's helpful. Does that...

John David Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Jeff. Now the other side of digital here is that it appears to be deflationary
to traditional oilfield services going forward, you customers can do more with less. Would you agree with
that? And do you think that future digital revenue to Halliburton, presumably it's comes to higher margins
more sustainable. Can that more than offset this deflation over the next several years?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

I think it can because I think what's missing in this deflation discussion is the moat that comes in around
our equipment that allows so much cost savings on the client side part of the business that we'll be able to
reap better margins and better returns on those assets to deliver those solutions.

And obviously, at the same time, we'll likely be reducing our own cost as we work through this. So I
think it will be deflationary in some ways. But I think the value and the returns on the -- not just the
componentry, but how that componentry is part of that ecosphere really widens the moat that maybe isn't
there as prevalent today. But I think we'll see that widen and that ultimately drives better returns for us,
in spite of what might be deflationary in a number of other areas of the business.

Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Chase Mulvehill
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I guess I wanted to come back to the CapEx question and ask it maybe a different way. If we think about
that $1.2 billion of CapEx, what's the split between D&E and C&P?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Chase, this is Lance. I would say that it's very similar to the 60-40 split that we talked about between
NAM and international is a good proxy.

Chase Mulvehill
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. So 60% C&P, is that what you're saying?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

No, no, no, 60% D&E.

Chase Mulvehill
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Okay. All right. So if you're 40%, I think that puts you sub-4% of C&P revenues. If we think about
CapEx as a percentage of revenues, obviously lower than kind of what you did in 2016 on a percentage of
revenues. If we look over the next couple of years and kind of, call it, a sluggish, modest growth in North

America environment. How should we think about C&P CapEx over the next couple of years and maybe
frame it on a percentage of revenues?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Look, I think structurally lower, as we've described it based more on the market and the opportunity
set that we see. But we're really careful not to -- look, we don't peg this to percents of revenues and
other things because then we get sort of odd answers when we see markets growing, and I don't think
growth is geared that way to our CapEx necessarily. And so we will continue to focus on the best-returning
opportunities and where we see those. But the idea that it's going to have to move the CapEx, it's going to
move as a percentage with revenues is really not the -- that's not how we approach that.

Chase Mulvehill
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes, yes, okay. That makes sense. And then coming back to frac, you talked about 22% less frac
horsepower, is that the amount that you've actually retired? Or is that the amount that you've actually
taken out of the market from an active fleet reduction? And then a quick on a follow-up to that. When you
talked about improvement in frac utilization in 2020 for your active fleets, you care to kind of quantify
that, how much improvement in utilization across your active fleet you think you can get in 2020?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Well, look, I'll start with the first question. The 22% that we described is out of the market, out of the
market sold by the pound retired. The -- but that's done some good things for us. I mean the reality is
that we're 90% Q10s at this point. Our costs are lower. Our service quality is the best it's ever been. So
that's how we view that. The activity, I guess, is the -- as we look out at the balance of the year or in
terms of utilization, part of maximizing profitability of that fleet and the returns on that fleet is keeping it
busy. And as I described earlier, when we start the year, 95% committed, which is the best we've been in
some time. So I'm encouraged by that outlook based on the fleet that we have.

Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Thanks for that great rundown. I was kind of curious, first and foremost, on the international front.
When you look at 2020, where do you think the best relative growth prospects are for Halliburton. You
mentioned that Asia-Pac was a major contributor here in '19. So just kind of curious on how you see the
regional dynamics play out for 2020?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Look, I think it's, again, led by Asia-Pac. In 2020, Europe/CIS continues to be strong
as we get into a full year of activity on a number of the contracts we've talked about in the past. Africa
grows, but it will be a bit more choppy as it works through exploration and regulatory sort of resetting in
that market. Middle East remains robust. But obviously, starts at a fairly high point as a market itself and
LATAM likely brings up the rear.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Appreciate that dynamic. And then I just want to get a little bit better understanding here on the
guidance you provided for first quarter on the margin progressions for C&P and D&E. And I want to try to
get into this context. For C&P, when you look at the margin degradation on a quarter-on-quarter basis,

18

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 21, 2020

could you give us some general sense of how much is that related to the absence of the tool sales versus
market dynamics?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Kurt, this is Lance. Yes, it's definitely impacted by just the nonrecurring nature of year-end product
sales in the C&P division, which were probably up 10% to 15% versus what we saw in 2018. So we had a
good fourth quarter in our C&P division in terms of year-end equipment sales.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then can the same be said for D&E?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

That said, the offset -- I'm sorry?

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I'll let you continue, Lance, sorry.

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

No. And then -- and that is -- obviously, those margins are accretive. So what we see replacing that in
the first quarter in terms of activity, largely in the resumption of our pressure pumping business in North
America is coming at lower margins, and so that you see the offset of that in the guidance.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then can the same be said for D&E?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Same can be said for D&E, probably more comparative, flattish year-over-year in terms of year-end
product sales in our D&E division.

Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen.

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Jeff, you were talking about oversupply still in the frac market and with your retirements and what we've
heard from the others, there's been a pretty significant reduction so far. What do you think is needed from
here to kind of balance the market? And what do you think the time line is for that?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Look, I think what's most important is that, that attrition is real. I get this question a lot, and I think
a quarter ago, I said -- I thought it was 20%, which was viewed as high. It turns out that's right in the
fairway. And so that attrition is, in fact, occurring. And the market forces or the forces that drove that
attrition haven't changed at all in terms of amount of sand pumps, number of stages per day. All of those
things that drive that attrition haven't changed. And so I suspect we continue on a pace that's at least
consistent with that. As far as the time line of when we see it, I'm really -- it happens at some point. It

doesn't change the way we go to the market today. And so we are so focused on delivering our strategy
around cost reduction and our service delivery improvement that when that happens, it will be terrific, and
we'll see a great boost from that.

And I think in the meantime, we've got a plan to deliver solid free cash flows and return sort of in any
market.

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Maybe somewhat related, we've got the guidance here for first quarter for C&P margins, which
includes the full benefit of all the cost-cutting you're doing. Where do you think those margins can get
absent any kind of pricing recovery for the frac side of the business? Is there just through the self-help
that you're talking about a bogey that you would point to over the next number of quarters?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Look, no, I mean, I think we've provided guidance on Q1. Our view strategy is something that we execute,
and we continue to see the value and benefit from. And so we're taking a very long view of this business
and the actions that we're taking beyond Q1 to continue to contribute and improve the business. And I
think that we will continue to outperform. I think we have the highest margins today in North America,
and we'll continue to add to that.

And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Miller for
closing remarks.

Jeffrey Allen Miller

Thank you, Liz. Before we wrap up, I'd like to close with a few points. First, I expect that Halliburton's
international growth will continue in 2020 and that the combination of capital discipline, pricing
improvements and technology will lead to margin expansion. Second, Halliburton will continue executing
our North America playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. And finally, I believe digitalization
will define the next decade, and Halliburton is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits. We look forward to
talking to you again next quarter.
