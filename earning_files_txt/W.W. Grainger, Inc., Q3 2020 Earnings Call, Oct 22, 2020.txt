Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.

Irene Holman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.

With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO.

As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements. Actual results may
differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.
Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found
in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q3 press release, both of which are available
on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the third quarter of 2020 which
exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release.

Now I'll turn it over to D.G.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.

Market conditions remained challenging in the third quarter as the pandemic conditions improved but
continued to weigh on many of our customers. Despite these challenges, Grainger performed well,
continuing to demonstrate our resilience and strength. I'm so proud of how Grainger team members have
responded to the challenges of 2020, staying relentlessly focused on further deepening relationships with
our customers and supporting each other.

I've shared with you our Grainger Edge framework, which includes our purpose, aspiration, strategy and
the principles that define the behaviors we expect from all team members. These principles, including
starting with the customer, acting with intent and competing with urgency, provide clarity and focus as we
continue to execute on our purpose to keep the world working. And we'll continue to leverage the Grainger
Edge in all that we do throughout this pandemic and beyond.

So let me start off with a brief business update and an overview of our third quarter performance before
turning it over to Tom to dive into the details.

On the business side, we continue to serve our customers well, support the needs and safety of our
team members and ensure we remain in a strong financial position. A quick update on each point:
Grainger has operated effectively throughout the pandemic, first in support of essential businesses
and now in serving all businesses. Each of our customers has a unique story on how they have been
impacted by and managed through the pandemic. We have been there for all of them. Sales to health
care, government and e-commerce businesses remained strong in the quarter; and we saw improving
trends with manufacturing and commercial customers. I'll address the pattern of revenue in a moment.
Our world-class integrated supply chain organization, which supports both our North American high-
touch businesses and our Zoro endless assortment platform, has helped find and secure products to meet
customer demand. We have successfully worked down our backlog of orders for most pandemic-related
products, including masks; and continue to work with suppliers to catch up on a few categories that
remain scarce, including some gloves and hand sanitizers. The team remains laser-focused on maintaining

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

our high level of customer service. Customer feedback has been strong and improving throughout the
pandemic.

For our team members, we continue to take steps to support not only their safety but their overall well-
being during this uncertain time. To date, we have managed the challenges of 2020 without major layoffs
and currently have roughly 1% of our workforce still on furlough.

Importantly, we've maintained a strong financial position. We've been diligent in controlling costs while
balancing the need to continue to serve our customers, support our team members and invest where it
matters most. Our strong performance over the last 2 quarters, together with our solid cost containment,
have enabled us to relax a number of our short-term cash preservation actions. We exited the quarter with
approximately $2.1 billion in available liquidity.

We continue to make strong progress on our strategic growth priorities during the short-term uncertainty.
We have continued to execute our transform merchandising process to drive significant user experience
improvements to grainger.com, including our search and visualization capabilities and enriched product
descriptions and content. By the end of 2020, we expect to have remerchandised $2.8 billion in product
through this new process, including $1.6 billion in the year alone. We intend to further accelerate these
efforts moving forward as a result of our new product information management system that launched in
the third quarter. Customer feedback on our website has improved significantly over the past 6 quarters.

Marketing has been a large contributor of our U.S. share gain over the last few years. We have improved
effectiveness in both media advertising and paid search and plan to further invest in marketing given
these strong returns. We continue to deepen relationships with our customers through our large customer
multisite growth initiative, enhancements to our KeepStock offering and improvements to our sales
strategy and effectiveness. We know that, when we embed one or more of our service offerings with our
customers, we foster deeper and longer-lasting relationships. Over 60% of our U.S. revenue is generated
from customers with one or more embedded solutions.

And lastly, within our endless assortment model, we are executing the successful MonotaRO playbook at
Zoro here in the U.S.; and are making strides in marketing effectiveness, customer analytics and SKU
additions. This year alone, we have added 1.5 million SKUs to Zoro, pushing its assortment to roughly 5
million products.

Turning to our quarterly performance.

We produced strong operating results in the third quarter. Organic daily sales finished up 4.6% in the
quarter, underpinned by growth in our U.S. high-touch business and continued impressive performance
of our endless assortment model. In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader MRO market
as a whole, which was down 5% to 6% in the quarter. Our gains were supported by pandemic-related
demand, sales to new customers and improved sales of nonpandemic product as we started to see some
stabilizing trends in underlying business activity. Overall business activity still trails pre-pandemic levels
as some customers remain disrupted by COVID. The endless assortment model continues to deliver, with
20% growth in the third quarter, while also generating meaningfully improved margins. We remain very
excited about the future of this business as we continue to adopt learnings from MonotaRO to drive growth
and profitability.

At the total company level, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 90 basis points as gross margins
stabilized sequentially and we demonstrated strong cost control. Tom will detail this in a bit. The business
continues to produce a durable cash flow stream with operating cash flow of $311 million and free cash
flow of $252 million.

Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important to again show this chart to highlight the underlying
trends with pandemic and nonpandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Our
characterization goes beyond traditional safety products to include product categories with substantial
volume increases during the pandemic. Plexiglass barriers will be an example. As you can see, while
sales of pandemic-related products have decreased since May, continued demand for key products,
including masks, gloves and cleaning supplies, has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year. This

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

heightened demand has continued to come from a multitude of new and existing customers across
numerous industries as businesses reopen and adjust to the new operating protocols. On the nonpandemic
side, sales have improved since bottoming out in April, with nonpandemic sales now down about 7% year-
over-year. This improvement has been seen across most industries, with some of the obvious industries
remaining the furthest below their pre-pandemic levels. These include airlines, hotels and cruise lines.
Based on month-to-date performance, we forecast October sales to finish up around 2% for the U.S.
segment on continued trends in pandemic and nonpandemic performance.

Predicting the recovery over the next few quarters is very challenging. The path of the virus will have a big
impact on whether the recent improvements continue, level off or reverse, but we feel well positioned to
compete in any environment that comes our way.

With that, I will turn it over to Tom to talk us through the quarter's results in detail.

Tom?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, D.G.

Starting on Slide 8, you can see we delivered strong results in the quarter. Organic daily sales, which
adjust for the divestitures of Fabory in China, were up 4.6% on a constant currency basis. This increase
was primarily driven by share gains in our U.S. segment; and continued impressive growth in our endless
assortment business, which was up over 20% in the quarter. These gains more than offset pandemic-
related softness in our Canada and Cromwell businesses. We saw meaningfully higher sales sequentially
but still remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Gross margin for the total company was down 170
basis points versus the prior year quarter but represented a 120 basis point improvement from the second
quarter year-over-year decline. Margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds,
primarily in our U.S. segment, as well as continued unit -- business unit mix impact as we experienced
significant growth in our endless assortment business.

Our SG&A came in at $700 million for the third quarter, better than our communicated range of $715
million to $730 million. SG&A cost was down $60 million year-over-year, and we captured 260 basis
points of SG&A leverage in the period. This result stems from prudent cost reduction actions across
our high-touch solutions model, including costs -- lower costs as a result of our Fabory divestiture, and
leveraged gains with our endless assortment business. This SG&A performance more than overcame GP
headwinds to drive a 90 basis points improvement in total company operating margins for the quarter, a
tremendous result in this environment. Incremental margins were up 50% in the quarter. As mentioned
last quarter, the utility of the incremental and decremental margin calculation is diminished in this
uncertain environment as the metric can vary significantly given the magnitude of top line swings from
quarter to quarter.

We generated operating cash flow of $311 million, which we used to continue to invest in the business,
build appropriate inventory to support our customers and return capital to shareholders. Operating cash
flow was 126% of net adjusted earnings, and year-to-date adjusted return on invested capital is over
29%. Given our solid results in the last couple of quarters, combined with stabilizing trends in underlying
business activity, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility, increased our dividend payment and are
announcing today our intent to restart our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. While we
anticipate putting several hundred million dollars to work on repurchases in Q4, we will monitor market
conditions and optimize the amount accordingly. The favorable trends over the last several months give us
confidence that this is the right time to move forward with these actions.

Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.1% in the quarter, driven primarily by volume,
which is net of unfavorable product mix. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products
remained elevated, up 53% in the quarter, but as shown earlier have tapered off from the peak in
March. Nonpandemic products were down around 8% in the quarter but continued to show meaningful
improvement from April lows. We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions with some

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

really encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we saw improved growth with
both large and midsized customers, with the latter growing 6% in the quarter, an improvement from the
6% decline year-over-year we saw in Q2 2020.

Gross margins of 36.4% was down 160 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019 but improved
sequentially from the 310 basis point year-over-year decline we saw in the second quarter of 2020. The
unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven by -- mainly by 2 factors that were similar to the second
quarter: pandemic-related product headwinds and tariff-fueled cost inflation. Pandemic-related headwinds
contributed about 140 basis points of the gross margin decline as we continued to see unfavorable product
and customer mix due to elevated sales of lower-margin pandemic product. Beyond the pandemic impact,
we continued to face pressure in the quarter due to the lapping of year-over-year cost inflation which
was driven partially by tariffs that went into effect in 2019. This drove approximately 80 basis points of
year-over-year margin decline. Based on what we know now, we expect that both of these gross margin
headwinds will continue into the fourth quarter. It should be noted that we anticipate the tariff headwinds
will fully subside as we move into 2021. Offsetting these 2 factors in the quarter was a 60 basis points
tailwind related to favorable freight costs driven by nonrecurring shipping efficiencies and timing. We do
not expect these freight dynamics to continue in the fourth quarter.

From an SG&A perspective, we gained 160 basis points of leverage, with costs decreasing approximately
$22 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower labor-
related costs and general operating efficiencies. Operating margin remained flat to the prior year quarter
at 15.1%, as SG&A leverage offset gross margin headwinds. Return on invested capital was a very healthy
38%.

Drilling into our U.S. sales performance on Slide 10. While we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined
between 5% and 6% in the third quarter, Grainger was able to capture roughly 850 basis points
of outgrowth fueled by pandemic-related sales, selling to new customers and improving sales of
nonpandemic product. Despite the challenges of 2020, U.S. segment daily sales are up 2.1% year-to-date,
and we have outgained the broader MRO market by over 900 basis points through the first 9 months of
2020.

Moving to our other businesses. Organic daily sales increased 12.5%, or 12.3% on a constant currency
basis. The endless assortment business grew at approximately 20%, fueled by strong results at both
MonotaRO and Zoro during the quarter. Zoro continues to execute the MonotaRO playbook, with
improvements to marketing effectiveness, discounting strategies and better cost leverage all helping
to drive improved performance. Although we saw significant sequential improvement compared to the
second quarter, our international high-touch businesses continued to be impacted by pandemic-related
shutdowns, with both Mexico and Cromwell seeing year-over-year declines.

Operating margins for other businesses are up 190 basis points, 35 basis points which is due to the
divestiture of our Fabory and China businesses which produced below-system-average profitability in the
prior year. The remaining operating margin favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage across the
portfolio, most notably within our endless assortment business which continues to do a nice job levering
its cost base. This leverage was only partially offset by gross profit headwinds from incremental freight
costs at MonotaRO.

Turning to Slide 12. In Canada daily sales decreased 9.9%, or 9.1% in constant currency. The decline is
comprised of roughly 8% decline in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately
1%. While volumes in Canada continued to be impacted by the pandemic-driven economic slowdown,
the business did improve sequentially; and is gaining traction with hospitals, manufacturing and higher
education customers. As the Canadian business continues to integrate and leverage our U.S. resources,
we are making progress with our customer diversification efforts and are pleased with the trajectory of
this business going forward. Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 35 basis points year-over-
year, driven by pandemic-related mix headwinds, which were offset partially by lower freight costs in the
quarter. Cost management remained strong with savings of $5 million year-over-year, resulting in 110
basis points of SG&A leverage. Total operating margins were up 75 basis points versus prior year despite
the top line challenges.

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Before I turn it back to D.G., similar to the last couple quarters, I want to give you a sense of how we
are thinking about things in the fourth quarter. From a sales perspective, month-to-date trends support
our estimate for October year-over-year sales growth to be up over 4% at the total company level on an
organic constant currency basis. This October month-end estimate is reflective of continued solid growth in
our U.S. segment coupled with strong performance in endless assortment.

From a gross margin perspective, as I previously mentioned, we anticipate gross margin pressure will
continue, as the pandemic-related impacts and tariff-fueled cost inflation headwinds will persist into
the fourth quarter. The onetime freight tailwind we realized in the third quarter will fall off. Further, we
anticipate year-over-year cost headwinds in the fourth quarter as the already-stretched global shipping
providers pass-through freight surcharges during the busy holiday season. Given these factors and based
on what we are currently seeing, we anticipate gross margins will be down over 200 basis points year-
over-year. With respect to SG&A, we expect to see sequential increases in a couple of areas primarily
related to some incremental technology investments to support growth in the U.S. and at MonotaRO,
which will push our estimated SG&A to between $725 million to $740 million for the fourth quarter.

As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in long-term
growth, particularly in people, processes and technology where and when it makes sense.

With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Tom.

So I'm proud of our results for the quarter, and I want to thank our team members for their commitment
to safety and customer service. We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing
capabilities, deepened our customer relationships, expanded our assortment while improving margins
at Zoro; and have significant financial flexibility to support the business moving forward. We remain
committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as
continuing to execute our strategy so we can achieve this purpose for years to come.
And with that, we will open up the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Glynn from Oppenheimer.

Christopher D. Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I was curious. You mentioned customer acquisition trends still going strong and conversions to some
regular customer dynamics are going well. Just wondering if you could further dive into that topic and how
it informs early view of share outperformance for '21.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Great. Thanks, Chris. So yes. So we've had -- as you might guess, given inventory positions, we have had
a whole bunch of new customers sample Grainger and Zoro and MonotaRO, frankly, as we've had elevated
customer acquisitions through this period. The good news is that, those who have repeated, the number is
much higher than in the past. The repeat rates are similar to the past, but we have a much bigger funnel.
And we're starting to get those customers to be regular purchasing customers, so we've seen really nice,
attractive customer acquisition through this period, and we think that really helps bode well for the future.
We feel very confident in our 300 to 400 basis point outgrowth in the U.S. business and the 20% growth
expectations for the endless assortment, and we have no reason to change those right now. This year,
we've obviously been higher than that number in the U.S. We would expect to be in that range and shoot
for higher but be in that range moving forward.

Christopher D. Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then for follow-up: I think the -- would you anticipate that 3Q pandemic sales using October as
a proxy might approximate the sustainable run rates, as long as workplaces are very germaphobic? Or is
that still [ wait to influx ]?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

I think that's a very interesting question and I don't think anybody has the answer. What we're seeing
right now is elevated pandemic sales. We expect that to continue. And certainly as case rates rise, which
we've seen recently, we would expect that to continue through the fall. What happens when we have
better treatments and a vaccine is probably a question that is all in our minds, and it's probably impossible
to answer. We would expect some of that to moderate, but we do think people are going to be more
conscious of safety and cleanliness for some period after that as well. But for now we're seeing similar
trends to what we've seen in the past. We would expect that to continue in the fall and given the rate of
transmission.

Operator

Next question today is coming from Chris Dankert from Longbow Research.

Christopher M. Dankert
Longbow Research LLC

I guess, first off, what's the status of investment in Zoro? I mean in the past we've mentioned about $50
million of investments in '19. It largely rolls off this year, I guess. Are we still on pace to get to mid-single-
digit EBIT margin-plus in the other businesses in '21? Just thoughts on investment there would be really
helpful, I think.

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Sure. So we had a very heavy investment period in the back half of '18 and '19 with Zoro. Many of --
those investments took several forms. One was technology. Another was people and getting the talent
to be able to have their own destiny in terms of product adds and the like. And so we made those
investments. Those investments are behind us. We start to see those -- starting to see those leverage
themselves now. This year, we're getting improved operating margins in Zoro. We think the long-term path
for Zoro from a margin perspective is as we've discussed. We will talk about it next year, in January, but
we have no reason to believe the positivity that we've seen won't continue. And we still think that is going
to be a "high-single-digit operating margin" business in the next several years. And so that's the path for
that business.

Christopher M. Dankert
Longbow Research LLC

Got it, got it. And then thinking about SG&A. I mean compared to what the guidance was, again coming in
below that range. My apologies if I missed it, but just what were the key moving parts on what helps you
kind of cut that SG&A number even lower in the third quarter here?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks...

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Tom, do you want to take that?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Thanks, Chris. First of all, there was a little bit that was [ win dated ] just with the Fabory
divestiture. And that takes the $60 million down to about $40 million, but then we just had real good
efficiency across the board, everything from travel and entertainment, professional services, cleaning
supply, security, just a real good focus by the team in terms of efficiency and cost control. And one of
the great things with the pandemic is -- we've always been cost conscious, but I think we've really upped
our game, and I think it's going to continue going forward where we're really in this mode of operating
this way. So just to summarize, really good cost control across the board while continuing to spend in
advertising and technology, which are important for us.

Christopher M. Dankert
Longbow Research LLC

Got it. I'm glad to hear it's broad-based savings certainly. So congrats again on the quarter.

Operator

Your next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.

Adam William Uhlman
Cleveland Research Company

Sticking with the SG&A question. I guess the freight dynamics that you pointed out for the third quarter
and the fourth quarter are pretty interesting. As the surcharge rates kind of transition into base rate
increases, I'm wondering if you could help us ballpark just how meaningful of a headwind that could be for
2021. Or perhaps it's not a headwind and you have some other levers to pull to offset that, then -- and
maybe you can just remind us about how you charge customers for freight. I believe most customers don't
pay, but maybe discuss that as well.

Donald G. Macpherson

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Chairman & CEO

So I would say that it's a great question. I -- most customers -- our largest customers and contract
customers often don't pay for parcel. They often pay for LTL or large shipments. The surcharge that Tom
was referring to is really around large packages during the peak season, and we will charge for some of
that. We expect to recoup some of that. We don't expect to recoup all of that, and that doesn't have much
to do with what happens into next year. So we will talk about it next year, obviously, after this quarter.
I would say certainly the freight business, given the number of shipments going to people's houses, has
become strained, and we've seen some pressure. That does not mean, though, that the surcharges that
happen in the fall necessarily translate going forward. And so we'll talk about that. And we think we've
got initiatives and actions to help mitigate that moving forward, but we'll talk about that at the end of the
year.

Adam William Uhlman
Cleveland Research Company

Okay, great. That's good to hear. And then secondly, the company has been building up inventory. And
I was curious, one, if you could talk about your inventory and working capital assumptions here in
the medium term; and then secondly, if you are concerned at all of absorbing losses on any pandemic
inventory that you might be taking if we have some good luck and the pandemic starts to roll off and
market pricing deteriorates further.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes, so let me take those. And Tom, you can add to them if you think I miss anything. So in terms of
inventory, there's really 2 areas where we've built inventory and we'll continue to do so through the latter
part of the year. The first one is sort of normal, which is we are starting the Louisville DC full up in 2021.
And so as that comes on, we obviously stock that building. That's partially stocked now but becomes
more fully stocked as we go through, and that's a part of what you've seen. The other part is pre-buys for
pandemic-related product. I would say, to your question about do we have risk on excess obsolescence
with that product, part of what you see in terms of -- with us in terms of pandemic GP already embeds
some write-downs. We obviously, to make sure we could serve our customers, took positions at a whole
bunch of products in the height of the pandemic. And some of those, the price/cost has changed. Some
of those, we haven't seen movement. In a lot of those, we've seen movement. And it's gone, worked very
well, but in that messiness to serve customers, which we think has been really, really important, you're
already seeing that in some of the GP rates that you're seeing, is us take that. We think that we're in
good position. Most of the inventory build, to be clear, has been pre-buys on products that is very low
risk. We know suppliers. We know product. We know product that will sell in any case but trying to get out
ahead of that in case the fall and the winter is really, really bad. And so most of that is not higher risk than
normal, but certainly in some of the speculative buys and things we took in the heart of the pandemic,
you've already seen some of that come through in terms of GP.

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And just to add a little bit more color on inventory and cash. One of the things that we've been very
efficient on is our management of cash; and you've seen that in this quarter, more specifically our cash
conversion cycle. Our DSO is actually down year-over-year a couple of days. And our DPO is actually
favorable by more than a few days, which has allowed us to keep a overall cash conversion cycle that is
very healthy versus last year and invest in the inventory so we can play our role as an essential business
and support the customers the way we need to. So you're right. Inventory is up, since the beginning
of the year, 8% at $1.78 billion. We've invested in working capital. It's up $220 million. And we did put
pandemic inventory spend in the quarter of approximately $300 million. And as D.G. said, I mean, you're
not going to [ be at 1,000 ] on all of that. So we go through the normal E&O process. And I guess the way
I would describe it is we're very aggressive operationally but very conservative financially. So doing the
right thing to reserve. So thanks for the question.

Our next question today is coming from Chris Snyder from UBS.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on endless assortment margins. I understand there is like a longer-term kind
of high single-digit target out there for Zoro, but with the back-office investment slowing, what kind of
incremental margins could we expect for this business as the top line continues to ramp?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's a good question. We really don't look at incremental margins specifically on the endless
assortment business just because the supply chain is so intertwined in the synergies with the broader
business. So we really look at the business as the incremental margin for the overall entity.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

The short -- yes. I mean, Tom, I will just add. I mean, if you look at incremental margins with MonotaRO,
typically you're talking about 15% to 20%, which is just GP minus the variable marketing costs. And
so I would expect us to get to something like that over time at Zoro, but that's typically what we see in
MonotaRO, I think.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Appreciate that. And then just following up on MonotaRO. So like the stock is up like 100% year-to-date in
Tokyo last I checked. Can you just talk about how you kind of view that business strategically at Grainger?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Well, we view -- sure. So we view both the endless assortment and the high-touch solutions model as
absolutely core to what we do. Masaya Suzuki, who's the leader of that business now, also leads Zoro.
We are sharing best practices and analytics and working together to ensure that we're actually making
progress across those 2 businesses and our Zoro business in the U.K. as well. So we view it as absolutely
core to what we do right now. And we're getting a whole lot of leverage from that MonotaRO team in
terms of learnings and building the business at Zoro for the future. So we are running those very, very
tightly together at this point.

Our next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I was hoping we get some color on the -- additional color on the gross margin guidance for the fourth
quarter down 200 bps. Is there any way you can parse out what the pandemic sales would be versus
nonpandemic sales? We're just trying to get a sense of what the core gross margin trajectory might be.

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think the way to look at it, Deane, is we said the pandemic impact is 140 basis points for this
quarter, and the cost other is 80 basis point unfavorable bad guy. And we had the onetime freight of
60. So if you remove the 60 from the 140 and the 80, you get to 220. Now we think that the pandemic
will likely improve. Obviously it's very volatile. And say you get roughly a 20% improvement on your
cost inflation as well as your pandemic. That gets you to around 200-ish. And then you throw in the

freight headwinds that we think we might experience at the end of the year, as D.G. discussed, with the
surcharges, and that gets you above 200.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's real helpful. And then I was hoping to get some additional color on the October sales. Just the
extent that you can, anything that you think would be helpful regarding geographic, customer sizes,
anything else about the mix? That would be a big help here.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

I think, Deane, if you looked at sales revenue performance July, August, September, October, you'd be
hard-pressed to see much of a difference across those months. We've seen a little tailoff in pandemic and
a little improvement in nonpandemic, but pretty much the trend has been very, very similar across all of
those months. So the trends we've seen and the performance we saw in the second quarter really just
appears to be -- in the third quarter appears to be continuing in October at this point.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And just lastly, an observation. I've certainly heard the Grainger spot ads on business radio pretty
frequently and the brand building. So I think it's pretty effective.

Our next question today is coming from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just to -- I want to pick up on that 4Q gross margin guidance. So roughly 200 basis points down from
38% last quarter gets it to about 36%, which would be up from this quarter. So I just wanted to make
sure that, that math kind of still holds, that we are looking for what would be a fairly normal sequential
pickup in gross margin percentage from 3Q.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Tom, do you want to take that one?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I'm sorry. I was on mute. Nigel, I think another way to look at it is our absolute gross margin should
be very similar to Q3. And then when you just look at the comparison to prior year, it's going to bump it
over 200. So that's the other way I would look at it.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay, no, that's fair. And then the midsized customer growth was pretty impressive and a nice swing
from what we saw last quarter. And I'm just curious. Are we seeing -- obviously a lot of your competitors,
especially the small competitors and 1 or 2 larger ones, have employed a very high-touch distribution
model. And I'm wondering if we are seeing a switch towards perhaps more low-touch, direct-ship e-
commerce type sales and maybe some supply consolidation? I mean, anything you see in there in the
market?

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Yes, I would say we've certainly seen more digital sales through the pandemic. I think we've seen
that in almost every industry, and ours has been no different. What I would say is that we are seeing
improvements in midsized customer growth from digital actions but also from inside sales actions. So that
is more of a touch, but we're seeing nice growth across both of those contact points. And so yes, I would
say it's fair to characterize as more digital but not all digital. We're also seeing some nice growth through
some of our other actions that are more high touch.

Our next question today is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just a couple of questions. I -- we've covered a lot of ground already but one thing I want to be sure on,
if you don't mind. Tom, on endless assortment, clearly some good leverage happening there. But just
wondering if anything is happening inside of Zoro or MonotaRO, for that matter, with mix. Obviously, in
the middle of pandemic, we can talk about like pandemic mix and safety products, but I guess, just more
broadly, are people buying different stuff than that is normally tuned up for? And does that have some
benefit positive or negative that may not look like the ongoing model?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think the only thing that I would say, and then D.G., please add, is we're probably seeing more B2C
customers than B2B customers in the pandemic but, other than that, nothing out of the ordinary.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean -- so one of the things that I would say that's muddled the pandemic a little bit in terms of
results has been, with so many people working from home, sometimes the business and the consumer
tends to blur. I've listened to a bunch of contact center calls, and it's fascinating that there's a lot of
people at home maybe buying things for businesses but also sometimes delivering to their home. And so
we think we've had more consumer acquisition than normal. We don't remarket to consumers, whether in
Zoro or Grainger. And what we do know is that the business customer acquisition has been very solid, very
strong. And the attractiveness of those customers has been every bit as strong as we've seen in the past.
So we're happy with, besides having to sort of sift through consumer business, the business that we're
sure is business has been very strong. And that's been a sort of key for us.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then it sounds like Deane is going to be a future customer here based on the
effect of this marketing, so maybe he can close that lead...

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

He's not the target segment. I can assure you that.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. And then just on the inventory question. I know someone asked earlier about the inventory
build there. Anything on kind of an seasonally uncommon liquidation in the fourth quarter that you're
planning that may be dragging that down or impacting that at all? Just thinking about historically you
usually build a little inventory in the fourth quarter sequentially. Is that something that happened earlier?
And is that playing into the -- that dynamic at all on the gross margins [ this quarter ]?

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Senior VP & CFO

It's playing into it a little bit. As we said on the previous question, we've been very aggressively
operationally from an inventory perspective because it's the right thing to do and we want to have the
product available for our customers, but on the other hand, we've been conservative financially. So part of
the gross margin deterioration that you've seen in Q3 is an E&O headwind cleaning up some of the buys
that didn't exactly thread the needle. So we've tried to do most of that in Q3. We'll see a little bit in Q4 as
well, and then we believe that that's going to be behind us going into 2021. We'll have the right product
to serve our customer. And then if anything, we will have a tailwind as we unwind some of those reserves
when the products that we have reserved potentially will be available for sale.

Our next question today is coming from John Inch from Gordon Haskett.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Assuming that PPE sales, which you would assume, right, to happen as the market has been saturated,
naturally continued to trend lower, as we roll into 2021, what kind of a kind of an absolute sales headwind
could this prospectively represent? And you guys have had very strong OpEx control. Kind of I don't think
I've heard this in the discussion thus far. I mean, what kind of costs are you thinking about are going
to have to come back next year as you're starting of flip from PPE to kind of a more normalized volume
trajectory for other products?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think there's a lot in that question, John. I will say that we -- it's hard. It's really difficult to project
the PPE trend. What we've seen since April -- in April, we saw PPE up almost 100% -- pandemic product,
what we call pandemic. That includes more than PPE. We saw sort of normal volumes down 20% in April.
And what we've seen is those two sort of just come together consistently since that time. And there's
lots of puts and takes to that. So if PPE comes down and we get a little bit better nonpandemic product,
it helps GP. It probably doesn't have any impact on SG&A, frankly. We think we can control SG&A in any
environment. And one of the good things about the pandemic, and there haven't been many, is it really
forces a business to focus. And I think it's we've really been focused on what matters, and I think that's
something that we definitely need to take forward. It's how do we continue to focus on a few things that
really matter, which helps drive results but also helps you manage your SG&A. So we think we're going to
be able to do that going forward. I can't give you a crystal ball answer as to what's going to happen with
PPE because it just all depends on the timing of the virus and people's behavior, and we've never seen
anything like this before.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Right, but do you have any sense, D.G., of what maybe the SG&A -- I'm sorry. Tom, the -- what sort
of SG&A headwinds you're facing kind of on a quantifiable basis. Because you do have the 1% people
that are furloughed. Presumably you're going to have to bleed back a little bit of travel and some merit
increases and stuff like that. Is it too early to tell at this point? Or how are you thinking about it?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Well, yes. No. I mean we'll talk about that certainly at year-end as we talk about forward looking. We
took, we had merit increases this year. So that's not -- yes, clearly, we have costs that will come back
into the business. Travel will be modest, we think, for the next 6 months given what we're seeing with
the virus. At some point, that can come back, but I think the headline for me would be we've seen nice
growth. GP has been depressed given pandemic sales has been so elevated. SG&A has been down. I think,

15

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

over time as that moderates, you get better GP and a little bit of costs back added into the business. And
there is just the dynamic there that we can talk about later.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Understand...

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The only -- I'm sorry. The only thing that I would reinforce is, as D.G. said, we're always going to be
about SG&A efficiency and control; and we'll handle that. The upside that I see, which D.G. mentioned,
is we're going to see the gross margin pop from -- as the pandemic goes down. And also I think, on the
sales front, as the broader economy opens up, we're going to be well positioned to ride that wave as well.
And I would have to imagine, obviously it's speculation, that there's going to be a lot of PP&E product
that's going to come into those businesses opening up as well. So I see it more as a tailwind than any sort
of a headwind.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

D.G., just lastly, implicit in your answer on MonotaRO and monetizing MonotaRO, you indicated that Zoro
-- it's still pretty important to the Zoro business. It's intertwined and so forth. At what point can Zoro,
do you think, stands on its own where you might strategically be in a position to say, "Hey, we don't
need to own half of MonotaRO. The stock has done fantastic. Let's take our position down to 20%, 30%,"
something like that or even to 0?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Well, I'd say a couple of things to that. One is it's probably timing. You probably need 3 more years,
given what we're projecting, to get Zoro to where we would like to get it. So it's really got the connected
tissue to be a really strong performer for a long time. And so that's what we're shooting for. At that point,
obviously we can do things. There's all kinds of tax implications of that, John, and so we need to think
through all that at that point. For now, for the next 3 years, we're thinking of it as we need to get Zoro
business performing well. We're really excited about the MonotaRO path, and we think that's the right
focus for us.

Our next question is coming from David Manthey from Baird.

David John Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Tom, I'll have to go back and review your commentary, but when you were talking about gross margin and
you said above 200, I'm confused. Was that a fourth quarter statement, or were you walking into 2021?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Fourth quarter, Dave. The way I'm looking at it is just simple math. If you look at Q3, a 160 bad guy on
gross margin with a 60 bps of onetime freight. So if you just take the 60 bps off, that gets you to 220.
Now we assume the pandemic is going to get better, as is cost inflation. So bring that down to 200 or a
little bit below, but then going back to the freight surcharges we see during the holiday season, that will
get us back above 200, which is the framework that we talked about in the prepared remarks for Q4. Now
having said that, I mean, it's very fluid. It's hard to predict, but we're just trying to give you guys some
framework for your model.

Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay, yes. That's very helpful. And so I'll ask the question: Gross margin is obviously extremely hard to
model these days. And if we're just thinking big picture moving parts from where we'll wind up in 2020,
which looks like, I don't know, low 36s. If you just were thinking big picture, what are the main moving
parts as we go from 2020 to 2021 that could move that up or down?

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, we'll have a lot more to say about that going forward. I think, though, just to give you a couple of
things to think about, one would be how long is the pandemic going to last. Because obviously, the longer
the pandemic lasts, the more we're going to be depressed with pandemic-related mix and the type of
customers we're selling to. So that's number one. Number two, we should see a natural tailwind in terms
of we will have fully lapped the tariff-related cost inflation, as well as we'll probably see less spikes in
terms of cost inflation related to the pandemic product. So those are the 2 big ones to think about and
both of them should be tailwinds for 2021, but again it's premature to talk in detail. We'll have plenty of
time for that later.

David John Manthey
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. That's great color. And second, on KeepStock and these embedded solutions that you talk about
making up 60% of revenues. Just to put that in context: What percentage of customers would that
represent? And then recognizing that those customers obviously buy from -- via several mechanisms that
you provide, can you talk about what percentage of sales are directly via the embedded solutions today?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Well, so let me try to take that. So most of our largest complex customers will have embedded solutions.
And typically they'll have both a KeepStock inventory management solution and EDI pro sort of connected
digital solution as well. And so EDI pro and KeepStock would make up over 30% of our direct revenue, I
believe. Don't quote me on it. Something like that. I don't have that in the numbers right in front of me,
but it's something like that. In terms of number of customers, obviously our midsized customers have
fewer of those solutions. They're more into buying on grainger.com. And by the way, that can be pseudo
embedded, although we don't call it embedded because they can have their own -- they'll have their own
pricing. They may have their own workflow on grainger.com, but typically they wouldn't have inventory
management. And so from a customer count, the number of customers will be much fewer in that 60%
than those in there, but the largest, complex customers will all have an embedded solution in general.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes, yes, yes. So I mean I'd say there's 3 things that have been really impactful. One is SKU count. So we
look at the productivity of every SKU add. And we look over -- kind of the last 6, 7 years, as we've added
SKUs, we're now -- we've now hit the 5 million point. The adds we've made in the last 6 months are as
productive and, it looks like, maybe even more productive than those that we've made in the past, so that
bodes pretty well for future growth. So that's probably the most important piece of the growth. The other
one is customer analytics and marketing. So getting customers, customer acquisition. The funnel is pretty
big, but then getting customers to repeat is really the key. And we're doing all kinds of things there with
analytics and marketing to get that second, third, fourth order; and starting to get real traction there. So
those are, far and away, the 2 most important things with the endless assortment business that we track;
and we're seeing progress on both of those.

Michael Lawrence McGinn
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And how does it correlate to sales per site visit? And what's kind of been the trend there?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Sales per site visit. You mean customers coming onto the website and what's the revenue per site visit.

Michael Lawrence McGinn
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Yes, what -- I guess, what industry metrics are you benchmarking to within that and this assortment
model? And what's been the improvement with this level of investment?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Right. So we look at things that other businesses would look at. The return on ad spend, that is interesting
but not sufficient. The most important thing is looking at customer value. And so looking at customer
acquisition and the customer lifetime value. And so we look at new customer acquisition rates, repeat
rates; and we link all that to a customer value model to understand the NPV of each customer add. And so
that's what we track all the time.

Michael Lawrence McGinn
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it, all right. On my second question, CapEx. Is there a normalized level of CapEx that you would be
targeting in the out-years as you transition more -- less from branches, more to endless assortment? Is
there -- I mean it looks like you're trending pretty well this year. I'm just wondering if there's -- if you
underspent this year and there's a catch-up into next year or beyond.

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I don't...

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

[indiscernible] -- go ahead, Tom.

Thomas B. Okray

roughly $60 million in the quarter, which was similar to last year. When the pandemic first hit, we

cash generation, we're back to normal spend levels. So I don't see any big wave coming in future years
that would be anything out of the ordinary.

Our next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.

Hamzah Mazari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

My question was just in the other segment. If you take out the endless assortment business, are those
other businesses losing money today, or are they profitable? And then is the endless assortment business
now over 10% of revenue, where you have to sort of re-segment that? Or is that not the right way to look
at that?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

So on your second question. We are evaluating the need to think about any segmentation, and we'll talk
about that and our position on that at the end of the year -- or with next year. So we have -- we are
evaluating that, and we work with our auditors to make sure we understand requirements. So that's still
to come. So there's different types of businesses that are in other when you take out endless assortment,
but there's not a lot of them. So there's Mexico. That's profitable. There's Puerto Rico. That's profitable.
And there is Cromwell. Cromwell is unprofitable now but having a pretty good year in terms of customer
service and experience, and they're losing less money this year than last. So in total I believe those would
be slightly unprofitable, but two of them are profitable and one is not. And working on that one.

Our next question is coming from Justin Bergner from G. Research.

Justin Laurence Bergner
G. Research, LLC

A quick clarification question, then a more open-ended question. The medium-sized customer growth
going from negative 6% to 6%, how much of that related to those businesses sort of being closed in the
second quarter or being unable to get pandemic-related product and then sort of catching up in the third
quarter?

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

So 2 things there, 2 things going on. One is that some of those businesses were more impacted and may
have been closed. I think the bigger issue was, in the heat of the pandemic in April, May in particular,
given the way product supply happened for pandemic products and the customers we needed to funnel
that product to, we didn't have product available for those customers. And in the summer, we relaxed
that constraint as pandemic products became more available, and we were able to open that up to that
customer base. And so we've seen very strong growth since that happened. And I think that's probably
the bigger issue, is just being able to release the product for midsized customers, and we've seen nice
growth as a result of that.

Justin Laurence Bergner
G. Research, LLC

Great. And then the open-ended question: Looking at it from an sort of customer grouping point of view,
Grainger showed nice acceleration in the government and the retail channels. Maybe you could just sort of
talk about anything unusual or potentially recurring that is going to sustain that trend and maybe in the
context of just general outgrowth levers that may be materializing anew as you look towards the end of
this year and into 2021.

Yes, I think it's important to understand what retail is. Retail is mostly distribution centers that go direct
to customer. We don't do a lot of sort of walk-in retail business. We're more sort of the distribution centers
that obviously have more safety needs and other needs. So that has obviously been growing as an
industry as the pandemic has happened, and so we've been there supporting our customers through that.
So that is a trend that we believe will continue as we move forward. What was the other -- I'm sorry. What
was the other segment you mentioned?

Justin Laurence Bergner
G. Research, LLC

Government accelerating, which would sort of be surprising in light of pandemic sales being decelerating.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, yes, the government sales have been strong, and a lot of that has been pandemic as
governments try to find product to support their communities during this time. And so that's a lot of state
government business. Military has been okay as well for federal, but certainly state governments have
been very, very busy as each of them has tried to fight the pandemic. And we've been there trying to help
as much as possible.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

D.G., Tom, I just have a couple of quick ones here. [indiscernible] next year [indiscernible] I'm just
wondering if there's a way for you to quantify the amount of revenue from pandemic that could be a
headwind for next year. It sounds like you still expect pretty good share gains. You've said 300 to 400
basis points, but I just wanted to check to see if there's any major issues on that front in terms of the
pandemic sales into next year.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think we're like -- we're definitely going to talk about that in January with our results, like I said
before. Right now and as we head into the winter, given what we're seeing with case counts, we expect
pandemic sales to be elevated through the fall and into the winter. That would be our expectation. We
will reevaluate as we go forward to really understand what the puts and takes are, but if pandemic sales
go down, we think nonpandemic sales will go up because that would mean the pandemic isn't as much
of a problem. And again that's -- that helps our gross profit when that happens, and probably overall
profitability rates. So we don't really know. I think it's impossible to tell what's going to happen with
pandemic products. At some point, it will be a headwind, but other things then won't be a headwind, and
that's our expectation.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, makes sense. And then last one real quick, on Zoro. Are -- the added SKUs year-to-date, is that all
third-party related? And since you're skewing mix more in that direction, I just want to check and see if
there are any big differences in how you report the revenue or the margin or the type of margin you get
when you ship third-party versus Grainger-owned inventory.

W.W. GRAINGER, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Yes. So a lot of the new product adds are third party. Some are through the Grainger supply chain. Third-
party items tend to be lower SG&A and slightly lower margin -- gross margin, but most of the time, we're
working with high-quality companies that have very good fulfillment capabilities. And so that's one of our
important sorts as we develop partners that actually add to our assortment. So there's really no difference
in how we report it, but it is going to be a bigger factor for us going forward. We're going to continue to
add third-party shippers, and that's a big part of what we're doing.

Thomas B. Okray
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The only thing I would add, Patrick, is the accounting difference is whether you're an agent or not
when you're doing third party, but that's a minor nuance. So thanks for the question.

Operator

Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over
to management for any further or closing comments.

Donald G. Macpherson
Chairman & CEO

All right. So this is D.G. So thanks, everyone, for joining us. We really appreciate it.

We feel good about our results in the quarter. We feel really good about our forward prospects. Obviously
there's a ton of uncertainty in terms of how the market is going to evolve, and probably more than
anybody, we'd like for the pandemic to be behind us, but we know it's not. And so we're going to make
sure we continue to support our customers through this. That's the first and most important thing we're
going to do. And we're going to make sure we take care of our team members. And we're going to make
sure we do things that are prudent both for the current performance of the business but for long term.
And we feel like we're taking the right actions and in really good position to succeed both during the
pandemic and beyond.

So thanks for joining us today, and I hope you all stay safe.

Operator
Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and
have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
