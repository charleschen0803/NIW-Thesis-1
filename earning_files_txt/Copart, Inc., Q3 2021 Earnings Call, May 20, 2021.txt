COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Just a
reminder, today's conference is being recorded.

For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart
Inc. Please go ahead, sir.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures,
which include adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, foreign currency-
related gains, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option
exercises. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday.
We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in
analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance.

In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal
securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and
uncertainties in our markets, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you
to the section titled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, and
each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of
today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.

So with the disclosure out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Liaw, President.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Thank you, John. We're pleased to report our record financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. I
wanted to start first with -- by extending a thank you to our team in the field around the world and here
at headquarters for their resilience and agility over the past 14 months. For over a year now, we faced
the challenge of providing excellent service to our customers while keeping our people and communities
safe. And I'm grateful and proud for our team for having delivered on both. We take very seriously our
responsibility as an essential business in keeping our roads and support infrastructure clear for the
movement of people and things.

I'll start with some of the key statistics that we share each quarter, and I'll close with some remarks about
the future before turning it over to John for a review of the financial results specifically. For the quarter,
we experienced global unit sales increase of 3% for the quarter with a U.S. increase of 4.5% and an
international decline of 5%. We have observed more pronounced shutdowns internationally in certain
countries in which we operate, and they are likewise adopting more protracted reopening plans than we're
experiencing here in the U.S.

Our insurance business, specifically, was slightly below the third quarter 2020 volumes, down
approximately 3%, but effectively flat with 2019. This is the product of lower driving activity, of course, as
driving activity remains suppressed relative to the norm, and also decreased claims frequency, offset by
increases in total loss frequency and share gain.

Our U.S. noninsurance business grew approximately 30% in unit volume year-over-year. This is also
a reflection of strong used vehicle price -- a strong used vehicle price environment combined with our
auction liquidity and sales efforts across noninsurance categories.

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

Our dealer business, in particular, increased 26% in unit volume year-over-year, compared to what
we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms that serve dealers. This is a
reflection of the flywheel effect we've talked about on earnings calls. Previously, our growing auction
liquidity enables us to serve an expanding set of vehicles. And then those additional vehicles, of course,
further enhance our liquidity as well.

Our global inventory at the end of April increased 16% versus a year ago. That's comprised of a year-
over-year increase of 21% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 13% for international inventory, a reflection
of the dynamics described a moment ago.

On average selling prices, our ASPs increased worldwide, 48% year-over-year for the quarter. Our ASP
strength is a reflection of both of market dynamics as well as our own member recruitment, and --
member recruitment and retention efforts as we cultivate more buyers worldwide. We'll comment more on
that in a moment as well.

The ASP increase is not primarily due to mix shift effects. Our insurance ASPs in the U.S., for example,
were up more than 50% year-over-year.

And while growth in used car prices have, of course, contributed to our ASP growth, our selling price
growth has far exceeded the overall used car price environment, reflection, again, of our marketing and
member recruitment capabilities and our broad global reach to emerging economies who are increasingly
buyers of vehicles from our markets.

Our auction liquidity itself also continues to grow as we observed sequentially and year-over-year, more
domestic and international bidders and bids per unit, a reflection of both of supply growth, of course, as
well as our active cultivation of those buyers.

The natural questions that we would all pose would be what the aftermath of the pandemic might be to
our business. It's certainly challenging to separate signal from noise given the abundance of confounding
and extreme variables at the moment. My comments will largely be U.S.-centric, but will apply, by and
large, to the rest of our markets as well.

I thought I'd take a minute to talk about some of our long-term assumptions and how they may have
been affected or not by the pandemic.

First, on driving activity. It does appear to be rebounding, but certainly still suppressed relative to pre-
pandemic levels, in particular with commuting traffic still down 25% to 30% or more based on sources
like Google Maps, among others. Due to increasing vaccine availability, there is certainly line of sight to
reopening more fully here in the U.S. and our other markets appear to be 3 to 6 months or thereabouts
behind the reopening sequence of the U.S.

Longer term, we continue to expect modest increases in per capita driving as we've observed over the
past 50 years. Mobility remains essential for employment, education, health care, leisure and every other
aspect of our existence. We do anticipate perhaps some increase in virtual work arrangements, but offset
by a shift from various forms of other mass transit in favor of driving.

Accident and claims frequency have declined during the pandemic, as you know, though, with increasing
severity due to higher speed driving and increasing distracted driving. Long term, we expect a
continuation of a decade-long trend to a very modest decline in accident frequency over time due to the
gradual penetration of safety technologies and new car shipments, which then in turn, eventually make
their way to the operating fleet. We do, however, expect an increasing severity over time as well as those
safety technologies also become more expensive to repair as well.

On the question of our average selling prices, I would note the longer-term trends in favor of higher
ASPs. Certainly, there have been near-term pandemic effects. But over time, say, over 10-years plus, it
has been demand from emerging economies for wrecked vehicles from our markets, from the U.S., from
U.K., Canada, Germany, Spain, the Middle East and Finland and elsewhere, combined with our member
cultivation efforts that have driven ASP growth over time.

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

I'd acknowledge that we're seeing an unusual historic moment for used car valuations given the supply
shortage for new cars. But we have experienced, with the exception of the third quarter of last year, the
very beginning of the pandemic, we've now experienced year-over-year increases in prices for 17 straight
quarters. So we think that there are elements of the selling prices, certainly that will prove much more
durable over time.

Our operating and strategic decisions are predicated on the expectation of a volume recovery post
pandemic, as well as long-term growth post pandemic, largely consistent thematically with what we've
experienced over the past 4 years. We're grateful for our strong financial performance this quarter and
excited to continue investing in our customers' future and our own.

And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North.

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Jeff. As we mentioned, I'll make a few brief comments on our results to provide a little more
color on the earlier remarks. And then we'll be happy to take a few questions this morning.

Global revenue increased $184 million or 33%, including an $8 million benefit due to currency. Global
service revenue increased $132 million or 27%, primarily due to higher ASPs. The U.S. service revenue
grew 27% and international experienced an increase of 23%.

Purchased vehicle sales increased $51 million or 87% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes. U.S.
purchased vehicle revenue was up 103% over the prior year, and international grew by 64%. As a result,
purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by almost $11
million overall.

Global gross profit increased by $138 million or 57%, and our gross margin percentage improved by
approximately 788 basis points to 52%. U.S. margins improved from 46% to 55%, and international
margins increased from 32% to 37%. Both segment's margin improvement was driven primarily by higher
ASPs.

Moving to G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and G&A and depreciation expense, our spend
increased $2.2 million from $37 million a year ago to $39 million in 2021. We anticipate G&A will be lumpy
quarter-to-quarter, but will continue to improve as a percentage of revenue over time as we grow. As a
result, our GAAP operating income increased by 68% from $195 million to $328 million, we delivered 926
basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs and controlling
costs.

Net interest expense decreased $0.2 million or 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lapping last year's
decision to draw on our revolver in the initial days of the pandemic to ensure adequate liquidity. Q3
income tax expense was $36.7 million at an 11.4% effective tax rate, reflecting a $20 million tax benefit
from the effect of certain discrete income tax items and a $5 million tax benefit on the exercise of
employee stock options, both of which have been adjusted out for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings
included in our earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 19%.

In summary, GAAP net income increased 95% from $147 million last year to $267 million this year.
Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefits described above, non-GAAP net income
increased $89.8 million from $138 million last year to $262 million in the third quarter of '21. For the first
9 months of fiscal '21, GAAP net income increased 27% from $534 million last year to $681 million this
year, and non-GAAP net income increased 44% from $447 million last year to $642 million this year.

Now to briefly highlight our liquidity and cash flow. As of April 30, we had $2 billion of liquidity comprised
of $912 million of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of
over $1 billion. This is an increase of $434 million over July 31, 2020. Operating cash flow for the quarter
increased by $75 million year-over-year to $369 million, primarily driven by stronger earnings that were
partially offset by working capital consumed by building consignment on inventory.

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

We invested $81.2 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, approximately 95% of this amount was
attributable to capacity expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity for additional
business and creates a wider economic moat for defense to market entrants given the difficulty in sourcing
appropriately zoned facilities.

In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong durable cash flow enable us to continue to
make decisions for the long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders.
And with that is the end of the prepared remarks. We're happy to take some questions.

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Labick with CJS Securities.

Peter Kirk Lukas
CJS Securities, Inc.

It's Pete Lukas for Bob. Just wondering if you could discuss how -- if you could just talk about how
increased supply demand imbalance impact auctions other than price? I.e., are cars selling faster, less
service needed, your ability to raise fees? Anything you can comment there.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Pete, thanks for the question. I'm not sure I entirely follow. But certainly, the high -- if you're talking
about the strong used car price environment, I think it has helped with conversion on the margin of
consigned vehicles to us from dealers. But by and large, I don't think there are any unusual effects other
than what has already been reflected in price. Everything else in terms of bidding activity, of course, has
been true for many years, where we talk about having more domestic and international bidders and bids
and bids per unit. That's been a recurring theme since before the pandemic.

Peter Kirk Lukas
CJS Securities, Inc.

Great. And sticking with dealers you mentioned there. Can you just kind of talk about -- I think you
had mentioned Copart taking some significant share there. What advantages or disadvantages does
Copart have? And in terms of dealer cars, are you seeing them sell disproportionately internationally or
domestically, or a similar mix to your overall?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I'd say, in the first instance, similar, but indexed more internationally because they tend to be higher value
cars than our insurance cars. So the insurance mix will include some very low-value cars that end up
transacting almost locally. Though economically, the ones that matter, of course, are the higher end units.
Those tend to go internationally, as do the dealer cars as well.

In terms of the share capture you described. As with all of our customers, the -- what matters to them
are the results in the end. What are the delivered prices that we can achieve at auction. So it's auction
liquidity and prices that matter the most to dealers by far, and we continue to deliver for them and thus
earn the right to sell still more of their cars.

Peter Kirk Lukas
CJS Securities, Inc.

Great. And just one last one for me, sticking with dealer cars. Do all your dealer cars go to a Copart
location? Or can you sell them without bringing them to a yard? And if not, do you anticipate being able to
do that in the future?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think we're today not commenting long-term on where our products might go. Today, when a vehicle
sells either before or after it is sold, it is still -- it is brought to a Copart location.

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

Great. Very helpful. Congrats on the quarter.

Operator

Our next question is from Stephanie Benjamin with Truist.

Stephanie Lynn Benjamin
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to touch a little bit on some of the demand levels you're seeing, particularly from international
buyers. Do you feel like they're buying at a greater rate than we saw pre-COVID levels? I'm just trying to
get a function of what has been lower assignments versus the supply side and just the demand level. So
I'm just trying to get an idea of how healthy the buyers are at this point of time.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I would describe the buyers is very healthy in the aggregate. The international buyers are purchasing --
are bidding and purchasing, plus or minus the same rates as they were pre pandemic. Now that's with
everything having shifted very meaningfully. With ASPs up 48%, they tend to buy higher value cars on
average than our domestic buyers, and their activity has grown proportionately during the pandemic.

Stephanie Lynn Benjamin
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then I'd love to get an update on where you stand internationally, particularly with the
Germany operation and continuing to switch over to a consignment model. I believe, beforehand, you
were doing some pilots with the consignment model. So any update there?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Briefly so. We continue to invest in Germany in the form of land, technology, people and infrastructure. We
are, as you know, selling vehicles on a consignment basis for multiple insurance carriers, as well as selling
vehicles as a principal there as well, as I think we described in much, much greater detail probably 6, 7, 8
earnings calls ago.

But we continue to make good progress there. We are -- the key lynchpin, as you noted, being to
convert the market to a Copart-style auction and growth settlement, away from the historical listing
service/net settlement model. The results continue to bear out. This is an economically superior path
for insurance carriers long term as well as a superior policyholder experience as well. So nothing has
particularly changed in our approach, and our results continue to warrant further investment in Germany
and elsewhere in Western Europe.

Stephanie Lynn Benjamin
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then last for me, more high level. I'm curious, especially given the events over the last year,
as well as some significant investments that you guys have made. But when you guys have conversations
with your insurance customers, as well as even some of your noninsurance customers where clearly that
business is growing, what are they asking for from you guys as a preferred partner? What are they looking
for in terms of services, digital tools? And has that changed at all in the last year?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Great question, Stephanie. I think it has changed. I think there is certainly much more virtual work being
done by all participants in the ecosystem, ourselves included. But certainly our insurance carriers, among
others of our sellers. They want more handled virtually more by phone, more by text, more through our
various applications that we provide to them. So that's certainly one of the demands that we have met.

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

It has helped that we've been natively digital, so to speak. We've been operating online-only auctions
since 2003. So this is already a language that we spoke fluently. We've already been operating
internationally, so we know what it means to operate this business remotely in many cases, and we're able
to do so well and to accommodate our customers who, in some cases, had not been accustomed to such
an approach.

So those are some of the specific pandemic-related requests we've gotten for, certainly, video services or
virtual communication in lieu of in-person interaction.

Operator

Our next question is from Craig Kennison with Baird.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

It's really a big picture question that goes to one of your core advantages, which I think is your member
of consolidation and cultivation globally. How would you frame the size and scale of your global buyer
network? And how does it compare to your competition?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think the latter half of your question, Craig, it's harder for us to opine on since we don't have firsthand
visibility into their own buyer network. But I would say this is largely the result of having what I think is a
multiple decade advantage in pursuing the international market.

Being online, I think, is essential to accessing that portion of the marketplace. We have been investing for
years in physical and digital media, in physical infrastructure and physical presence in those markets. We
respond to early signs of a market showing promise as buyers of Copart vehicles. We also will anticipate
certain markets that make sense for Copart vehicles and plant seeds there.

So this is the product of multiple decades of investments in that regard, which we think ultimately
manifests itself at auction in the form of returns. But comparatively difficult for us to know. We do believe
it's a distinct advantage for us.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Thanks, Jeff. And then, John, maybe could you frame your CapEx outlook for this year and maybe the next
couple of years and where you expect to target your investment dollars?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think in short, Craig, we are still very much in investment mode. You may remember from, if I get my
date straight, probably the May 2016 earnings call, when we launched the 20/20/20 initiative, which
was to open 20 new yards and expand 20 yards inside of 20 months. As it turns out, that was not nearly
ambitious enough. We have far exceeded that. And continue to expect to invest in land and infrastructure
for at least the next few years.

I think this is always a dynamic question. As you know, Craig. It takes a long time to permit and acquire
land. We've taken the pandemic as an opportunity to opportunistically turn it up to buy land and perhaps
-- or buy or permit land that perhaps would have previously been difficult to pursue. So we view ourselves
very much still in investment mode.

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

And lastly, maybe just a follow-up on the land acquisition piece. When you buy land, to what extent do
you have knowledge of potential share gains that would immediately consume that land? Or is it not the
case that you can, kind of, align your share gain opportunity with where you acquire that property?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think the -- our aperture is wider than that. It's not per se, customer-specific or even time-bound
narrowly so. I think we buy land when we are currently congested or foresee potential congestion in our
serving the industry broadly, and that could include market share gain in certain markets.

But it's about being a good steward of industry, owning this land to make sure that we can control our own
destiny and deliver that service for our customers for the next 50 years, not the next 3.

So in short, yes, those kind of account-specific considerations certainly factor into our decision. But
overwhelmingly, it's more about just having enough to serve the industry today and tomorrow.

Operator

And our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

A follow-up on that CapEx question. I guess, if you could talk maybe about land investment in U.S. versus
international markets, sort of how much of that CapEx is weighted to geographic expansion. And then if
you could talk a little bit about capacity utilization, you talked about when you feel a congestion building
out incremental real estate. But could you maybe give us a feeling for capacity utilization as we stand?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Sure. To your first question, the strong majority of the capital expenditure is still in what, I think in your
mind, we would characterize as incumbent Copart markets. So that's the U.K., Canada, U.S., Brazil, with
growth to come in Germany and Spain and Western Europe. But that is certainly not a very substantial
portion of the CapEx to date. Your second question, Bret, was?

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Capacity utilization. We sort of looked at your existing real estate footprint. What are we utilizing?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. Capacity utilization, a challenging subject to address directly, in part because our land is not fungible,
as you know. So having excess capacity in City 1 or in Salt Lake City, for example, does not benefit you at
all in Minneapolis or in Miami, and so ends up being a microeconomic decision, not a macroeconomic one.
So we don't actually track measure or reports per se on capacity utilization U.S. wide or certainly, globally
speaking. We look so within metropolitan areas.

And so capacity utilization, then we target our CapEx based on where capacity utilization is either high
today or could be high or could be high in a catastrophic event. So we'll factor all of that into those
microeconomic decisions. But it isn't, by and large, an overall global -- we are 2% higher than we were a
year ago. That's not a metric that guides our business.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then a quick question on ASP. You said that it was not really mix-driven, but it sounds like the
dealer cars are typically higher value. Could you sort of just give us, sort of, a description of how -- what a

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

dealer car looks like versus the company average, maybe transaction value? Or -- and is the fee structure
comparable for dealer cars as it is for the insurance business?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

The -- our auction platform, regardless of the source of the vehicle, has the same fee structure, so to
speak. So as a buyer at one of our auctions you would -- you would be indifferent as to the source of the
vehicle.

In terms of the selling price, we haven't provided a specific disclosure, but it is higher, meaningfully higher
than our average insurance car. Though they -- over time, I think it is the rising insurance values as well.
It is increasing total loss frequency. It is the safety technology that makes the "typical Copart salvage
car" look a whole lot more like a drivable car than a wrecked vehicle that will be parted or dismantled or
melted down for metal. It's that big shift over time that I think is expanding the relevant dealer universe
to us as well.

So there is some overlap, certainly. But I view them as both curves. The curve for the dealer car certainly
has its midpoint higher than the curve for insurance vehicles, but with heavy and increasing overlap as
well.

Operator

Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Jeff, you noted the increased buyers, particularly in emerging markets, are improving liquidity. First, sorry
if I missed this, but did you provide global bidder growth or buyer activity growth in the quarter?

And then secondly, are you seeing the mix of international bidders increase from newer countries? Or is it
further penetration of existing markets where you already kind of have a foothold?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Okay. Fair question. We didn't disclose specifically the percentage increase, so to speak, but did note that
we're increasing domestic buyers, bids and bids per unit, both domestically and internationally for the
quarter.

So I think we -- and that has been true for many quarters. You can go back and check the transcripts, but
I think we've said that virtually every time we've been on the phone.

In terms of the mix of countries, that is -- both are true. It is -- and it's -- there are some microeconomic
considerations here. Some countries will have a stronger currency one quarter than others or 1 year
than others, and so you'll see some shift over time. You'll see local economic variables also fluctuate.
Obviously, all the work by the pandemic, so that's the ultimate confounding variable. But in general, we'll
see countries ebb and flow. I think that's the benefit of having a true global platform that's online, is that
we smooth all of that activity in effect by accessing the world's economies, period.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And to follow-up on that, just a theoretical question on the international buyer. If prices
keep going up at auction, which it makes sense why they are and maybe why they will, is there a limit
or a natural limit where they still need to make money on the back side of that purchase to where ARPU
or ASPs cannot continue to increase? Or maybe how do you guys think about that, just longer-term, as a
factor in your business?

President & CEO of North America

I think the specific answer to the question is for an individual buyer, certainly, there is some truth to that,
that they have to make a margin for whatever their ultimate activity is, to rebuild the car, restore the car
and sell it again into a used car price environment. So certainly for a given buyer, they would tap out at
some point.

I think the reason, however, that our international demand has grown so much is that, that's not a
static buyer. The number of countries and the population share of that country, which has access to an
automobile and will want access to an automobile is what drives international demand over time. So it's
that there are more countries with more of a desire for U.S., U.K., Canadian, Middle East used cars, that's
what drives the growth over time, not a specific buyer per se. But there are more countries.

And countries grow wealthier, as you well know, the U.S. and Western Europe have the richest economies
and certainly, China, Japan and Asian countries as well. But in many -- in most cases, the wealthiest
countries per capita have the most cars per capita, also have the slowest GDP growth rates as well. So the
faster-growing economies with an appetite for vehicles that you and I and everyone on this call takes for
granted, very much wants access to a vehicle for education, for employment, for health care, leisure, all
the reasons we cited a moment ago. And that trend, I think, is a 50-year trend that will not abate.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

That's perfect. Really helpful color. And then last one. On the noninsurance, I think you mentioned total
units were up 30, dealers were up 26. Both are impressive, but that does imply something else, with
noninsurance is up well over 30, to bring that average up. Curious what other sources of volume within
noninsurance were outperforming this quarter to get you to that 30% unit growth?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think it's probably not. I think sharing that level of detail, I think, will be maybe sharing more noise than
signal. But in general, the rest of that segment includes [indiscernible] cars, wholesalers, rental car fleets,
banks and the like. So it's -- as you know, noninsurance is a bit of a catch-all for us. We certainly think
of them individually as separate businesses or separate customer sets to serve. And collectively, as you
know, they grew more than that 26%. But I think more detail than that would be more confusing than
helpful.

Our next question is from Ali Faghri with Guggenheim.

Ali-Ahmad Faghri
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I guess starting on the pricing strength. Is there anything that's occurred during the pandemic, changes
in the industry dynamics or your company specifically, that would suggest ASPs could remain structurally
higher even after some of the more cyclical factors like constrained used car supply and higher pricing
normalize?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Ali, I think the -- what I'd point you to is the -- before the pandemic even, I think it would have been 3
straight years, maybe more than that. Every quarter, year-over-year increases in ASPs. I think the total
loss frequency dynamic is the most important driver of our business long term, and it naturally drives
ASPs upward as insurance carriers find it more economically rational -- more economically favorable
to total more cars over time. Those marginal cars are better and better vehicles, less damaged. They
are ones with cameras and sensors taken out, not drivetrains. And those have a very wide-ranging set

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

of buyers who want those vehicles. So I think there's a lot to our ASP growth over the years, which is
secular. There certainly are cyclical factors.

5 years ago, we used to talk about scrap metal prices, which are obviously less relevant today. Today,
we're talking about used car prices. Clearly relevant to us, but I think there are secular portions of this
ASP growth, which will prove more durable. How exactly, I think, is -- what is exactly attributable to either,
I think, is obviously a difficult intellectual exercise to isolate those variables.

Ali-Ahmad Faghri
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And I guess just as a follow-up, has the recent surge in pricing caused insurance companies
to maybe change the way they think about the total loss formula, perhaps factoring in salvage pricing to
a greater degree than what they've done historically, which should help increase total losses maybe at a
faster rate than in the past?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I'd say, overall, we have seen total loss frequency increase during the pandemic and as we anniversary the
pandemic. We haven't seen a dramatic shift either. It's more a continuation of the many decade-long trend
that I think you're well aware of, Ali, as well.

If we were in 1980, at total loss frequency of 4%; today, north of 20% -- total loss recency over 40 years
has grown fivefold. I'd say, over the course of the past year, we've seen a continuation of that trend, not a
dramatic shift.

The reason for that is that, of course, the used car price environment has been strong as well. And as you
know, the higher the value of the intact car before the accident, the more prone the carriers are to repair
it. So we have had the offsetting effect of very strong salvage returns, which would otherwise, all else
equal, drive more volume to total loss. We've also had increasing used car values themselves, which all
else equal, would drive more cars to repair. The net effect of that, I think, is a gradual continuation of the
favorable trend we've seen for 4 years.

Ali-Ahmad Faghri
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Do all insurance companies factor in salvage returns into their total loss formula?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think to varying degrees. Some carriers will evaluate that economic proposition on every car. Others,
meaning they will literally access our machine learning-enabled pricing tool, we call ProQuote, which
estimates the value that an insurance carrier can achieve at auction. And some carriers will run a
ProQuote for every prospective total loss or literally every claim to see if it makes economic sense to total
the car.

Others will rely more on rules of thumb that the repair cost exceeds x percent of the intact value of the
car. And use those guideposts to make total loss decisions. Over time, more and more are accessing that
specific economic decision, which I think leads to a better economic outcome for them.

Ali-Ahmad Faghri
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. Appreciate that color. And last one for me is with nearly $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet,
can you talk about your priorities for deploying that capital? I know investing in capacity is your priority,
and you're still very much in investment mode per your earlier comments. But it does seem like you're
going to have excess cash beyond that. So I want to see how you think about maybe potential M&A and
buybacks specifically and how you balance those two?

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

John F. North
Senior VP & CFO

Ali, it's John. I think, obviously, the first priority is capacity investment. As you mentioned, as we've talked
about and has been the trend over the past number of years, all the way back to '16 with the 20/20/20
plan, that story remains a primary focus. There are obviously other markets in Western Europe. Our
expansion in Germany, Spain and otherwise, that are there as well. And then we've been opportunistic to
earn capital to shareholders at times in our past. We think that makes sense.

I think overall, we like the flexibility. We think that we've been able to take actions in the pandemic that
wouldn't have otherwise been possible without the balance sheet that we had. And so I think we view that
as a structural advantage we want to maintain.

And other than that, we're capitalists. So we're certainly thinking about how to generate the highest
return on capital overall, return on invested capital for our shareholders.

Operator

Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

The first one is on the deployment of 360 technology. Just wanted to see where you stand in terms of the
rollout of the technology, how prevalent do you think this will be across your inventory. And early, but are
you seeing any kind of measurable impact on selling prices because of the technology?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

In a word, I think those are the kind of variables that are very hard to isolate, Chris, in very -- in a very
dynamic environment, right, in which there are a number of variables changing at the same time.

For us, the technology, including the one you described, like 360, among other such technologies,
important for us in terms of the service that we provide sellers. They have use cases for images like that.
And so we track that certainly very carefully to make sure we're providing them the best possible service.

I don't think we're in a good position to talk about differential auction returns. I don't think there is a
fundamental -- there's not a fundamental shift attributable to 360 particularly.

Christopher James Bottiglieri
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Got you. That's interesting. And then two, can you talk more about the dealer consignment channel? Are
you seeing increased engagement on the buy side of the equation? Not the sourcing, but the buy side
of the equation as inventories become more constrained in the industry? And is this having any kind of
flywheel effect on your ability to source more vehicles from these same dealers?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think in a word, yes, but I'm not sure it's unique to the moment. By that, I mean the dealers have grown
as a share of our activity on both the sell-side and buy side and define more broadly to include not just
U.S. and Canadian dealers, but dealers all around the world, right? A dealer who buys a car and sells it as
is, or a dealer who buys, will recondition it to some extent, and then sell as is. That has been very much
part of the flywheel effect over the past 10 years, 20 years-plus.

Operator

And our next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.

Ryan J. Brinkman

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to ask again around inflation, just given it is now a larger part of the national conversation and
given the quarter looks to have benefited from higher used car and metals prices. But primarily, I'd like to
try to zero in, if I can, on the value of your land holding.

So I've been seeing these headlines about how the average price of a home has risen by an incredible,
like 16.2% year-over-year in April. And haven't really seen or done much research into what the price of,
say, undeveloped land or land generally has done. But I've seen some other articles recently about big
increases in the value of farmland, et cetera.

So just wanted to get your sense of what might be happening with the value of your land, given that
you've been out there in the marketplace so much in recent years, buying land, I would think that you
would have a good sense of the value of your existing properties, too. So what is happening with the value
of the land?

And given that it doesn't get captured into the P&L., how are you thinking about -- or are you thinking
about any actions to ensure that increased value gets reflected into the equity value of the company? I
know you have historically preferred to be conservatively capitalized. But would you ever consider maybe
like sale leasebacks to raise capital for shareholder-friendly actions? Or any other kind of actions to try to
tap into the value of that land? Or even just put some estimates out there for shareholders to see so that
they could better appreciate any increase in the value that you might have captured here?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Got it. I certainly appreciate the question and appreciate the thoughts. I think history would show that the
shareholder friendliest action we have taken is to buy the land and hold it forever. And we view that also
as the customer friendliest approach as well. And that we own the land, we control it, we are the stewards
of that facility, that capacity on behalf of the insurance industry for the next 50 years-plus. So that, to me,
is overwhelmingly the default approach that we would take.

As to your question, your IR question more narrowly about how to ensure that, that value is reflected in
our stock price, I think to some extent, that's academic for us. We own it. We use it. We have virtually
never repurposed land that have been permitted for Copart use in part because it's so hard to achieve
that. We don't repurpose it for other uses. We will -- we are there today and tomorrow to serve the
insurance carriers and to serve our expanding noninsurance sellers as well.

So I think -- unfortunately, I think the intention, I know your question is good, but the outcome is
effectively academic for us. That land is there to serve our customers.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Very helpful. And then I'd be curious if you have any thoughts on this emerging digital dealer-to-dealer
marketplace that ACV auctions and Car Global's Trade rev and backlot cars businesses you operate in. Is
that a market that you might be interested in participating in?

I was just thinking that given that you're primarily a salvage car auction company and need to have, I
think, capacity, including surge capacity for cat type events, et cetera, if that might be a way to sort of
participate more in the whole car market without crowding out space on your lots for salvage cars?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

We certainly evaluate and consider strategic extensions of the source that you described a moment ago.
So I think we recognize that the world is evolving in terms of how vehicles transact. As we noted earlier on
the call, we were the first to move rather dramatically in 2003, I think it was less conventionally obvious at
the time to move to a pure digital auction platform. We did that 18 years ago.

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

So as for additional shifts from here, we certainly evaluate, experiment, et cetera, as to how we can
achieve a still greater share of the market over time.

I would note that it is against the backdrop of companies of the sort you described, who are running
digital-only auctions, who are performing services on-site at the dealer and so forth. It is against that
backdrop that we continued to grow that dealer business, healthy double-digit rates for years now. So I
think that speaks to the power of auction liquidity as well.

So the one thing that -- with money, you can replicate an app and inspectors and so forth. With money,
I'm not sure you can replicate auction liquidity and many thousands of bidders and buyers attending
online auctions globally, right? We will help you achieve the absolute highest and best use and value for
your car, whether it's here or Estonia or Honduras or Poland or wherever it might be. I think the -- many
of the other platforms out there cannot achieve the same.

Ryan J. Brinkman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Interesting. And then just last question, I wanted to ask about the types of things that you consider
within your wheelhouse to auction. I know that you've obviously focused on salvage cars, but now also
increasingly on whole cars and have gotten more into sort of the crash toys market, right, with personal
watercraft and the motorcycles.

I don't know if you're doing ATVs or just what other things you might potentially consider doing, heavier
equipment, RVs? I don't know. I was at one of your auction yards, it was 10-plus years ago, but you were
auctioning then some like fire damaged or smoke damaged furniture, something like that. I don't know if
that's ever anything that you would consider again, any sort of tangential moves. Or you've got enough
balls in there already. What do you think?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

I think that's a long-term possibility, though I think furniture is low on that priority list. But we have
extended our auction technology and approach to other arenas. As you know, we acquired National
Powersports Auctions, which is not per se in the salvage business, but sells motorcycles, watercraft and
other power sports equipment on behalf of financial institutions as well as dealers. And that we continue to
expand that business as well.

So with -- we do believe that our auction technology our logistics management, our understanding of
the regulatory environment, et cetera, could well be applicable to other markets. We would experiment
cautiously and thoughtfully because our core business is obviously critical to us in serving our existing
customers in our existing markets well as priority #1. But we would consider other such extensions as
well.

Our next question is from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.

Could I get what your global inventories were up or down in the quarter? I didn't get a chance to write

COPART, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2021

16% year-over-year. Okay. And then just a question on the dealer market. How has -- over the years, how
has the profile changed of the kind of car you're selling? My understanding of it is that, initially, it was --
the target market was the 10 to 15-year-old car that the wholesaler was taking off the dealers' hands.

Have you, I guess, downstreamed that to a younger kind of vehicle? You're seeing a lot more of that now?
And is the real competitive advantage that you have is that auction liquidity that allows you to compete
with some of these online platforms that are proliferating in the market?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Yes. In a word, yes. So the cars have become younger so to speak, over time, in accordance with our
insurance volume as well. So as the insurance industry used to total "old cars", badly damaged cars, and
increasingly, we're seeing lighter damage and newer vehicles because of the severity and repair costs and
sensors, that [indiscernible].

As that market has shifted in that direction and, therefore, bought buyers to bear, so too then do more
of the dealer cars become addressable as well. If you went back 20 years ago, I imagine a good portion
of the dealer cars would have been actual wrecked cars that were -- for which the policyholder only had
liability coverage. Perhaps didn't have collision, didn't want to fund the money to repair the car himself
or herself, ended up at a dealer, sold for cash and traded in for another car. Those might have been a
meaningful portion of the cars that we were selling.

Nowadays, however, I think it is now more like drivable whole cars, certainly newer than they were a
decade ago.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from John Healy with North Coast Research.

John Michael Healy
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

I wanted to ask kind of a big picture trend question. Jeff, when you look at kind of electrification and think
about how that's coming into the car population, how do you see electric vehicles compared to combustion
engine vehicles in terms of stacking up, in terms of total loss frequency?

And are the proceeds of those vehicles materially different than what you see with kind of your historical
book of business. Just kind of curious what the initial findings are there.

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Sure. In short, the electric vehicles outperform the average combustion engine vehicle at auction. The
returns are meaningfully higher. I think the root cause of that I think may well be the electric vehicles tend
to be cars with a lot of sensors, a lot of technology on the perimeter, more exotic materials in the car to
lower the weight and so forth.

So in many cases, they total more easily. But the returns we generate at auction are some of the highest
that we achieved for any kinds of vehicles we sell. So I think the total loss proposition is promising there.
I think repairs are difficult, so severity tends to be high. Our repair infrastructure, the handful of public
companies, you know, as well as the extensive mom-and-pop network around the U.S. The insurance
carriers rely on, the U.S., U.K., Canada, everywhere, that the insurance carriers rely on, in most cases, are
well equipped to manage repairs of combustion engine vehicles, not yet so for electric cars. So if anything,
I think that's a tailwind in our favor, and the severity will prove to be more extreme still for electric cars.

John Michael Healy
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Great. And then just another theoretical question. With the noninsurance business becoming an even
bigger part of the puzzle for you guys, as you look at that business, how do you react and how do you feel

about potentially getting into aspects of the floor plan financing business? I think it's a polarizing business,
but it's proven to have some pretty good returns to it.

So just kind of curious how you see that as -- how you'd rate that as an opportunity for the company
going forward?

Jeffrey Liaw
President & CEO of North America

Sure. I think it's a -- floor plan financing, certainly, broadly available, by and large, for a given credit
qualified dealer or buyer for a car. So that's a space that we would consider, but carefully so. It's obviously
different in many respects from what we do day-to-day.

And so the banking business, not something that has to date been a priority for us to enter. But the kind
of thing that along with auctioning other products and so forth, it's in our strategic window but has not
been a priority.
