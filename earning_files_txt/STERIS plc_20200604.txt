Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to STERIS Plc First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Julie Winter, Investor Relations. Ms. Winter, the
floor is yours ma'am.

Julie Winter
Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President
and CEO; Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer.

I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast
contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission
or rebroadcast of this call without the expressed written consent of STERIS is strictly prohibited. Some
of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements.
Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements, including, without limitation, those risk factors described in STERIS' securities filings. The
company's does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new
information or future events or developments. STERIS' SEC filings are available through the company and
on our website.

In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share,
segment operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used.
Additional information regarding these measures, including definitions, is available in our release, including
reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are
presented during this call with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial
information, used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational
decision-making.

With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to
review the highlights of our first quarter performance.

For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a decline in volume, offset by
70 basis points of favorable price. As a reminder, healthcare capital equipment revenue in the quarter
reflects a onetime benefit of $15 million for a change in the timing of revenue recognition.

You may recall that when we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard at the beginning
of fiscal 2019, our operating room integration capital equipment products required significant on-site
system configuration during the installation process. As a result, we were required to defer all revenue
until installation was complete. Since then, we have enhanced the design of our OR product line, which
allows for full assembly and configuration of the equipment in our plant before shipment and simplifies the
installation process. As a result, revenue is recognized based on the shipping terms, consistent with other
capital equipment products.

In addition, constant currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $10 million from
prior year tuck-in acquisitions, primarily in health care, spread across capital equipment, consumables
and service. Excluding both of these items, total company constant currency organic revenue would have
declined 8%.

STERIS PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Gross margin for the quarter was about flat at 44.1% and was impacted favorably by mix and price,
somewhat offset by lower productivity due to reduced volumes. EBIT margin for the quarter was 21.3%
of revenue, an increase of 180 basis points from the first quarter last year, due in part to approximately a
$5 million benefit from the change in the timing of revenue recognition, as I noted earlier, as well as lower
travel expenses, compensation-related costs and sales and marketing expenses.

The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.3% and includes the benefit of stock compensation
deduction. Net income in the quarter grew 6% to $111.8 million and earnings increased to $1.31 per
diluted share.

Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of
$255.6 million, access to available credit lines and a leverage ratio below 1.5x debt to EBITDA, we are well
positioned from a liquidity standpoint. During the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $66.9 million, while
depreciation and amortization was $49 million. The increase in capital expenditures versus the prior year
is related to expansion projects within the AST segment.

Free cash flow for the quarter was $67.4 million, an increase over the first quarter of last year, primarily
due to improvements in working capital and deferred tax payments under government programs.

With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our solid overall performance in the first quarter reflects
the diversified nature of STERIS' business across our medical device, pharma and healthcare customers.
Collectively, our constant currency organic revenue declined just 3%, while adjusted earnings increased
compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. Given the circumstances, we are very pleased with those
overall results.

Healthcare, our biggest segment, most impacted by the reduction in deferrable procedure revenue,
declined 10% with mixed performance across the segment. Healthcare consumables were down 28% for
the quarter, but we generally saw monthly sequential increases culminating in near prior year levels by
the end of June. As we discussed last quarter, our endoscopy business continued to be one of the most
impacted areas for STERIS, but it is following the same trend as the rest of consumables.

Service declined 10%, but also witnessed similar trends as consumable products, with June returning to
prior year levels in our equipment service business.

In Healthcare capital equipment, which grew 6% in Q1, shipments continued from strong backlog entering
the year as well as the $15 million benefit in ORI that Mike mentioned earlier. I would add that this benefit
in revenue also reduced Healthcare backlog by the same $15 million as those shipments were recognized.
Even with that reduction, we ended the quarter at $164 million of Healthcare capital backlog down just
$8 million compared to the first quarter of last year when the ORI change is taken into account and up $9
million sequentially from Q4 with the same adjustment.

As I've commented before, we would not be surprised to see Healthcare capital equipment come under
some pressure over the coming quarters, particularly replacement equipment, some of which can be
delayed by our customers.

Turning to AST, which serves medical device customers, that business's revenue was flat with the prior
year. This was largely the result of continued elevated demand for PPE sterilization, offsetting a reduction
in devices for deferrable procedures. Once again, we experienced increased procedural device processing
on a sequential basis within the quarter.

Life Sciences revenue grew 21% in Q1 as we continue to benefit from our pharma customers' expectations
for growth in vaccines and biologics. Supporting that growth, Life Sciences consumables grew 34% versus
last year, which is exceptional performance, driven in part by our customers' desire to build inventory.

STERIS PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

While we would not suggest this growth rate is sustainable, we do continue to see favorable growth trends
for this business.

Our margin and earnings improvement reflected our success in spending reduction, in particular, travel
expenses and variable selling costs, which will generally come back as our businesses return to normal.
In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we chose to avoid unpaid layoffs. Instead, we placed our
underutilized people on short term, fully paid furloughs, some of which were partially subsidized by
governments around the world. We have tracked the costs related to that decision, along with other
COVID costs, about $9 million net of government subsidies and are excluding these items from adjusted
profit in the quarter.

We believe that maintaining our trained and dedicated staff was the right thing to do and is helping us now
support our customers as they ramp up healthcare procedures to normal levels. Our furloughs have been
reduced substantially as businesses come back.

On another note, we have continued to invest in R&D as originally planned, and we expect to do so
going forward. As a result of these factors, we anticipate that our adjusted SG&A dollar spend will rise
as business rebounds. Since we last spoke to you in May, we've witnessed a turnaround in deferrable
procedure volumes in the United States and Europe. While the recovery is still region-by-region and some
COVID hotspots are occurring, we have been pleasantly surprised at how quickly healthcare providers
have been able to bring procedure volumes back. Many of our product lines are now running flat to slightly
up as compared to the prior year.

Although we may see some reductions due to COVID hotspots, we do not expect to return to the low
levels of deferrable procedures experienced in April and May, as healthcare providers have improved their
ability to combat the disease. We believe that STERIS' balanced business model will continue to be a
benefit and remain optimistic that we are well positioned to respond to changes and uncertainties in the
market.

Now changing gears a bit from our financial performance. Yesterday in our earnings release, we
announced the addition of a new Board member, Chris Holland. You may know Chris from his role as CFO
at C.R. Bard prior to their acquisition by Becton, Dickinson. Chris brings a great experience to our Board,
and we are happy to have the benefit of his insights and perspectives.

We also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday, bringing us to $0.40 per share per
quarter and representing our 15th consecutive year of dividend increase. As Mike discussed, our balance
sheet and cash flow remains strong, and we are pleased to be able to continue returning value directly to
our shareholders through our dividend.

As you know, STERIS is an essential business supporting healthcare. We are very fortunate to be in the
business we are in and to be in strong financial position. Our plans to be nimble and ready to support
our customers as needed are already paying off. We believe that our approach to managing through the
pandemic leaves us well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities.

Before we open to questions, we express our respect and gratitude to the health care providers on the
frontlines of the pandemic around the world. These are unprecedented times, and the challenges facing
caregivers have been unexpected and monumental, and they continue to do remarkable work to this day.

We also thank the people of STERIS, those working with our customers in the field and those working
behind the scenes, in our factories, labs, offices and from their own homes in this unusual time. Our team
has done a great job of adjusting to this difficult situation while serving customers and their patients.

Our confidence in our strategic positions and operating capabilities continues to grow. While there is more
uncertainty in the near-term given the COVID situation, both potential upside and downside, we stand
ready to capture opportunities and mitigate risks. We continue to believe that the long-term future for
STERIS is bright.

I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open Q&A.

STERIS PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Dave Turkaly of JMP Securities.

David Louis Turkaly
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

Walt, maybe just to kick it off here. I'd love to get your thoughts given the customer base that you have
on sort of what the state of the consumer is today? Meaning like patients to the hospital, their attitudes
towards surgery and going in? I know you mentioned that monthly your progression improved. I'd just
love to get your high-level thoughts on, do you anticipate that continues ahead? And have you noticed the
difference in terms of the hospitals opening up to the surgery, you said it did come back rather quickly?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Well, the answer is certainly yes. And I think the health care systems around the country and around the
world have done a fantastic job of assuring patients that it is safe to go to their facilities for procedures.
And they've done a number of things and done that in a number of ways. I don't know if you happen to
have been into a hospital or surgery center recently, I have, and the precautions that they are taking are
fantastic, both with their own staffs and with the patients who are coming in. The visitors no longer come
in, so they've taken care of that problem pretty straightforwardly.

There are all kinds of methods that they've used. And again, we're talking to them all the time about
this. First, my understanding from speaking with a number of them is that kind of the patient or potential
patients, #1 factor in making that decision is their physician. And so they've done great work in outreach
using their physicians to -- and their physician offices to give outreach to the patients, reassuring them
that the hospital may be one of the safest places to be as opposed to all kinds of other things that people
are doing around the country, which is what's causing COVID to be spread. So -- and I think the facts
bear that up. They've done a great job with PPE. We know a number of physicians groups who have
extraordinarily low amounts of COVID in their own staff, even though they are actively involved -- heavily
actively involved with COVID patients. So it's both the work they've done to make their places safe and
the -- of the marketing, but it's marketing to let people know that it's safe to return. It's largely the
physicians doing that, not the facility so much.

The other thing they've done is they have moved more and more procedures into spaces that patients feel
more comfortable, so in the ambulatory surgery centers and other types of centers like that as well as the
standard operating room. So I mean, really, it's pretty miraculous, the work they've done the last 2 or 3
months to offset this significant concern among potential patients. And of course, the toughest areas were
the places like New York City that were overrun early. And it's been, I think, somewhat easier in other
spaces where we didn't see that level of burden on the hospitals.

David Louis Turkaly
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

Maybe quick follow-up for Mike. The $15 million, is that -- the last we see of that or is that something --
I know you mentioned it was from that 2019 change, but does that happen again in the future? Or is that
done now?

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

No, Dave, that is a onetime adjustment that we had. So we are final at this point in time. You will not see
that again.

STERIS PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

CEO, President & Director

David, only to the extent that, that business grows, the growth will come quicker just because the revenue
is recognized quicker, but there's not a, if you will, a pull-forward-like effect.

Operator

Next, we have Chris Cooley of Stephens Inc.

Christopher Cook Cooley
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on a solid quarter there. Maybe if I could, let's take a little bit of a look at the margins
for my first question on both Life Sciences and AST. And I appreciate the commentary, Walt, that you saw
some stocking of consumables, in particular, in Life Sciences. But you hit a record growth -- I mean up
margin there in Life Sciences at 41.5%, which is really enviable. Help us think a little bit, though, about
how that business may have shifted structurally such that as we start to see some normalization there in
consumable purchasing patterns, how we think about that operating margin? And then, I guess, similar
to that, a little bit of a taper in AST, which is to be expected with the shift more towards PPE in some
instances. But is that something that we should think about lingering throughout the fiscal year and kind
of slowly working its way back out? Or is that something that would start to reverse itself, maybe more so
in the second half of the fiscal year? Just want to make sure we're thinking about the margin contribution
correctly? And I've got one quick follow-up.

Daniel A. Carestio
Senior VP & Chief Operating Officer

Okay. This is Dan Carestio, actually. And on the Life Science question, I think the increased margin that
you saw in the first quarter was heavily based on the fact that we had a mix of very high consumable
revenue stream. Some significant portion of that is stockpiling by our customers just for a surety of supply
and some portion of it is actually also increased demand from those customers. With all the investment
being dolled out right now in vaccine production, that is an area that is really in STERIS Life Sciences
sweet spot for our portfolio because it requires aseptic manufacturing. So -- and to the extent that, that
is sustained, we believe we'll see some sustained benefit for consumables business in particular. To the
extent that pharma starts making significant expansion investments in either CMOs or their factories, then
we may see some benefit in our capital equipment side of the business in the future. But in the interim in
short term, we see it as purely a consumable play at this time.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

And Chris, I guess I would add, I don't think anyone is thinking vaccines are going to slow down in the
next year or 2.

Christopher Cook Cooley
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Probably not.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

So if anything we feel bullish in general in the space -- 34% year-over-year, we're not planning on that
for very long. But we're bullish in the space. And on AST, you called it dead on. PPE is a high-volume,
relatively speaking, lower-margin product than many of the consumables that are related to surgeries
that have been deferred. And so that is largely a mix issue. And I would expect it to slowly reverse as the
surgical type devices come back. Now I don't know that we're going to see PPE slack off a great deal. So it
may not move back to the original numbers, but orders of magnitude, I would expect some of it to come
back due to mix.

STERIS PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Christopher Cook Cooley
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I really appreciate the color. And then just finally for me, Walt, to my 15-plus years here, the leverage
ratio being below 1.5x toggling across here, it's been a really long time since I've seen...

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Maybe 10.

Christopher Cook Cooley
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Yes. And I understand and greatly appreciate that you've always ran the business very conservatively,
not leveraging up here, and especially not in a challenged time. But this is a relative historic low level for
debt to EBITDA. Just curious where you see opportunities from an M&A perspective, from an opportunity
to invest back in the business to either enhance the margin profile longer term or drive growth. But I'm
assuming rather than just accruing cash on the balance sheet, even after the 8% increase in the dividend
here this quarter, your -- there's got to be opportunities to deploy cash. So just how do we think about the
capital structure?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Chris. We've spoken about that and have been very, very consistent over the decade or so. You've
talked about in terms of how we intend to spend our capital. We do intend to provide dividends. We think
that's a good discipline of management to grow dividends somewhat in line with the profit and cash flow of
the business. We absolutely intend to continue to investing in the businesses we already have. And you're
clearly seeing that we're -- as Mike mentioned, we actually spent more capital this quarter than we did a
quarter ago last year.

We have significant investments moving forward in the AST space for growth, which we absolutely believe
is coming. And also in the hospital outsourced processing business, we are intending and have and intend
to spend significant capital. So those -- and we're spending capital every place. Those 2 are just orders of
magnitude, kind of larger than some of the others at this moment in time and that's, in our view, because
of the long-term opportunity in those spaces. But in general, I'd rather spend money in the businesses
already run to make them either more efficient or new products than running around looking for new
things. After that, we want to run around and look for new things. And we did have a number of things
on our plate when this little COVID issue hit us. And so we pulled back on that due to the near-term
uncertainty in the space.

We are feeling more comfortable that our own cash situation is in good shape and that we can kind of go
back to the search and hunt. But those things -- timing of those are never known. So I wouldn't suggest
something is going to happen tomorrow morning, but it would be surprising if over the next year or 2,
we don't see things that are worth investing in and that add to our portfolio. We like things that are
either in our space or right next door to our space. We don't like stepping out wildly into things we don't
understand. So at a high level, that hasn't changed. It's just we took a little pause, but -- and it seems
like when it rains, it pours, as you remember, last year, we did 6 or 7, they were relatively small. A couple
of years before, we did some relatively large ones. We don't control the timing on those things. Usually,
the seller has more control of timing than we do. But we certainly continue to see a pipeline of things and
intend to be active. And we are far more comfortable today than we were 90 days ago in making those
kind of decisions.

Operator

And next, we have Mike Matson of Needham & Company.

STERIS PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

I guess I just wanted to start with what you're hearing from hospitals about the outlook for capital
equipment spending. The hospitals have obviously been hit by elective deferrals, but there's also been a
huge infusion of cash from the government. So just any thoughts there would be helpful.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

And I've probably said this 100 times since the last -- since I've been at STERIS. But the -- health care
capital spending loves change and hates uncertainty. And so we've been in a little bit more uncertain time
the last little bit, but we're also seeing changes. So it's not at all clear exactly how that's going to work
out over the next year or 2. As I said, this move -- we already saw the greatest growth rate in our capital
spending for health care was moving to ambulatory surgery type of facilities, whether they be a part of
a hospital system or not. And so we -- that -- I would not be surprised if that accelerates, given what I
said about trying to move patients to places that they feel more comfortable, a, it's closer to their homes;
and b, it's -- there's just less traffic, if you will. And so I would not be surprised to see that spending
accelerate.

We have felt for some time that both particularly into surgery centers, as you see them, take on more
and more extensive surgeries, they cannot have the same type of capital equipment, they need stronger
infrastructure to do that. So I would expect to see that mix move up in ambulatory surgery. And again,
they can't do orthopedic implants with the sterilization capacity they currently have. So we think that's
opportunity, both for capital spending and for our ORC. So we do see the intermediate to longer-term
positively in that space. And for every time -- for every surgery that moves out of the hospital, they put in
2 more complex surgeries. Heart, lung -- one heart-lung transplant does not equal to one artificial knee.
And so even though the numbers may stay constant, the intensity continues to rise.

So in the long term, we see it growing with hospital or health care revenue, generally speaking, as it
has for the last 30-some-odd years. In the very short term, there are a number of places just like we
did put on capital freezes. But I think as they see -- as they get visibility into their cash flow, they will
begin spending again more in their normal fashion. And then the good news for us is we had a very good
backlog going in, which we rarely see cancellations. And then lastly, the big projects are rarely stopped or
slowed down. It may slow down a little bit just for labor, but they're rarely stopped or slowed down in a
consequential way. Once you put steel in the ground, you need to fill the facility. So those will, I think, will
continue as they would have.

The pipeline is a bit softer right now than what we saw 90 days ago, [ let's say ], or before COVID
got serious in the U.S. But for roughly 45 to 60 days, we had no ability for our salespeople to access
facilities as they shut down everything, but patient care. And so we're now back in the field working with
facilities on their needs. So I think it's early yet to predict the exact strength or lack of strength in capital
equipment. But I think the intermediate to longer-term looks pretty good.

Michael Stephen Matson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just as far as ASP goes, so it sounds like the PPE has been driving a lot of sterilization
demand. You expect that to continue to remain strong. At the same time, devices -- the elective
procedures seem to be recovering. So I'd imagine that volume of device sterilization is going to be going
up. So is that the right way to think about it? And then do you feel like you've got adequate capacity to
meet all that demand as those things are both seeing high volumes?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

In short, yes, is the answer to your first question, is that the way we see it, that's almost exactly how
we see it. And the second question in terms of capacity, there's a reason we're spending several hundred
million dollars over the next few years building capacity in [ ASTs ] because we believe the demand will be
there to utilize that capacity, and we always try to stay ahead of it to the extent we can. So we do think
that there will be capacity requirements going forward, and we're building to meet that demand.

The next question we have will come from Larry Keusch of Raymond James.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Walt, I wanted to touch on just a couple of quick things here. First, on Healthcare. Just curious how you're
thinking about surgical procedure volumes, let's call it, in the second half of the year? I know that things
have obviously improved through June and probably there's been at least some stabilization in July. But
just trying to understand, do you think surgical procedure volumes actually can grow in the fourth quarter
this year? Or do you think they kind of run at levels that are actually down year-over-year? And I guess
as part of that question, do you kind of view the fiscal fourth quarter sort of total growth here, the lowest
that you would expect for the year? And then I have 2 other ones quickly.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

I'll try to answer the question. I'm a little confused by the last piece of it. But the short answer is, I do
think procedure volume still has room to grow from where it is. If you think about it, we're approaching
last year's levels. I would say most of the places that I've talked to, the facilities are saying they're
running 85% or 95% kind of numbers of last year. But typically, we see 3%, 4%, 5% growth. So -- and
the same in our AST business, what we've described is it's basically did last year, but that's not normal for
us, right? We would expect to see 5%, 6%, 7% growth. So my answer to that is there's probably some
catch-up from the last quarter or so that is going to occur. And then there's also a catch-up of the growth
that would have occurred. Now how quickly that all happens, I think, is a wildcard. But in general, if you
take a more 18- to 24-month view, my view is that the normal growth we would have seen will occur and
we're likely to see some catch-up on top of it.

Okay. Perfect. And then just -- maybe I didn't state the question clearly enough. I was just, again, trying
to understand if you think this fiscal fourth quarter as you think about the dynamics across the business
kind of marks the low for the fiscal year for you guys as you look at that growth year-over-year? And then,
I guess, I'll just ask my other quick questions. U.K. certainly seems to be lagging quite a bit from the
rebound in surgical procedure volumes over there. So again, just sort of wondering what you're seeing
in your outsourced business and instrument repair business? And then I guess one for Mike, again, I'm
just -- I know you mentioned this on the call when Walt was chatting in his prepared comments, but what
exactly was being excluded from gross profit associated with COVID costs?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Larry. Again, I'm not -- if we were comfortable understanding the relative growth rates quarter-
to-quarter, we've been giving guidance. And so timing is probably the toughest thing to call right now as
opposed to, I'll call it, general trend. And so I think we've laid out our views of the general trends, but
timing, we're not nearly so comfortable on that question.

So I don't know that we would have a strong feeling that second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter is
going to be our best or worst year-over-year performance. The -- you're absolutely correct about the U.K.
At this moment, it tends to be the lagging entity in Europe. The converse is true of the rest of Europe.

The rest of Europe has been ahead of the U.S. in bringing back procedures and our businesses, both AST
and ORCs are showing that. So the Continental Europe, for lack of better terms, has been stronger coming
back quicker, I should say, and U.K. has been the slowest entity in our space.

As you know, the U.K. is relatively small piece of our business. But it is real, and we have seen -- the
ORCs are coming back from their very low levels, that they were in earlier in the year. But they're not

as far back as the ORCs in the United States on average. So at a high level, that's the answer to that
question.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Great. And then, Larry, from your question regarding what is being adjusted out for the COVID-19 cost. As
Walt talked about, the majority of that $9 million is related to the opportunity we took to furlough some
of our underutilized folks, and we also received some of the benefit from the CARES Act, in particular, also
from some of the other government benefits in the U.K. and in Italy that we're paying a portion of our
furloughed employees at that point.

And as we did in the fourth quarter, we also had some meeting cancellation costs. We did not hold our
annual meeting this year. So we had some cancellation costs associated with that. We had some PP&E,
specifically for employees. And we had some above and beyond enhanced cleaning protocols that we've
also put into that incremental cost. So the total net cost of all that is $8.7 million in the quarter compared
to about $800,000 in the fourth quarter of last year.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

And I think orders of magnitude, Larry, without getting into the numbers, the non-furlough piece probably
is pretty similar last quarter and this quarter, orders of magnitude, and the bulk of that money is the
furloughed people, and they're largely back to work at this point.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So just to finish that thought. As you look into the next quarter, we should assume that any excluded costs
from gross profit should go down, I would think?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes, our expectation is that revenue will rise and costs will fall -- or revenues will rise and costs will rise
with it, as we bring people back to do that work.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

But we will continue to have certain costs.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

We will have certain costs.

Just a follow-up on vaccine production. Assuming that we're going to get to full production of vaccines
sometime in 2021, what are your customers indicating their needs might be from you? And what -- and
any chance you can put some context or quantify what the opportunity might be?

STERIS PLC FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

I mean at a high level, the -- what we do for, I'll call it -- for lack of better terms, COVID vaccines are
the same as what we do for other vaccines. So the consumables that we would use would be very similar
at a high level. And in terms of quantities, it is way too early for us to make any judgments on that
because we don't know who is and isn't going to be making, which drugs are and are not going to be
the most effective and there's 2 types, right? The prevention side of the equation and the -- helping the
patient recover side of the equation and both are under clinical trials right now. It's just -- it's unusual
for people to begin spending money on production before they know the answer to that question. So
we have a number of people that are spending money for potential production that may or may not end
up manufacturing the drug. So that's the tough thing to call. And some of those people would be our
customers, some of those people would not. So it's -- I think at this point, early to call. But having said
that, our general expectation is that we will see a rise out of that production.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. I'm assuming this is a more fragmented area than Healthcare for you, where you have very high
market share. You have a lot of different competitors here. Is there a particular vaccine or biologics
customer or kind of -- or technology that would have an outsized impact for you that we should be
potentially watching?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I don't know that it's more fragmented. In fact, maybe less fragmented if you step back and, call it,
hospitals or health care systems. There's a lot more health care systems in the country than -- or in the
world than there are vaccine producers. So I wouldn't say that. And I don't think there's any one specific
technology that we would say it would be a step out change for us versus, I'll call it, general growth in
vaccines. The other side of this equation is going to be interesting is other vaccines, right? I think people
are going to get far more sensitive to taking flu vaccines than they used to be because you don't know
whether you have flu or COVID until you've been tested, right? And so -- and you certainly don't want
both and all those things. So the question is what's going to happen to vaccines in general. I think right
now, vaccines are going to be on the uptake.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then on the capital equipment, I mean, if I remember correctly, the lead times on those
machines are longer and they're more specialized. When do you think those customers are going to have
to put in those orders to ramp up more quickly for that kind of equipment?

Daniel A. Carestio
Senior VP & Chief Operating Officer

Yes. Currently -- this is Dan Carestio. Currently, our lead times on GMP equipment, depending on the
product, can extend from 30 days to 7, 8 months, depending on how customized it may or may not be.
And pharma customers are continually investing in capacity to stay ahead of it to the extent that they can.
And so our backlog will flow through over the next few quarters. And our intake of orders remain strong.
The sort of the capacity-limiting situation is not necessarily going to be capital equipment in the short
term, though, as it relates to vaccine. It's going to be more production level equipment for production of
vaccine as opposed to the sterilization and decontamination equipment.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Understood. And last question. As you think about the ASCs being a positive driver for your capital
over the last couple of years, I think most people would understand that on the surgical equipment side.

How is it -- how has -- how did the ASCs manage their sterilization needs? And is that a net positive for
you when you see a procedure move from the hospital to an ASC?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

No. The -- in general, the answer is yes, it's a net positive. Again, if you go back to the original general
statement I made, capital flows change and of course, uncertainty. Moving from north to south, cities
to suburbs, suburbs to cities, hospitals to ASCs and ASCs to hospitals generally creates capital spend --
increased capital spend because you don't tear a sterilizer out of the wall and then stick it in a brand new
facility typically. Less true of tables, but it's very true of lights and all that. Tables, you can move. But if
you're 2/3 of the way through with the life, maybe you go ahead and put new tables in this new facility. So
generally speaking, any kind of change or movement from one place to another creates capital spend in
the spaces that we operate.

There are no further questions at this time. We will go ahead and conclude our question-and-answer
session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Ms. Julie Winter for any closing remarks.
Ma'am?
