Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference
Call. Joining the call from the company today are Bill Hornbuckle, Chief Executive Officer and President;
Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer; Hubert Wang;
President and Chief Operating Officer of MGM China; and Cathy Park, Executive Director of Investor
Relations. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Cathy Park. Please go ahead.

Catherine Park
Executive Director of Investor Relations

Thanks, Chad. This call is being broadcast live on the internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we have
also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.

On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the federal
securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-
looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. Except as
required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or
otherwise.

During the call, we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance. You can
find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which
are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.

I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Cathy, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the past few months, we've had the honor
and the privilege of welcoming back guests back to our properties at a remarkable pace, both in Las Vegas
and our regional markets. It's been rewarding to see our guests taking in all the world-class gaming and
entertainment experiences that only MGM Resorts can provide, and it's been equally gratifying to witness
the tremendous effort of our employees delivering these experiences. We have an amazing team of people
here at MGM Resorts, the best in the business. And so I'd like to take this time to thank them today for
their hard work and dedication to our company and our guests, especially over the last 18 months. I can't
say enough how critically important they have been, will continue to be to our success as we carry out our
vision to be the world's premier gaming and entertainment company.

In fact, investing in our people and our planet is the foundation upon which we've built our strategic plan
for the company's long-term vision. Our strategic plan consists of the following 4 priorities: investing
in our people and our planet, providing unique experiences for our guests by leveraging data-driven
customer insights and digital capabilities, delivering operational excellence at every level, and allocating
our capital responsibly to drive the highest returns for our shareholders. In driving our vision, we have
long discussed our goals of simplifying our corporate structure and monetizing our real estate premium
valuations to become asset light. We've been busy on this front. And over the past 90 days, we've
meaningfully advanced this strategy.

In May, we announced an agreement to sell and lease back MGM Springfield, underlying real estate to
MGM Growth Properties. We followed that news in July with an agreement to purchase Infinity World's
50% interest in CityCenter and then to subsequently sell and lease back the underlying real estate to
Blackstone at an unprecedented cap rate for gaming asset. And we're very excited to become the full
owners of Aria and Vdara operations soon.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

I'd also like to take this time to thank Bill Grounds from Infinity World, who has on the heels of this
transaction stepped down from MGM's Board after serving us since 2013. He's been a great partner for
many years, and we wish him the very best in the future.

And finally, as you know, we have spent significant time and effort working on the best solutions for our
stated goal of deconsolidating MGP. And this morning, we were pleased to announce a comprehensive
transaction with VICI and MGP to monetize the majority of our operating partnership units for
approximately $4.4 billion in cash at a multiple that's among the strongest in all gaming real estate
transactions to date. This is a great win for MGM and MGP, and we're excited by our new long-term
partnership with VICI.

Again, I'm incredibly proud of our finance, operating and legal teams, who have been accomplishing an
astonishing amount in a short order to get these transactions across the finish line.

Combining these transactions grant us greater financial flexibility by the means of $11.6 billion in domestic
liquidity and importantly, they allow us to intensify our focus on maximizing growth in our core business
and pursuing opportunities that align to our long-term vision.

In terms of such opportunities, we remain committed to our sports betting and iGaming joint venture,
BetMGM, which continues to impress. Having expanded its net revenues and its leadership position in
the second quarter, BetMGM is the #2 operator in the space nationwide, and in the second quarter, it
commended 24% share of its live markets. BetMGM remains a clear leader in iGaming, having reached a
30% market share in the second quarter, and we also continue to see the benefits of customer acquisition
cross pollinization between MGM and BetMGM.

In the second quarter, 15% of BetMGM's new players came from MGM and 31% of MGM -- M life sign-ups
came from BetMGM. We'll strategically invest in our digital capabilities and customer growth strategies,
driving innovation and a deeper customer loyalty throughout technology led customer-centric experiences,
products and services. These efforts will be led by Tilak Mandadi, who we recently hired as our Chief
Strategy, Innovation and Technology Officer. Tilak is a visionary, a results-driven leader who has spent
several decades of experience at both Disney and American Express, where he led similar initiatives. Tilak
will also be leading our relationship with BetMGM joining its Board of Directors. He's another fantastic
addition to our senior leadership team and complementary to the deep bench we've now built with recent
additions of Jonathan as CFO; and Jyoti Chopra as our Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer. I
have no doubt that will be invaluable to the company's future.

We'll also increase our diversification into Asia through the footprint expansion in Macau and the
integrated resort opportunity in Japan. As a matter of fact, we officially submitted our RFP as a sole bidder
for the Osaka license a couple of weeks ago, which starts the clock on a 3-month review process. We and
our local partners, ORIX, remain excited by the opportunity, which we expect will yield very attractive
returns. We look forward to Osaka reviewing our proposal, and hopefully, I'm confident, we'll ultimately be
named Osaka's designee operator early this fall.

And lastly, we continue to study key regional markets of significance, including commercial gaming license
at Empire City in New York.

Before I turn it over to Jonathan to delve into our second quarter results, I'd like to say a few words on
our current business trends and our future outlook. We reported a great second quarter at our domestic
properties, driven by pent-up consumer demand and high domestic casino spend as well as our ability to
yield our business and maintain our cost discipline efforts. In fact, we delivered all-time record margins
in both Las Vegas and regional segments as well as all-time record EBITDA quarters at our regional
properties. Further, 11 of our 17 domestic properties had all-time record quarters and slot gross win. And
that momentum continued into July with another record month that exceeded June.

I can't tell you enough under these circumstances how pleased and proud I am of our entire team. We
have righted the ship, and we're going full steam ahead. In Las Vegas, our weekend volumes are back
to normal, driven by leisure and domestic casino customers with ADRs now surpassing 2019 levels. The
weekday while improving continued to lag the weekends in the second quarter due to lower level of group

business. That being said, June kicked off a series of citywide events coming to town such as World Of
Concrete and Surfaces, and we anticipate a return of groups here in the third and fourth quarter. Feedback
from meeting participants have been very positive. Our lead volumes in the year for the year, production
is now close to normal levels, which we expect will help midweek occupancy uplift in the back half of the
year. We continue to believe that full convention business recovery will be post '21 event, solidifying itself
in the second half of 2022, and we remain pleased with how our '22 and '23 group calendar is shaping up
as well as contract commitments for the future.

In July, we relaunched entertainment with a great line of events that was met with overwhelming demand
and now with Allegiant Stadium hosting large-scale entertainment, we can now drive more meaningful
compression, especially at the mid- to south end of the strip. Consider the entertainment programming a
few weekends ago, we had Garth Brooks at Allegiant Stadium, we had a McGregor fight at T-Mobile and
Bruno Mars at Park MGM, selling over 98,000 tickets within our properties distance situated to capture
significant amount of this foot traffic.

While our conviction in the long-term viability of our business remains stronger than ever, the recent
rising number of COVID cases and the subsequent actions taken by the CDC and local regulators and our
reinstituted mask mandates here in Las Vegas of note is a reminder that the pandemic is not completely
behind us. In Las Vegas, we continue to facilitate vaccinations among our employee base and have
partnered with the Governor's Office to host multiple vaccination clinics including 1 at T-Mobile Arena,
another on the strip at The Park, and we're using the full weight of our business and resources as part of
this effort, including significant incentive offers to both guests and employees, who get vaccinated or bring
friends and family to get vaccinated.

We've also invested in ongoing educational employee campaigns as well as providing easy access to all 3
vaccines on pop-up clinics at all of our properties. In July, we implemented a mandatory COVID testing
program for all of our Las Vegas employees, who have not proven proof of vaccination. We've taken the
virus very seriously, and as always, the health and safety of our guests and employees is our top priority.

At this time, it's too early to speak to any meaningful impact to our business, but we are monitoring the
situation closely. And we'll continue to proactively work safely to accommodate guests and our properties.
July, as I mentioned before, was the best month this year and by far in terms of operating performance,
we ultimately feel great about our long-term positioning in Las Vegas. The last few months have inevitably
proven that the city remains resilient to a top destination for both business and specifically for tourism.

Our regional properties that I mentioned earlier, delivered their best quarter-to-date yet in terms
of EBITDA. We are encouraged by the stability of demand we saw at our properties as restrictions
further eased into July, and I'm also pleased that our focus on cost and productivity across labor, player
reinvestment and other streamline initiatives remain a key priority for our regional teams.

And finally, on Macau, in the second quarter, we delivered sequential improvements over the first, amid
a choppy GGR environment that remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Despite this, MGM China,
given our strength in premium mass, continued to outperform our former position in the marketplace.
We believe the rate of Macau's recovery will continue to hinge on broader sentiment as we pace the
vaccinations rollout throughout the regions, which will ultimately lead to sustainable easing of travel
restrictions. With the Guangdong outbreak quickly contained, July was off to a better start when we saw
visitation and business volumes striking a pickup again. And while the region had felt some additional
speed bumps in recent days, with the government's expeditions efforts to contain the outbreak and border
restrictions easing over time, we expect gradual growth demand for travel to Macau throughout the end of
the second half of the year.

We remain committed to elevating our footprint in Macau and will soon be increasing our upscale suite
inventory. We have finalized the construction and fitting in the South Tower suites and MGM Cotai and are
pleased with the final product, which we believe will be well received by our premier mass clients. We are
now in soft opening in order to make final adjustments to our product and to achieve a level of service
that meets our high-quality of standards. We expect to officially open it later this month, and further, we
completed the gaming space refresh in MGM Macau and are now looking at remodeling our villas.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

At both properties, we're enhancing our F&B options focused on the gaming floors, and over time, we have
the ability to build out another hotel tower at MGM Cotai, along with meaningful entertainment assets to
diversify our offerings. I am confident in Macau's longer-term growth prospects and firmly believe our
investment in premium product positions us well for a broader recovery.

With that, I'll turn this over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter in more detail.

Jonathan S. Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks a lot, Bill. Let's first discuss our second quarter results. Our consolidated second quarter net
revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first quarter results. Our net income
attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 million, and our second quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved
sequentially to $607 million -- $617 million, once again, heavily driven by our domestic operations. Our
Las Vegas strip net revenues in the second quarter were $1 billion, 31% below the second quarter of 2019
and 28% below, excluding Circus Circus Las Vegas, which was sold at the end of 2019.

Despite the lower top line, we delivered far superior EBITDAR results. Our second quarter adjusted
property EBITDAR was $397 million, which is 5% below the second quarter of 2019 and just 1% lower,
excluding Circus. Hold had a $6 million negative impact to our EBITDAR this quarter, so Hold-adjusted
strip EBITDAR in Las Vegas was $403 million. Our strip margins improved almost 1,100 basis points to an
all-time record of 39.5%. And this does not include the results of CityCenter, which generated $120 million
of EBITDAR at a 46% margin.

As Bill mentioned in his remarks, our margin improvement was driven by a combination of strong leisure
and casino demand, continued cost control and the operating leverage inherent in our business. Naturally,
with limited convention business and entertainment, we are driving more visitation from customers that
we know.

And our second quarter casino room mix was 9 points above pre-COVID levels. Furthermore, our second
quarter casino revenues were 15% above 2019 levels and contributed to 35% of our overall net revenues
in the second quarter. This compares to roughly 22% in all of 2019.

We're seeing particular strength in the slot customer. Our second quarter slot handle was 23% greater
than that of the second quarter of 2019 on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Circus Circus. And for the
first time since being impacted by COVID, we are now attracting the older 65-plus demographic to our
strip properties at levels commensurate with what we were seeing pre-pandemic.

Our second quarter occupancy was 77%, an improvement from 46% in the first quarter with weekends
and weekdays at 94% and 70%, respectively. June occupancy was 83%, with weekends and weekdays at
96% and 79%, respectively. July occupancy was 86%. As pent-up demand -- as pent-up leisure demand
stabilizes longer term, we believe this will be offset by ramping group business, and I echo Bill's comments
that we're very pleased with the current trajectory of that segment's rebound.

I'll close on Las Vegas with some thoughts on margins. Longer term, we believe that the 40% margins we
achieved this past quarter will stabilize a bit lower as casino spend and overall business mix normalizes,
and also as we ramp up staffing to more sustainable levels in order to serve our guests more fully.
However, I know that we have further upside in overall profit dollars as our top line continues to rebound
with group business and entertainment. I'm also confident that our focus on operational excellence and
cost efficiency efforts will allow us to achieve strip margins well above 2019 levels long term.

Now on to our regional operations. Our second quarter regional net revenues of $856 million were aided
by the continuing easing of statewide restrictions, and we're just 6% below that of the second quarter in
2019. We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR well over 2019 levels, 22% to be exact, to $318 million.
Much like in Las Vegas, we're driving success in casino, with second quarter casino revenues outpacing
2019 levels by 8%, primarily due to slots and our higher-end customer base.

Our 50 to 64 age demographic, of which I'm a proud member, is now at 2019 levels, and we're attracting
more of the 65-plus age demographic. Our second quarter regional margin of 37% was also an all-time

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

record, growing 855 basis points over the second quarter of 2019 and sequentially by 316 basis points
over the first quarter.

Our regional margin growth is a continued testament to all the great work that our teams have put
into maximizing the effectiveness of our operating model and rethinking how we run our business. This
ranges from marketing reinvestment to procurement, from energy utilization to labor management. And
the breadth of our efforts gives me confidence that we will deliver on the $450 million of cost savings
domestically, which we previously identified.

Our margins of the regions will likely normalize a bit lower from second quarter levels longer-term as
casino spend adjusts over time and as we reintroduce F&B and entertainment, especially in our destination
markets. We also expect to rightsize labor in the near term, which has certainly had a favorable impact on
our margins, but it's also become a bottleneck in certain segments of our operations, negatively impacting
our EBITDAR. Still, similar to Las Vegas, I know that we can achieve regional margins well above 2019
levels longer term.

Our joint venture BetMGM is clearly the #1 operator in U.S. iGaming and has solidified its #2 position
nationwide in U.S. sports betting and iGaming. Net revenues associated with BetMGM operations grew
19% sequentially from the first quarter to $194 million in the second quarter. This was driven by growth in
both iGaming and online sports betting verticals as a result of increased customer acquisition and strong
retention that yielded more first time deposits and actives. These results are especially impressive during
the quarter with arguably minimal exogenous catalysts, no major state launches, a seasonally low sports
calendar and a further reopening of brick-and-mortar casinos.

Our share of BetMGM's losses in the second quarter amounted to $46 million, which is reported as a part
of unconsolidated affiliates line of our adjusted EBITDA calculation. We remain excited about BetMGM's
strong positioning in this fast-growing marketplace and both partners remain committed to its long-term
success.

Finally, in Macau, market-wide GGR sequentially improved 7% in the second quarter, but still remained
depressed at only 35% of second quarter 2019 levels. Nevertheless, as Bill mentioned earlier, MGM China
outperformed the market, with its GGR having recovered to 43% of pre-pandemic levels. MGM China's
second quarter net revenues were $311 million, up slightly from the first quarter. Adjusted property
EBITDAR of $9 million also improved quarter-over-quarter from $5 million in the first quarter. Hold-
adjusted EBITDAR was $13 million on 2.75% VIP win in second quarter compared to 3.29% in the first
quarter. Mass Hold was also lower sequentially.

Our second quarter corporate expense, excluding share-based compensation, was $90 million, which
included $6.5 million in transaction costs. We expect that our quarterly net corporate expense will run a bit
higher going forward as we ramp our investments in IT, our digital offerings and our IR efforts in Japan. In
the near term, we also expect to incur incremental costs related to our recently announced transactions.

We were active share repurchasers in the second quarter, having repurchased 5.6 million shares for $220
million. We believe our shares are attractively valued and we've purchased an additional 6.8 million shares
for $263 million in the third quarter through today, bringing us to $615 million of share repurchases year-
to-date.

Bill talked about our recent milestones in simplifying our story and becoming asset light. We sold MGM
Springfield's underlying real estate to MGP for $400 million at a 13.3x rent multiple or a 7.5% cap rate.
We also transacted on CityCenter, effectuating a high watermark on the sale of real estate assets at an
18.1x rent multiple or a 5.5% cap rate and acquiring ownership of 100% of the operations of ARIA and
Vdara at an implied multiple of 8.9x based on CityCenter's 2019 adjusted EBITDA from resort operations
of $425 million.

CityCenter's second quarter results demonstrate the premium quality of the property, the excellence of
its management team and its cash flow generating potential with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million, 13%
above the second quarter of 2019 and with margins of 46%.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

And finally, we announced today the transaction with VICI, whereby we will receive $43 per unit or
approximately $4.4 billion in cash for a majority of our MGP OP units. As part of the agreement, we'll
hold an approximately 1% stake in the newly combined company valued at nearly $400 million. We will
enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI, with initial year's rent at $860 million. The
transaction values MGP at an implied 17.5x pro rata EBITDA multiple for a 5.8% cap rate. So it's been
a busy and a productive quarter. We expect to close on CityCenter by the end of the third quarter and
Springfield by the end of the year, and our transaction with VICI will likely take us into the first half of next
year to close, and all of these transactions are subject to regulatory approvals.

The end result is a cleaner, more focused company, a streamlined reporting structure and a stronger
deployable cash position to maximize shareholder value and advance our vision to be the world's premier
gaming entertainment company.

As of June 30, our liquidity position, excluding MGM China and MGP, was $6.5 billion and $11.6 billion
adjusted for the aforementioned announcements. On last quarter's call, I highlighted our approach to
capital allocation, and it is certainly worth reiterating today.

First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Second, we'll return cash to
shareholders, which we have done convincingly thus far this year. We will continue to take a disciplined
and programmatic approach to shareholder -- share repurchases for the balance of the year. And third,
when assessing potential growth opportunities, we'll invest where we have clear advantages. And will
exercise discipline in measuring prospective returns for our shareholders. As we evaluate uses of our
shareholders' capital over time, these priorities will act as a blueprint for our decision-making process.

With that, I'll turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Jonathan. We're very pleased, obviously, with all we've accomplished thus far this year. Our
strategic actions, together with the improving domestic backdrop, continued focus on operational
excellence, and strong conviction in Macau's recovery, positions us very well for the future. There's a lot
to be excited about when we think about our path on delivering our long-term vision. We remain focused,
disciplined and ultimately transparent.
With that, we'll open to your questions. Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I want to start off by talking about -- to you, Bill, and Jonathan, what you just referred to is a sizable,
deployable cash position. Obviously, you have Japan out there. And that's not sort of a near-term thing,
and that's uncertain. You've been doing buybacks. Maybe you can talk a little bit about maybe where M&A
is and how much of a front burner priority for you and just in general, discuss your M&A aspirations and
how you look at M&A as achieving whatever goals you have discussed maybe at the internal executive
level or at the Board level?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Well, that's a simple question, Joe. Thank you. Look, Jonathan said it, I've said it, you've heard us say it
consistently, we are committed to becoming the premier gaming entertainment company in the world. We
like to think we hold a key position in it already. We have expressed desires in digital. And the obvious, I
must say, our strategy doesn't refer and hint simply on 1 other company. We are very excited about our
JV with BetMGM and we continue to grow that. We have a great working relationship with that, and it's
productive. Jonathan has already shared the company's position on share buybacks. And we'll continue to
look. But the good news is, I mean, we've got 6 or 9 months before these transactions close and time is
our friend. And so we're going to be disciplined about the approach.

Jonathan S. Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

It's -- Joe, it's Jonathan. I would only add that it is such a dynamic environment right now. We are
certainly all hands on deck as our operations continue to grow and recover here in the U.S. We do believe
the shares are attractively valued right now, which is why we've been active in the market. We expect to
continue to be so. But I really like our position in terms of our current liquidity and the expected liquidity
with the transactions in Springfield and with VICI to be in a good position just with the way that things
continue to change, and we expect them to evolve over the next several months and years.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Maybe can you just talk in some greater detail both for the Las Vegas strip and then the regional
markets in general, labor challenges, finding people and then where wage pressure is going. How much
of a mismatch is there between [indiscernible] expense growth in the 2Q? Was the exit rate on the
expenses and the margins different than it was for the full quarter given maybe a lag in operating expense
pressure?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll turn this to Corey in a second, but just kick it off by saying, look, I think like the balance of the
whole hospitality industry, we are suffering universally our share of labor shortages, some supply chain
issues. They're not critical, but they are important. We've done everything we can. We've done incentives
and other things to motivate people back to work. I think we all believe come the end of September, we'll
hopefully see some increase in terms of people's willingness between the negotiations here, particularly
with the legislature in Nevada, unemployment, hopefully, weighing in some respects. But we've been
managing through it and effectively. I think the team has done a really good job with it. It has hampered

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

some midweek occupancies. And we've pushed up our business and therefore, our ADRs, and we've
yielded effectively. And so I think it's helped our margins. So Corey, I don't know if you want to pick it up?

Corey Ian Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

What I would add, Joe, is we've made a lot of headway over the last few weeks in finding the labor that
we needed. As Bill mentioned, we have had some incentives. It's not going to be very material at all on
the impact of our labor cost.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

We're trying to do everything we can not to completely change the paradigm now until things settle in.
And so we continue to think about it in that context.

Operator

The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.

Chad C. Beynon

As you think about your time line in Las Vegas in terms of getting back to 2019 levels, given the strength
on the hotel side on -- particularly on weekends, in your gaming market share right now, can you help us
think about how that's changed in terms of when you believe you can get back to pre-pandemic levels on
a revenue or EBITDA basis?

Corey Ian Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

Yes, Chad. The question has been asked in the last few quarters when we think we'd get back to 90%.
And I think we're there, and that has accelerated. I think when we get back to exact '19 levels will be
when the convention business comes back in a pretty solid level. We're seeing some pretty positive
bookings and trends in 2022. So it could be as early as the first or second quarter of 2022 that we're at
'19 levels, especially on the nongaming revenues.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

I mean mid-week and really through the balance of this year, we're going to have about 1.2 million group
room nights, give or take. Obviously, we're all watching COVID closely in the coming weeks here. But
we've had very limited cancellations. We've actually had a couple of upticks interestingly. And so that will
be paramount to really setting the stage going forward. But again, long term, '22 and '23 fundamentally
are looking great. And we've had no substantive cancellations given even what's happened in the last
week. So I think Corey's estimate's spot on.

Chad C. Beynon
Macquarie Research

Great. And then on the digital side at the BetMGM Investor Day, you talked about market share goals,
which you're already exceeding. I think in the next couple of months, you'll see some additional
competition, but then on your side, I believe a lot of your retention tools will be in place. Can you just talk
about what you'll have in place over the next couple of months to help retain the customers that you're
currently doing business with?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Well, obviously, you heard yesterday on Tom's call, they're going to step into the space in a substantive
way now and chase it with about $1 billion. So they'll be a real competitor. And if you think about what

they do and what we do, it's the most likely competitor to us in the context of same-store loyalty,
presentation, ability to omni-channel and monetize across a broader platform, brick-and-mortar as well as
digital.

We are heavily into our loyalty push. We have appointed several senior executives, both here and at
BetMGM, who are marketing focused on doing exactly that. You heard me express earlier the amount
of interchange between BetMGM and M life and vice versa. And we also have a strong push in moving
regional play through BetMGM and through just the regional properties back here to Las Vegas.

We'll have yet another product launch coming up here very soon. If you look in the deck we provided, you
can see some of those product enhancements. The team at BetMGM is working around the clock on this
to get it prepared for football. And I think it will speak to a lot of things of note, loyalty, retention and our
ability to lower our ultimate CPA, which is the goal here, will stick.

The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Jonathan, you gave a lot of color as you kind of talked through the puts and takes of the Las Vegas strip
margin profile going forward. But if you talk a little bit about CityCenter and obviously -- sorry, excuse me,
Circus Circus removal. You guys gave in the period about $400 million less of revenue. As you think about
kind of being at a 40% margin level and that incremental $400 million of revenue that should come back
over time, is it being overly conservative to say that the kind of margins do compress over the long term?
Or is there some spend here over the medium-term that might kind of bring margins in a little bit before
they could rise again from kind of the natural operating leverage of getting that revenue back?

Jonathan S. Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Thank you for the question, Carlo, and it's well posed. Because there are a few dynamics going on
here. One is certainly the -- just the higher levels of casino spend from our customers that we've been
experiencing over the past 6 months. And we're not simply just kind of taking this business. We are
driving that demand through our marketing channels. And so we've earned those revenue levels for sure.
But they are elevated compared to what they've been in the past.

And that's what I referred to in our remarks, is some expectation that over time, as other avenues for
spending are available in our properties, that perhaps that mix normalizes a bit. But at the same time, our
hotel RevPAR is still below where it was back in '19 fairly materially, both by occupancy as well as overall
rates. And that presents tremendous upside. That's high-margin revenue for us. We fully expect to be able
to get back to those levels over the next year or so. And that will lead to -- that will be very profitable
revenue growth for us. At the same time, much of that is, of course, going to come with the recovery of
the group business.

So there are the puts and takes, as you put it. We're just -- we're doing the best we can to account in the
future for the impact that some of our labor additions are expected to have, but there are clearly sources
of upside in revenue and even margin performance, mostly around the hotel mix.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And what I would add, Carlo, is a few pieces of our business that are missing. We just opened up the
restaurants. There's an opportunity to make some additional EBITDA there. Yes, it will be a little bit less
margin, and then the entertainment side. And we're seeing some great demand there. That also will put a
little bit of pressure on our margins, but it will increase our cash flows.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

That's helpful. And then if I could just 1 follow-up, and it's kind of small and nitpicky. But could you guys
kind of talk a little bit about the tax implications of the NGP, the transaction for you guys, the $4.4 billion
of cash you'll receive? And perhaps the rationale behind kind of holding on those 12 million OP units. Is
that something tax related?

Jonathan S. Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

It is. So in broad strokes, what will happen is VICI and MGP will merge, and MGM's OP units or the vast
majority of them will be redeemed for cash, and that -- $4.4 billion in cash, and that will be tax deferred.
And in keeping the 1% interest in the combined company, what will happen is on those remaining units,
those -- the basis of those units will be reduced by the amount of the gain that we will have on the $4.4
billion. And this will be subject to a 15-year tax protection agreement with VICI, which protects us against
that gain being triggered through any sales of the assets. So it's a 15-year tax-deferred receipt of $4.4
billion, and the remaining interest is critical to that tax analysis.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. That sounds like it was probably a very fun negotiation for you guys.

Operator

And the next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

As we have listened to companies report and talk about the businesses and their outlooks and at the same
time, talk with investors about the sustainability of the margin gains that we're seeing primarily out of this
quarter. And clearly, we meet an amount of cynicism around everybody's ability to do that. Can you just
help us alleviate some of that cynicism and why we should be comfortable that the margin gains will be
reasonably permanent?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Well, David, let me kick it off and maybe Corey can jump on here. The margin that we did this quarter is
not sustainable. I think we've said that in a couple of different ways. But what I think is really relevant
is that where we are versus where we're going to end up is a substantial difference up. And so as these
high value, high revenue, high cost things like a Lady Gaga show come into play, it just -- it works on your
margins, given particularly as the higher end business returns, whether it be ultimately from Asia or other
places, it will kick in.

And so I don't think -- I hope you haven't heard us say we're going to sustain where we are this quarter.
That wasn't the message. The message is we have learned a lot. We're going to be appreciably better
than we've been in -- I can't remember, in our history. And there are certain things we'll never do again,
whether it's buffet openings or how we think about labor or services or products, given what we've all
gone through for the last 18 months. There's a massive amount of learnings of how to even think about
our business. I mean just look at our corporate enterprise, we had 4,750 FTEs. We're under 3,000 today.
We will never go back to 4,750 FTEs, full stop.

And so I hope the message is, from our perspective, we're not going to sustain where we are, but they will
be much better than they've ever been historically. I'm pretty excited about where I think they're going to
end up ultimately.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

That was relatively clear. I could have asked the question just a little bit better. And if I can follow-up
quickly with respect to the loyalty program, Jonathan, I recall you making some commentary in investor
meetings about the opportunities to build and life out in a lot of different directions and grow it. An update
there would be helpful.

Jonathan S. Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. I appreciate you bringing it up because I do -- I know this is a huge opportunity for MGM Resorts.
I mean we have a fantastic loyalty program with 36 million members, which is growing in significant part
by BetMGM right now. And so it's a large and important loyalty program. And where I think some of the
sources of upside are particularly around cross property play here in Las Vegas and kind of the transparent
portability of those rewards across the network in Las Vegas, and then in driving regional customers of
ours, members of the M life's loyalty program to our properties when they visit in Las Vegas, which we
know that they already do.

I think that this effort, of course, is led by Steve Zanella, our Chief Commercial Officer. But here's where
Tilak Mandadi, this phenomenal talent that has just joined us from Walt Disney is going to be hugely
impactful as he helps us really build out the technology platform and the overall design of that program in
its next instance.

So there's a lot of work going on around that effort right now, and I'm really confident it's going to have a
real impact for us in 2022.

Corey Ian Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

And just a few data points to that. We have just began some of these initiatives. Our cross-regional for the
quarter was actually up 25%. So we're pretty excited about that opportunity there. We're just touching
the surface. And even when we talk about BetMGM and what it means to a property, our Detroit active M
life customers in Q2 were actually up 40% from Q4 '19. So we're seeing that actual sign up in that market
actually translate to bricks-and-mortar customers. And you actually would see that in the July results,
which Detroit does publish the results. We had a record market share in Detroit.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

And David, maybe a final comment. There's 4 areas we're consistently after the high end. And so we're
looking at the program and modifying it and making sure digitally more things are accessible. We're after
retail high end, meaning -- I don't mean retail stores, I mean we have a great deal of business that roams
around here that aren't principally gaming customers that we think there's an opportunity to recognize
with loyalty.

Obviously, the regional play that Corey has mentioned and Jonathan and BetMGM are really the 4 key
drivers. And then 1 interesting tidbit I stumbled on this morning, Corey just mentioned it's somewhat
in Michigan. One of the questions that's come up with BetMGM is about cannibalization. It's interesting.
Detroit just got 46.5% market share in brick-and-mortar. And we lead the market in iGaming at 38%, and
that's an increase in the mid-30. We were 43% in June. We're 46.5% in July, and we're holding at 38%
market share in iGaming.

And so the idea that omni-channel can and will work and not be cannibalizing is something I'm very
excited by moving forward.

Operator

The next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

So actually following up on this conversation. If we look at Slide 24 of your presentation, you had 15% of
new BetMGM players in 2Q who were active with MGM. That's up from 10% last quarter. And then you had
31% of new M life players in 2Q who were from BetMGM, and that's down from 44% last quarter. Can you
kind of talk about what's driving the difference in trend between those 2 numbers? And like how to think
about it going forward?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think the second 1 is the easier one. We've just seen that many more. I mean the volume between
the first and second quarter and how -- and Michigan, by the way, how it grew is just -- it's overpowering
and -- thankfully. So I think that explains that more than anything. I'm sorry, Tom, the first one?

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So the first one, so in the first quarter, 10% of your BetMGM players were legacy MGM players and second
quarter went up to 15, what drove that increase?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Well, Michigan a lot, and then we continue to push on programming, hosts, et cetera, in terms of
incentives and otherwise to get them to sign up our customers. And we just have more active in the
database in terms of making BetMGM known to them and available to them.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Helpful. And then I see you reiterated your you're $1 billion of revenue next year for BetMGM. I mean, you
did $357 million in the first half of this year. I mean [indiscernible] potential upside there now?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

We do. Remember, iGaming just got going second -- really into the second quarter, not even in the first
quarter. You've got football, I think, with better programming, better database to pull upon. We've got a
couple of states that are on the horizon of coming out. You've got Maryland. You've got something we've
just done in D.C. Arizona is around the corner. So I think between an increase in states, the full year, if
you will, of iGaming and some other potential things that we continue to market, hence, the numbers we
just talked about, we feel pretty comfortable about the GGR -- the NGR excuse me.

Operator

The next question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just following up on the VICI transaction, and congratulations on all the myriad of activity. I was
wondering if we could just get a little guidance as we're trying to think about maybe cash flow bridges.
One would be, I'm sort of calculating pro forma rent expense for all of these different things coming out in
the kind of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. So first question is, am I in the right ballpark for that?

And then second would be sort of directionally, how should we think about cash taxes across the
enterprise after all these moving pieces settle into '22?

Jonathan S. Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. The -- you are in the right ballpark. The changes are really the CityCenter, which we expect to close
at the end of the third quarter, and that will introduce increased rent of $215 million. So you'll be close on

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

that. And then regarding the cash taxes, that's something that's still -- we're still working on right now as
it relates to 2022. So I think what -- I'd prefer to defer that question until we get a little bit later in the
year.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

Understandable. Maybe just as a follow-up, you talked a lot about the gaming behavior and the increase in
your casino block. Just kind of curious if you could give us a sense across your different channels. What's
OTA doing right now? How important is that? Is that an area where you can maybe change the mix more
permanently? Or just how are you thinking about some of that, particularly that hotel revenue mix going
forward in more of a steady state?

Corey Ian Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

Shaun, this is Corey. Yes. That's 1 of our big strategies that we're definitely working on. We are working
on pre-COVID as the mix in maximizing that mix. And we've had a lot of success in this period. We've
been able to increase our transient mix obviously, as Jonathan mentioned in his opening comments, the
casino mix is up. But more importantly, we're shifting the mix from the OTA package business, which
is our least profitable business, and seeing increases in the land business which was very similar to our
transient business.

So we're very optimistic on what we're seeing there. And when that convention business comes back, we
think there is additional opportunities to maximize our mix.

Operator

And the next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe you touched a base on this a little bit, but turning to Japan, can you just remind us what the capital
contributions you'd be anticipating over the next couple of years? And as you become more asset light,
what is the potential to bring in REITs or other sources of capital into that market to reduce your asset
intensity there?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

So on its surface, remember, the program with ORIX is for 40:40:20, meaning a consortium of other
Japanese companies will make up to 20%. If not, we both fill to 50. The project itself is, call it, $10 billion.
We think it's a little lower, but call it $10 billion for simple math. Call it, 55% debt to equity. So for us, it's
a $2 billion to $2.25 billion check. Probably over '24, '25 and '26, give or take, if you want to think about
how that might flow itself through the system.

I think longer term, look, there's a commitment we're making to Japan and to Osaka that we would be
a true partner in this. There's an actual requirement for 30% equity in it to be classified or qualified,
if you will. But REITs are something that are in Japan. And so I think longer term, we'll see. But in the
short term, it's about a $2 billion to $2.5 billion cash commitment over 3 years. And depending, again, on
licensing, '24, '25 and '26 is probably the best way to think about that.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then sticking with maybe capital allocation. How are you thinking about the allocation of
proceeds from VICI, similar difference in cash from operations. And then has your thought process around
the right leverage ratio for an asset-light business evolved?

Jonathan S. Halkyard

16

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Thank you for the question, Stephen. That transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022.
So the plans for the allocation of that capital will begin soon. They've already begun actually. And -- but
the actual cash won't come to the company for probably 9 months or so. And like I said in the prepared
remarks, really, our first order of business at these levels, we think our shares are attractively valued. And
so we'll be aggressive purchasers of those shares.

Beyond that, we'll look for opportunities to -- inorganic opportunities to really further the company's vision
as a premier gaming entertainment company globally.

In terms of our leverage targets, the company's capital structure is changing from a traditional senior debt
structure to the leases that we have, and that will -- that certainly impacts our thinking about leverage,
because the lease payments do represent financial leverage on the business and lease-adjusted leverage
level of 4 to 5x, we think, is reasonable for a business of our geographic diversification. And so that's the
way we'll be thinking about it going forward on a lease-adjusted basis.

Operator

The next question is from John DeCree with CBRE.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Securities, LLC, Research Division

Maybe to build on that, Jonathan or Bill. I think there's still some interest in potentially U.S. markets. For a
casino in New York is 1 that gets talked about a lot. Not sure if you guys have any comments or thoughts
or any of those prospective opportunities, something you see coming to fruition in the near medium term?
Or are they all kind of longer-dated opportunities that might that might unfold in the future?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Look, in New York, it was disappointing, we weren't able to get it to the legislature. It was close. We're
going to take another run at it. But the reality of that is we're probably looking at '23 before there's a
real decision to be made there. We still have a keen interest in taking a [indiscernible] casino and time
to tell what ultimately gets invested there and how we partner that up. But we remain excited by that.
Obviously, given location and scale, it's kind of hard not to be. We'll watch Georgia and Texas over time
with interest. But again, those are long-term deals. They both require, I believe, a referendum. I know
Texas does. And so that's not going to happen overnight.

And so I think domestically, we're going to try to push for Ohio in the context of a casino, but that will be
time again. So there's nothing immediate on the horizon in terms of real development. I think the only
way to think about development for the near-term is the Japan discussion we just had.

John G. DeCree
Union Gaming Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then changing subjects a little bit with CityCenter coming entirely into the fold. Is there anything
that you would do or could do differently from an operational perspective now that you'll have 100%
ownership? Any advantages that we should be thinking about?

Corey Ian Sanders
Chief Operating Officer

This is Corey, John. We ran it like we've owned 100% of it. But we do think there are opportunities, how
we synergize with Bellagio. For example, Vdara is like right -- is as close to the Bellagio Convention Center
as it is to Aria. And we think there's some other additional operational efficiencies that could be gained
owning 100% of it, but we're pretty excited about finally getting our hands on it.

I'd also just add 1 comment that I'm excited about consolidating this fantastic business. Our Las Vegas
EBITDAR would have been 30% higher this quarter had we consolidated CityCenter, which is -- it's a
phenomenal business, which outperforms our citywide averages on virtually every dimension. So I'm
enthusiastic about having it be consolidated into our financial results.

Operator

And the next question will be from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.

Barry Jonathan Jonas
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I think it's clear, the goal is to be more efficient on the cost side versus 2019 or pre COVID levels. But do
you think the revenue mix of gaming in Vegas could be structurally higher as well? Or I guess, are there
any more recent top line trends you would expect to sustain going forward?

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Look, I'd love to think that the movement we've made pushing regional customers, we've watched for too
long, frankly, with great interest what our colleagues next door have been doing. Our market mix is half of
theirs. We know we can increase that. So we think that's sustaining. Obviously, what we have done best
historically is high end international business. We're well positioned. We have a plant in Macau, obviously.
We have regional offices all over Asia. We'd like to see us get back into that business. I think there's some
real growth there.

And I think interestingly, the demographic has changed to a younger audience, and they've gotten
more acclimated to gaming. We've seen it throughout this past year. A lot of these numbers, remember,
the older folk like myself have generally stayed away for health concerns. And I think we've seen the
emergence, if you will, of another marketplace, it's called millennial that we haven't seen for a while. So
we're all pretty excited about driving that and some of the platform technology, things we talked about
earlier with M life, we think will be meaningful in that regard.

And what I would say is I think we have our cost pretty walked in. Obviously, there's always opportunities.
Now it is a revenue discussion and how we continue to maximize that and how we can grow organically
higher than what we're seeing in cost of living. I think some of the digital initiatives we're working on, on
that, the mix will help that. As Bill mentioned, that customer base, we're up over 50% M life customers in
that group. And if we could figure out how to capture them, and we believe we have ways to do that and
keep them in the properties, we think there's opportunity for revenue lift.

the commentary on a younger player base. But how are you thinking about slot CapEx investment going
forward?

Yes. We're looking at it right now. And we're looking at our floors. We -- actually what we did during
COVID and since we've opened, we've rightsized our floors, and we've actually relaid them out, you'll see
pods, you'll see better vision, better excitement. We think there's also opportunities in pockets to increase
our capital spend with some decent ROIs, and we're looking at that right now.

Last question please, Chad.

Operator

And that question will come from Robin Farley with UBS.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to circle back to the tremendous proceeds that you're getting, because I know you've talked
about your balance sheet and all of that, but it doesn't seem like you would need it for any liquidity. It
doesn't seem like you need it for any projects near term. So I'm just wondering, is there any sort of tax
reason that you couldn't do a special dividend? Or is there a consideration there? And you use the phrase
kind of, I think if I heard it right, it looks for inorganic opportunity. So that's a pretty sizable budget in
terms of looking for. I assume that means potential M&A. And so I don't know if you can characterize kind
of where you see the portfolio having gaps to fill. What kind of thing might be of interest to you?

Jonathan S. Halkyard
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Robin. I'll offer following -- a few thoughts and then turn it over to Bill. There's really no
tax reason why we could not deploy that capital as a dividend to our shareholders or for returning
capital to shareholders through other means. And in fact, that remains a priority for us. It is their
capital. It represents, in broad terms, I think about it as releasing capital from the real estate in this
business, freeing it up for other uses, including returning to shareholders. My comment about inorganic
opportunities, I'm sure that can be development, can be M&A, and it's really in recognition that it's a very
dynamic environment and market with some interesting things going on. And so we really like our position
having this kind of liquidity available to seize on those, but I'll turn it over to Bill.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Robin, I want to remember -- remind, I should say, look, we talked about focus, we talked about
discipline, and we've talked about in our vision being a gaming company at foremost. And so look, where
gaming and entertainment might intersect themselves will be there, where digital will be there. We have
some reinvestments back in our properties. We think that's important over the next couple of years in
terms of room remodels and some other things. I don't know we'll go too far afield. I don't think that's
probably in our best interest or our shareholders.

So I think you'll see us disciplined and very focused on the idea of driving this whole omnichannel into a
different and better place as we think about the next decade or so.

Maybe just 1 clarifying question just since a large Vegas asset came up for sale earlier this year. Is it fair
to conclude that maybe MGM doesn't necessarily see a benefit in like growing its Vegas presence? Or I
mean, it seems like any property you acquire, there would be a tremendous amount of synergy just given
the scale you have there. But is it fair to assume from sort of how things have played out this year that,
that wouldn't necessarily be an area that you want to grow your presence?

Robin, I don't think we're going to comment right now. I appreciate the question, but I don't think it's --
we're not going to comment right now.

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference
back over to Bill Hornbuckle for any closing remarks.

William Joseph Hornbuckle
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Chad, and I'll be quick since this is going a little bit over. Again, I just want to call out
and thank our team, both universally and specific to deal teams that got us through this quarter with this
tremendous pace. We're coming off an amazing quarter. July is even more so. So I know what we have put
in play is trackable, is doable and sustainable. And so we're very excited by that. Labor and supply chain
remain an issue for our company as it does in the industry. But we've also learned a lot from that by not
having some things easily accessible to us. We've figured out different and potentially better ways to do
things. And so those learnings aren't going to go away.

We're going to remain diligent and keep the pressure on with COVID, particularly as it relates to our
employees and making sure we get them vaccinated. We're making good headway over the last 30 days,
and we'll continue to push on that aggressively. We look forward to our group business returning in the
back half of the year and have no reason to believe that at this date that it won't with some velocity.
BetMGM continues to shine. There's no reason to believe that second half of this year is not going to do
the same. And as we've all talked about, we have this tremendous liquidity position we're now looking at.
And so the future is bright and the opportunity is, I think, extensive. But again, we're going to be patient
and disciplined about what we do and when we do it.

So having said that, I appreciate everyone's attendance, and thank you all.

Operator
And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You
may now disconnect.
