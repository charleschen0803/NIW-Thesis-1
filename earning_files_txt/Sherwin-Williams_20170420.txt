Thank you, Bob
Good morning, everyone
First quarter 2017 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective
But there was one obvious exception and as our nature, I'm going to address it first
Our Consumer segment had a bad quarter
There are two reasons I feel it's important to address this upfront
One because I don't want you to think that our strong consolidated results diminishes the urgency we feel to address the challenges this group faced in the quarter
And two, because you need to know that nobody is more disappointed in how this quarter unfolded than the women and men responsible for driving this business
Consumer sales in the quarter were weak in most product categories across most market segments in most geographic regions all three months of the quarter
This was not the result of soft sales to one customer or one product line
We were comping against the first quarter 2016 load-in of the INFINITY product line at Lowe's and I wish the explanation for the weakness this year was that simple
I believe Consumer Group saw the flip side of the obvious strength in the professional paint market reflected in soft DIY demand in the first quarter, but they will remain focused on expanding our retail presence and driving sell through
You also need to know that I have the utmost confidence in this group
I know they will rise to the challenge
You should expect better results from our consumer segment over the balance of the year
The positive momentum we saw in our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter last year accelerated in the first quarter
Sales to residential repaint contractors continued its double-digit growth trajectory followed closely by sales to new residential painters, property management contractors, and commercial contractors
Equally encouraging our pro customers continue to report large project backlogs
Protective and marine coating sales and volume turned positive in the quarter, but lagged the pace of growth in architectural paint
During the quarter, paint stores group added 10 net new stores while this pace is slower than first quarter 2016, the difference is entirely attributable to timing issues
Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations compared to 94 opened in 2016. Today our total store count in the U.S
, Canada, and the Caribbean stands at 4,190 compared to 4,099 a year ago
Latin America Coatings Group delivered high-single-digit revenue growth in local currencies in the quarter, although down volumes were still recovering in most countries in the region
As market demand fully recovers, our management teams will continue to make progress on managing operating expenses and mitigating raw material cost inflation
Global Finishes Group delivered solid top-line growth in the first quarter with revenues up across all businesses and volumes up in most
Once again, the group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A resulting in a cycle high 11.1% first quarter operating margin, 30 basis points better than first quarter last year
We continue to see positive demand momentum in many of our industrial coatings businesses in North America, Latin America, and Europe and this team is well-positioned to flow through revenue growth to profit improvement
To get a more accurate picture of our profit performance in the quarter, you need to back up the effect of the two accounting changes we adopted last year plus the acquisition-related expenses
Excluding these items, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points to 49.6% of sales
SG&A improved to 37.2% of sales compared to 37.7% last year and PPG margin was 11.8% this year compared to 9.8% last year
Our reported tax rate in the first quarter of this year was 22%
If you back out the tax benefit from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 our effective tax rate would have been approximately 33%
Net income would have been $214.1 million, an increase of approximately 25% and earnings per share would have been $2.27 per share, up 25.4%
Net working capital increased slightly year-over-year as a percent of sales to 11.5% compared to 11.2% first quarter last year as accounts receivable and inventory both increased to support the strong sales momentum early in the year
In dollar terms, the increase in working capital was $97 million in the quarter compared to an increase of about $80 million in the first quarter last year
Despite the higher March 31 year-over-year working capital, we generated $231.8 million in net operating cash, an improvement of more than $290 million compared to the first quarter 2016 due primarily to the increase in net income and reduction of cash used during the quarter to service accounts payable compared to first quarter 2016. Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $41.5 million
Depreciation was $44.6 million and amortization was $6.2 million and in 2017, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $230 million, depreciation of $175 million to $185 million, and the amortization of about $30 million
Capital spending will continue to run higher than normal in 2017 as we complete investments and IT infrastructure, capacity, and new stores
Our cash balance on March 31 was just over $1 billion compared to $890 million at the end of 2016. We will continue to build cash on our balance sheet over the coming months to reduce total borrowings required to finance the completion of the Valspar acquisition
Therefore we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury during the quarter and we'll suspend share repurchase activity throughout 2017. On March 31, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share compared to $0.84 per share last year
North American architectural paint demand should remain strong throughout the year, driven by steady increasing level of residential remodeling activity and to a lesser degree new residential construction
As we move into the prime painting season, we are also encouraged by growing signs of more robust non-residential activity and improving demand for many of our industrial products
While growth in the U.S
Do-It-Yourself market will likely continue to lag the professional painter market, we expect positive sales growth in our consumer segment in the quarters ahead
On our year-end 2016 earnings call, I said our expectations for average year-over-year raw material inflation was in the low-single-digits
Given the recent uptick in crude oil, relatively high propylene pricing in the first quarter, tight market conditions in certain key monomers used in the production of latex, and low TiO2 inventories, we now expect raw materials inflation to be in the mid-single-digit range
The price increases we have announced to the market thus far in the year appear to be gaining traction and we have not made any additional announcements
We will however continue to monitor changes in the raw material environment and will respond appropriately to changes as we go through the year
Our outlook for second quarter 2017 is for consolidated net sales to increase mid-to-high-single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter driven in part by the revenue reclassification
With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share compared to last year's record $3.99 per share
Our guidance range for second quarter includes acquisition-related expense totaling $0.25 per share
As a reminder, second quarter 2016 earnings included $0.16 per share in acquisition-related expenses
For the full-year 2017, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2016 by mid-single-digit percentage
With annual sales at that level, we are updating our full-year guidance to be in range of $13.65 to $13.85 per share compared to $11.99 per share in 2016. Our updated full-year 2017 earnings guidance includes $0.40 per share charge for acquisition-related expenses which is $0.40 less than the charge included in our initial full-year guidance
And an increase in the income tax provision benefit of $0.25 per share more than forecasted in our original 2017 EPS guidance
These two items account for all of the change in our full-year 2017 EPS guidance
As a reminder, full-year 2016 earnings per share included $0.86 per share related to the Valspar acquisition and $0.40 accretion from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now we'll be happy to take your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Yes, so we don't talk about any specific customers so I'm not address the INFINITY directly
I will say that, as I mentioned earlier that the overall performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations and while we found ourselves in a situation where we felt there was weakness across the board
And it was a very challenging market
We just, we don't accept that
And so the answer your question, our expectations moving forward to be the best partner possible to our customers
And that means helping them get product off the shelf it's not our desire to fill their shelves is to help them get product off the shelves
I don't -- I don't want to get into a lot of specifics on our strategy to be able to do that
I will say that our teams
We have great confidence in our teams
We've got and I think the terrific strategy
We are looking forward to the combined business once we close on Valspar we think added to assets together or the people, the brands everything will make us better and we're focused on every one of our customers and helping them to be more successful
Yes, I would say that we're very pleased in the stores segment's performance while we don't give specific numbers
I will tell you that the residential repaying once again had a double-digit gain
This will be the 12th of 14 quarters that we've had double-digit gains and we feel as though there is a terrific momentum
I've got that's great respect for that team and what they're executing on right now is just been terrific
I would like to take you back to the second and third quarter of last year when we started talking about the challenges that some of our customers were talking about at that time which was their view of the world included a great confidence in the projects that they were working on and the bidding that they were doing, and if there was any concern in their comments, it was typically that they had more work than labor
And so while our residential repaying business has been growing for 12 to 14 quarters I have more confidence right now probably than ever because our team is really responded
We're not exactly sure what the second and third quarter has in store for us as it relates to labor and any constraints that they, our customers might experience but we're not waiting and our teams have been working very aggressively and filling the pipeline with new accounts to try to offset any slowdown that our customers might have in growing their business
It's a matter of are they at capacity or not
The residential repaying we're very excited about and momentum
The others commercial, new residential, I mean it is, is really a very strong quarter of stores organization, in fact even protective and marine we had a couple years of softness in protective and marine through our stores
We had a positive quarter in sales of protective and marine and that some of the bottoming out of the oil and gas, but we've been talking about pivoting into different segments and trying to accelerate in those segments
We'd like it to be faster without exception but we're starting to see some momentum there
The gross margin, I think in our first quarter, we were pretty happy with that result on the core we saw a 60 basis point improvement
As the year unfolds as Bob mentioned, the second quarter, we expect year-over-year, raw material inflation to be -- to peak we're confident that we can recoup the inflation in the market
It just doesn't happen in real time and as we see that the rest of the year unfolds on the effectiveness of our price increase, where raw materials trend out at the end of the second quarter, we'll have a better line of sight to our gross margins and update accordingly
Yes I believe in the first quarter our effectiveness was better than we thought and more than offset the raw material increase
Latin America will be higher, higher but across the rest of the globe, I'd say the U.S
the impact of titanium dioxide that has on our U.S
business is probably a little higher in the U.S
Yes
So Paint Stores Group increased $82.5 million, Latin America Coatings Group increased $4.9 million, Global Finishes Group increased $6.6 million, and Consumer decreased $10.2 million
No, it's certainly some easier numbers, but I would definitely say that it has an equal if not more result of the efforts that our teams are putting forward
I think that we are seeing some benefit in the market, we're seeing some easier comparison and we're certainly witnessing some benefit of the pivoting into some of the other segments I spoke of
Volumes in Paint Stores Group were very strong and as I mentioned I could go on every segment just as much passion as I started with resi paint but each one of our segments have really shown terrific growth and we're feeling really good about it and protective marine wasn't the headwind that it had been in the past
Are you talking about in our stores organization, Steve?
Through the consumers, yes consumer did lag and that's the comments that I made earlier, as far as we found some challenging markets and customers there is not one that I would point you to say that there was one customer, one geography, as I mentioned earlier, there was -- there were some challenges that we faced throughout nearly every market with many customers facing some tougher sales and our focus remains on helping them to be more successful
It's hard to say, I don't
I will say that we didn't experience any shelf loss, we've not found ourselves in situations where we feel as though we've lost shelf to our competitors we're just really trying to focus on helping our customers sell more product off the shelf
I don't think there was a significant difference throughout the quarter
If you adjust for days
I would say the non-paint categories remain strong
And I'd say the growth rates are in line with paint demand; we're seeing good momentum in those -- in those categories
P&M you talk Protective & Marine?
I'm sorry; I thought you meant non-paint sorry
No, I think that as I mentioned Protective & Marine sales were up but not in the same range as our architectural category, so it's certainly in our expectation that they wouldn't go from a direct headwind to a strong tailwind
And so we feel as though, as I mentioned, it's bottoming out in the industrial businesses inside our stores and through a lot of effort and some of the markets improving, we feel as though it's going to help us
It won't turn into a terrific tailwind for us immediately though
Yes it's funny we had this discussion every quarter and we like to see those numbers little smoother
But as you would expect with just different construction regulations and ordinances it's just a little bit of challenge to smooth those up
Bob, yes, we're going to load up, we're confident in the year
And no one should read anything into the number little softer in the quarter than what we would have liked but it was truly just a matter of in some cases getting permits, occupancy permits we're on, we're on the same point, we should be
On the inventory piece that's always something that we're trying to work with, with our customers
We want to as part of being their best supplier; we want to be the ones that can offer them the best service, so that they don't have working capital tied up in that
And so there is always in those discussions and I wouldn't say that to any greater extent, then we would expect or quite frankly that we would want
We want to help our customers in those terms
In regards to pricing, we don't comment on the pricing on that side of the business
We've spoken to our stores and we've spoken to the raw material basket but we, because of the competitive nature of those customers, we don't speak to any specific customers outside of our stores
Well, Mike, what we've done in it typical practice in the past as we've annualized, these types of changes we start including them in our core and that's why we didn't call it out on our second quarter
I think what you see is if you look at how the adjustments rolled out in the quarters last year they maybe a little bit muted from a timing standpoint, but they're smaller and probably typical of what you'll see going forward
I would say our first quarter was, was higher than what we are certainly expecting higher than last year and it was just a pure function of the amount of options that were exercised and the run-up in our stock price after the first -- our year-end call
So, on the first piece, no, I wouldn't say that it's been fully executed
We're working with customers across all businesses on stepping those price increases in
On the second question --
Yes, I mean little hesitant to do that, and only because from a strategic standpoint, I want to play my cards a little close to our best
I do feel though that it's fair to say that the teams that we have around the world, but particularly here in the U.S
because of the size of this business
Our focus on those areas as I mentioned earlier, I'm trying to help our customers to be more successful by selling more products rather than getting products in the shelf lane out the specifics on how we plan on doing that's something I'd rather show you the results and explain to you as we're working on these what we're doing
I mentioned that we have not experienced any shelf loss
I wouldn't say that we're -- we're feeling as though we're on the backend of any deals that went the other way but at the same time we're far from complacent, assuming everything is okay
We have -- we have very high expectations of our team and I do think that they found themselves as I mentioned in a challenging market
That said, we have higher expectations for ourselves and our investors should have higher expectations of us
Well as I mentioned and as Bob mentioned as well and we're now waiting to see last year's second quarter when we started to hear from our customers that they were concerned with their ability to grow their business
We started right then mobilizing our sales organization to effectively increase the number of accounts that we have an account activation program
So the good news that we see is that the fundamentals of the market are very, very strong, it's a matter of how much our customers can apply product and so many of them as we've said found themselves at capacity
Well when you find your customers at capacity and you want to grow your business, you got to find new customers and so we've been working very, very hard at both the share of wallet customers that are currently in our store that offer more opportunity as well as customers that are in other locations buying product and we've had some success there
So we're not waiting for the second and third quarter to play out
We're taking steps right now to control our future and we'll see how effectively we're compared to what the constraints in the markets are
But we're not just waiting for things, good things to happen to us
Well few things, Scott first the DIY number that Bob just quoted as far as our percent of sales was a total year it's a first quarter is a relatively small quarter for us in DIY
There is a shift clearly there is a shift from do-it-for-me to do-it-yourself to do-it-for-me
But there is still an awful lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow our business
Inside our stores we talked to DIY consumer because it's an important component not only in trying to grow our business but the DIY is a relatively small piece, we want that homeowner accepting our product coming in the door with the painting contractor
So in the first quarter, while it was up slightly, I'd say it's a relatively small percentage of our business it is the first quarter
Yes, you're right, we are pleased with our results in Q1 and again pointing to stores and even our Global Finishes Group momentum, we feel good about that
We've got great confidence in our strategy and great confidence in our team, so that as I feel like I have repeated a few times here, it's important part of our culture here and Sherwin, there is no complacency despite the fact that we had a good first quarter
But that said, and if you'll pardon a sports analogy I know you're a Yankees fan, but I'll use our beloved Cleveland Indians which we're very proud of
First inning of the game they may put a lot of runs on, on the scoreboard, but they don't start packing our bats after the first inning and so Scott, I'd say we're not packing our bat after the first quarter, we typically earn about I'd say between 15% and 20% of our full-year EPS in the first quarter and I'd say probably what else 65% to 70% in the middle two quarters
And so in other words we make our year in those middle quarters so not to overuse it but after the first quarter we're not ready to pack up our bags and go home
We've often said here at Sherwin that here is a strong weak in July can make up for a weak month in the first quarter
So while we're confident in our outlook and we have plans in place to sustain our momentum throughout the year we prefer to wait until we get this second quarter under our belt before making any adjustments in either direction to our full-year guidance, lot of confidence but we just think it's prudent to, to see this through
Yes but we better, right we've sort of lot of money to get those yes, we're very excited about what they bring very complementary in nature
We have gotten those, some of the people inside Valspar deeper into the organization and we're just absolutely thrilled with the team their approach, their attitude
We're anxious to be able to exchange more information and, but we know that's right around the corner
You're right, our feeling about how our team in the industrial side of our business has been doing has us feeling more bullish than we have in the past and that comes from a number of different areas
One is they have there was a question earlier, I think Greg asked about SG&A and our management of SG&A on the Global Finishes Group side, they've been managing that business very well
So, they're positioned quite frankly to be able to flow a lot of -- a lot of profit through our incremental sales
And the pipeline of customers that they've been working on line trials and the confidence that they have going forward has definitely improved
So we're feeling pretty good about that team and what they're trying to accomplish and likelihood that they'll get there
Yes, we've not lowered our expectations of that team
And John I know from our past discussions that you know this, but we couldn’t coordinate anything like that with Valspar anyway
I mean that's on the other side of the wall
So we're not allowed to have those types of discussions
Yes, you're exactly right now Dmitry and across the board, and all three of those areas
We saw an improved run rate
And I'd say we're feeling good as I mentioned just a moment ago about the pipeline of tests and trial runs that we've had continues to move in the right direction
We've been aggressive in the SG&A side on that business
And at the same time, we've been investing in new products and people that we feel can help drive our business forward
And so I'd say that across the Group through the three different businesses we saw sales gains across all three
We're feeling good about the momentum that they're gaining as they as they go forward
And as I mentioned the number of qualified trial runs that we've been on, has improved
So we're feeling better going forward
I think what you'll see is we opened 47 new stores last year
I think -- I think you'll see a slightly lower number than that and it's based on timing in the markets and similar type of issues we run into in the U.S
We love big infrastructure bills
Our Protective & Marine team has a good position in many aspects of the structural steel, the bridge and highway, water-wastewater, pretty much across the board
So we have -- we believe a terrific product line an outstanding distribution model, which we can utilize various stores that are properly equipped to take care of our customers that terrific technical people and a wonderful sales organization
So we've got a good position there and we'd love nothing better to see spending in this area
We have not included any specifics to any kind of an infrastructure bill
It certainly can
Our expectation would be that it is most likely to close before the June 21 date, it doesn't, we have not given that as the date of close
So the agreement that we that that we had signed originally with Valspar provided for to a provision a three-month extension, it happened to land on June 21 that was the three-month extension
So our hope and expectation as we move through that process is that we'll be able to close before then
Chuck?
Yes, so we have had a couple of markets there that have moved in the right direction from what both a sales and volume standpoint
We've had mix that we've had couple that have not broken to that line yet
I would say that even in those areas that we're a little under pressure, we still saw improvement in specific segments
And so we're -- we're feeling better about Latin America as a whole
We're now to the point after release screwing down the expenses there, we have invested a little bit of money in some of the things that we think will continue to drive business clearly will keep that on a short leash
But we don't break out by country or business unit down there Greg, but I would say that it's safe to say that we've had positive momentum in all of them, some of them are in fact, positive volumes
They're just slightly negative, just slightly
I would say from a quarter-to-quarter, I'm sorry month-to-month within the quarter is there was choppiness; there was no trend that I could speak to that
And quite frankly that's a little why we were able to manage the SG&A as we did because we didn't see any traction earlier on in the quarter and so since the November, October time last year we've been really trying to manage the expenses on this business
Going forward, I'd say that the expectations that we have would have to include catching up on some of the business that we had expected to see already and it's going to be hard to say how much of that is market improvement and how much of that is some of the product that we had hoped would have been shipped prior to this moment actually getting shipped
So it's going to be a little difficult for us to have that clean line of sight
Again I'd reiterate that and we're feeling good about the relationships that we have with our customers and not having experienced a specific loss of any space
We truly believe that working with our customers and this is what we have been working on to make them better is going to be the answer
Customer is number one always number one
We want to get in front of as many customers as we can
We've got a very detailed plan on how we approach this and we're anxious to get in front of those customers as quickly as possible
Number two employees
We've got because of the line of sight of our customers is somewhat muted, we don't have specific customers to see we can't exchange that information
We have plans to be in certain business units to visit with those key customers but we do know where the employees are and so getting in front of those customers, employees, and working with them to really put them at ease on the exciting future that they're going to have with Sherwin-Williams would be second
From there, there is a great deal of effort that has gone into the blueprinting of the businesses, how we're going to move forward in areas such as removing complexity, value capture, exchange of information, exchange of technology, and each business unit has mapped those out in great detail
Again there are limits in what we can exchange but there's a lot of things that we can and so we've had the right people engaged in the room in talking about what those priorities are and we've got that down business to business, line by line and we're very excited, if there's been any positive at all to this business taking a little longer to be combined than what we would have liked, it's been our ability to work in greater detail on some of the things that we may not have gotten to until month two or three
But with the additional time, we've been able to get deeper, where legally allowed
