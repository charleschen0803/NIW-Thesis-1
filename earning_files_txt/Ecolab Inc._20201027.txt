Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to Ecolab's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Monahan. Thank you. Mr. Monahan, you may now
begin.

Michael J. Monahan
Senior Vice President of External Relations

Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's third quarter conference call. With me today is Doug
Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; Christophe Beck, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dan
Schmechel, our Chief Financial Officer.

A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results
and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read
the cautionary statements in these materials, which state that this teleconference and the associated
supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements,
and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to
differ are described under the Risk Factors section in our September 25, 2020, Form 8-K and in our posted
materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.

Starting with a brief overview. Third quarter results showed significant improvement from the second
quarter while still reflecting the divergent impacts from COVID-19 on the business segments. Fixed
currency sales and earnings per share declines narrowed as we leveraged recovering customer end
markets with new business wins, increased customer penetration and cost efficiency actions to show the
sequentially better results.

Sales and income for our Healthcare and Life Sciences segment were strong as it continued to benefit
from good underlying business trends, strong cleaning and sanitizing demand and several large onetime
sanitizer orders.

Our Industrial segment saw a modest sales decline as end-market activity returns toward more normal
levels, while income growth continued to be strong due to pricing and lower costs.

Institutional division results also improved from the second quarter as consumer activity within
restaurants, hotels and entertainment facilities continue to recover, though traffic at them continues to run
below last year due to COVID-related restrictions that yielded the lower Institutional segment results.

We expect our overall improvement to continue in the fourth quarter, though likely at a slower rate, as the
second COVID wave impacts reopenings. We remain confident we will emerge from 2020 with a stronger
competitive advantages and a more robust product offering.

We continue to invest in the key drivers for our business. Our accelerated investments in hand care and
sanitizing capacity are paying off, and our continued digital investments and accelerated field technology
deployment are enabling us to provide excellent customer support, even where we cannot be there in
person, while also enabling better value delivery and further efficiency in our cost to serve.

We remain firmly focused on maximizing our post-COVID position. While COVID-19 creates a near-term
challenge, it also creates long-term opportunities. In a world challenged by COVID, our food safety, clean
water and healthy environments positioning has become even more important. We believe that our long-
term growth opportunities remain robust driven by our huge remaining market opportunity; our leading
global market positions; our focus on providing our strong customer base with improved results while
lowering their water, energy and other operating costs; and our strong financial position with resilient free

cash flow. We believe looking beyond the near-term uncertainty and focusing on these sustainable long-
term business drivers will yield superior long-term performance for Ecolab and our investors.

And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Thanks, Mike, and good day, everybody. So our sales and earnings showed significant improvement in Q3
versus the lows we saw in Q2, which was expected. This is led principally by our Institutional division as its
markets reopened albeit partially. Our Healthcare and Life Science businesses continued to accelerate with
our third quarter sales up 29%. And our Industrial businesses performed solidly as well with negative 3%
sales but 18% OI growth.

Importantly, we expect the overall improvement to continue in Q4, though at a slower pace, as COVID
second wave is expected to dampen reopenings. Even so, we have a number of initiatives underway as the
opportunities and challenges presented by COVID are much clearer now. We have a heavy up and front --
upfront investment in hand care and sanitizer production, which is now coming online and starting to pay
off. Our launch of new antimicrobial with best-in-class 30-second COVID-19 kill claims are well-timed. It's
just going out now. Our continued investments in digital and our accelerated rollout of our newest shield
technology is paving the way for further efficiencies and our cost to serve, which we are capitalizing on
now through targeted cost-savings programs.

Finally, our new business efforts continue to drive really good results, particularly in Institutional. Our
ability to dramatically outperform our competition in terms of customer care during the COVID period is
being rewarded with new business across the board. And our new Ecolab Science Certified program is
helping drive improved penetration in existing customers.

If you recall, our objective for this year was to maximize our position for post-COVID success, and we are
well on our way to do that. As a result, we feel we'll be in very good position leaving the year. As we look
forward, we expect COVID to run into 2021 fairly deeply, meaning through several quarters, but we also
expect our business to continue and strengthen as our capacity, innovation, new market entries, Ecolab
Science Certified and digital efforts put us in a great position to manage and grow our business. So I feel
really good about the steps our team has taken; how they've managed through this period; and most
importantly, how they position us for success in 2021. Thank you.

Michael J. Monahan
Senior Vice President of External Relations
Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please begin the question-and-answer
period.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Doug, I know there's a lot of uncertainty right now and a lot of moving parts between your different
segments. But I think a key question for me and what's on a lot of investors' minds this morning is, based
on what you know today, when do you expect to get back to 2019 EPS or better?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. Well, thank you, Tim. I would say we're not giving specific forecast, but I'll say this. Even with
COVID second wave, and I think we've -- we understand where COVID's going. We track it very carefully,
meaning all the recent news reports about what's happening in Europe, what's happening in the U.S. is
not really news to us per se that we've considered this in thinking about our business progression, even
when we talk about further improvement in Q4 and how we're considering 2021. That doesn't mean it
couldn't be worse than we anticipate or could be better than we anticipate, but I don't believe we are
underestimating COVID.

With that said, I think we are in good shape to be playing above 2019 EPS in 2021. The question is really
how much. We've got a number of things that give us confidence. The markets, we believe, are going
to be better, on average, in '21 than they were in '20, principally because we don't expect a repeat of a
global shutdown during the March, April period. That alone drives, on average, a significant improvement
in just underlying market performance.

Inventory reduction is really behind us. Dishmachine rent relief isn't going to be repeated, a lot of the one-
offs that we had talked about that we took purposely in Q2. And we know we've gained share. We've got
very strong innovation. And we've added capacity on hand care, where, honestly, we could sell more if we
could make more, and now we're able to make more. And ultimately, we know we're also taking steps to
lower our costs.

So we feel we're well positioned next year. We've got a number of levers to pull. And so I expect sitting
here today that we will be certainly above 2019 EPS in 2021.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. That's really helpful. Appreciate your thoughts there. I'd also like to ask about your new business
wins and how that trended through the quarter relative to your expectations. Are these wins coming from
developing growth opportunities? Or is it more just from recovering end markets? I know you've got a lot
going on with new sanitizers and science certified, for example. So I was curious how that's all affecting
the cadence of your new wins.

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I'll ask Christophe to go address this. But we've been, I would say, very surprised at the strength. We
were worried early in COVID with the fact that we couldn't make in-person calls in the same manner that
we did prior, impact our ability to get customers to yes. And that's turned out to be a false worry. We've
actually performed very well through this whole period.

And I'll give Christophe an opportunity to give you some color.

President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Doug, and Tim, good morning or good afternoon. So yes, new business has been going very
well this year when we think year-over-year growth of new business that we track. So on a monthly basis,
it's basically growing at the same pace as it used to be as well, so pre-COVID, which is very encouraging.

Doug is right as well. So installing that new business has become a bigger challenge, which means that
our full book of business ultimately will help us as well down the road. But we've leveraged as well digital
technology. So to do that in unbelievable ways where we could install new customers all remotely, so
we've learned as well, and those are capabilities that we can use as well tomorrow.

And to your question on the main drivers. I'd like to come back as well to what we discussed during
the previous calls as well, where many customers are coming to us because they are looking for our
expertise from a science perspective as well, how to deal with COVID, how to make sure that their guests
or customers can be protected as well. That's been a huge driver for many new customers to come to us.

It's also innovation. Doug mentioned our new sanitizing programs that we have that are killing COVID-19
in 30 seconds or less. Those are world records out there, and that's coming out of years of innovation as
well.

And last but not least, in more difficult economic times, our customers like our proposition of driving the
total cost of operations down, which drives more business as well towards us. So net-net, new business
generation is kind of steady even versus what we had pre-COVID.

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. And I would just add because Christophe won't say it, he'll be humble today is from an operating
standpoint, our businesses have done a great job performing in a tough environment and honestly, have
dramatically outperformed competition in our ability to meet our customer needs. When it's required in
unit, we get there. We've worked and leveraged remote digital capabilities, and this has really been led by
Christophe and all of our teams out in the field, and that has made a big difference here as well.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first question was just around this increased focus on standardization that clearly, you guys are
benefiting from, maybe a 2-part. The first one is, you talked about you can now do more capacity in
hand care. But I was just curious if there was any updates on any other areas where maybe you still are
restrained in terms of how much you can produce. And I think for the first time ever, I saw an Ecolab ad
on TV for certified science, I guess. Is that trying to target a little bit more branding versus the Cloroxes
and Lysols of the world?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I'll touch on the capacity question. Our capacity challenges really have been around hand care, in
particular. To a lesser extent, to some surface sanitizes, it's all driven by demand. Meaning our hand
sanitizer business is up 3x.

Now we've had to do a lot of work to be able to increase capacity 3x. And now we are expanding that
beyond that because demand is greater than that. But these aren't easy, easy ramp-ups as you go
through this, right? This is GMP. You've got to make this properly. We don't take shortcuts. We're not
the guys using bad ingredients. People can count on us. And so we're going to do this the right way, so
customers continue to count on us going forward. But the operations team has done really a terrific job

ECOLAB INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

working with the team to move these volumes up. And we have a lot of capacity now just coming online
because it takes months to order the equipment. We found very creative ways to do this.

Regarding the TV, Ecolab Science Certified, let me give that to Christophe.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Doug, and Manav, good to hear you. Ecolab Science Certified, so it's something kind of new for
us. So we're learning as well as we go. Was really meant to support our customers to provide reassurance
for their consumers, their guests, for the most part, so in hotels and in restaurants. And it's been really
driven by the fact that we knew that guests were faithful about the risk of infection. We all know that. We
knew as well at the same time that hospital-grade disinfectants were driving them. So 2 to 1x versus the
retail brands that you mentioned as well before. So that was a plus clearly as well so for us.

And the third thing was really that we knew we heard from guests that they wanted to see clean, not
just to have people telling them that it's safe out there. All that brought together this fear of being
infected, the fact that you like hospital-grade disinfectants, the fact that you want to see that it's clean
and safe led us to this concept of Ecolab Science Certified that has been extremely well welcomed by our
customers. Their customers seem to be liking it a lot as well. So great reaction from customers. We're
really working now in the rollout of all those thousands of sites as well, so around the gentry. And from a
media perspective, it's just after a few weeks, so hard to tell, but early indication are way above average
than what we had expected.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And it was nice to hear the comments on 2021 EPS, but maybe just on fourth quarter trends.
I guess in terms of the way you described it, it sounds like fourth quarter won't -- even if there is a
resurgence in cases, et cetera, it won't be as bad as the June quarter, but maybe somewhere between
that and the September quarter that you just reported in terms of maybe partial lockdowns and impacts.
Would you say that's a fair characterization?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I think Q4 is, one, you're entering Q4 with a very different run rate from a market consumption
standpoint than we entered Q3. And so as a consequence, you've got a room. I mean to get to even
equal, right, you can have some degradation through the quarter just fundamentally. We expected -- I
mean some of these lockdowns are just being announced, but we knew that COVID second wave was
real coming, and there's going to have to be some reactions to this. And so as a consequence, it's in our
mindset.

Now it could get more severe than we anticipate and everything else. But we expect Q4 to be better than
Q3 and the top line on income, on EPS on an absolute basis and on a relative basis versus prior year. I
mean that's -- so -- and I think it's with our eyes wide open, but this is a wild world. And we're here to
react to what we need to react to, and we'll do the smart things.

Long term, this business, I think, is in great shape. And we're going to manage intelligently. The one thing
I'm not going to do is cut key investments in Q4 and do some other things because they are really what is
paving the way for our very positive feelings about 2021 and beyond.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

ECOLAB INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Your Institutional organic sales were down 28% year-over-year. What's your estimate of what the market
was down? Maybe give us some perspective on the share gain.

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. It's not as easy as just doing the straight math simply because the market is down 50%. We're not
going to be down 50%. There's just some base level of consumption in these units if they're just open.
So the numbers that we have shared in the deck and others is over 90% of restaurants in the U.S. were
opened by the end of third quarter, running at a roughly 55% capacity rate. Now in addition to that,
they're doing a bunch of off-premise, but obviously, off-premise doesn't generate much warewashing
business, as you might imagine, if you've been an off-premise customer.

So I would say, we certainly -- our volumes are healthier than the restaurant volumes in total. We do
believe we're gaining share because we track very carefully what we're gaining and what we're losing. And
I would say our losses have been minimal. And I mean, we've done a great job on the other side, securing
a bunch of new business through this period.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then water downstream sales were down 11%. Petrochemical was up, so refining was down more
than 11%. I don't know if that is surprising or not. But I thought the utilities, the steam system and the
cooling tower were relatively insensitive to the refinery operating rate. Or is that not the case?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I'll give this to Christophe. Our water businesses improved. You're talking downstream, and you're
right, downstream was worse in Q3 than Q2.

Christophe, you want to...

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

That's right. Yes. Overall picture, Industrial is in a very solid shape as you've seen. So up modestly, and
the OI is up double digit, as you have noticed, driven by a few great businesses, obviously, like water
being one of them; food and beverage, really good; water improving very nicely.

On downstream, you underline petrochem, which is positive. This is really true. Otherwise, for the fuel
refining business, we're kind of in line with the consumption, which was down 12% roughly in the quarter.
But when the oil price is low, refiners have a tendency to go for like crude, which means that they need
much less of our additives as well, which are usually used for harder to treat as well product. So generally,
we like the petrochemical, which is where we focus most of our attention, especially going forward.

Operator

Out next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Doug, you guys increased your savings this quarter to $335 million from, I think, $270 million. Where
are those additional savings coming from? And with COVID impacts go well into '21, are you looking at
additional temporary or interim cost levers to pull to offset these headwinds?

ECOLAB INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Yes, I'll have Dan answer specific questions around numbers. But yes, I would say a couple of things.
What we wanted to do is allow time so that we could see more clearly where we are going to be hit, say,
for several quarters, at least, or even a couple of years, like we've talked about lodging recovery and some
other things. And we are starting to adjust our cost in businesses that are going to have more lingering
effects.

You might think also, we are investing in some businesses like Healthcare and Life Sciences, where we
expect the lingering impacts to be positive. And so we have increased A 2020, which was the program that
we had in underway, which is really a place for us to put early moves there. They were not a big impact at
all in Q3, will start impacting Q4 somewhat, but the major impacts will be in Q1 and Q2 of next year.

And Dan, if you want to add some detail.

Daniel J. Schmechel
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks. So just as you've indicated, right, we've announced that we've taken up the full year
target from $270 million to $335 million. And of this incremental $65 million, as Doug has indicated, we
anticipate that the big bulk of that, say, maybe $50 million, will fall into 2021, with a little bit recognized in
2020, not much, frankly, given the fact that we're -- you can imagine starting -- where we're starting now
near the end of October and a little bit of cleanup in 2022.

In terms of what drives it, I mean, I would go back to sort of how we're thinking about A 2020 or this
cost-savings initiative, generally, which is some of this is a reorganization. A lot of it, frankly, is driven
by getting back benefit from the significant investment that we've made in Institutional. And as Doug
has indicated, we're really similarly sitting here in the era of COVID, taking a look at our deployment
principally and where we might see continuing benefit. And so of the $50 million, it's pretty evenly spread,
frankly, across the Industrial business opportunities; in supply chain, too, where we true-up and had
an opportunity to think of improving efficiency of some of the lines; and some also in the Institutional
business, not surprisingly.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And Doug, just looking longer term, given the impact of COVID on Institutional, is this Institutional a fast-
growing business post-COVID than it was pre-COVID?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I think there's going to be -- I mean Institutional is obviously ground zero for COVID, and there's
going to be some knock-on effects for a period of time, but not forever, by any means. I would say, I think
if you read most lodging forecast, people believe that business travel will be down for several years, but
will start coming back. It will be replaced in fairly short order, but I think lodging takes a couple of years
to recover. I think restaurants recover a lot quicker. And the reason for that is if you look at the history of
recessions and everything else, even in restaurants that go out of business, there seems to be an endless
line of people who think opening a restaurant is a great idea. And that has been true. And you end up
with a lot of, let me just say, capital-light opportunities after these recessions. You have strip malls with
restaurants in them that are vacant, where they are looking for somebody to move in and put a sign on
the door and get back into business, and it's sort of a time-honored tradition.

So, so far, I would say, we've been surprised at the fact that there's not more restaurants out of business
during this period. We expect that there will be more, particularly as we get into the winter, but it's still
probably below the forecast that we had internally last March and April. So Institutional, ultimately, we
feel very confident will be a -- and continue to be a great business.

Now we can get to earnings, right, growth faster than we'll probably get to sales record growth simply
because we're doing a lot in the business. Some of this is planned pre-COVID, a lot of the technology
moves we're doing, the efficiency moves. We've accelerated the deployment. I mentioned this in my

opening comments of the newest and latest shield technology, which gives us a lot of new capabilities and
makes our field team a lot more efficient and gives them much more time to sell. We are adjusting our
field service team to what we expect to be service requirements going forward and efficiency benefits. But
we're actually adding sales firepower because we're now coming through this, and out of this, we want
to go out and secure the new business that's going to occur. There are other forecasts, let's say, in 2021,
midsized chains and others will be adding a significant higher number of units than they've done in recent
years as they work to capitalize on this, too. And we want to be the guys there getting this business.

We never mind taking, if you will, SG&A risks like this. We think they're wise. We think they're going to
pay off and help us recover even faster. And if we're wrong, they're not hard to address.

The next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I guess if I could go back to the cost program for a second. Good to hear about the incremental and where
that's coming from and the timing. But can you just give us an update on where you are versus the initial
plan? As I recall, it was a significant number and growing number from '19 to '20 and then into '21. Are
you on pace? Did you pull some forward given the challenges of this year? Or is there still an expectation
that there's a significant step-up from the original plan next year before this $50 million incremental that
you're adding here?

Daniel J. Schmechel
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So this is Dan again. Let me -- I'll just walk through the sequence here. We announced a plan,
right, which was originally $200 million and took it up to $325 million, so we accelerated it. Of that $325
million, $55 million was focused directly on the upstream business. And so those cost savings and all of
the incurred expense associated it went with the ChampionX business. So that's how we net down to the
$270 million. And frankly, we've described this $270 million as $200 million in run rate savings for Ecolab
and then offsetting $70 million of what were essentially stranded costs related to the separation of the
ChampionX business. So that's the background on the $270 million.

If you focus on the $270 million, I would say that our capture of that opportunity has been almost exactly
in pace with what we have said, okay? And so now we're saying that we're going to increase it by $65
million for all of the reasons that I went through, with the biggest part of that benefiting and falling into
2021.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. So there's -- I mean I have the $325 million breakdown, which you provided a few years ago. And
so I understand part of that went away, but it was like $80 million in '19, $105 million in '20 and $140
million in '21 was the initial target. So assuming a lot that went away is in '21 maybe, but -- so there's a
significant step-up still from the original plan, and then you're adding on top of that.

Daniel J. Schmechel
Chief Financial Officer

I would say yes. Okay. From the $200 million to the $270 million, that was the step-up. Really, though, I
would think about that as an offset to the ChampionX-stranded costs.

What we disclosed as incrementally benefiting 2020 originally was $110 million. And it will be essentially
that number with a little bit of increase related to the $65 million increase. So I view this as being -- once
we expanded the plan for the first time, if you net down to the $270 million, which is ex the ChampionX
piece, we have been pretty much in line with the targets year-by-year, as we've communicated them.

ECOLAB INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes, I'll only add this. What we said very early in this, and we were asked that we're going to make cost
adjustments even back as early as February. We basically said, "Look, we're in the fog of war. We don't
know what moves to make right now. We need this fog to clear and really have more understanding of
where the opportunities are and where the challenges are going to be, what's going to linger and what's
going to go away quickly." And as a consequence, we are sitting here today with much more clarity around
what needs to happen moving forward. So we're much more confident taking steps that we don't believe
are going to cause any unintended harm and other moves.

The team, I think, is in a great place. Everybody understands. And since we're adding in some businesses
and subtracting and others, even where we're reducing our team, we have opportunities to create for
them another businesses, which we're making available sort of differently than we've done in the past. So
these are moves we're taking.

So in Institutional, we're certainly taking steps, which I mentioned, around field service costs, in particular,
given number of units and the efficiencies that we have generated as a consequence of the technology
investments and all the digital investments that we've been talking about over time. You would expect
us to do those. And now we have a better understanding of delay of the land, and so we're taking
those steps. And if anything, I would expect us to take more -- not -- this is not internal, that's all been
discussed. But as we start getting clarity around the financials, what that means and what it means for
2021.

Our next question is in the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood.

Ryan Michael Connors
Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask a question about -- you talked about the fog of war, Doug. One of the things that seems
to be emerging from that is that the big chains are out there taking share, if you will, or faring better
than some of the mom-and-pops restaurants, as an example, but I guess that's in a number of different
industries. That would seem to favor a company like Ecolab that presumably is heavy with some of those
big national accounts. Can you talk about that dynamic and whether you think that's meaningful, and how
that affects you, if that does, in fact, continue in the next couple of few years?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I mean it could only be a net positive for us. How it exactly plays out in terms of their ability to
continue to garner share vis-à-vis smaller players, we watch the same trend. I believe they will gain share
during the upcoming periods, probably even more notably during recovery. They're poised to add units
aggressively and would be in a position to do it even faster and, in some cases, in, say, smaller and mid-
sized players. So I would say we're not -- it's hard for us to say exactly what this means to us. But I would
say, to make a case it's a negative would be hard to make. It's net positive, for sure.

Ryan Michael Connors
Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then my other one was at risk of going across the valley as it were. You talked about
investments in capacity, in hand care and sanitizers and the 3x demand growth and so forth. Obviously,
you're not the only one making those capacity investments. And if, in fact, things normalize post-vaccine,
even if that's a year or 2 or whatever out there, how do you guard against, really, as a company and as an
industry adding too much capacity and then we've got a negative pricing cycle in those product lines once
this all kind of -- the dust settles here?

12

ECOLAB INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Yes. I would say there's 2 things. One, here's our expectation in the hand care market. We think in the
near term, it probably -- and this includes hand soap, which is obviously a much larger market than hand
sanitizer in total, that the combined market triples and then settles as a double versus pre-COVID, i.e.,
there's certainly a COVID bubble here, but the post-COVID will be at a run rate much higher than the pre-
COVID simply because you condition people through this around hand hygiene, which, by the way, is a
smart thing to do to prevent many other viruses than just COVID-19.

So with that, yes, are people going out? Yes, we're not the only guys adding capacity. But I would say
prior to this, we were also doing a lot of co-packing. So we are now in a place where we have additional
capacity. If it proves not to be as wise, we can in-source stuff if we need to. So I think we've got a number
of options here, and we wanted to create more options, if you would, going forward.

In terms of all -- how price war, it's not going to work that well here. Even hand care, dispensers fall off
walls, things happen. We have been priced at a premium. In almost every one of our markets, we're the --
if not the global leader, right, #2 in the world in terms of hand care. And we do it at a significant premium
because service does matter even in this market. So I don't think we're -- I don't think that's going to be
the play or the conversation we're going to be having in 2 years.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So you went on this a little bit, but I just want to get down a little bit further. But despite a lot of noise
on the Institutional revenues right now, how should we be thinking about the current market share gain
environment? It still seems, despite a lot of noise, like you're outperforming a lot of your peers. And then
also, just when we think about the growth in innovation investments, how do those ultimately factor
into your expectations for your framework for '21 and '22? So just any additional color would be greatly
appreciated.

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. Well, I'll just put together what we've already said on the call in maybe a different context. One, we
have confidence that the business is going to be playing above 2019 in total next year, right, from an
earnings standpoint. We don't believe Institutional is going to be fully back while we're doing that, which
we've also said. Institutional will ultimately have record sales and record earnings. We have not seen the
peak of Institutional by any stretch because that market will come back. We think foodservice first, lodging
a little later. The good news is foodservice is much larger, and there are underlying trends in foodservice,
which are positive. We are gaining share, which means I think we'll even beat the market getting back.

So I guess, the point is, I think when you look out beyond the depths of COVID, you've got a number of
positive earning machines, right, within this business. [ Delivery ] of Institutional over the couple of years;
[ slightly ] faster recovery in Industrial and some of the other players; technology, lowering our cost to
serve on a permanent basis, et cetera. So I -- we feel like the steps that -- the steps we've done in the
last 6 months, I think, has long legs. That was the whole idea. We didn't want to go do a bunch of stuff in
the second quarter that would only help the third quarter. We wanted our stuff to have years of benefit,
not weeks of benefit. And I think that's why I'm proud of the team. You can get very flustered during
these periods because these results are hard to report. It's not what we normally do. But I think the steps
will prove to be very wise going forward. I don't think we're very far away from getting back to the type of
reports people expect out of us.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. That's very helpful. And just very quickly on the Industrial front. There's been a fairly material
divergence between end markets. Just versus your initial expectations, let's say, coming out of the second

quarter, can you just assess your performance in F&B, water and downstream? And then similar to my
questions on Institutional, how would you also view your own relative end-market performance on a go-
forward basis?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes, I'll give this -- Christophe got this.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Chris, maybe starting with your Industrial question, and then I'll cover Institutional. So as mentioned,
overall, Industrial is in a very solid shape, saw slightly off at sales, but income up 18%. And that's the
advantage we have, that we have so many different end markets as well that we serve but all driven by
these needs of water purity and hygiene, food safety as well, which are obviously some big trends right
now.

So when we think in terms of the water businesses, the way we call them, so this one has improved very
nicely. So from a minus 5% to a minus 2% in Q3, and we expect that to improve as well in the quarters to
come.

F&B, which has been a very strong franchise pre-COVID has remained fairly strong positive, for sure,
during COVID as well. Q3 being a little bit of an unusual quarter out of 2 reasons. One is the total
shutdown of brewing in Latin America. They're not allowed to produce beer, basically, over there, and we
have a huge business over there, extremely strong, extremely profitable as well, but that's going to come
back. People are not going to stop drinking beer, obviously.

And dairy as well in the U.S., which is related to schools as such, but this is very temporary.

New business is really strong in F&B, good momentum, great relationship with customers. There's no
one even close to us who can really bring the water and hygiene as mentioned before. So a very strong
position on Industrial.

And in Institutional, a lot has been said. Obviously, before, I firmly believe that people are going to go
back ultimately so to what we call out-of-home. As such, people are not going to start cooking from
scratch in the long term. So these trends are going to be positive. At the same time, people are going
to look for more demonstrated safety in restaurants and in hotels. This is well to our advantage. They're
going to look as well for more expertise. This is Ecolab's strength as well. They will want to have global
standards as well that you have in every unit anywhere around the country or the world. Well, this is what
we offer to customers.

And last but not least as well as such, well, it's mostly driven by corporate accounts, as Ryan was asking
before, 2/3 of our business are large customers, well, that's where the growth is going to come from, and
that's where we have most of our focus. So Institution long term is going to be a positive story as well. So
I hope it helps, Chris.

Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So looking at the other segment, it seems like it's mostly going to be driven by pest. The profitability
surged pretty dramatically compared to kind of the revenues where, look, they were up but not nearly
to this degree. Was there a bit of a catch-up in there? Or I guess, can you help to explain kind of the
incremental margins from 2Q to 3Q in that business and help us to think about how to think about that
business going forward?

ECOLAB INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Executive Chairman

I would say within their pest, our pest business, I would say, recovered even stronger than we had
thought it would during the third quarter. It was down 2% year-on-year in the third quarter. And they
made up a lot of ground. They have done a number of smart things in that business and are poised to
break through the growth number even in the fourth quarter. So of those businesses, it's probably the
most significant in terms of its ability to earn money. And most of the -- that's probably the biggest
positive story coming out of the other segment.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. And then maybe just a housekeeping question just because admittedly, I've gotten probably a
dozen e-mails on this since you've been talking. But -- so when you talk about EPS growth in 2021 versus
2019, I assume that's on the $5.12 base, the kind of pro forma, the oilfield services split base. Is that
right? Am I thinking about that right?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. That would be our new -- that would be the '19 number we would compare to.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just thinking about trying to bridge Institutional a bit more, and I'm looking at that Slide 4 you've
provided in the supplemental data. And in particular, just trying to think about the multiplier effect of
product use in COVID and what percentage of operating rates in full-service restaurants do we need to get
back to in order to kind of make it whole with 2019 because presumably, you don't have to get back to
100% or 90% or something like that, just given more products being used. And likewise, for lodging. So
any thoughts there would be helpful.

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Well, we don't have a specific number to throw out. It would be less than 100%. I think the truth of the
matter is, you're -- there's going to be this natural, I would say, recovery ceiling until you have vaccine.
Now what we believe is vaccines will be approved here in short order, but they're first going to go to
frontline workers, second to populations at greatest risk and then broader populations beyond that. And
you need a significant number of the population to get it. It's going to take quarters, right, to get this out.

And the reason I bring this up is I really think we will continue to see improvement in Institutional.
Some on the top and then on the bottom line as we go through this. I don't know that you're going to be
breaking through 90% than others until you get real breakthrough on COVID, to be honest.

We've watched in other markets. There's just a fundamental fear factor that stops people from going in
the environment even when there's low COVID rate. Now it improves. It's got, clearly, room from this 55%
number. But I don't think it buzzed through 80% until you start seeing COVID done. With that said, we
don't expect Institutional to be fully back in '21, but we expect to be certainly playing north of '19 EPS in
'21.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And just as a follow-up, just thinking about the SG&A line into next year. You're down about $165 million
year-to-date, and I'm just trying to reconcile. You have some discretionary cost savings that maybe some
of that starts to come back later next year versus the cost program that you're running to take things out.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

ECOLAB INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

So how should we be thinking about SG&A trending into the fourth quarter? And then how much do you
think it can actually stay down next year?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I think the discretionary savings, i.e., T&E, in particular and some others, I think lasts well into
next year. Our view -- we're going to respond to what actually happens on COVID, not what we believe.
We believe COVID's here through a good part of 2021. If that proves to be wrong and it goes away
faster, then that will benefit and vice versa. But our travel isn't going to change dramatically until COVID
restrictions change. And so there's sort of what I will call natural benefit lined up with sales pressure.

So we think for the majority, certainly, majority next year, we're going to see depressed T&E travel as a
consequence. We will not bring it back up to 100% of 2019 rates for a long period of time because I think
we've all learned. There probably are a number of trips we took in the past that we didn't need to take,
and we will be using digital technology. In many cases, that prior we took trips to accomplish. So travel is
not going down to 0, but it's not going back to 100% in '19 either.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.

Scott Andrew Schneeberger
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

With regard to Healthcare and Life Sciences, that growth rate certainly is impressive. How sustainable
do you think that is? And then the margin in the segment was very strong. Just curious, how much was
pricing and other factors for the margin expansion and maybe some discussion on sustainability of that?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I'll give it to Christophe.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Doug. Scott, so it's been another great quarter for this group. So 29% top line growth, 82%
income. And it's been driven by both big businesses in there. So Healthcare and Life Science, both were
in the double-digit top line growth and income growth as well, driven from one part because of COVID. On
the other hand, as well, a lot of government business as well that we could conclude as well in Germany,
in the U.K., in Australia because of the expertise that we could provide as well, so to those agencies with
whom we have great relationship. That's going to partly stay in the future, but it's going to ease as well
over time, whenever COVID is going to ease as well. So that's back to Doug's comment of the vaccine and
how many quarters we'll have to wait for that.

Bottom line, when we think in terms of underlying growth, we've said so for Healthcare that if you exclude
those big onetimers, it's roughly 12% top line, but that's still driven by the COVID wave as well. So when
that eases as well, we believe that we will be so in healthcare. So kind of 6% to 8% underlying growth,
which is really where we always wanted to be. So ultimately, that's a business that has truly benefited
from what's happening here.

And on life science, it's a business that's totally on fire. It's really an industry that loves what we do for
them. New business is extremely strong. Innovation is very strong as well, think Bioquell as well, so has
grown 100% during the quarter as well in Q3, while those are offerings that are going to stay as well
going forward. So it's not going to stay at the same high level as what you've seen in Q3, but it's going to
be double digit underlying so going forward, for sure.

ECOLAB INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2020

Appreciate that, Christophe. And as a follow-up for either you or Doug. Just curious, now that you've built
out capacity significantly for human sanitizing, just curious kind of on the back end of supply chain, what
were the considerations you made so that if we get into a situation where the world has largely sit down --
shut down, hopefully, that doesn't happen again, but has this been done largely domestically, near shore?
Just curious of the thought process and the strategies you've taken in developing that supply chain.

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. Our historic supply chain strategy is to make in the currencies we sell-in, i.e., if you go to China, we
have multiple manufacturing facilities. They're really designed to meet China demand. And like 93% of our
China volume is produced in China. So that's been the historic strategy, and it's the strategy that governs
us going forward. It was really designed because we didn't want currency to become a strategic problem,
i.e., producing U.S. dollar gets strong and our competitiveness has weakened everywhere else. That was
the initial reason for it. It obviously has also proven to be a good strategy in a tariff world and a more
restricted supply world. So that strategy has been, let's say, cemented at this point in time is a good idea.

So where we are building, we're building a lot of the capacity in the U.S. and in Europe, which are 2 of the
largest markets where you'd expect, but we also made capacity moves in China, too.

Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Two quick questions. The cost reduction moves that you're now making, how will that affect operating
leverage once conditions recover? And secondly, a longer-term question, I guess, I remember most of
our discussions on the Healthcare side being around antimicrobials. Can you speak a little bit about your
[indiscernible] in antifungals?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Sorry right, Laurence, the last couple of words got garbled. What was the last question about health care
antimicrobial?

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Sorry, can you speak about your capabilities in antifungals as opposed to antimicrobials?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. Well, in Healthcare, I mean, if you want to go -- I mean spores are the biggest challenge, right, C. diff
and the others, and we have significant advantages in that category in Healthcare as well. And so that's
been an area that I would say we have some standout capabilities, too.

The health care capabilities are important, not just because of the Healthcare market opportunity, but
also because of, if you will, what we learn in Healthcare and how we can apply it in other businesses. So
Christophe talked about the positioning that we're using in Ecolab Science Certified, which is health care-
grade, hospital-grade disinfectants that resonates with consumers. Oh, by the way, they're right because
the breadth of the kill claims and the kill time are much more advanced in those types of products than
they are in consumer products. You can have a consumer product that literally takes 4 minutes to kill what
we're killing in 30 seconds. And the problem is not many people wait 4 minutes for anything anymore. So
this is an important part of what we're doing.

improve leverage, which I know you already know.

The next question from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Doug, you mentioned this reduction in on-premise dining. A lot of your restaurant customers are shifting
toward more takeout and deliveries. Some are coming up with these novel ideas like ghost kitchens or
creating meal kits to help make ends meet or survive in this challenging time. What kind of changes are
you making in your approach to help your customers navigate this trend toward less on-premise dining?
And how do we think about kind of the future of your business, what we used to think of as warewashing
being kind of the anchor or the cornerstone of your Institutional business? Is that going to be shifting
toward hard surface cleaners going forward?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I would say 2 things. I mean there are certainly new business categories in Institutional that we are
pushing and exploring that, frankly, we think will have staying power, no matter which way the industry
goes. With that said, I would say, we think post-COVID, the industry reverts back to principally on-premise
for 2 reasons: it's what diners want mostly; and two, the profit of takeout, given packaging and other, is
not great. If you're in the pizza business, it's hard not to make money on pizza because the ingredient
cost is so low and all you got is a cardboard box. But when you're getting into -- let me just say some of
these fancier meals and the packaging costs and the rest, I have a number of friends who are actually
in the restaurant business, it is not a perfect solution for them. They're trying to keep the doors open,
cash flow moving and everything else, but their preference greatly would be to be serving these meals on-
premise versus off.

We have supported ghost kitchens. They've been long-standing in a number of ways. Think about food
trucks and the rest. They are going to have a place going forward, and it's probably the way to run just
the delivery business. But there will be modifications in this industry as a consequence of COVID, but I
don't think it's a revolution.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

All right. And then in terms of the food retail side, you mentioned expanded cleaning protocols and
frequency. Can you give us a sense of how much that's increasing sales right now? Like is the typical
grocery store customer, for example, using 10% or 20% more of your product? Or is it double how much
they would typically be using?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Well, I think it's settling down where it's double-digit up in consumption. It's -- I will also say you've seen
slowly a number of retailers curtail some of the cleaning that they were doing early. It's still up versus
where they were pre-COVID, but where you had maybe 4 people wiping down every cart, you may have
1 or you have cart wipes and some other things, all of which go to consumption. We expected this. So
I think what you'll see, you'll see certain categories have benefit going forward. But right now in the
Institutional business, I mean, the #1 volume standout is the negative impact on warewashing, which, by
the way, is where we have a lot of our innovation and money, it will come back. But until it does, right,
you got a mix challenge in Institutional that doesn't get fixed until digits start getting washed.

Eric B Petrie
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Doug, it's Eric Petrie on for P.J. Can you talk a little bit more about your growth opportunity in these new
fast-kill cleaners? And how long does it take to reach peak sales in your view? And then as these viruses
mutate, can you talk about how effective the cleaner is over the long term and whether or not you'll
reformulate?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. I'll turn it to Christophe on this. They have quite a bit of staying power as you go through, and
there's different ways you kill organisms. And I would say, for instance, hand sanitizer to alcohol basically
destroys the cell. So it's hard to develop immunity to a spear, if you think about it that way. Some do
poison, and you can have immunity built over time to poisons, but not to everyone, and it's not a fast
issue, i.e., we're using quats that still have effectiveness that have been around for decades, right, in a
number of instances.

So it's not a short life in terms of our business careers. It's a short life in terms of human history. So I
don't know if you want to add in terms of, Christophe, how long it takes to get to peak sales, et cetera.

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

The only thing I would offer is that we're really watching every pathogens out there, so the ones that we
know well and how do they react. So against our products as well or how do our products are effective
against those, the new ones as well, COVID being one of those that we didn't know, obviously, in the past,
and we learn from each other. The latest disinfectant that we talked about today, which is extremely fast
skill time, was developed for the norovirus, for instance. So we really look at all pathogens out there to
try to understand the type of effectiveness, how is it still working, is there any reaction to it as well. And
generally, so we develop our innovation in order to stay ahead of that. So I believe that we are in a very
unique place, especially compared to any competitor out there.

Eric B Petrie
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Helpful. And then, all right, just maybe talk, Christophe, on peak sales related to that question. And then
for my follow-up to Doug, as end markets recover, some managements have been talking about building
out their M&A pipeline or returning to share repurchases. So Ecolab's net leverage has improved to below
2s. Can you discuss both uses of cash?

Christophe Beck
President, CEO & Director

Okay. So I'll take the first question, and I'll give the M&A part to Dan just in a second. To your point, on
the peak annual sales, we usually -- it takes 5 years, which is the best average that we have out there.
Some products are sometimes shorter term, but most of them are longer than 5 years. So that's why it's
the metric that we use.

On M&A, Dan?

Daniel J. Schmechel
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So I'll interpret it more as a cash priorities question. You also asked the question on share
repurchase. So let me just say this. We ended the quarter with a little north of $1 billion on the balance
sheet in cash, which is, by any historical standard, a very, very big number for us. So yes, that's the
premise for the question, right?

I will follow the thread of a lot of the Q&A today to just say that the world remains a very uncertain place.
And I'm comfortable with the amount of cash that we have on the balance sheet. Partly, this is a cash-is-
king environment, and there's a lot of who knows what's to be seen. We are getting increasing confidence,
as you've heard from the tone of the call today, too, about the shape of the world with many uncertainties
yet to be known. I presume that as we go forward, it will present both challenges, right maybe some
unforeseen, but also opportunities.

And so I guess, the shortest answer I can provide is that as our confidence continues to build, you'll see
us return to more traditional cash levels and cash priorities, including share repurchase and M&A activities,
okay? So.

Thank next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Revenues declined $250 million in the Institutional business, and Institutional operating profits were down
$200 million. Why is the decremental margin 80%? If the decremental margin were 50%, you would have
earned double. What is it about the business where the incremental returns are so high?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

You're talking about year-on-year on third quarter to third quarter?

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Exactly right.

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Yes. Well, I would say a couple of things. They won't be 80% over any long period of time as you go
through this. But you get into quarters, now you're getting to what happened in the last period. You get
into bonuses. Bonuses were -- are taken down and up in different quarters, in different years for different
reasons, and these can have impact as you go forward. There are other investments or bad debt and some
other things as you go through this period. But our decremental margins, either going down or going up
over a period of time, aren't going to be in the 80% range. The gross profit of that business is right in
the mid-60s, right, on a good day. So a lot of that's going to happen. We are starting to take decisions on
fixed costs and other things. And so what we will see is a recovery of those margins as we go forward.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Were raw materials down about 5% year-over-year in the quarter?

Douglas M. Baker
Executive Chairman

Raw materials in total were not a material impact. If anything, they were negative in Institutional. A lot of
that is stuff you're seeing around heightened demand in hand care and some other areas where you really
just have shortage of supply. And Industrial year-on-year, minorly favorable.

At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the floor back to Mr.
Monahan for closing remarks.
