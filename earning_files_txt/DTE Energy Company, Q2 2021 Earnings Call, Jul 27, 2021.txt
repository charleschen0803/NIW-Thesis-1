DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the DTE Energy Second Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker
today, Barbara Tuckfield. Please go ahead.

Barbara Tuckfield
Director - Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone to read
the safe harbor statement on Page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking
statements. Our presentation also includes references to operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings provided in the
appendix. With us this morning are Jerry Norcia, President and CEO; and Dave Ruud, Senior Vice President
and CFO. And now I'll turn it over to Jerry to start the call this morning.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Barb, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying
healthy and safe. This morning, I'll recap our performance for the second quarter then Dave will provide
a financial review of the quarter and wrap things up before we take your questions. Let's start on Slide
4. We are making great progress this year at DTE for our team, our customers and our communities
positioning us to deliver for our investors. This progress has produced a strong second quarter and
positions us well for continued growth. Our distinctive team of 10,000-plus employees continues to be
recognized for our engagement by Gallup with our ninth consecutive Great Workplace Award, continuing to
build on this strength with our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion to create an even better workplace
for all our employees where everyone feels valued, welcome and able to contribute their best energy. Our
company celebrated Juneteenth together last month with a series of virtual meetings, we pay tribute to
this important day with global community partners. A number of employees offered reflections on what
the day means to them personally. Overall, it was a great way to come together and honored a significant
holiday.

We understand that all people thrive and succeed when they feel included and welcome. We continue
to focus on service excellence for our customers and delivering clean, safe and reliable energy as we
continue our clean energy transformation. DTE Electric received approval from the MPSC to further expand
the voluntary renewable program by MIGreenPower, while also making it even more affordable, including
increased access for low-income customers. Additionally, we partnered with Ford Motor Company to install
new rooftop solar and battery storage technology at the Ford Research and Engineering Center. The array
includes an integrated battery storage system and will be used to power newly installed electric vehicle
chargers.

This can generate over 1,100 megawatt-hours of clean energy. We also continue to support the
communities where we live and serve. We were also recognized by Points of Light for the fourth
consecutive year as one of the Civic 50. This award highlights DTE as one of the top 50 community-
minded companies nationwide in corporate citizenship. We also launched a Tree Trim Academy to create
200 high-paying jobs in Detroit. DTE has a need for Tree Trimmers, and the community has a need for
good high-quality jobs. It will also help us continue to improve electric liability as trees account for over
70% of our customer outages.

On the investor front, we completed the spin of the midstream business. Now DTE Midstream is a stand-
alone company and DTE Energy is a predominantly pure-play utility with 90% of operating earnings
coming from our utilities. The transaction went very smoothly and was well received by all stakeholders.
We didn't miss a beat on a very strategic transaction and many said we made it look easy. Many thanks to
the DTE team and our advisers that made this effort a great success for our employees and our investors.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

We delivered a strong second quarter with earnings of $1.70 per share, and we are raising our 2021
operating earnings guidance and continue to pay a strong dividend.

Let's turn to Slide 5. DTE is continuing to deliver successful operating results. At DTE Electric, we made
another significant step toward our goal of reducing carbon emissions as we retired River Rouge Power
Plant in the second quarter. For over 60 years, the River Rouge Power Plant delivered safe, reliable and
affordable energy for communities throughout Southeast Michigan. River Rouge is one of the 3 coal-fired
power plants DTE is retiring by the end of 2022, which is an integral part of our company's clean energy
transformation.

We continue to look at ways to accelerate our coal fleet retirements and potentially file our updated
IRP before September of 2023. We continue to expand on our voluntary renewable program, which is
exceeding our high expectations. In the first quarter, we announced the commitment of new customers to
MIGreenPower, including the State of Michigan, Bedrock and Trinity Health.

During the second quarter, we signed up a number of new large customers, including Detroit Diesel, which
is now one of our largest voluntary renewable customers. The program continues to grow at an impressive
rate. So far, we've reached 950 megawatts of voluntary renewable commitments with large business
customers and approximately 35,000 residential customers. We have an additional 400 megawatts in the
very advanced stages of discussion for future customers. MIGreenPower is one of the largest voluntary
renewable programs in the nation and helps advance our work towards our net zero carbon emission
goal while helping our customers meet their decarbonization goals. We have made progress with our
expedited Tree Trimming program, which is greatly improving reliability for our customers and have
received Michigan Public Service Commission approval to securitize the Tree Trimming costs along with
costs associated with the River Rouge Power Plant retirement.

At DTE Gas, we are on track to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We began the second
phase of construction on our major transmission renewal project in Northern Michigan in June. The project
includes the installation of a new pipeline as well as facility modification work which will reduce the risk
of significant customer outages. Project is on track to be in service by the first quarter of next year. Last
quarter, we announced our new CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program. This program provides the
opportunity for customers to purchase both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas.

We enable them to reduce their carbon footprint. We are proud of how fast the program is growing.
Currently we have over 3,000 customers subscribed, and we are looking forward to seeing it become as
successful as our voluntary renewable program at DTE Electric.

On our Power and Industrial business, we continue to add new projects as we began construction on a
new RNG facility on a large dairy farm in South Dakota. This will be P&I's largest dairy R&D project to
date. Project will directly inject RNG into the Northern Natural Gas system for sale into the California
transportation fuels market. Facility is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2022. We are also
in advanced discussions on several new industrial energy and RNG projects. and we'll provide updates on
these as they progress.

P&I was also recognized by The Association of Union Contractors with the 2020 Project of the Year Award
for the Ford Dearborn cogeneration project. Overall, I am extremely proud of the team's accomplishments
year-to-date, and I'm looking forward to more successes in 2021 and beyond.

Now moving on to Slide 6. As I said, we've had a very strong start to 2021. We are raising our operating
earnings guidance midpoint from $5.51 per share to $5.77 per share, moving our year-over-year growth
and operating EPS guidance from 7.4% to a robust 12.5%. We are able to use some of this favorability
to position the company to continue to deliver in future years. We mentioned in Q1, we were deep into
planning for 2022 in a great level of detail. With all of this work, we feel great about achieving a smooth
5% to 7% growth trajectory into 2022 and through the 5-year plan. You are not going to see any surprises
from us in our growth rate in 2022 in spite of the [ area rollouts ] and the converts coming due. 90% of
our future operating earnings will be from our 2 regulated utilities, where we have a large investment
agenda with $17 billion of capital investment in our 5-year plan, focused on clean energy and customer
reliability. Overall, we feel very confident with our performance in 2021 and our future operational and

financial performance. Now I'll turn it over to Dave to discuss DTE's financial performance. Dave, over to
you.

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 7 to review our second quarter financial
results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $329 million. This translates into $1.70 per share.
You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported
earnings in the appendix. I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. The second quarter
was a really warm quarter for us here in Michigan. In fact, it was the seventh warmest on record.

DTE Electric earnings were $238 million for the quarter, which was $19 million higher than the second
quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher commercial sales, rate implementation and warmer weather offset
by nonqualified benefit plan gains that we had in 2020. As we mentioned in the first quarter call, we've
taken steps to reduce the variability of these investments going forward. Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating
earnings were $7 million, $4 million lower than the second quarter of last year. The earnings decrease
was driven primarily by the warmer weather in 2021, offset by new rates. Let's keep moving to the Gas
Storage and Pipelines business on the third row.

Operating earnings for GSP were $86 million. This was $16 million higher than the second quarter of 2020,
driven primarily by the LEAP pipeline going into service and strong earnings across the Pipeline segment.
On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial segment operating earnings were $34 million. This
is a $9 million increase from second quarter last year due to new RNG projects beginning operation.

On the next one, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $21 million,
which is $16 million higher than second quarter earnings last year due primarily to strong performance in
the Gas portfolio. Year-to-date through the second quarter, this positions us positive to our expectation
and our original guidance for the year. Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable $22 million quarter-
over-quarter, primarily due to the timing of taxes and higher interest expense. Overall, DTE earned $1.70
per share in the second quarter of 2021, which is $0.17 per share higher than 2020.

Moving on to Slide 8. Given the strong start to the year, we were able to use this favorability to position
ourselves to continue to deliver for our customers and investors in future years. And we are also
increasing our 2021 operating EPS guidance midpoint, $5.51 per share to $5.77 per share. The increase
in guidance is due primarily to warmer-than-normal weather, sustained continuous improvement and
uncollectible expense variability at DTE Electric, higher REF volumes at P&I and stronger performance
of energy trading due to the realization of gains from a small, long physical storage position during the
extreme cold weather event in Texas in the first quarter.

In the third quarter, we are seeing additional sales upside for Electric compared to our plan and higher-
than-planned REF volumes at P&I. We are continuing to explore opportunities to support future years
through our invest strategy and to support future customer affordability. As you can see on the slide, there
is no Gas Storage and Pipeline segment in our operating guidance for this year. The GSP segment will be
classified as discontinued operations starting in the third quarter.

Let's turn to Slide 9 to briefly discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan. We continue to focus
on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics. Due to our continued strong cash flows, DTE is targeting no
equity issuances in 2021 and has minimal equity needs in our plan beyond the convertible equity units
in 2022. We have a strong investment-grade rating and targeted an FFO-to-debt ratio of 16%. With the
proceeds from the spin-off of DTM, we are retiring long-term parent debt of approximately $2.6 billion
after debt breakage costs. These were NPV-positive transaction and immediately EPS accretive as we were
able to retire a higher interest rate debt to support our current plan and to deliver our 5% to 7% operating
EPS growth rate.

Now I'll wrap up on Slide 10, and we open the line for questions. We feel great about our second quarter
accomplishments, and we are confident in achieving our increased 2021 guidance and continuing to
deliver on our long-term 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate. Our utilities continue to focus on our

infrastructure investment agenda specifically investments in clean generation and investments to improve
reliability and the customer experience.
We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics and are targeting no equity issuances in
2021. In closing, after executing a successful spin of our midstream business, DTE continues to be well
positioned to deliver the premium, total shareholder returns that our investors have come to expect over
the past decade with strong utility growth and a growing dividend. With that, I thank you for joining us
today, and we can open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just on the IRP that Jerry, you kind of referenced in your prepared, your peer obviously has an
aggressive decarbonization plan out there, probably one of the more aggressive plans. Can we maybe just
get a sense on how you're thinking about your upcoming IRP and sort of not to frontrun the process, but
can you get out of all your coal prior to the 2030s?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're looking -- Shar, we're looking at how we can accelerate our coal retirements. We've started
with a larger position in our coal fleet and our self-generation fleet. So we are looking very closely at how
we can accelerate all of these retirements prior to 2040. So you'll recall that in our prior IRP, we were
retiring all of our coal by 2040. So we're looking at acceleration scenarios to pull that forward. And as
I've mentioned in past discussions, we will update you likely at the end of the year or early next year as
what those plans may look like. And we're spending a lot of time with various stakeholders through the
summer, including our Board, having those conversations, trying to balance the interest of acceleration
and of course, affordability and reliability.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And Jerry, can EEI be the right podium to disclose the updated plan?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

It will either there, Shar, or early in the new year. That's the range of timing that we're looking at right
now. We'll get a little tighter on that as we go forward.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, sort of between kind of already strong rate base growth at the
Electric and Gas, which obviously exceeds your earnings guidance growth rate, and you have the potential
to accelerate decarbonization with the updated IRP coming. And I guess how does all this kind of play into
your 5% to 7% growth rate? Obviously, I understand you've taken a conservative bend here. But could we
see some incremental upside here in time, especially if you decarbonize faster than what's in your current
internal planning assumptions?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're looking -- obviously, we're in the middle of all of that analysis. And as you've mentioned, Shar,
typically, we update our capital forecast at EEI for our 5-year outlook. And as we start to build in these
earlier retirements, there could be impact on the back end of that plan. As you recall, the back end of our
plan return more to the average in terms of rate base growth and earnings growth of the 2 utilities. So
we're likely, it will be impactful in the back end of that plan. So more to come on that, Shar, but we're
working through all those details now.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

The next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I know that GSP is now discontinued. So obviously not a focus going forward in the same way. But just
wanted to better understand, I guess, what was happening here. If I look at the results so far, it seems
like GSP had put up 56% of the high end of the guidance already. And so I was just wondering if you could
expand a bit more on what specifically GSP did to kind of exceed expectations in the first half? Or if there
was something baked into later in the year that was going to weigh down. Just trying to understand a bit
better what was happening there.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

We can comment on the first half, and I know the pipeline company will have their earnings call here later,
I think early next month. So I'm sure they'll comment on that. But what we can talk about is the first half
of the year, and we just saw favorability in all the platforms across the board, our southern platforms and
our northern platforms.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. I mean were those sustained? Or is there anything kind of onetime in nature that was a positive
benefit?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Again, it was a pickup in activity and value across all our platforms, both in the Appalachia platforms and
the Haynesville platform. I think in terms of forward looking, that will be more appropriate for DTM to
describe.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And maybe just kind of pivoting over to the electric utility, some really strong results there. And
just wondering if you could provide a bit more color with regard to low trend recoveries there. It seems
like commercial sales were coming better. But just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on
how things materialize versus your expectations versus your guidance for the segment and how you see
that kind of trending?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave, do you want to take that?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. First, if you look at quarter-over-quarter that we have in there, you could see that was way
up. And that was especially commercial and industrial, that was really because we were comparing back
to the worst period of the pandemic. So quarter-over-quarter, we saw commercial and industrial way
up. Interestingly, we saw residential stay pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. And that's interesting because
last year, with people working from home, we saw our residential load running at an average of about
8% higher than we would have expected pre pandemic. And this year, so far, we're seeing that continue,
even though there has been some return to work, but we still see that we're seeing this favorability at
residential, and that's what's driving some of the favorability. So we've expected it to reduce more, but at
this point, it's pretty sticky. So we're going to be watching this closely to see how it plays out and how it
can impact really customer affordability going forward if it's remained sticky.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it.

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I would say on commercial load, I mean, that's come pretty much all the way back from as to what
we would have expected. We -- at the kind of the height of the pandemic, we thought we'd see some
more bankruptcies and closures in commercial, and we really haven't seen that. So we've seen our
commercial load really come back to as expected. Industrial load was coming back and pretty much came
back, but that has some variability in it due to some of the instability really or the challenges at the auto
plants right now with the chip shortages, they're running a little more sporadically. But really, it's been a
great return to load and then the residential remains really sticky for us.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful there. If I could slip in 1 more on RNG. Just wondering if you could expand a
little bit on how large do you see this business kind of growing over time? It seems like there's more of a
focus there? And how do you see the growth rate of that business kind of comparing to the rest of PT?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, the nonutility business will make up no more than 10% of overall operating earnings for the
company. So the growth will be modest compared to the growth that we're seeing at our 2 utilities. We're
planning to put $17 billion to work over the next 5 years in our 2 utilities and somewhere between $1.5
billion and $2 billion to work in our nonutility businesses. So it will be modest levels of investment. We
don't need a lot of income growth from that business. So we're being really picky and discerning about
the type of projects that we invest in, in RNG, where we're seeing 3- to 4-year paybacks, simple cash
paybacks and unlevered IRRs after tax in the teens. So that's what we're going after. So not a lot of
pressure to grow there. And so we're being very discerning about our growth projects.

Operator

Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congratulations on the results. Absolutely. Quick question. I think you've alluded to it a couple of times,
and I think Jeremy might have been trying to get at this. But you've alluded to a smooth trajectory here
of 5% to 7% into '22. I just want to make sure that sort of on balance, net of all these items, the ballpark
where we should still be assuming, right? Just wanted to...

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

We're going to be -- typically, we target the midpoint of our growth rates, right? That's how we plan for
our business. That's how we build contingency plans, and that's what we're going to deliver next year.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Excellent. And then perhaps even more importantly here, as you think about layering in these incremental
items, be it the IRP at some point or frankly, some of the renewable opportunities that are more on the
voluntary side and/or some additional, as you say, perhaps late stage or advanced stage conversations on
the industrial and RNG side.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

What's that outlook, the time line here? Some of the IRP updates maybe beyond the 5-year? Or do you
think that some of that actually accrues the near term? I would presume the voluntary renewables and the
nonutility businesses would be more in that 5-year period?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The voluntary renewables update that we'll provide in the fall will certainly play into the 5-year plan.
I would say the IRP work that we're doing could come into the 5-year plan, the latter part of the 5-year
plan. But certainly, there'll be a good story beyond the 5-year plan as well.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And maybe to clarify your earlier comment about sort of showing a normalization in the rate base
growth trajectory when you commented to Shar. Is that beyond the 5 years that you were talking about?
Or is that even within the 5 years that you're kind of alluding to potentially seeing a more sustained
current level of rate base growth rather than that normalization trend?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, what we are seeing, Julien, is growth rates and our operating earnings for our 2 utilities higher than
our average that we've advertised, the 9% at the gas company; and the 7%, 8% at the electric company
in the first couple of years of our 5-year plan. And that's helping us deliver that smooth EPS growth
rate that we've described. And then it returns more to the average in the out years of the plan as we've
described.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Right. So despite the long-term nature of some of the IRP, on balance, we could see some of that really
accrue into the back half of this 5-year plan regardless.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

That's possible. Early -- too early to tell, but certainly possible.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Excellent. All right. And just again, to come back to Jeremy's, quick clarification there on the RNG side,
again, you're 10% you're sticking with it, right? So we should really be thinking about scaling it and sizing
it within that bucket, right?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

That's correct.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Thank you so much for the clarifications here. All the best.

Your next question is from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

My first question on the financing side of things. When you think about the 5-year growth plan and
beyond 2023, how should we think about potential equity needs in the back half of that plan? And what's
embedded in your guidance?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Right now, you've seen we've given the guidance through the 3 years, which only has really acquisitions
as those converts that come in '22. As we look out of the 5-year plan, our goal is going to be to continue
to minimize the acquisitions we need and that's that's how it fits within the plan that we're looking at right
now.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. So based on the base -- the current CapEx plan, you're looking at more moderate level of [ need
that's ] kind of like what you're seeing on the 2023 front?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Right.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just going back to RNG a little bit. I appreciate the earnings mix that's going to have in
the overall portfolio. When you talk about the strong returns that you're talking about, are you seeing
increased competition now with a lot of other players focused on that? And as you look out at potential
new projects, are you seeing those translating into a tougher returns on a comp basis?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

What we're seeing is with the level of investment that we have to make, which is a couple of RNG projects
a year, a couple of dairy farms a year is another way to think about it. Not really having trouble originating
Greenfield, where we've seen things get a little more frothy as when assets are up and right, people

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Well, on the trading in the quarter, which you said was Gas portfolio, is that -- was that really sale of
storage out of -- related to the winter storm event or was that favorability more in the first quarter, and
this was just continued good performance. Just curious what's driving that?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

This was just continued good performance of the trading group in the gas portfolio. But I can't say
what gave us the confidence to raise the guidance was the favorability we had from that small physical
storage position that gave us the gain during the first quarter during that cold weather in Texas. So our
expectation going forward in future years is that we'll be more in line with our original guidance when we
don't have those kind of unexpected onetime things.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then just back to the growth rate and the comments about smooth -- Jerry, just to be clear,
you're talking off of the original 2020 midpoint, right, which was, I think, 530. I just want to be sure that
-- and that's -- is that the number of which you're intending to show smooth 5% to 7% growth? Or -- and
we should think of sort of this Q '21 favorability, which kind of puts you above that range, that's -- but
you're still using that as the base. I just want to be clear about that.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

We're using the -- you're correct, we're using the original 2021 guidance that we provided as the basis for
our growth rate.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Is that '21 or 2020?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

2020.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

But it would be similarly smooth for '21 because we target midpoint for each of the years in terms of
original guidance as a starting point.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. So we should just be calibrating off of original guidance in both cases and not [indiscernible].

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Correct.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

You've answered the most. Maybe just update us on the recent -- what's the most latest on the gas rate
case front. And then the timing of the electric rate case, is that still sort of late this year?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

So on the electric rate case, yes, it's still late this year, no earlier than October of this year that we will
file. And on the gas case, we've engaged in conversations with interested parties to try and move the case
towards some form of settlement. But we're feeling pretty good about that in terms of how that case is
progressing, and it's a final outcome.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Excellent. And then just a real quick clarification. I know you sort of addressed the demand trends, pretty
strong quarter, Q2 '21 versus Q2 '20. Obviously, a ton of concerns around this Delta variant. Anything
sort of that is striking or sort of material for us to sort of talk about anything that you're seeing in your
territory, any cause of concern as it relates to Delta variant?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

We are not, at this point, certainly, the large manufacturing [ outfits ] are starting to take actions to make
sure that the Delta variant doesn't impact our operations, things like masking and social distancing are
starting to be reintroduced somewhat in preparation for a potential Delta variant surge here in Michigan.
But we're not seeing anything that puts any of our margin at risk at this point in time.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Excellent. Great quarter.

Your next question is from Andrew Weisel with ScotiaBank.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

A lot of my questions were answered. Appreciating the conservatism, given that you're growing 12.5%
this year and you grew 9% -- or you [ beat it up ] by 9% in 2020, but we'll stick with 5% to 7% for now.
Just 2 clarifying ones on 2021 outlook. First of all, does the updated guidance reflect July weather?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Dave?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, we do take into account weather into account, but there hasn't been too much weather in July, yes.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Then on cash flow, I see you updated the outlook from cash from operations to reflect the
Midstream spinoff. What about the underlying DTE business? It looks like cash has been stronger than

expected since you're pointing to no equity needs this year. Of that $300 million reduction, can you talk
about how much was Midstream if there was any change to the base business?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. In the guidance update that was all taken out the second half of Midstream. And you're right, we have
seen some strength too, and we're coming in a little bit above our plan in cash so far this year, mainly due
to strength in operating cash flows from Electric and from some of the other businesses, too.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. But that strength is not reflected in the updated guidance, right? So there might be some upside?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

There -- yes, there might be some upside. The guidance was really just taking out the Midstream part.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Can you update us on longer-term O&M outlook and now that we're emerging from a COVID environment,
if you're seeing any more structural changes to your cost profile?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

We constantly work to maintain our O&M as flat as possible. And I think you'll see from our history
that we're one of the better performing utilities in terms of being able to keep our O&M costs relatively
flat. I think over the last several years, we've been about 1% CAGR on O&M. We do have significant
opportunities to continue to do that looking forward. and that certainly is built into our growth plans as
well as our affordability, go get for our 2 utilities.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Are you seeing any inflationary pressure for labor or any other component of your cost structure?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

We've been looking at that pretty hard as we started to build our plans for '22 and beyond. And we've got
long-term contracts for some of our key commodities on the material side. So we're not seeing pressure
there. And with our contractors, I don't do a good portion of our work. Those are obviously negotiated
prices. And again, not seeing anything that would give us great concern at this point in time.

Ryan Michael Levine
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. And then on Energy Trading, you had highlighted the increase in guidance range that largely was
reflecting the year-over-year increase for the second quarter. Is there embedded conservatism for the
second half outlook in light of some of the volatility in the gas prices and higher prices? Or is there any
color you can share on what's driving the relatively no change to the second half outlook.

DTE ENERGY COMPANY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Yes, there is conservatism in that. As you can see, we put our guidance from 25 to 35, and we're pretty
much within that range or at the top end of that range already. So we do have some conservatism in that
number. And we'll just have to watch how it plays out throughout the year.

Our next question is from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Can you guys hear me?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

One real quick question. And I know it's early in the IRP is sort of the [ trend ] of next year. But as you're
approaching the acceleration potentially of more coal, how are you thinking about, I guess, the regulatory
recovery mechanisms for accelerating that coal retirement? Are you thinking more regulatory asset model
or securitization potentially?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

And what we're looking at are various techniques that we have our disposal, one is accelerated
depreciation. We're also looking at ways to make the asset lives longer in terms of the remaining
usefulness in all kinds of physical options for that, that we're considering. And we're also looking at some
tax strategies that could help smooth affordability as well. So multiple ways that we're looking at making
the financing of the retirement of coal earlier, more affordable to our customers. And also making sure
that our investors get their value out of these assets.

We have a follow-up from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just 1 quick one. On the convert -- post the spin, I believe the numbers may change in terms of the
shares that will convert into and what have you. Will that be disclosed in the Q? Or can you give us some
guidance here as to what the implications of the spin were for that conversion?

David Ruud
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, there is -- there will be an adjustment to the settlement rates to ensure consistency of the
economics. So it will change the convert price kind of in proportion with equity price so that equity holders
remain [ hold in ]. And Barb can send those mechanics to your -- you can contact Barb and get the actual
mechanics of that, if you want, after the call.

Jonathan Philip Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

But those are now set, David, it's really my question. Or are they still pending on trading levels?

affect that.

On your final question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Hopefully, 2 easy ones. I guess the first one, Jerry, earlier in the call, you were highlighting how the
transaction team worked. You got the spin of DTE Midstream seems very seamless. I mean you seem like
your transaction team is in mid-season form right now. Any thought to keeping them in shape with other
transactions?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Well, right now, we're, Anthony, we're really focused on our $17 billion growth agenda to utilities, which
is the lion's share of our CapEx and of course, having modest growth for our nonutility business, P&I, and
RNG and cogen primarily. So that's really our play right now for the next 5 years.

Anthony Christopher Crowdell
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just lastly, post spin, and I just don't know the process. Do you know if your ESG score
is under like a valuation now that the company has removed the ESP business. And looking at your new,
I guess, environmental footprint, DTE classic. I mean how often does that review happen? Or any insight
you give on the potential for a change in your ESG score?

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

So I would venture to say that our ESG metrics will improve, with the spin of DTM. But Barb, maybe I'll
get Barb to provide some insights to you, Anthony, as to when that might happen, when might we get the
next score.

Barbara Tuckfield
Director - Investor Relations

Sorry about that. Yes, those happen annually, typically. And right now, we're sitting above average on
quite a few of those metrics.

Operator

I will now turn the call back over to Jerry Norcia for closing remarks.

Gerardo Norcia
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll just close by saying that DTE had a very successful first half
of the year, and we're feeling really good about the remainder of 2021 and also how well we're setting up
for 2022. So I hope everyone has a great morning, and stay healthy and safe.
