Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the FactSet Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2021
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be
recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker host today, Rima Hyder. Please go ahead.

Rima Hyder
Head of Investor & Media Relations

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.
We continue to be in various remote locations today. We may have some audio quality issues, and we
appreciate your patience should we experience a disruption.

Before we begin, I would like to point out that the slides we will reference during this presentation can be
accessed via the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com. The slides will be
posted on our website at the conclusion of this call. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and
on our website. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. [Operator
Instructions]

Before we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains
the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, please
refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from these forward-looking statements. Our slide presentation and discussions on this call
will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliation to the most directly
comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued
earlier today.

Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Helen Shan, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Revenue Officer. And now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Thank you, Rima, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that we
delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results.

We ended the year with record organic ASV plus professional services growth of $68 million for the
quarter, crossing the $100 million annual ASV threshold for the first time and soundly beating the top end
of our guidance. Our year-on-year organic ASV growth rate accelerated 200 basis points to over 7%, and
we delivered annual revenue of $1.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $11.20.

Our outperformance was driven by 2 years of planned accelerated investments in content and technology,
which is paying dividends. FactSet's goal to be the leading open content and analytics platform is
resonating in the marketplace and increasing our wallet share with clients. Our targeted investment in new
content sets was a significant ASV driver in fiscal '21 and fueled our workstation growth. The continued
development of our deep sector coverage improved sell-side retention and expansion with our largest
banking clients and helped secure our new business.

Content and technology were both key to our expansion with wealth management firms, where we landed
important wins, including with the Royal Bank of Canada and Raymond James Canada. These wins were
due to our market-leading data and the launch of FactSet's Advisor Dashboard. We are also expanding our
addressable market by increasing our content and delivery capabilities across the front, middle and back
office.

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

We added meaningful ASV from our cloud and API solutions this year, including delivering more data
through the cloud and cloud-based platforms; entity mapping and linking client data through our data
management services or DMS; and unlocking opportunity in new workflows by unbundling our components
to plug and play into other third-party systems such as CRMs.

Cloud delivery, coupled with the strength of our DMS and Concordance as a service solutions, enable
our clients to centralize, integrate and analyze disparate data sources for faster and more cost-effective
decision-making. This has been a major driver for our CTS business.

As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we remain focused on three things: scaling up our content refinery
to provide the most comprehensive and connected set of industry, proprietary and third-party data for
the financial market; two, enhancing the client experience by delivering hyper-personalized solutions,
so clients can discover meaningful insights faster; and third, driving next-generation workflow-specific
solutions for asset managers, asset owners, sell-side, wealth management and corporate clients.

We added new data and capabilities to further these goals by acquiring differentiated assets over the
past year. The addition of Truvalue Labs has grown our ESG offering; BTU Analytics advanced our deep
sector content for the energy markets; and Cabot technologies will better support the portfolio analytics
workflows of asset managers and asset owners. The progress we have made on our investment plan,
along with these acquisitions and our award-winning products, give us a distinct competitive advantage.

Turning now to our financial results. We accelerated our organic ASV plus professional services growth
to 7.2%. Our strong performance was driven by stellar execution from our sales and client-facing teams
throughout the entire year and especially in the fourth quarter. Our buy-side and sell-side growth rates
increased 100 and 400 basis points, respectively, since the third quarter, reflecting higher sales across our
key clients.

On a year-over-year basis, we saw an increase in ASV growth rates from high single digit to double digits
across banks, asset owners, hedge funds, data providers, wealth managers and corporates, including
private equity and venture capital funds. We capitalized on the strength of our end markets, particularly in
banking, and landed several large deals in our wealth and CTS businesses.

Turning now to our geographic segments. We saw acceleration in every region. ASV growth in the
Americas rose to 7% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by increased sales to our banking, corporate
and wealth clients. We also had a large data partner win this quarter in CTS. Asia Pac had a record ASV
quarter and delivered a growth rate of 12%. We saw wins across many countries with global and regional
banks as well as our research management products. CTS and analytics also contributed to growth
with wins across asset managers and data providers. EMEA accelerated to a 6% growth rate, driven by
strong performance with data providers, asset managers and banking clients. And CTS had the highest
contribution to this region, followed by research.

Now turning to our businesses. Research was the largest contributor to our ASV growth this year with
a growth rate of 6%, driven by very strong growth on the sell side at 12%. We increased research
workstation users by 86% this quarter versus a year ago with growth across both sell-side and buy-side
clients. Increasing our workstation presence and footprint with our largest clients positions us very well for
cross-selling opportunities in the future.

Analytics and trading accelerated in the second half in fiscal 2021 versus the first half, ending the year at a
6% growth rate. We saw wins across performance and reporting, front office and core analytics solutions.
Within front office solutions, we are really pleased to see larger wins with our trading platform and believe
this will be a contributor to analytics going into next year.

CTS grew 16%, driven by core company data and data management solutions sold through an increasing
number of channels. CTS had robust sales to data providers this year and expanded their footprint across
multiple workflows within middle and back office functions at asset management and banking clients.
Additionally, while all Truvalue Labs' ESG sales are excluded from our organic numbers, I'm pleased to
report that ESG data sales were a contributor to CTS's overall growth this quarter.

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

Wealth ended the year with a 6% growth rate. Wealth workstations grew 24% year-over-year, and they,
alongside FactSet's Advisor Dashboard, have been the biggest contributors to winning new clients. We've
seen a combination of large- and medium-sized wins as existing clients continue to expand their advisory
businesses, and we are equally pleased with our new business wins. We are also seeing cross-selling
opportunities with analytics products as wealth managers increasingly look to advance the sophistication
of their offerings.

Moving forward with fiscal '22, we will report three workflow solutions. We are combining the desktop
portion of the wealth business with research into one business to be known as research and advisory.
We believe this is the right strategy to further our goals to holistically manage our desktop solutions,
accelerate the build-out of differentiated front office solutions and facilitate the global expansion and
adoption of StreetAccount news and FactSet web. We have also taken the wealth digital business and
combined it with CTS to better align our digital solutions.

In summary, we are entering fiscal '22 with strong momentum and a solid pipeline as reflected in our
annual ASV guidance. The need for more differentiated content and analytics is at an unprecedented high.
And we are perfectly positioned to capture this demand and poised to deliver best-in-class workflows and
a hyper-personalized experience for our clients. I'm proud of our company's strong performance in fiscal
'21. We have advanced our digital platform, executed at a high level and strengthened our relationship
with clients.

I'll now turn it over to Helen, who for the last time as CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter and full year
performance in more detail and take you through our fiscal 2022 guidance. I want to thank Helen for
leading our global finance organization in the past 3 years. And I'm confident that as our Chief Revenue
Officer, she will bring a disciplined, growth-oriented mindset in the same rigor to the sales organization as
she did leading finance, enabling us to continue our success going forward.

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

Thank you, Phil, and hello, everyone. I'm happy to be here with you today, and I hope that we will
continue to engage even after I fully transition to my sales role.

Like Phil, I want to congratulate FactSetters around the world for achieving outstanding results in fiscal
2021. While we have continued primarily to operate remotely, I am so impressed with the resilience
with which our FactSet teams are able to serve our global clients. Our 7% top line growth this year is a
testament to the hard work of our teams and validates our strategy to invest in content and technology,
capitalize on market trends and address client needs.

Throughout this fiscal year, we accelerated our growth rate in ASV plus professional services through
consistent conversion of our pipeline, delivering over $100 million in ASV growth and surpassing our most
recent guidance for the year. Full year revenue also exceeded our target as we realized more revenue from
ASV booked early in the fourth quarter.

We generated solid earnings through disciplined expense management and operating leverage. Driving
sustainable long-term growth requires continued investment back into the business as reflected by our
increased spend on differentiated content and cloud-enabled technology. We executed our plan well. And
our operating results are in line with expectations due to higher revenue and productivity gains with higher
adjusted operating income and growth in adjusted EPS.

Let me now walk you through the specifics of our fourth quarter. Before I explain the quarterly results,
I want to remind everyone that our prior year fourth quarter GAAP results were impacted by a one-time
noncash charge of approximately $17 million related to an impairment of an investment in a third party.
Thus, any year-over-year comparison of GAAP operating results for the fourth quarter of 2021 should take
that into consideration.

As you saw on the previous slide, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate was 7.2%.
This increase reflects the higher demand for our solutions as clients execute on their own digital

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

transformation. Our success in solving their workflow challenges has resulted in higher levels of both client
retention and cross-selling activity.

For the quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 7% to $412 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any
impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization, also increased 7% to $410
million. Growth was driven by our analytics, CTS and research solutions. For our geographic segments,
organic revenue for the Americas grew to 6%; EMEA grew to 7%; and Asia Pacific to 12%. All regions
primarily benefited from increases in our analytics and CTS solutions.

GAAP operating expenses grew 3% in the fourth quarter to $293 million, impacted by a higher cost of
services. Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin increased by 320 basis points to
28.9% and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 150 basis points to 31.6%.

As a percentage of revenue, our cost of services was 10 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis
and flat to last year on an adjusted basis. The increase is primarily driven by growth in compensation
comprised of: higher salary expenses for existing employees; new hires to support a multiyear investment
plan; and higher bonus accrual in line with stronger-than-anticipated ASV performance.

SG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of revenue, improved year-over-year by 330 basis
points on a GAAP basis but increased 170 basis points on an adjusted basis. The primary drivers include
higher compensation costs, reflecting the same factors as noted in the cost of services.

Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 15% higher than the prior year's tax rate of 7%, primarily
due to lower tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation in the current quarter as well as a tax
benefit related to finalizing the prior year's tax returns.

GAAP EPS increased 15% to $2.63 this quarter versus $2.29 in the prior year. Again, this improvement is
primarily a result of the impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted diluted
EPS remained flat year-over-year at $2.88. Adjusted EPS was driven by higher revenues, offset by higher
operating expenses and an increase in the tax rate. A reconciliation of our adjustments to GAAP EPS is
included at the end of our press release.

Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $171 million
for the quarter, an increase of 18% over the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher
net income, improved collections and the timing of certain tax payments. For the fourth quarter, our ASV
retention remained above 95% and our client retention improved to 91%, which again speaks to the
demand for our solutions and excellent execution by our sales teams.

Compared to the prior year, we grew our total number of clients by 10% to over 6,400, largely due to the
addition of more wealth and corporate clients. And our user count grew 14% year-over-year and crossed
the total of 160,000 primarily driven by sales in our wealth and research solutions, and in particular, in the
number of banking users.

For the quarter, we repurchased over 265,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $93 million
with an average share price of $348. For the year, we repurchased 265 million of our shares and increased
our dividend for the 22nd consecutive year. With share repurchases and dividends, on an annual basis, we
have returned to shareholders almost 70% as a percentage of free cash flow and proceeds from employee
stock options. We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value
to our shareholders.

Turning now to our outlook for fiscal year 2022. We delivered outstanding results in the back half of
2021 and believe this pace will carry into our next fiscal year. For organic ASV plus professional services,
we are guiding to an incremental $105 million to $135 million. The midpoint of this range represents a
7% increase, which is equal to this year's organic growth rate, reflecting continued momentum in our
business.

We are confident in our ability to perform at the high standard we demonstrated in fiscal '21 with
underlying drivers to include disciplined execution and continued benefits from our investments. We

expect growth to be driven largely with existing clients through high retention and cross-selling. In
addition, we expect our ability to successfully sell new business in this virtual environment to continue.

Our recent investments in digital and content are providing us with more opportunities to sell direct
solutions tailored for specific workflows. Drivers of future growth would include: first, the retention
and expansion of our sell-side client base through our deep sector strategy as we launch new targeted
industries in addition to new private markets offerings; second, new wins with wealth managers, who
have been responding well to our web-based workstation and personalized Advisor Dashboard; and third,
growth with institutional asset management clients, who benefit from our data management solutions and
enhanced capabilities in front office and ESG workflows.

We are mindful about the global environment and potential future market disruptions. But we believe
we have the right offerings and strategy to maintain our high performance and growth rate into fiscal
2022. From an operational perspective, we plan for continued labor productivity and operating leverage.
In addition to our multiyear investment plan, new investments will be made in content and front office
solutions, funded in part by ongoing cost discipline, including permanent savings related to the pandemic
and additional efficiency actions.

As a result of higher growth in revenues and continued cost discipline, we are guiding to an expansion
in our operating margins. Combined with our consistent use of capital for share repurchases, we expect
to accelerate growth in our diluted EPS, both on a GAAP and adjusted basis. We are seeing the results of
our investments take hold in both technology and content. As we look to fiscal 2022, we are focused on
delivering more value to clients, prioritizing our resources and ensuring execution excellence.

As I transition to my new role, I am seeing firsthand the experience and skills of our sales team in
adapting to meet the needs of the market. Our client-centric mentality, combined with our expanding
data universe and digital advances, provide me with the confidence that we have the people, strategy and
products to build a leading open content and analytics platform in our industry, all while generating long-
term value for our shareholders.
With that, we are now ready for your questions, and I'll turn it over to the operator.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question, coming from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital
Markets.

Ashish Sabadra
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats on such a solid quarter and an impressive guidance. My question, more on the research side, and
this is the first year where we've seen such a massive acceleration to 6%, as you mentioned, your deep
content as well as technology transformation bearing fruit. I was wondering if you could provide more
color. It looks like it's been driven by new wins, client retention. But if you can just talk about how do we
think about this research and advisory growth going forward, is that kind of growth sustainable given your
deep sector strategy?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Ashish, thank you for the question. Yes, we're very pleased with how our research business performed
this year. Clearly, we had very good performance on the sell side and the investment that we made in new
content really helped drive new logos, expansion at existing clients and helped with retention. So that was
a big driver on the sell side. However, the research business grew at a healthy clip in lots of different firm
types. So we did very well on a relative basis to last year within institutional asset management. We did
well with corporates, hedge funds, a number of different firm types.

So it was pretty broad-based. You can see that we grew our workstations by, I think, 14% over the last
year. So just getting that footprint is really important for us moving forward to cross-sell. And we closed
lots of new logos. So my hats off to the research team. They've done an amazing job and just really a
monster quarter from the sales team in terms of going out and executing on all the opportunities we had
in front of us.

Ashish Sabadra
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's very helpful color. And maybe just a question on margins. Again, great to see margin expansion
despite the investments. And my question was more over the midterm as you retire your data center.
First, the question is are you still on track to retire the data centers by end of fiscal '22? And how should
we think about the cost savings as you get rid of some of the redundant cost and get back to a more
normalized investment cycle?

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

It's Helen. Thanks for that question. Yes, as it relates to the status of our investment plan, we remain on
track. We're obviously being able to, as we've talked about in the past, to be doing our transformation and
transition to the cloud, and that remains on track as well. And so we do expect to complete most of what
we expected to get out of the data centers by year-end. But obviously, we'll see how the year progresses,
but there's nothing right now that changes our view.

Ashish Sabadra
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's helpful. And congrats on the solid quarter.

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

Yes. Thank you.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Crédit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And let me add my congratulations as well. For '22, the guide, can you unpack maybe a little bit,
Helen, how are you thinking about new logos versus additional client offerings and then just any thoughts
as to the client retention? Because again, you're seeing a lot of success across multiple vectors, so just try
to get a sense of the buildup a little bit.

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

Yes, happy to do that. Thanks for your question. So we've been very pleased with the way we've been
able to execute. Honestly, as we think about from a year ago to now, I think what has been extremely
beneficial to us is our ability to grow with existing clients. So in the past, we've talked about 2/3 of the
growth comes from existing, 1/3 from new. If we take a look at how the year actually progressed, we
actually saw with existing clients the ability between retention and expansion to be nearly 3/4 of it.

That doesn't mean that new business didn't grow. In fact, it grew at the same pace as in the past, Kevin.
But what we saw was our ability from many of our investments to really resonate with our existing
and even our largest clients. So we do look at new business going forward continuing to do well. As I
think about the course of the year, we actually had more in terms of volume. The average transaction
price might be a bit lower, but we made that up from volume. And I think that just reflects the virtual
environment and the situation that we're in. But it continues to be a key part of our overall growth.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's great. And then just real quick, it looks like in September, Snowflake announced a new solution in
the financial services data cloud. That probably brings more leverage in terms of what you're doing with
them. But any updates as to how that impacts kind of the existing partnership you announced back in
January, if at all?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

I think it's just consistent, Kevin, with what we've been doing with them. And we're working with lots
of different cloud providers to make sure that we provide FactSet's data and analytics in the places that
our clients want to consume it. So super happy with the Snowflake relationship, adding on services like
Concordance will help us. And we do think that new channels like this are going to be important as we
move forward.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. Congrats again.

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Thank you.

And our next question, coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So I just had a question on the analytics business team, I guess, stuck to the 6%, 7% growth for the last
couple of years. Is that the right growth rate for this business? Or is there any initiatives in there that
could probably get that higher?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Manav, thanks for the question. We certainly think analytics can do better. We did get off to a bit of a
choppy start with analytics in the last fiscal year. And we attributed that to, I think, sort of everyone
getting their feet under them as we've learned how to work through the pandemic. Analytics had a much
stronger second half, very good performance with our front office solutions, which include our portfolio
management platform as well as our trading solutions. And analytics is setting up much better for next
year. So we see a good pipeline for the first half and good pipeline within the buy side, which, as you
know, is where most of our analytics solutions are pointed.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just on the research business, can you just talk about or help break out how much of that
growth came from just new hiring on the sell side versus the rest of the buy side? And then I think you
talked about winning some trading business, so if you can just elaborate a bit on the trading side of your
offering.

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Sure. So we think that we outperformed significantly for three reasons: one is the investment in content
and technology, which we outlined; the excellent performance of our front office team; and then we'd
say about 1/3 of it probably was us really just capitalizing on the strong trends in banking. So I probably
attribute about 1/3 of it to the trends that are out there. And it's the work that we put in though that
allowed us to capitalize on those trends. The trading business is really the Portware business that we
acquired a few years ago. We had a very strong year. We closed some new logos. And we increased
our transaction revenue. I think a lot of that might have come from FX. So we've got very strong FX
capabilities within our EMS.

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

Yes, Manav, keep in mind that the retention piece that Phil alluded to is really quite key. It is a part of why
research did so well this year.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.

Toni Michele Kaplan
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Wanted to focus on wealth. The ASV was up 6% organically year-over-year. It's a little bit lighter than
we've seen in the last few years. You did mention that the workstations in wealth was up in the mid-20%
range. So just hoping you could give some color on what sort of dragged the rest of wealth down.

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Yes. Good question, Toni. So you're absolutely right. The desktop business grew significantly at 24% and
the ASV ex the digital solutions part of wealth grew at about 10%. So we had one large deal that got
canceled in February, which was a legacy digital solution from the acquisition we did many years ago, not
the type of solution that we're sort of upgrading our clients to these days. So that was something that was

11

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

out there. It was with a large firm that was under financial stress and something that was a headwind for
us in Q2.

You might have -- I think I may have mentioned it in that quarter. We also had one other loss on the
digital side, which was not related to wealth but another anticipated cancel. So in total, we might have
had about $6 million in cancel from the old legacy digital business. So I would factor that in when you're
thinking about our wealth business. But the new solutions we're focused on and how we're going to
market now, that was exceedingly healthy and I think bodes well as we go into next fiscal year.

Toni Michele Kaplan
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And just regarding removing the wealth disclosure in the future, I guess, why are you doing that?
And how much is related to research versus CTS? And if you could sort of give the growth rates of the
pieces so that we know how much to impact each of those segments by, that would be helpful.

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Yes. So it's just -- we've realigned our business. So the wealth business, which was run by Goran Skoko,
has now become research and advisory, which he'll be leading once Kristy moved into the Chief Product
Officer role about a quarter ago. So really, there were two pieces to wealth. There was the web or
workstation business, which lines up nicely with our research business line. And then there's the digital
part of wealth, which lines up very nicely with CTS.

So there are really good synergies on the product and workflow side that we can capture by organizing
things this way. And the digital piece of wealth, some new really good capabilities have been built there
called FactSet Widgets, which is in line with our open strategy. So I believe after the call, you'll get all of
the numbers that show you what the growth rates would have been this year for those 3 business lines,
which I'm sure Rima will be happy to review with you later today.

And our next question, coming from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. My first question, just around on sales. Just could you
comment on how much capacity and room for improvement there may be in sales execution today, and
maybe you can also touch on what your hiring plans are over the next year?

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

This is Helen. Thanks for that question. When I think about the continued pace for sales in terms of what
we have the opportunity to do, I think from an execution perspective, the results speak for itself for this
year. And where we're looking to accelerate our efforts will be along the lines of some of our solutions that
right now, we're seeing a lot of client demand for on ESG, on wealth analytics. And what we're seeing, as
I mentioned earlier, about our ability to expand with our -- within the wallet share of our existing clients, I
would expect to see that continue as well.

And so what we've done is we're going to be planning on essentially focusing on premier-type clients,
our highest clients, and including some that we think we can really continue to do that expansion on
the enterprise front. So from an execution perspective, those are the areas that I think we'll continue to
expand on. But it really is building on the momentum that we already have seen this year.

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

And then for my follow-up, I mean, we've seen a lot of large M&A in the financial services space in
general. Maybe you can just talk about what your willingness is to participate in any of the larger M&A.
And specifically, are there any synergies with assets that are currently not in your portfolio today? And
then is there -- are there any significant scale advantages today that you might be lacking?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Well, I think our answer has been consistent regarding M&A. So we're -- we feel that we have the scale
we need. We're one very well-integrated platform. And we're very good at doing tuck-in acquisitions for
unique content and technology, which we demonstrated this year. So we're really happy with our platform
and our ability to be a central player in the ecosystem and be really agnostic to the data that's on our
platform, whether it's ours or us integrating third-party content. We do have a very healthy balance
sheet. And we've said historically that if the right transaction comes around that's larger, we're in a
position to execute on it. But we don't feel that it's something we need to do to be successful. And we've
demonstrated that this year.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk about the outperformance on ASV
in the fourth quarter? I mean, obviously, you had some guidance out there that you gave us just a couple
of months ago. And then I would say you beat that by, I don't know, $25-or-so million. So just wondering
if there was anything chunky, maybe not repetitive, that you would call out that we may have missed
because that obviously creates a tougher comp for next year.

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Well, like some quarters, Alex, we do have some large wins. So we did have very -- one very good win
on the wealth side, and we had one very good win on the data partner side. But that doesn't mean we
can't have these types of wins in future quarters. So that certainly helped, getting those done. But again,
I think just excellent execution from the sales team really closing out the year in dramatic fashion and
capitalizing on those market trends that we spoke about earlier.

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. No, that's helpful, just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything super chunky, but it seems
like two larger things. And then just as a follow-up to a question earlier, I think you said that you think
the environment added about 1/3 of the growth, so I guess, a little bit over 2% or so. So I guess as we
look into 2022, what type of environment is kind of factored into your guidance from an overall industry
perspective? Because you can't ignore, as you said yourself, that has been -- that there's been a lot of
tailwinds in capital markets that had helped you. So just curious what you expect -- if you expect this to
persist or what kind of environment we should be thinking about?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

So just to be clear, I would say 1/3 of the outperformance versus our guidance was due to those trends,
not 1/3 of our overall performance as a company. And as I mentioned in an earlier question, the buy side
is setting up very nicely for us next year. We see a very healthy pipeline, good trends on the buy side.
So even though there are some tough conditions out there for asset managers, our investment in our
platform, our content opening it up really allow us to take market share and really help them with some of
their challenges, which is managing data better, which CTS does a great job of, and then really being plug
and play in terms of their workflow solutions. So we feel good about the buy side going into next year. Of

course, continued health on the sell side will help us. But we don't need that to be successful and to meet
our guidance.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.

Trevor Romeo
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

This is actually Trevor Romeo in for Andrew. I was just kind of hoping you could provide an update on the
selling environment and how sales cycles have evolved in terms of length and complexity. Have you seen
any changes in the speed of client decision-making lately?

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

Thank you for that question. I'll take that one. So I think one of the other points that helped drive our
outperformance was our analytics business, which accelerated, and some of the deals that perhaps had
taken a bit longer really coming to fruition. And we continue to see that as we think about -- look at the
pipeline going forward.

So I don't think I would say there's wholesale change yet in terms of the decision-making, that really is
case-by-case. But I will say that as we settle into much more so of the virtual environment, clients are
clearly focused on their own digital transformation and the need to improve. And as a result, some of
the things that we've had for a while that got pushed were realized, and we'll continue to see that going
forward.

Trevor Romeo
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the deep sector content investments that you've been making,
I was just wondering if there are any particular sectors or industries where you've kind of seen the
strongest uptake at this point and then going forward, which ones you might expect to see the most
investments.

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Yes. So we've -- I think the three that we have released are our financials, we've done some good work in
insurance, our real estate. So we're seeing really good usage across all of those. And we're beginning to
make progress on some of the other sectors. So I'd say it's pretty broad-based there.

Operator

Our next question, coming from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to follow up on the components of ASV growth in fiscal 2022. You've had several larger wins in
2021 and also some larger legacy cancels. So as you look ahead to fiscal 2022, what kind of ASV growth
do you expect across your realigned research, analytics and CTS businesses?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

I don't think we're giving explicit guidance there, George, on those three business lines. But I would say
it's well balanced between all of them. CTS, I would expect will continue to have a high growth rate, just
given the trends in the market and the opening-up of the platform. Analytics, as I've mentioned, is setting
up well versus last year and not a lot has changed in terms of the components of that business line. And
we're very optimistic about research, just based on what we've seen over the last year and our ability to

close new logos and meaningfully increase the number of users of FactSet across a lot of different firm
types.

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

And George, I would take a look across the geographies as well. I mean, if I look at the pipeline, quite
frankly, Americas, which has been very strong in 2021, we expect to have that have continued strength.
But we saw double-digit growth in Asia Pac and Europe ticking up as well. So I think it's clearly quite
broad-based. I think it's what gives us not only a lot of pride of what we've just done but also the
confidence as we go forward, which is reflected in our guidance.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it, very helpful. And then on pricing, what kind of pricing assumptions are you reflecting in your guide?
And how much do you expect pricing to go up by in the forthcoming year, particularly as you think about
how much competitors are raising their prices by? So are you -- do you think you're raising prices in line
with the competition ahead of or below the competition for next year?

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

Sure. I'll take that one as well. I mean, we're very -- we could see that our clients value our products by
what we were able to capture this year, and we'll continue that into next year. I think we'll be in line with
many of our competitors as well. So we would expect to see that similar impact, if not more. We've spent
a lot in enhancements in the value that we can clearly tie back to what we've done for them. So George, I
would expect to see it in line in -- not only in the market but in the previous year.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

In terms of your momentum with sell-side customers, to what extent would you ascribe that growth
to new customer wins and new product sales as opposed to your existing customers growing their
headcount?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Patrick, it's Phil. So just in terms of new logos, we did better this year on the sell side than we did last
year. I think we were actually down in terms of new logos on the sell side and we were up this year.
So we're certainly adding new clients. And some of that, as you can expect, is being driven by just the
investment that we've made, particularly in the content area.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then I guess, speaking of the headcount theme, FactSet's headcount growth has slowed. I
think it was 4% in the fourth quarter year-over-year, I think, close to 3% ex acquisitions. Was that an
intentional deceleration of your headcount growth? Or does it reflect challenges in terms of hiring and
retaining talent in this environment?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

I think we've done very well in terms of the employee value proposition at FactSet over the last year.
We've done a lot to really make sure that our employees feel like they're taken care of, that they have

15

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

flexibility in terms of how they work and so on. So I think we have a lot to be proud of there for our
employees. Like lots of firms, right, we're going to be faced with a lot of movement, I think, on the talent
side.

We believe that creates a good opportunity for us in the marketplace. We think we'll be able to retain the
talent we need at FactSet but also attract some really good new talent to the company. So I think we're
probably in line, frankly, in terms of what we planned in terms of headcount growth there. I don't know,
Helen, if you've got anything you wanted to add.

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. No. And I think what we've seen is in our own productivity and efficiency improvements as we've
gone through, I think we've talked before around workforce mix. If I take a look at where -- while our
headcount has gone up, the mix of that is also quite key. And then when we talk about the operating
leverage or our labor productivity, you've seen that come through as well. And please note that especially
since we've invested quite a lot in the technology front, that is meant to help us in terms of having the
type of work that our folks do. So I wouldn't necessarily look at people count as the driver here when you
think about our opportunities going forward.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.

Kwun Sum Lau
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Going back to the driver of CTS, could you please remind us some of the use cases of CTS? And as this
segment continues to evolve, do you see a scenario that customers will like mostly need API and data fits
but not so much on the desktop or they will still come hand-in-hand because desktop can still provide a
good distribution channel to customers?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Yes. Good question. Thank you. Yes, so traditionally, FactSet has sold a lot of data workflow solutions
through CTS to Quants. But that's not the only workflow that we've sold to. So we still do very well
selling to Quants, but we're also thinking about how do we expand our market share by getting into more
workflows across the middle and back office. And as we've opened up our platform and invested in new
content, it's created some great opportunity for us to help clients manage their own data with our entity
data map and our Concordance Services. Managing data is expensive and FactSet is really expert at that.
So that is one area that we're seeing really good growth from, particularly as we make those services
available through new channels such as cloud providers that we already spoke about.

We've done traditionally well with performance workflows as well. This was a very good year for us with
our Benchmark DataFeed. So FactSet does a lot of work to integrate all of the different benchmarks
and indexes that are out there that feed into a client's own performance system. So that could be our
own performance system, but we're not the only performance system out there. And so there's lots of
opportunities here. Real-time is another opportunity, sort of that trading workflow. So as we've developed
more of our own capabilities there, we view that as a good opportunity.

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

And Owen, just to add to that, when we talk about the sell side, Phil alluded this, too, before, the growth
there is also on the feed side. And so we're seeing, interestingly, that being a driver for our CTS business.
So I think that's an important piece to consider as well.

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

And just to finish off, your second point there is a valid one, we do think there's going to be a very healthy
balance out there for how people want to consume value. So it could be through a workstation or a web,
where we tee up the next best action for a particular user. But increasingly, firms are going to want to
consume data in new ways as they analyze things in new ways. And that could be just a research analyst
deciding they want a program in Python or use Tableau or some other types of systems to sort of do their
analysis. So that -- it could be the same type of user but through a different workflow or it could be just
feeding directly into a system that a client has, like a CRM.

Kwun Sum Lau
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's extremely helpful. And then going back to the research, I think we touched on a lot about
the growth there. But there are lots of news out there that many investment banks are raising the salary
of the junior bankers on the banking side. Do you see -- like in terms of the new -- is there any like
additional subscriptions from these clients? Do you think they also increase their hiring and FactSet can
benefit from that as well?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Yes. I think that's what we just saw in Q4 as we saw the banks, if I'm understanding your question
correctly, hire a lot of new talent. And when that happens, very often, FactSet will just get deployed
automatically onto those desks.

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

And I think also in addition to the number of analysts, to your point, Owen, what they're looking for is
to be able to provide their analysts the tools that are needed. And I think that's what we're finding, and
that's why I think our retention has grown -- has improved as well. What we're finding is getting the tools
of FactSet to the analysts to allow them to do their work in a more efficient way, so they're not spending
100-plus hours. I think all of that comes into play.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of David Chu with Bank of America.

Jitaek Chu
BofA Securities, Research Division

So you highlighted strong performance from the sales teams throughout the call. Helen, are there any key
changes to the strategy since you took on the new role?

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. Thanks for your question. One of the things, quite frankly, is how proud I am in the fact of how we
have executed. And I think the areas of focus, if anything, is more of an enhancement at this juncture.
I think what we will focus on is our go-to-market strategy. I think we will focus more on driving the
enterprise discussion with senior client executives. It really allows us to provide our platform for their own
digital transformations. And in terms of major changes, I would say no, other than really again enhancing
on the areas that we think we can leverage across the firm types or, quite frankly, operationally where we
can provide them more bandwidth to spend more time with clients.

Jitaek Chu
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And then just on the wealth side, are there any meaningful RFPs coming up, let's say, in the next
12 months? And how would you characterize your win rates now when you go into these RFPs?

Frederick Philip Snow

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

CEO & Director

Yes, we're not going to comment on that. But there is, I think, a steady drumbeat of these opportunities
coming through each year. And we do exceptionally well when we get into an RFP just based on the
product we have and the legendary FactSet service. Those are two things that really give us an advantage
when we're competing for those businesses.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Congrats on a great quarter. So just looking at the pipeline that you guys have talked about in the past of
being fantastic, I remember back to last quarter, how would you talk -- how would you characterize the
pipeline coming out of the fourth quarter compared to, I guess, the third and second quarter?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Well, the way that I would look at that, Keith, is just sort of versus the first half of last year. And we got
off to a pretty rough start last Q1. We were definitely digging out of a hole there and just came storming
back in the last 3 quarters. So as I mentioned already a few times, the first half, which is typically the
period that we have the most visibility on, is setting up quite nicely, particularly on the buy side with the
analytics team.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Great. If we talk about the growth that you guys are experiencing, would you talk about it as more market
share gain or more an expansion of your overall product set and the expansion of the overall market?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

It's a combination there. I think we do very well competitively. And our strategy, we believe, is
differentiating in terms of opening up the platform and investing in new content sets and being neutral
in terms of what data we provide the market. So that is resonating particularly well with our clients as
they try to differentiate themselves and become more efficient. And we get a lot of upside from expanding
clients. When we continue to build out our solution, our clients trust us and we've got great service. And
when trends are good like this in the market, we're able to really capitalize on that.

Operator

And our next question, coming from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.

Craig Anthony Huber
Huber Research Partners, LLC

My first question, as you remember 2 years ago, you guys put a 3-year investment plan and stuff with, I
guess, on the back end that you're expecting to be able to get to high single-digit ASV growth on the back
end of that. Is that still the plan here a year out? Or has it been pushed out some, as you've alluded to in
prior calls, because of this pandemic?

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Thanks, Craig. Yes. So we're entering the third year of that original 3-year plan. And I think you can see
our performance this year and what our guidance is for next year. So we're certainly -- high single digits is
certainly something that's achievable. I believe back then, we articulated that we would exit the year with
a 33% margin, which is, I think, I believe, the middle of our guidance here for this year.

FACTSET RESEARCH SYSTEMS INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 28, 2021

And our aspiration was to get to double-digit EPS growth. I think if you look at the midpoint of our
guidance, it's high single digits. But that doesn't mean if we execute well, we can't get to that thing. So
I couldn't be prouder of our company. We've all worked exceptionally hard over the last 2 years. And it's
really great to see this level of performance. And we're really optimistic as we go into FY '22.

Craig Anthony Huber
Huber Research Partners, LLC

And then my follow-up, please, on the cost side related to that 3-year investment program, I think
originally you thought you were going to spend $15 million each of the 3 years. It's changed. Maybe can
you just update us on those numbers, please? I think it was higher last year. Do you have that number?

Helen L. Shan
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Revenue Officer

Sure. I can talk broadly on those points, Craig. Yes, I mean, we -- as discussed earlier, we are on target
in terms of our plan. There are things that we probably accelerated in terms of spend, and in some cases,
where we've adjusted along the way. That's what you would expect in a 3-year plan. So from a technology
perspective, we probably spent a bit more. And we're able to make that up, as you can tell, from our
performance this year.

To go back a little bit to your point on us having pushed it out, I think what's really, I think, admirable is
the fact that with the situation that we had with the pandemic, we were trying to be as transparent as
possible. And the fact that we were able to achieve what we have and what we're indicating for the third
year really does mean that we're -- that we were able to meet what we had originally given guidance on.

Operator

I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Mr.
Phil Snow for closing remarks.

Frederick Philip Snow
CEO & Director

Thank you all for joining us today. In closing, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with our performance
this fiscal year. We also made substantial progress on our internal ESG strategy. Steps we have taken
this past quarter alone include joining the UN Global Compact and Principles of Responsible Investment,
publishing our global diversity figures and committing to becoming MLT Black Equity at Work-certified,
in addition to completing our sustainability plan, which outlines our ESG goals and aspirations. I'm very
proud of all FactSet has accomplished this year, and we look forward to speaking with you again next
quarter. In the meantime, please call Rima Hyder with additional questions. Operator, this ends today's
call.
