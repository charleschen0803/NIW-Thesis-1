CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Church & Dwight First Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call.

Before we begin, I have been asked to remind you that on this call, the company's management may
make forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's financial objectives and
forecasts. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that are described in
detail in the company's SEC filings.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Matt Farrell, Chief Executive Officer of Church
& Dwight. Please go ahead, sir.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1
results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for
questions.

Before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued
dedication to keeping our company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and R&D
teams, as we overcame raw material shortages in Q1 as a result of the Texas freeze.

Now let's talk about the results. Q1 was another exceptional quarter. Reported sales growth was 6.3%,
and adjusted EPS was $0.83, and that's $0.03 better than our outlook. Organic sales grew 4.9%, driven
by higher consumption. E-commerce shows no signs of slowing. In Q1, our online sales increased by 54%
year-over-year, and as a percentage of total sales, were 14.8% in Q1 compared to 10.2% in Q1 of 2020.
We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales.

The vaccinations will significantly influence consumer behavior. The U.S. is slowly opening up, which
means consumers are more mobile. 60% of vaccinated consumers are optimistic that they will return to
a normal, or new normal, as we are seeing the first signs that consumers are willing to spend more time
in stores based on a study by IRI. In contrast, many countries outside the U.S. continue to experience
lockdowns.

As described in the release, we have been facing shortages of raw materials due to the Texas freeze. Raw
material and transportation costs spiked higher in February and were exacerbated by the Texas freeze. We
expect the tight supply and higher input cost to continue for the balance of the year. To mitigate the cost
increases, we have announced price increases in laundry and across our international portfolio, and we
have reduced couponing and promotional spending. Rick will discuss this further in a couple of minutes.

At our Analyst Day in January, we outlined which categories and brands we expected to stay elevated
throughout 2021, recover from COVID lows, decline from COVID highs and which ones would remain
steady. Overall, our full year thinking has not changed. To name a few categories, demand for vitamins,
laundry additives and cat litter are expected to remain elevated in 2021. Condoms, dry shampoo, power
flossers and women's grooming are expected to deliver year-over-year growth as society opens up and
consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda, pregnancy test kits and oral analgesics are expected to
decline from COVID highs.

Of the 16 categories in which we compete, 8 grew consumption in Q1, in some cases, on top of big
consumption gains in Q1 of 2020. Of those 8 categories, 5 saw a double-digit growth: Gummy vitamins,
toothache, battery-powered toothbrush, pregnancy test kits and women's electric grooming. Household
categories, such as laundry detergent and baking soda, were down in the quarter and unable to comp the
huge COVID-19 sales spikes seen in Q1 2020.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Looking at market shares in Q1, 8 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share within our U.S.
Consumer Domestic business, which grew organic sales 5.1%. I'll comment on a few of the brands right
now.

Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. VITAFUSION and L'il Critters Gummy Vitamins saw
great consumption growth in Q1, up 24% with the help of the new launches described in the release. It
appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying. One survey showed that
consumers who are new to the category had a 90% repeat rate.

WATERPIK grew consumption 15% in Q1 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefit from
the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. WATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices
returning to pre-COVID patient levels. We expect the frequency of our Lunch & Learn program to return to
normal levels in the second half of this year.

Now BATISTE. While BATISTE remains impacted by social distancing, consumption was up 6% and we
achieved a record-high quarterly dollar share of 39% behind our International Women's Day campaign.

Now I want to talk about the International division. Despite European lockdowns, our International
business came through with 3.2% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in our
Global Markets group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. WATERPIK, FEMFRESH and ARM
& HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter.

Our Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 6% growth, primarily due to higher
pricing. Milk prices were stable in Q1 and are projected to increase later in the year due to higher demand.

Now turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. In 2021, we
have launched many new products which are described in our press release.

In the household products portfolio, we are introducing OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer. It is the
first and only sanitizing laundry additive that boosts stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and
viruses. The product is also designed for cleaning throughout the house and on a variety of surfaces.

In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry gummies, triple immune gummies and
POWER ZINC gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity.

WATERPIK launched WATERPIK ION, a water flosser which is 30% smaller and contains a long-lasting
lithium-ion battery and is specifically designed for smaller bathroom spaces. To capitalize on its earlier
success, Waterpik Sonic-Fusion, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to Sonic-Fusion 2.0
with 2 brush head sizes and 2 brush speeds.

And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with a facial
cleanser system, a shower wand for a full-body spa-like experience and at-home manicure and pedicure
solutions.

Now let's turn to the outlook. We're off to a good start in Q1. We continue to expect full year adjusted
EPS growth of 6% to 8%, which is in line with our evergreen target despite the heightened input cost.
Given our expectations for consumer consumption, we have raised our full year outlook for reported sales
growth from 4.5% to now 5% to 6%. Organic sales growth expectations were raised from 3% to 4% to
5%. And if you look at consumption trends through the middle of April, 14 of our 16 categories were up in
consumption year-over-year.

Now in conclusion. I'd like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church &
Dwight. Our track record shows that we are positioned to do well in both good and bad times and in
uncertain economic times such as now. Categories in which we play are essential to consumers. We have
a balance sheet of value and -- pardon me, we have a balance of value and premium products. Our power
brands are #1 or #2 in their categories. And we have low exposure to private label. And with a strong
balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses.

Next up is Rick to give us details on Q1.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody.

We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was
$0.83, flat to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will
continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earnout period. $0.83 was better than our $0.80 outlook,
primarily due to continued increase in consumer demand for many of our products. Reported revenue was
up 6.3%. Organic sales were up 4.9%, driven by a volume increase of 3.1% and a positive price/mix of
1.8%.

Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 5.1% due to
higher volume and positive price/mix. Overall, growth was led VITAFUSION, L'il Critters Gummy Vitamins,
WATERPIK oral care products, FLAWLESS beauty products, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and
KABOOM bathroom cleaners as well as VIVISCAL hair-thinning products.

Consumer International delivered 3.2% organic growth due to higher volume, partially offset by lower
price and product mix. This was a great result despite European lockdowns.

For our SPD business, organic sales increased 6% due to higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume.
Milk prices have remained stable month-to-month and are projected to rise as 2021 moves forward.

Now turning to gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin was 44.5%, a 120 basis point decrease from
a year ago. Gross margin drag was impacted by 350 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily
related to commodities, distribution, tariffs and COVID impacts. Commodities, which were exacerbated
due to the Texas freeze, were a 90 basis point drag on margin. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross
margin by 40 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a plus 190 basis points from price/volume
mix and a positive 170 basis points from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis point positive impact
from favorable currency.

As a reminder, our outlook for the quarter on gross margin was down 50 basis points. The entire variance
was related to the spike in commodities and tight transportation market. The good news is, for the back
half of the year, we expect margin expansion behind the pricing and promotional actions we laid out in the
release as well as we start to lap some of the higher inflation and tariffs that we experienced in the back
half of 2020.

Moving to marketing. Marketing was up $2.3 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brands.
Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 8%.

For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 60 basis points year-over-year primarily due to acquisition-related
intangible amortization. We also had higher investments within IT and R&D as well as some transition
costs from the ZICAM acquisition.

Other expense, all in, was $11.6 million, a $3.6 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower
interest rates.

And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 23.2% in 2020, an increase
of 100 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises.

And now to cash. For the first 3 months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 57% to $100
million due to higher cash earnings, which was offset by an increase in working capital. Inventory is higher
to support increase in sales as we continue to improve customer fill levels. Accounts payable and accrued
expenses decreased due to the timing of payments. As of March 31, cash on hand was $128 million.

Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $180 million as we continue to expand
manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

For Q2, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 4.5%, organic sales growth of approximately
4% and gross margin contraction of 350 basis points as higher input costs continue and we lap artificially
low promotional levels from a year ago.

Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.69 per share, a 10% decrease from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. As you
read in the release, we did a voluntary recall of selected products within our vitamin business. We expect
the EPS impact in Q2 to be approximately $0.04 for the quarter, and we are seeking reimbursement by
insurance.

And now for the full year outlook. We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be 5% to
6%, which is above our previous 4.5% outlook. We're also raising our full year organic sales growth to
approximately 4% to 5%, up from the previous outlook of 3%.

Turning to gross margin. We now expect full year gross margin to be flat for the year, primarily due to the
impact of higher raw material and transportation costs and the Texas freeze in March. We had previously
expected gross margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year. And recently, we have seen a large
increase in raw materials and transportation costs. We're absorbing $90 million of incremental costs
for the full year. Higher sales, reductions in promotions and price increases across all 3 of our divisions
represented about 1/3 of our portfolio, offset a large part of the cost increases. As a reminder, we price to
protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin.

Our full year tax rate expectations are now 22%, higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock
option exercises. This is a $0.02 headwind versus our previous full year outlook.

Adjusted EPS expectations continue to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.06, a 6% to 8% increase year-over-
year. Our cash from operations outlook continues to be $1 billion while we continue to pursue accretive
acquisitions.

As you heard from Matt, the company is off to a great start, and we expect 2021 to be another strong
year.
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Let's start, I guess, on pricing and commodities. Rick, if you can just spend a moment on how much of
your commodity exposure you have hedged for the year, I think that would be helpful.

And then shifting to pricing. Matt, you mentioned laundry and your international portfolio. I think typically,
the company will lead in baking soda, contraceptives, in OXI. What percentage of your portfolio do you
expect to take pricing? How much is in your outlook? I know pricing is a sensitive topic, but maybe just
sort of triangulate between how much is in your outlook. And then how much you -- there might be
additional pricing that may not be in your outlook, I suppose.

And then what are you seeing from competition, specifically in your bigger categories like laundry and
litter and vitamins, on the pricing front?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Okay, Kevin, it's Rick. I'll take the commodity piece really quick. Maybe 2 parts, maybe to give you
comfort on the back half gross margin expansion as well. But we're about 80% hedged from a commodity
perspective. And remember, we said if we could hedge those, 1 of our key 6 or 7 commodities, then a lot
of the volatility does go away.

We do have a lot of confidence in gross margin expansion in the back half as we are lapping some of those
higher commodity costs in the back half of 2020. Just as an indication, ethylene, for example, in the first
half of 2021, is up 70%. If we keep that current spot rate for the remainder of the year, the back half
would be up 30% versus the second half of 2020.

So like I said, we are comping some of that, and that's why we think we have confidence in the back half
gross margin expansion, as well as the price/volume mix.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Okay. And Kevin, your question about pricing. So we'll start with laundry. So if you look at over the past
18 months, our competitors have taken price in a different way, generally through changes in ounces. And
where our estimate is anywhere from maybe 8% to 12% price. And so we announced in early April that
we're raising price. We're discussing that with retailers now. And -- but we don't think we're going to be
out of bounds with respect to price gaps in laundry.

Your question about how much has been priced. We've had 1/3 of the portfolio, and that would include
Domestic, International and also SPD. And in the U.S. business, it's ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, our sheets
business, scent boosters, so it's pretty much concentrated on laundry. A couple of other categories in
there, we're raising some price, and also just a couple of specific variants within the TROJAN category.

Internationally, it's largely a personal care business, so the price increases are largely around the personal
care business.

And SPD, in particular, some of our products are being impacted by PFAD, which is Palm Fatty Acid
Distillate, which is affecting inputs for one of our products called MEGALAC. So we've been increasing
prices now monthly for MEGALAC, and we'll be doing it as well for some of our other products.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

As far as -- I think a related question might be sold on deal, so how promotional is the environment
today? So as everyone knows, the household side of the business is the one that's promotional. So
laundry was down 300 basis points. The laundry category is now 300 basis points year-over-year sold on
deal. And litter, similarly, was down 500 basis points year-over-year in Q1. We think that's probably going
to reverse in Q2, and there's a simple reason for that is because last year in Q2, promotions were pulled in
these categories.

So for example, last year, in the second quarter and year-over-year, the laundry sold on deal was down
1,700 basis points 2020 versus '19. So obviously, a different kind of comp in Q2, so we think it may be up.

That help you, Kevin?

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes, yes. That's helpful, Matt. A quick follow-up on the pricing comment, a broader question, if you don't
mind.

You mentioned that 1/3 of the portfolio is taking pricing. Is that to suggest that the other 2/3 are
potentially upside? Should -- and presumably, you're not going to lead, so you're waiting for the
competition to lead, because it's probably hard to envision many categories where there's not a cost
justification for the price increase. So presumably in that 2/3, you're waiting for the competition to lead.
If you could just sort of confirm that. Is that a potential additional offset to the commodity cost pressure
you're seeing?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. That's the right way to think about it. I mean, the price increases were -- or the cost -- input costs
were very acute in the laundry category, so that's where we thought we had to move. But as far as -- we
wouldn't speculate on any other category about what we might do later in the year.

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. Just one more quick, I apologize if I'm monopolizing time here. But sort of like the million-
dollar question, Matt. Long-term implications from COVID, understanding still a lot of volatility, a lot of
uncertainty in the environment. It would seem like at a minimum, the view -- company's view would be
expect higher consumption in vitamins even as we sort of get through this and looking out to next year.
How are you thinking and planning internally? And what could the potential implications be broadly for
Church's portfolio? And I'll pass it on.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Hang on, Kevin. Is your question in the next 6 months, what our expectations with respect to...

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

No, the question is for longer term, Matt. The question's -- so relative to the 3% organic sales guidance
which you guys have pretty consistently beaten for some time now, at a minimum, it would seem like
household penetration has and will, to some degree, sustain a higher degree in vitamins at a minimum
within the portfolio. How are you thinking broadly about Church's portfolio in terms of shifts in consumer
behavior as a consequence of the pandemic focus on health and wellness, et cetera?

President, CEO & Chairman

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Well, certainly, the focus on health and wellness is going to benefit not just our gummy vitamin business,
but our WATERPIK business, which has been just a high single-digit grower perennially since we acquired
the business.

I think what you're going to find is that 2021 is going to be kind of a reset. That as we live with COVID
this year, we'll be able to grow from there. But we have such a broad portfolio, both in household and
personal care. We do think that we're well positioned, frankly, for '22 and beyond.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.

Andrea Faria Teixeira
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I want to go back just to -- basically coming back for the categories that are kind of more impacted by
mobility. What are you seeing now?

And then as a follow-up to the recall, what is the -- obviously, you called out for $0.04 impact and you're
trying to get insurance payback on that one. Is there any additional potential charges there?

And have you had any issues with the shelf space or anything else for the balance of the year on the
vitamins? Any comments on that or any potential changes on production or any disruptions that we should
be thinking of.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. So I'll let Matt take the categories and mobility, and I'll just talk about the insurance and the recall.

So trying to be very clear that the potential impact is up to $0.04. We think it's relatively limited to that.
To our knowledge, there has been no additional shelf reset issues. This was a small window of production.
We've been very clear in the release of what we've talked about. And that's kind of the extent of it.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. As far as the categories go, just give you some color on that, the gummy category was up 19% in Q1,
and even depilatories were up 9%. Again, people who discovered depilatories a year ago when using at-
home solutions. So those are a couple of examples, 2 of the categories we expected to be elevated this
year.

Litter is another one, and there's 6% more households that have cats. So that's sort of the tailwind for
litter.

And there were a number of categories we expected to recover, for example, water flossers. Water flossers
was up 29%, just the category, in Q1. And even electric grooming was up 3% in Q1.

Dry shampoo was down 1% in Q1, so it's way better sequentially. And we have -- as I mentioned in my
remarks earlier, we had a record share and we grew sales in Q1 year-over-year in dry shampoo.

And as far as the ones that will decline, baking soda's already started to decline in Q1. Toothache as well
was off 3%, that category, in Q1. And also cold shortening, as Rick made reference to the ZICAM category,
was down 70% in Q1. So that's to give you a little bit of color on what's going on in the categories.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Andrea, I think Matt's comment in his prepared remarks, about 13 of 16 categories being positive
in April, and that's pretty broad-based across household and personal care. So all those socially distant
impacts are starting to mitigate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.

Christopher Michael Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So a couple of questions. Just first, on the back half gross margin expectations, I guess it feels like
something like 225 basis points average midpoint of gross margin expansion versus 2020. Appreciate easy
comps, appreciate lower promos and pricing. But it's also, I guess, implying a slightly higher gross margin
level than even in 2019 despite this higher-inflation environment. I wonder if you can -- just maybe,
number one, is that a fair way to look at it?

And then number two, maybe just unpack that a little bit. How much of that is maybe lower promo, the
mix of the business relative to 2019, the higher pricing levels? Just anything you might think relevant to
better think through that dynamic. And then I have one follow-up.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, sure. I'll do it 2 ways. The first way, I'll just give you some of the details of the full year outlook,
remembering, in New York, in our annual -- or at CAGNY, we gave you a full year outlook on gross margin,
gave you the pieces. So I'll do that again, and then I'll kind of bridge it to you.

So the full year outlook for margin is plus 200 basis points for price/volume mix, plus 120 basis points for
productivity. So those are the 2 big tailwinds. Price/volume mix, for example, is a lot higher than it was,
given all of our expectations for, number one, lower promotional spending but higher pricing; and really,
baseline volumes doing better than we expected. Then we have inflation down 300 basis points; and then
tariffs down 40; m&A, up 20. That's how we get to 0.

Now if you take a step back and you think, well, the first half of this year, to get to 0, the first half is going
to be down about 2.35%, and the back half is going to be up about 2.35%. That's a delta of about 470
basis points. So why are we convinced that we can go from the first half down to the second half up?

200 basis points of that 470 is because of price/volume mix, those the actions that we talked about. The
other 300 basis points is really cost-related. Inflation, I gave the example in relation to Kevin's question,
that ethylene, for example, is up 70% in the first half of 2021, HDPE is up 85% in the first half of 2021.
Ethylene is only up 30% in the back half if we keep current spot levels, HDPE is only up 50% if we keep
current spot levels.

We're lapping tariffs, right? We had tariffs in the year-ago numbers in the back half. We had some higher
COVID costs in the back half of 2020. So those are -- that's a little bit more color, but just wanted to walk
you through.

Christopher Michael Carey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up would be on the vitamin category. So I know that this was
-- has been approached a few different ways already just from a category growth and higher per capita
consumption perspective.

But it's not just that, right? I mean, you outperformed the category, I don't know, at least at scanner,
roughly 50 points, maybe a little bit less, in 2020. And the relative outperformance has certainly sustained
that -- not that high of a level, but it certainly sustained on a year-to-date basis. So like there's clearly a
pretty significant share gain story here, too.

And asked different ways in the past, but can you just offer a little bit of perspective on exactly why
you think that's the case? Whether that's the incremental capacity that you had already invested into,
whether you think your product SKUs or the price tiers or the specific subcategories that you're in are

particularly relevant in the current environment? Just broadly, what you think is contributing to the
relative outperformance in the category that's doing quite well.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Okay. Well, remember, in the gummy category, we have #1 brands. So let's start right there. We know the
transition from pills and capsules continues to gummies. I mentioned earlier that household penetration is
up. So the households that were already buying VITAFUSION, L'il Critters gummies, are taking more.

And where new consumers are being attracted to the categories, so we stand the benefit from that, being
the #1 brand. We've had a lot of success with new products over the last couple of years. So we're able to
spread out on shelf.

And something else, too, is you may recall from earlier calls that we had third-party production come
online late in 2020. So our in-stocks are way better right now.

So a combination of all those is what's going to sustain the elevated consumption in [ 20. ]

Operator, are you there?

Operator

Yes, I'm here. Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So I wanted to go to the International segment. So clearly, Q1 was impacted by some of the European
lockdowns. I was curious how you guys are thinking about it for the balance of the year. And do you still
think a 6% type growth rate is achievable for that segment?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I'd say, on a full year basis, we're still expecting 6% from International. The engine for International
growth in the last few years has been the Global Markets Group. So that does spread your risk quite
broadly across many regions around the world, so we're not wholly dependent upon the countries where
we have operations. And you may recall that Global Markets Group is about 1/3 of our business, and it's
been growing at 15% or better for the last 4, 5 years. So we think that will be sustained in the 2021,
Rupesh.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. And just to give you a little bit more color, Rupesh, our outlook in February for organic was 3%,
and that was 2% domestically, 6% internationally and 5% SPD. Now we're thinking it's closer to 4%
domestically, 6% internationally and 6% for SPD.

Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So on ZICAM, it looks like -- I think if I'm
reading the numbers correctly, that you guys took down your expectations for ZICAM this year. And
clearly, everyone is calling out the cough and cold challenges. So I don't know, as you guys look out this
year, next year, like do you think -- would you expect the business to be back on track, I guess, next fiscal
year?

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

In 2021? Yes, absolutely. Look -- I mean, it's common knowledge that incidence of flu and cold and cough
is way down, so it's affected many, many brands in the category. We remain focused on the fact that we're
the #1 share and we had a 73% share in cold shortening. So it is a strong brand, we bought it for the long
term, and we do expect it to be a contributor to organic growth, particularly in 2022 and beyond.

Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Crédit Suisse.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Can I ask a question maybe about stimulus and the impact on demand. In particular, you mentioned
water flosser strength -- water flossers were very strong. We've also heard some pretty strong device
sales at Procter & Gamble, and this morning, Keurig Dr Pepper. Do you think there's maybe something in
the figures that we're seeing which are very strong that is a bit less sustainable because of the impact of
stimulus?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

I wouldn't think that would apply to water flosses just because of the growth rate that we saw beginning in
2017 when we first bought the business. So we've had high single-digit growth for the past several years,
and we have so much opportunity internationally. That's where all the growth is going to come from long
term.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. And I do think that -- remember, we're comping over periods of time a year ago that we're just
super depressed and nobody was in retail stores and/or doing shopping for devices. So I do think it's also
comp...

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, it's a super easy comp year-over-year, so I wouldn't be swayed by the fact that the category might
have been up 29% in Q1. But long term, it's going to be a grower for Church & Dwight.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And outside of water flossers, any view on impact of stimulus?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Well, look, I think this stimulus can affect virtually every category. I mean, the way to think about
the economy, or the way we think about it, is savings rates are up. The stats that I've seen is 13% of
disposable income, and the average for the last 5 years is between 6% and 8%. And certainly, stimulus
checks are helping those in need. There's labor shortages, right? So there's -- more jobs are available, and
average hourly earnings is up. So I think all of that suggests that the household balance sheets and the
consumer is healthier and getting healthier. So I think that benefits all of our categories.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just a very quick one. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion about raw material
prices and transportation pricing and stuff, but we're also hearing about kind of real supply issues that
maybe just can't get what you need. Is that impacting your business anywhere at all?

CFO & Executive VP

Well, it certainly does, right? I think I gave the example to the Board the other day that, in a normal
year, we might have one force majeure for one of our suppliers, and in the quarter, we had 6. So there is
tightness in supply. Our ops and R&D teams are doing a great job getting substitute supplies or working
with suppliers to get through that, have largely, on [ this gap ]. There's always stuff we go hand-to-mouth
on. But by and by, we've [ announced better than most ].

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.

William Bates Chappell
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just a follow-up on 1 of Kevin's 23 questions on pricing. In terms of timing, P&G had said that they were
looking at pricing kind of in September, I think you're talking about a little bit sooner. So do you think
there's any risk of kind of price gaps being extended kind of over the summer before everybody kind of
pushes it through?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

The timing for our price increases is starting in July, Bill. Is that what you're trying to drive at?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Well -- and Bill, the -- I think what Matt was trying to allude to before is some of the compaction activities
that happened with some of our competition kind of means that our price gaps aren't really that out of line
versus historical levels.

William Bates Chappell
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got you. So you see everybody kind of -- in terms of the competitive front, everybody kind of taking price
in lockstep at the same time...

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

No. Our decision with respect to raising price in laundry was unilateral and was driven by the cost
increases that we've been experiencing. My reference was just simply the fact that, hey, over the past 12
months or so, our competitors had raised their prices by reduction in ounces and things like that in their
products. So consequently, we didn't see that raising prices on our part was going to create a difficult gap
for us in pricing.

William Bates Chappell
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then just some -- can you give a little bit more of an update on where you see the
FLAWLESS franchise? I mean, since you bought it, there hasn't been a normal environment, from Bed
Bath issues, to supply issues, to COVID and people staying at home, to somewhat kind of return to
normal. I know it seems like, on shelf, it's gotten better positioning at retail more with the shaving kind
of category. It seems like you've expanded some SKUs, so it's a bigger block when you walk through the
retail orders. But kind of any thoughts, ex kind of the COVID bounce back, you see on that franchise?

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Yes. Well, look, we've talked about this in the past. And you're right, we've kind of gone sideways since
we bought the business for a variety of reasons. When we bought the business in 2018, it had net sales of
$186 million; and then 2019, $180 million; and then last year, $171 million.

So this year, we expect to be up approximately 20%. And the reason why we believe that is because we've
got a nice array of new products to go with our existing products. And I mentioned those in my remarks,
got body cleanser, face cleanser and some mani-pedi products, which are really good. Plus, we've got
influencers now that are getting behind the product. So notably, Ashley Graham and Dove Cameron. We
also have a celebrity, Halle Berry, who is pitching FLAWLESS. So I think -- and all of those are hitting in
2021. So consequently, we're optimistic about the future for FLAWLESS.

Operator

your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit -- 2 things, and the primary thing is the driver of the change in
outlook for Consumer Domestic, from 2% to 4% growth.

I guess, one, to what degree is that greater optimism on how well the vitamin business holds in?

And secondly, how does that relate to what we're starting to see in the Nielsen data, which is that market
shares in laundry are down and softening. And it's not multiple periods, but now we're talking about going
into a pricing environment. So just curious on your thoughts on laundry market share performance and
how that ties in, again, with that change in outlook to a more optimistic view on Consumer Domestic.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. I'll take the -- this change in the organic outlook and what brands are driving it, and Matt can add on.

So Lauren, it's really 2 or 3 things that are driving the confidence and the strength in the outlook from
3% to 4.5% as the midpoint. Vitamins is the big one. WATERPIK is doing exceptionally well. PTK, our
pregnancy test kit business is doing well. So it's kind of broad-based. Those are all -- those 3 that are
certainly helping raise our outlook.

Now in terms of laundry, just real briefly, we review share information all the time. Really, there's 2 things,
really one primarily, it's unit dose. Unit dose is down slightly in share. And that's not because consumers
aren't choosing to buy our product, it's because we continue to have a transition from making that outside
to bringing that in-house. And so outside supply is very tight at the moment, but the good news is we are
in the ramp-up stage right now to bring everything in-house. So we [ expect it to be ] a short-term blip.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. As far as the laundry category, Lauren. If you look at Q1, ARM & HAMMER gained share, XTRA did
not. We have been prioritizing ARM & HAMMER for quite a few quarters now, throughout the pandemic.

We do expect that shares could be impacted, certainly by our actions, with respect to price. I mean,
that's pretty normal. So how competitors react to that is unknown. And certainly, if competitors were to
raise price or reduce promotions, less sold on deal, obviously, that could affect our shares as well. But
unpredictable right now. But we're committed to raising price starting July 1.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. I'll also give you an optimistic comment. All of our assumptions in our outlook include assumptions
that competition doesn't follow us. So we've taken down the volume on the elasticity and everything else.
So that's kind of a conservative way to do it.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So I mean, just building on that last comment on the elasticities. You've got momentum and brand
strength. It seems like you've approached it conservatively relative to the competition. But at this point,
as we listen to so many CPG companies talking about raising price, either already having done so or
pricing to come, the whole -- the majority of the consumer shopping basket seems like it's poised to be
going up. So just -- can you talk about how that factors into your thinking, and relative cross-category
elasticity that might benefit or complicate your scenario analysis?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. It's sort of an umbrella statement, Steve. We've pointed out to investors for years that we have a
balanced portfolio between premium and value. And when you have #1 brands, typically, you're going to
fare better in difficult economic times than companies that do not have #1 brands. So we like where we
are right now going forward. We think we're in a good position.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. And a lot of our brands are value brand. And even in the laundry example, despite any increase, the
price gaps are in line with historical levels and are great values compared to competition.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. I guess, there's been just a tremendous amount of volatility in shipments and
consumer takeaway patterns as inventories rebalance, both at retail and, I presume, in household
pantries. As you try to cut through that -- those dynamics from where you sit, do you have a sense of how
actual consumer usage of your brands or your categories is trending today?

I don't know what the right benchmark is, whether sequentially versus the fourth quarter of last year,
versus 2019 or a year ago. But just any benchmark on actual usage that might give us more insight into
your confidence in raising the full year outlook.

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

I'll start. We think, just based on looking at consumption patterns in the categories, and consumption
equals usage. I wouldn't point to pantry-loading or panic-buying anymore. I think it's steady-state now,
Steve.

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. And just to add to that, right, and we talked about in the release about personal care categories
that are up double digits in consumption. That's partly because there's low comps a year ago. But I think
gummy vitamins, as an example, Matt referenced, is growth on top of growth. And if you look at most of
our categories and whatnot, it's growth on top of growth. Because April last year, we grew; but April of
this year, Matt just said, 13 of 16 categories are up. So again, growth on top of growth.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

I noticed -- so there's been a lot of talk about declining birth rates, and I noticed in the release and in the
commentary during the call, you called out positive pregnancy test kit trends. So I'm just curious, is this
a relation to just easy comparisons? Or do you think there's something else going on that happened over
the last 12 months as we're all locked up in our homes?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I think one way to look at it is if you look at the period like February, March, April last year, that was
down versus 2019. So you sort of have easy comps year-over-year. And when you look at kits in the first
quarter, we said the category is actually up about 23%. And that's one of the categories we thought that
would fall back a bit in 2021. So I think best case, maybe it doesn't fall back and maybe it's flat year-over-
year.

But it's -- one other fact that I could give you, Nik, is that typically, if you're in a recession, the birth rate
decline. But with the economy -- I mean, I think in the last -- people may have thought we were going,
[ but actually, it's ] clearly, we are not. So the category could be better than we expected for [ 2021 ].

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And one other question, Matt. I was just thinking about how more and more of these kind of
testing kits that you can do at home to diagnose a lot of things, like in terms of what you should be eating
and what kind of vitamins you would need and things like that. And I'm just curious, given that you're
already in that business, have you ever thought about expanding the portfolio to deal with other types of
diagnosis?

Matthew Thomas Farrell
President, CEO & Chairman

Nik, I think you have a future in new products. I think that's exactly the types of things that we'd be
looking at. And of course, we have a great brand name at FIRST RESPONSE. We could -- it is certainly
[ portable ] in other categories, but yes.

Operator

And our final question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Thanks for letting me bat clean-up here, I appreciate it. I wanted to come back to the gross margin
question that I think was asked earlier, because I don't think you ever fully answered it.

Your guidance suggests that you're going to hit a pretty high gross margin in the back half. In fact, going
back over the last 10 years, it will be the highest back half margin you've ever achieved, which in context
of the environment, seems surprising. So I was hoping you could explain like why, structurally, you're
going to be at a higher margin even with these cost pressures?

And then the second, related question is, gosh, if you can hit all-time high margins in the back half with
this environment, what is the right margin for this portfolio? Because Street's out there looking at fiscal
'23, maybe you're 46%, 46% straight. Do you think, with the portfolio you have today, your normalized
gross margin rate should be in the 47s, 48% type range?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. Jason. I thought I gave some context to it. I hear you on absolute numbers. I think -- I'm trying to
explain that we're going to -- we have a lot of confidence in being up in the back half, and part of it was
the comp on inflation, the comp on COVID, the comp on tariffs.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

But underlying that, remember, all the things we talk about with our evergreen model are certainly true,
right? Our productivity program over the last couple of years has almost doubled in relation to where it
was just 5 years ago. So we have a new capability that's offsetting these things that has been masked for
a period of time because of all this inflation, all these tariff discussions, all these COVID costs. So that's
certainly coming to bear in just a great way.

NPD as an example. When we buy businesses that have higher gross margin, that's simply an add as
well. So ZICAM, even though, as an example, that revenue number will be lower than we had hoped for
because there's 0 cold and flu season, the margin impact is still a tailwind.

So all those things that are structural are also tailwinds. I think over the long term, we have a lot of
confidence in the evergreen model, expanding gross margin. We've got to get past all these onetimers like
tariffs and whatnot. But I really do believe that we have more upside, more room to run. And so I do think
that we're going to be into the higher 40s over the long term.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. Again, I appreciate all the year-on-year stuff you gave. But just sequentially, forget about
year-on-year, you've got a cost structure in the first half. Do you expect it to be a lot lower in the back
half?

Richard A. Dierker
CFO & Executive VP

Yes. So not year-over-year, but just sequentially, do we [ expect to ] be lower? For right now, like all of
the inflation, as an example, we are assuming that it's kind of a spot pricing. We've locked in, like I said
before, about 80% of the commodities. So it's really the absence of higher inflation, the absence of higher
tariffs, the absence of higher COVID costs. In theory, COVID costs actually help us in the back half, we
don't have the same extent. And all those things help.

But then we're going to get the positive price/mix that's new to the portfolio. That is incremental pricing
on those brands that Matt talked about. And then the incremental productivity program that we always
talk about as well. And the M&A tailwind. So those are the kind of the things that are structurally higher.

Operator

And there are no further questions in queue.

Okay. Hey, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Obviously, we're always available for follow-up
questions. And then we'll talk to you again in July.
