JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this
time. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may now begin.

Sarah Wood

Good morning. This is Sarah Wood, Senior Director, Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to
our company's review of business results for the third quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2021.

On today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. And during the Q&A portion
of the call, Joe will be joined by Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Medical
Devices; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health; and Jennifer
Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceuticals.

A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible
through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you
can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.

Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review
the cautionary statements included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that
may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.

In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated
impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the
information available as of today's date.

A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings,
including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP
financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials
are also available at investor.jnj.com.

Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with
strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.

Moving to today's agenda. I will review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and
the 3 segments. Joe will provide some additional business and financial commentary, before providing an
overview of our cash position and capital allocation, and then conclude with updated guidance on 2021
results. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to
60 minutes. Now let's move to the third quarter results.

Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.7% versus the third
quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased
9.9% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. In the U.S., sales increased 7.9%. In regions
outside the U.S., our reported growth was 13.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.1%,
with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.7 points. Excluding the net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 10.6% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and
13.5% outside the U.S.

Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share
was $1.37 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.33 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset
amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.60, representing increases of 18.7% and 18.2%,
respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per
share increased 16.4%.

I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the
slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational
sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2020 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency
translation.

Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.7 billion increased 4.1% with
growth of 4.5% in the U.S. and growth of 3.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures,
worldwide growth was 5.7%. Although there is variability across the franchises due to the impact of
COVID-19, the overall portfolio is performing well. When comparing to 2019, the Consumer Health
business grew approximately 8% operationally in the quarter.

Over-the-counter medicines saw strong growth of 18.2% globally due to share gains in the U.S., along
with an increase of pediatric fever incidences and demand for vaccination symptom relief that drove
increased sales of TYLENOL and MOTRIN globally. Additionally, category recovery increased demand for
cough, cold, flu and digestive health brands, such as IMODIUM. Sales outside the U.S. benefited from prior
year comparisons, specifically prior year reduction in consumption in China.

Our Skin Health/Beauty franchise declined by 3% globally, largely due to the 330 basis point impact of
the divestiture of Sedona, the salon-based portion of Dr. Ci Labo in Asia Pacific. Excluding this impact, the
franchise experienced modest growth driven by strong performance in AVEENO and NEUTROGENA facial
moisturizing and body care, driven by COVID-19 market recovery and e-commerce growth, partially offset
by external supply constraints and lost sales from the sun aerosol recall.

Oral Care declined 4.5% globally, largely due to the impact of divestitures worth approximately 300 basis
points. Excluding this impact, the franchise declined due to external supply constraints for LISTERINE in
the U.S. and negative comparisons to prior year COVID-19-related impacts in EMEA, partially offset by
strong performance in Asia Pacific, driven by strong promotions and brand building behind LISTERINE
germ fighting ability.

The Baby Care franchise declined 1.2% globally, resulting from Asia Pacific COVID-19 lockdowns and
competitive pressure, mostly offset by strong AVEENO performance, along with category and e-commerce
growth in the U.S. Our Women's Health franchise grew 0.8% globally, primarily due to lapping prior year
COVID-19 impacts. And finally, our Wound Care franchise declined 4.8% globally, driven by unfavorable
comparisons to prior year stocking in the U.S. and competitive pressure in Asia Pacific.

Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13 billion increased 13.2%
with growth of 12.2% in the U.S. and growth of 14.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 13.8%. Additionally, as a reminder, for comparison
purposes, Q3 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting
in a decrease of roughly 200 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and
commercial capabilities continued to enable us to deliver adjusted operational growth at above-market
levels.

The immunology portfolio delivered strong global sales growth of 11.7%, driven by double-digit
performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition.
STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 21.7%, driven by market growth and share
gains of roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 7 points in ulcerative colitis in the U.S.

TREMFYA was up 63.5%, with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to continued positive share
growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased over 2 points
in psoriasis and over 3 points in psoriatic arthritis.

Oncology also delivered another strong quarter with global sales growth of 16.5%. DARZALEX continued
its double-digit performance with 42.9% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased
penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU and continued launches globally.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 5 points of share growth in the U.S. this
quarter, as an example.

ERLEADA also continued its global uptake with growth of 65.8% in the quarter, driven by global market
share gains, which increased in the U.S. alone by nearly 2 points across all indications led by the
metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 2.5% globally due to the brand's market-leading share position
but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. and a market that remains constrained due to
temporary COVID-19 impact on new patient starts. In addition, growth was negatively impacted by a prior
period adjustment in the U.S. that was worth nearly 350 basis points on worldwide IMBRUVICA growth.

Neuroscience grew 4.6% globally, driven by paliperidone long-acting portfolio, posting market and
share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency in the U.S. The Cardiovascular,
Metabolism and other business declined 12.4% globally due to competitive pressures in INVOKANA and
biosimilar competition for PROCRIT.

Pulmonary Hypertension achieved strong growth of 16.1% driven by OPSUMIT growth of 17.1% and
UPTRAVI growth of 18.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. And lastly, global sales
in the quarter included a $502 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, bringing the year-to-date
total to $766 million. Through the first 9 months of the year, revenue has been recorded at a not-for-profit
price of $7.50.

I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales of $6.6
billion increased 7% with growth of 0.8% in the U.S. and growth of 13.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding
the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 7.6%.

In the Medical Devices segment, we have seen mixed marketplace recovery as the COVID-19 Delta variant
and related factors impacted our sales across most of the categories in which we participate within the
quarter, with certain procedures such as spine and knees within Orthopaedics, deemed to be more elective
in nature, continuing to lag in terms of recovery.

The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at
13.2%, driven by market recovery, success of new products in both electrophysiology and neurovascular,
and strong commercial execution. Worldwide surgery grew 10.2%, primarily driven by recovering
procedure volumes and market expansion in Asia Pacific.

Advanced Surgery grew 12.6% globally driven by the positive impact of procedure recovery, new product
introductions and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion across endocutters, biosurgicals and
energy, partially offset by continued competitive pressure in endocutters and energy in the U.S. Building
on the Monarch robotic milestone communicated last quarter, we reached another significant commercial
achievement, now enabling over 10,000 bronchoscopy procedures.

General Surgery grew 8.1% globally. Wound closure is the largest contributor with growth driven by
procedure recovery, China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion and continued competitive growth in
both traditional and barbed suture markets.

The worldwide Orthopaedics franchise declined 0.3%, with U.S. declines of 4.5% reflecting the impact
of COVID-19 on procedures within the quarter, partially offset by 6.8% OUS growth. Trauma grew 3.7%
globally, 5.3% increase in the U.S. and a 0.9% increase outside the U.S. Results reflect global market
recovery dynamics and the success of recent product introductions, like our Cannulated Compression
Headless Screws, advanced nailing systems and FIBULINK.

Hips grew 2.3% globally driven by recovery in procedures, primarily outside the U.S., and continued
leadership in the anterior approach, supported by our robust portfolio of new products, such as ACTIS
femoral stem, PINNACLE Dual Mobility and VELYS Hip Navigation. In Q3, we introduced new image
guidance capability for VELYS Hip Navigation, which supports surgeons who prefer the posterior approach
in addition to the anterior approach.

Knees grew 2.1% this quarter, reflecting recovery of procedures, especially in markets outside of the U.S.,
growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery channel and continued momentum from recently launched products,

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE Knee portfolio. Results in the quarter also
benefited from the timing of international tender orders worth approximately 350 basis points of global
growth.

Lastly, within Orthopaedics, Spine declined 11% globally, driven primarily by a deceleration in procedure
volume related to COVID-19. The worldwide Vision franchise grew 10% this quarter, primarily driven by
market recovery, commercial initiatives and new products driving enhanced competitiveness. Contact lens
global growth of 6.4% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio,
success of commercial initiatives and recently launched products, such as ACUVUE OASYS multifocal and
ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. The decline of 4.3% in the U.S. includes a negative impact of prior year stocking
worth about 10 points. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 22.1% driven by market recovery across
all regions and success of recently launched products continuing to enhance competitiveness, including
TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy.

Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2021, I'd like to highlight
a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products
sold improved by 200 basis points, driven by recovery from prior year COVID-19-related impacts and
favorable enterprise mix from growth in Pharmaceuticals. We continue to invest strategically in research
and development at competitive levels, investing 14.7% of sales this quarter. The $3.4 billion investment
was a 20.5% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression.

In-process research and development reflect a partial impairment expense of $900 million for assets
associated with the acquisition of Auris. The other income and expense line changed from a net expense
of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020 to net expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021,
primarily due to an increase in litigation-related charges. Joe will provide more details on both the IP R&D
and litigation-related charges.

Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 4.7% in the third quarter of
2021 compared to 19.2% in the third quarter of 2020, mostly driven by unfavorable tax reserves and
positions from the prior year, which did not reoccur, along with lower income and higher tax jurisdictions
driven by onetime current quarter special items. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.5%
versus 19% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing
for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the
slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted
to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.

Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted
income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales remained fairly consistent to the prior year
with some changes between our 3 segments. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 46.4% to 43.9%,
driven by research and development investment to enable portfolio progression. Medical Devices margins
improved from 21.6% to 25.5%, driven by recovery from prior year COVID-19-related impacts and overall
expense leveraging resulting from sales recovery. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 24.4%
to 23.3%, driven by a 2020 onetime item and increased brand marketing expenses, partially offset by
COGS improvement.

That concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now
pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter
results, which reflect the continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses and
solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19 variability across geographies.

How do we see the current medical device landscape? In the U.S., surgical procedures across most
specialties in which we compete decelerated in late July and August, with the highest impacts consistently
in those procedures deemed to be more elective, such as knees and spine. Globally, new cases of

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

COVID-19 and hospitalizations related to the Delta variant have gradually declined in recent weeks,
and we are encouraged by more positive procedure trends in many Western European markets where
restrictions are beginning to ease. Some hotspots still remain in parts of the U.S., the U.K., Eastern Europe
and Southeast Asia, and the growing impact from reduced medical staffing are constraining procedure
volumes.

We continue to believe these variables are more short term in nature, and the medical devices market
remains attractive as the long-term factors leading to the need for medical and surgical intervention have
not changed due to COVID-19. The segment leaders on the call will provide more insights into each of
their businesses during the Q&A, but let me briefly touch upon some pipeline updates for the quarter.

We continued to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is
supported by our commitment to investments in R&D that have increased $1.9 billion or 23% on a year-
to-date basis. In the quarter, we received U.S. approval for INVEGA HAFYERA, the first and only twice-
yearly treatment for adults with schizophrenia. And we announced the start of a Phase III study of our
investigational RSV vaccine in older adults.

Subsequent to the quarter, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for nipocalimab in chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, or CIDP, a rare neurological disorder of the peripheral
nerves characterized by gradually increasing sensory loss and weakness associated with loss of reflexes.
This represents nipocalimab's fourth orphan drug designation. We also anticipate U.S. approval for our
BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third new product approval in 2021. However, we are
stopping further investigation in the Fontan-palliated population of macitentan 10 milligram in pulmonary
hypertension as results from the RUBATO Phase III trial did not yield sufficient clinical benefit.

Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we are pleased that on Friday, the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological
Products Advisory Committee voted unanimously to recommend Emergency Use Authorization for a
booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for adults aged 18 and older at least 2 months
following initial single-shot vaccine. The recommendation is based on the totality of evidence with clinical
and real-world data showing that while a single shot offers strong and lasting protection, a booster
increases protection, particularly against symptomatic COVID-19. We are very excited to share more
about the entirety of our robust pharmaceutical pipeline and long-term growth outlook at our business
review on November 18.

In our Medical Device business, we built upon a record number of 17 significant product introductions
in the first half of 2021 by introducing the INHANCE Shoulder System in the third quarter, a first-to-
market, fully integrated shoulder arthroplasty system designed to treat a broad range of cases in hospital
or outpatient settings where economic value and operational efficiency are important considerations. We
also announced results from a real-world study showing that the ECHELON CIRCULAR Powered Stapler is
associated with a major reduction in serious complications following colorectal surgery when compared
with manual staplers, reinforcing clinical evidence as a meaningful differentiator in product selection.

Let's transition to financials, starting with commentary on special items for the quarter. Other income
and expense in the third quarter includes a $2.1 billion charge of litigation expenses, primarily driven
by an incremental $1.4 billion charge associated with the recently announced qualified settlement fund
for current and future talc claims. The qualified settlement fund is intended to facilitate a final, equitable
resolution of all talc litigation in a structured manner through established bankruptcy law precedent.
Additionally, there is another $800 million legal expense in the quarter, representing final resolution of
outstanding claims related to RISPERDAL.

Another special item worth noting is on the in-process research and development line. We have a broad
offering across the digital robotic surgery landscape and continue to make meaningful progress in
advancing differentiated solutions across our portfolio. We are very pleased with the adoption of our
Monarch platform for lung bronchoscopy and are well on our way to expanding Monarch indications,
including initiating a clinical trial exploring the potential for localized drug delivery for the treatment of
lung cancer and submitting an application to the FDA for Monarch to be used in the treatment of kidney
stones.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

Our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee replacement is commercialized in the U.S., has received
several OUS approvals, and we are experiencing higher utilization on the systems placed to date than we
projected. We continue to be committed to the development of a general surgery offering with Ottava. But
as Sarah mentioned, we recorded a partial in-process R&D charge for $900 million in the third quarter. The
accounting for this charge contemplates a first-in-human delay of approximately 2 years from our earlier
projections of the second half of 2022, reflecting technical development challenges and COVID-19-related
disruption, including supply chain constraints being experienced broadly across all industries.

Clearly, we realize the importance that a differentiated digital robotic platform can have for patient
outcomes and the market. We continue to invest in and be committed to the platform, and we'll provide
updates to the external community as warranted.

Let's transition to a few comments on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash
flow with $15 billion year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $31 billion of cash and marketable
securities and approximately $34 billion of debt, resulting in $3 billion of net debt. Our financial position
and balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic,
value-creating way, consistent with our priorities that will benefit stakeholders over the long term.

Moving to our full year 2021 guidance. Given where we are in the year, our current assumptions around
continued recovery in medical device markets and confidence in the business, we are tightening our
adjusted operational sales range to 12.9% to 13.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a
constant currency basis, consistent with how we assess our business performance. This guidance also
incorporates the estimated $2.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccine sales, consistent with our July guidance. We
are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis
points, resulting in an operational sales range of 12.4% to 13.0% or $92.8 billion to $93.3 billion for a
midpoint of 12.7% or $93.1 billion.

As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative
to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.16, there's an estimated positive impact of foreign currency
translation of approximately 150 basis points, consistent with our July guidance, resulting in estimated
reported sales growth between 13.9% and 14.5% compared to 2020 or $94.1 billion to $94.6 billion.

Moving to other items of the P&L. Consistent with our previous guidance, you can expect our operating
margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year. Given year-to-date trends, we are
modestly increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $900 million to $950
million. Regarding interest expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, we are also tightening
the range of our estimate to $100 million to $150 million. And finally, we are lowering our effective tax
rate estimate to a range of 14.5% to 15.5% based on the occurrence of certain onetime, favorable tax
positions and settlements, both in the U.S. and abroad. Considering those updates, we are comfortable
with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $9.65 to $9.70 on a constant currency basis, a
guidance increase of $0.13 at the midpoint.

While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS,
our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share. Accounting
for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.77
to $9.82, an increase versus 2020 of 22% at the midpoint. Consistent with what we shared before, given
the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021 and, therefore, the
EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue.

As always, none of our achievements are possible without the hard work of our world-class team of
employees around the globe, whose dedication ensures that we deliver for all our stakeholders. We
continue to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of
everyone, everywhere. And I am grateful for their efforts and commitment.

I'd like to close my prepared remarks by briefly commenting on the CEO transition that was announced
earlier in the third quarter. First, I want to acknowledge Alex for his leadership and contributions to
Johnson & Johnson during his tenure. It has been my pleasure to work alongside him, particularly over the
last 3 years, and to observe and to learn from him, both professionally and personally.

I'm also pleased to congratulate Joaquin on his new role starting this January. I know firsthand that he
shares the same commitment to patients, employees and society that Alex considered core. Joaquin
similarly values innovation that underscores our strategy for long-term success. Both gentlemen will be
featured at the previously mentioned November 18 Analyst Day, sharing their thoughts on our business
and plans for the future.

I am pleased our worldwide chairs, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon and Jennifer Taubert, are here with
me today to address your questions. Jen McIntyre from our Investor Relations team will facilitate the Q&A
portion of the call. So I will now turn it over to her to begin the Q&A. Jen?

Question and Answer

Operator

Sure. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.

Christopher Thomas Schott
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I guess just first, can you just quantify or elaborate on the impact that the Delta variant had on 3Q results
and your guidance? I guess what I'm trying to get to was the impact you saw in the third quarter basically
in line with what you had contemplated in guidance? Or did we have upside elsewhere in the portfolio that
offset some of those slowdowns that you mentioned that hit part of the businesses?

And then just kind of maybe building on that, as we think out to 2022, I know you're not giving guidance
yet, but is there more in the way of COVID recovery that can aid growth next year as you think about the
portfolio as a whole? So -- and I guess what I'm trying to get to basically is pharma growth is sustainable
at these levels. And should we think about still device growth maybe above historic levels as we kind of
get COVID more in the rearview mirror a bit?

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Chris. So this is Joe Wolk. Let me answer some of it quantitatively, and then maybe I'll hand it over to
Ashley and Jennifer to discuss their outlook for their particular segments.

In terms of the guidance for the balance of the year as it relates to where we ended the third quarter, if
you look at what, I guess, has been labeled early morning here as a miss, I would say, I think about it in 2
categories: The vaccine quite frankly, and as you saw, we did not change the full year guidance. So that is
simply timing. We expect that to be fulfilled in the fourth quarter, and we're still very much committed to
the $2.5 billion of revenue and the supply that is correlated to that.

With respect to Medical Devices, I think we're very pleased that we had above 7% growth in the quarter,
given the different dynamics of Delta variant and hospital shortages. And we do anticipate that those
procedures will be recovered. It's hard to say whether they'll be recovered in the fourth quarter or early
next year. So that could provide some tailwind as you think about 2022.

But let me turn it over first to Ashley to comment on Medical Devices, and then to Jennifer to discuss
Pharmaceuticals.

Ashley A. McEvoy
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Medical Devices

Sure. Thanks, Joe. And thanks for the question, Chris. I would -- when I look at quarter 3, as we shared,
procedures across most categories in which we participated did decelerate through the quarter, primarily
due to, obviously, the Delta.

So if I take you a little bit around the world, Asia Pacific in aggregate continues to operate above pre-
COVID levels. However, COVID does continue to be a challenge with like mobility restrictions being
reinstated or remaining in places like Japan, Australia, Southeast Asia. China clearly is setting a new pace
for the world.

When we look in the United States, we saw procedure trends decelerate in quarter 3. You'll recall on our
quarter 2 call, we were feeling pretty good around 5% growth in procedures in May. We saw a stabilization
in June and July. In August, we saw the numbers of procedures dip around mid-single digit, and we saw
that continue into the early part of September. We are starting to see qualitatively recover from hospital
systems the past 4 weeks. When we look at early indicators of really filling the patient funnel, we look at
diagnostic procedures. In the past 4 weeks, we're seeing diagnostic procedures in the United States flat

relative to pre-COVID numbers. And as we talked about, we do expect some micro surges in areas like the
Northwest as well as the Midwest.

And then in EMEA, rounding it out, we are encouraged that countries are beginning to ease the strict
mobility restrictions and are really starting to resume procedures. Given the vaccine deployment
accelerations, the decrease in rates of new cases and hospitalizations and overall procedure volumes are
gradually improving. Like Spain, Italy, Germany are all above pre-COVID. The U.K., where I was just there
2 weeks ago, clearly below 2019. Long waiting lists, really working to go, make progress on that patient
funnel.

I'll turn it to Jennifer for any other commentary.

Jennifer L. Taubert
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals

Thanks, Ashley. Yes, so we've got a real positive outlook on the Pharmaceutical business. I think if you
take a look our third quarter results, we had clear double-digit growth across a number of our key brands,
including DARZALEX and ERLEADA in Oncology; TREMFYA, STELARA in Immunology; and OPSUMIT and
UPTRAVI in Pulmonary Hypertension. Those areas, we have seen strong recovery, and we believe that the
trajectory on those assets is really going to continue. So continued trajectory in '21 and into '22.

On the area -- part of the market where we're still seeing a bit of a slower recovery, but we're starting
to see it tick back, is really in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, the market where
IMBRUVICA is right now. From IMBRUVICA, we've just achieved double-digit growth ex U.S. But in the
U.S., it's actually been a little bit lower than that. And so I think that's one that as you take a look and we
move into 2022, we're anticipating to see some positive recovery there. But really strong results in 3Q,
and we anticipate continued strong trajectory through the rest of the year and into '22.

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Great. Thanks, Ashley and Jennifer. And Chris, I know you asked about Medical Devices and
Pharmaceuticals. But to be complete, Thibaut, I know you had a great success in the quarter, 6%, almost
9% when you compare it to Q3 of 2019. Maybe give a little bit of an outlook as to what you're seeing for
the balance of the year and into next.

Thibaut Mongon
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Consumer Health

Yes. Thank you, Joe. As you just said, the consumer segment continues to experience very strong
momentum. So we are very pleased with how the portfolio continues to perform around the world. Clearly,
this quarter, the star is our OTC segment, growing double digit with continued strong demand for trusted
brands in analgesics but also digestive health, continued demand in smoking cessation as well. So across
all categories and around the world, continued strong demand for our products.

As we get into Q4 and into 2022, we expect our portfolio of brands continue to be very well positioned
in the markets and categories in which we compete. Our brand -- many of our brands are iconic. And we
would expect continued growth for these brands around the world.

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Great. Thanks, Thibaut. Jen, back to you.

Jennifer McIntyre

Thank you for your question, Chris.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to just circle up on the announcements around the talc litigation and the process that J&J is
undergoing. Is there any way -- I know you're not going to talk about -- deeply about the strategy.
But just thinking about milestones for this process, and any way you can help us understand when this
strategy will be fully cleared and in play? And I guess, a stamp of approval by the bankruptcy courts. Or
how should we be thinking about this process through the rest of this year and into 2022?

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. Let me start this response by underscoring just our conviction in the
safety, based on decades of science that these products are safe. What we've done is acknowledge that
there's an established process that allows companies facing abusive tort systems to resolve claims in an
efficient and equitable manner. We initiated this process specifically for cosmetic talc claims, both current
and future.

And while we believe the cases lack merit -- and by the way, an overwhelming number of courts, juries
and judges who have opined on this to full adjudication ultimately agree with us, we did establish a $2
billion qualified settlement fund. But as you note in your question, Josh, it's really the bankruptcy courts
that will ultimately decide this. It's not plaintiff's attorneys. It's not Johnson & Johnson. But we do know
that based on prior experience, precedent, that claimants are far better off, and clarity and resolution is in
the best interest of all stakeholders. So we'll continue to monitor the process, but it will really beholden to
how the bankruptcy court decides to proceed and their time line.

Jennifer McIntyre

Thanks, Josh.

The next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just one for Ashley. Just Ashley, it looks like Q3 growth in devices relative to 2019 was about 4%. Could
you confirm that? And what are your expectations for Q4 relative to that metric, relative to Q4 2019 after
adjusting for 1 less week? I think people are trying to understand if Q4 growth could be better than Q3
on an underlying basis versus 2019. And how are you thinking about the staffing shortages and supply
constraints? I think Joe alluded to an inflation. How are you thinking about those factors that people are
concerned about in the device industry?

Ashley A. McEvoy
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Medical Devices

Thanks for the question, Larry. And before I get to quarter 4, let me just give a quick frame for quarter 3,
just so at a macro level. First is really the market. And while COVID-19 has temporarily disrupted the med
tech markets, we absolutely believe that the underlying foundation of these end-state markets continue
to remain attractive, really due to what we say are oodles of clinical unmet need and, quite frankly, the
overall state of the technology on the S curve.

A quick refresh is our standing and our competitiveness as the second largest med tech company with 11
platforms, delivering at least $1 billion in annual sales. We are very much focused on competitiveness and
innovation. In quarter 2, almost all of our priority platforms held or gained share. Some notables include
continuing to enhance our global market position in electrophysiology, biosurgery, gaining share in hips.
Seeing the impact of recent innovation in surgical vision, now seeing several sequential quarters of share
gains, and even seeing stabilization in knees year-to-date.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

So this is really about our focus on commercial effectiveness and our ability to deliver innovation. As Joe
mentioned earlier, in 2021, we had 17 new product launches to-date, and this is a significant amount over
last year. So year-to-date through 2021, Larry, we are tracking to 5% growth versus 2019. We did achieve
4% growth in quarter 3. Obviously, that's an improvement of how we exited 2019, the full year.

And then last, I would just say, you heard us talk a lot about digital surgery. We're absolutely committed
to leading in the future of surgery and making it -- our medical innovation smarter, less invasive and more
personalized. Joe talked a little bit about our Monarch reaching 10,000 patients this year, has a very rich
pipeline. VELYS knees is now approved in 5 countries. Our smart digital tools continue to scale.

And lastly, Ottava, our soft tissue offering, you heard us share, we're experiencing a temporary setback
in its development. Transformational innovation is all kinds of fun, I will tell you. It's highly complex, but
sometimes, we do experience technical challenges. But we are absolutely committed to resolving our
challenges, continuing to invest and bringing to market a competitive, differentiated offering as soon as
possible.

When we look at quarter 4, we do expect to see continued improvement. We do expect hospitals are going
to have to continue to manage through labor shortages. I don't expect that to get better in quarter 4
nor in 2022, but they've been quite masterful on how to manage patient flows. We are -- when I talk to
hospital systems over the past 3 weeks, in particular in the United States, they are ramping up again and
resuming elective procedures. We're keeping our eye on vaccination rates, patient sentiment, the cold
weather. But we do -- we are planning for a strong recovery in quarter 4 versus how we exited quarter 3.

Jennifer McIntyre

Okay. Thanks for your question, Larry.

Operator

Next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor.

Louise Alesandra Chen
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division

So I wanted to ask you about some of the management changes that were announced. And how we
should think about what could change or what could stay the same under a new CEO and CSO? And then
any anticipated changes to business mix between pharma, med device and consumer as a result of new
leadership?

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Louise, for the question. I'll try to address that one. What I would say is, first off, I'd probably
repeat the words I had both to congratulate Alex as well as Joaquin. Alex, clearly, on a stellar career, a
great run as his tenure as CEO. And he'll be a very active Executive Chairman, I suspect. It's not as if he's
riding completely off into the sunset.

Joaquin values the same principles that have made Johnson & Johnson successful. That's investing in
innovation and making sure that we've got differentiated products and solutions to improve the standard
of health care across the globe.

The nice thing about the transition is I don't expect any significant bumps. They've worked together for a
number of years. The strategies that they have talked about and that you'll probably see in the early part
of Joaquin's tenure have been contemplated with Alex in mind, and they've collaborated as Chair and Vice
Chair over a number of years. So I would expect, as the organization does, a very smooth transition.

With respect to CSO, we have not had a chance to acknowledge just really the impact that Paul has had
on the scientific community, not just here at Johnson & Johnson, but across the globe. He was a pioneer
in infectious diseases. When nobody had an answer for HIV, Paul emerged as clearly a leader there. And

14

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

then just most recently, his notable leadership on the COVID-19 vaccine, again, here at J&J, but also on
the global stage.

I think that probably the greatest testament to Paul's legacy is the fact that our R&D investment this year
is 23% higher through 9 months than what it was last year. And last year was a record-setting year in
terms of what we've invested in innovation. We've got a great team of scientists that Paul has assembled
over the years across all of our therapeutic areas, across all of our franchises. And I just look forward to
the success that they will continue to carry on, that Paul has really, I guess, cemented in terms of how we
approach our business.

Jennifer McIntyre

Louise, thanks for your question.

Operator

Next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.

Matthew Kelsey Harrison
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. I guess I was hoping you could focus a little bit on the upcoming BCMA CAR-T launch and just talk
a little bit about how you think about your capacity to supply that market and your preparations for that
launch.

Jennifer L. Taubert
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals

Sure. It's Jennifer. So we are really looking forward to our upcoming PDUFA date in the fourth quarter for
our BCMA CAR-T. This is going to be our first entry into cell therapy. And so the team -- the total team
from R&D to supply chain to commercial has been really, really invested in this asset over the past couple
of years, preparing to launch. I think the results that you've all seen and the really deep and durable
responses that have been proven through our clinical programs really highlight that this is going to be a
really meaningful and transformational asset for patients.

As we had been planning the launch, we're really taking a thoughtful approach to scaling our global
manufacturing, making sure that we're learning from those who've come before us. And that we're really
going to plan to deliver an optimal patient experience and a patient treatment or provider treatment
center experience as well as we scale up. So the team has been working very heavily on this, and we're
gearing up for what we believe will be a very successful launch for patients, hopefully later this year.

I also want to call out the very strong partnership that we have with Legend Biotech, where we've been
attached at the hip throughout. And we're so excited to be working in partnership with them to be bringing
that to market. So looking forward to a good launch later this year.

Jennifer McIntyre

Thanks, Jennifer. Matt, thanks for your question.

Your next question comes from Matt Miksic with Crédit Suisse.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So I have one for Ashley, just on the knee business in the U.S. and one quick follow-up, if I could, on
COVID vaccines. So Ashley, I think one of the things that was mentioned was sort of continued growth
and expansion around the knee business, if I'm not mistaken, in ASCs, and obviously, the VELYS launch.
If you could talk, maybe it's ASCs, I guess, in knees or something that we see some regional fluctuation
around the U.S. as to uptake, some areas stronger than others. And love to get your sense of how that's

15

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

progressing, where it's stronger and why. And how you see that playing out? And as I mentioned, one
follow-up for -- on vaccines.

Ashley A. McEvoy
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Medical Devices

Yes. No, thank you for the question, Matt. As Sarah shared, in quarter 3, knees grew 2% versus 2020.
And a lot of that was due to -- really twofolds: One is the state of innovation. So the VELYS knee robot is
obviously getting some nice traction. As Joe shared earlier, the utilization rates are very encouraging from
hospital systems that have adopted this new technology. That, coupled with a very proven, differentiated
to knee implant with a revision offering as well as a cementless rotating platform, have all really helped
shore up, I would say, our portfolio in knees.

And then you mentioned the channel, and we are seeing really healthy growth in the ASC channel. We
continue to be encouraged by our market share gains predominantly in joints in ASCs. And really, we
start to deploy what we call an Advanced Case Management, which is really how you simplify the pre-op
planning in ASCs. And that new Advanced Case Management service is starting to really take effect. And
we expect to have these new sites of care start to really improve, not just -- and take hold not just in the
U.S. but even in areas of Europe and really moving joints to more of a day surgery. Thank you for the
question.

Jennifer McIntyre

Thanks, Ashley. Matt, do you want to ask your vaccine follow-up?

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. Just we hadn't touched on it this call, but the sort of pivot to commercial. I would love to get
your sense of how we should think about timing and the sort of catalysts for that product becoming a
commercial product, whether next year or the year after.

Jennifer L. Taubert
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals

Yes. So we're really proud of the role that our vaccine is playing in really helping address the global
COVID pandemic throughout the world. And hopefully, you saw last week that the FDA advisory panel
unanimously recommended a booster for our COVID vaccine. We are in the process right now of
continuing under Emergency Use Authorization to roll out our vaccine across the globe, both in developed
markets as well as developing markets.

I think as the pandemic -- as we continue to work through and fulfill our existing contracts that we have
throughout the globe, and as we move into more of a booster market in later '22, potentially into 2023,
we'd be looking at moving into more of a commercial market. I know our R&D team is gearing up and
getting ready to file for full approval. I think we want to be moving into a full approval market for that
switch over to commercial.

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

And Matt, this is Joe. Just thanks for raising the point because I do think that underscores in that question
just the strength of our core business, right? So vaccines in and of itself this year is not for profit. As
Jennifer said, we'll rely on the science and the data to guide us how we proceed commercially.

But you should all consider that as upside to our base plan. We're so proud of the results that we've been
able to accomplish. The investment in R&D and just the strength of the portfolio, not just this year, but
how it really sets up for the balance of this decade I think is something that people should take away
from the call. I always smile a little bit whenever there's vaccine news because it seems to be overly
pronounced impact on our stock, good or bad. And it always just makes me chuckle a little bit because

the strength of our business is really in our Pharmaceutical, Medical Device and consumer strength these
days.

Jennifer L. Taubert
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals

Yes. And if I can jump in as well and just put in a commercial for our upcoming Pharmaceutical business
review. On November 18, we are really looking forward to having a comprehensive overview of the
business, our robust pipeline, featuring our therapeutic area leaders and also really outlining our long-
term growth outlook. So we're really excited.

I think at that meeting, we're planning for a great day, and we'll be highlighting a number, not only our
key therapeutic areas and delving deep in the pipelines, but also having a chance to feature a number
of the key assets that folks, I know, are really, really interested in learning more about. So everything
from CARVYKTI, our BCMA CAR-T; to nipocalimab that we got through our Momenta acquisition last
year; our new treatment for lung cancer and what we hope will be expanding to a much broader market;
RYBREVANT plus lazertinib; our retina portfolio; also things like our RSV vaccine and our TARIS drug
delivery platform for bladder cancer. And I could go on and on. But nonetheless, we're really planning for a
very exciting day on November 18, and look forward to having you all join us.

Your last question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

I just had a quick question, a follow-up to Ashley on the Medical Device business. And I'm just curious,
it feels like now, there might be a little bit more uncertainty around the pace of recovery. I just want to
be sure I'm getting that message correct. And you did mention that you didn't expect the hospital labor
shortages to necessarily improve as we go through Q4. So I was just curious about how to reconcile that
with a strong recovery.

Ashley A. McEvoy
Executive VP & Worldwide Chairman of Medical Devices

Yes. Thanks for the question, Danielle. I think what we're planning for quarter 4 is, I think we'll still
continue to see micro surges in cases. There'll always be little hotspots. Hospitals are still going to
experience some labor challenges. We don't see that getting better in the near term immediately. I will
qualify that though to say that they have been, quite frankly, masters at understanding how to manage
patient flow and procedure flow.

When we look at diagnostic and routine screenings and surgical procedures, we expect the trends will
continue to recover globally similar to the trends we saw in quarter 2, where surgical procedures grew
low single digit above 2019 baselines. As we've referenced, there are more procedural backlogs in the
highly elective procedures, like knees and spine. And we expect those to recover, although maybe not as,
in terms of hospital capacity, at levels significantly above 2019 in the near term.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19, 2021

But I would just say, going into November, relative to where we were entering November last year, we
are encouraged to look at the worldwide case data, to look at the worldwide hospitalization data, and the
freeing up of mobility restrictions. So we are encouraged by quarter-over-quarter performance from 2021
Q4 versus last year. You'll recall, we ended around 1.5%, Medical Device did in revenue versus 2019. So
we are anticipating a healthier recovery.

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

And Danielle, maybe just to clarify, too. It's a recovery, no matter what. It's just the intensity of the
recovery. So I would not expect, based on what we know today, any backward step with respect to Medical
Devices performance going forward across the industry.

Jennifer McIntyre

Thanks, Danielle, for your question, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest
in our company. Our apologies to those we couldn't get to today because of time, but please don't hesitate
to reach out to Investor Relations as needed. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing
remarks.

Joseph J. Wolk
Executive VP & CFO

Great. Thanks, Jen. So I hope you take away from the third quarter results as well as this call just how
broad our financial strength is, setting us up very well to close out 2021, but more importantly, 2022 and
beyond. We certainly do look forward to seeing many of you in New Brunswick on November 18, where
Jennifer, Mathai and a number of the pharmaceutical leaders will be featuring our product portfolio and
just how optimistic we are about the future. With that, I'll close the call and wish everyone a great day.
