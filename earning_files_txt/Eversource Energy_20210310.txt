Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Eversource Energy First Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. My
name is Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference
is being recorded.

And I will now turn it over to Jeffrey Kotkin. You may begin, sir.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's
Vice President for Investor Relations.

During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted this morning on our website. And as you can
see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined
within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are
subject to risks and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and
projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued this morning.

Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in
our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, our explanation of
how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures and how those measures reconcile to GAAP results is
contained within our news release and the slides we posted this morning and in our most recent 10-K.

Speaking today will be Joe Nolan, our new President and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Lembo, our
Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are: John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for
Finance and Regulatory; and Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.

Now I will turn to Slide 2 and turn over the call to Joe.

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Thank you, Jeff. We hope that all on the phone remain healthy and that your families are safe and well.

Over the past couple of years, I've spoken to many of the investors, who are on this call when I've joined
Jim, Phil and Jeff, at various industry conferences, including the last couple of EEI finance conferences.
I'm looking forward to meeting many more of you over the coming years and sharing my optimism and
enthusiasm for Eversource's future and excellent investment thesis.

I'm grateful to the Eversource's Board of Trustees and to Jim for allowing me to lead an incredibly
dedicated and high-performing organization. I'm also thankful that Jim will remain a full-time employee
of Eversource as Executive Chairman. In approving these executive level changes, the Eversource's Board
is signaling its confidence in our long-term strategy that focuses on our core regulated business with an
exciting investment in offshore wind.

We are in a world where customer service, safety and reliability have never been more important. We
will never forget that we would not be in the business without our 4.3 million customers. They are our
top priority. Customers pay the bills, and they deserve the reliable and safe utility service that we must
provide.

Over the coming decades, the tens of billions of dollars we will invest in our energy and water delivery
systems will be critical in helping New England prepare for a clean energy future, and we expect to be a
central catalyst for that clean energy transition.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

This morning, I want to cover a couple of topics associated with Eversource's energy initiatives and then
turn over the call to Phil. But first, I need to address our company's relationship with Connecticut. We
have thousands of employees in Connecticut who work hard each day to provide our 1.7 million natural
gas, water and electric customers with the most reliable and responsive service possible.

During emergency situations, which we have had far too often over the past year due to the historic storm
levels, they are working up to 16 hours a day for as many days as it takes to ensure that our customers
have their service restored promptly and safely, even in a pandemic. So I cannot tell you how painful it
was for me to read certain elements of the Tropical Storm Isaias decision that was released on April 28. It
did not reflect the hard work of our dedicated employees in the company I've been chosen to lead.

Our customers, PURA and our company all want the same thing, great service each and every day of the
year. And when there is a storm event, power restoration as safely and quickly as possible. The women
and men of Eversource work hard each and every day to meet these expectations.

The PURA order on storm response clearly identified areas for improvement. We know we have to work to
do not only our response plan, but also on our relationship with PURA. This was apparent from the April
28 decision and a subsequent notice of violation. I can assure you that we hear this loud and clear and
already doing all we can to improve on both counts.

Turning to our clean energy initiatives. You are probably aware of the climate legislation that
Massachusetts Governor, Baker, signed into law earlier this spring. Among many elements, the law will
allow each of the state's utilities to build up to 280 megawatts of solar generation. NSTAR Electric will
be able to increase its level of solar generation in rate base from 70 megawatts to 350 megawatts. As
Phil mentioned during our year-end earnings call, we have budgeted approximately $500 million for this
initiative from 2022 to 2025.

The other item with direct impact on us is a 2,400 megawatt expansion of Massachusetts offshore wind
authorization from 3,200 megawatts to 5,600 megawatts. This expansion will help keep the state at the
forefront of offshore wind development in the United States.

As you can see on Slide 2, there are now more than 10,000 megawatts of unawarded offshore wind
authorizations in Southern New England and New York with Massachusetts set to award up to 1,600
megawatts later this year. In fact, Massachusetts RFP was just issued on Friday of last week.

Our offshore wind partnership with Ørsted is very near in [AMI] high since I have overseen that
relationship and worked closely with our partner in recent years. It is an important element of our clean
energy growth strategy, and we have had a number of positive offshore wind developments already this
year.

Starting with Slide 3, in early January, the Bureau of Ocean Management (sic) [Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management], or BOEM, released its draft environmental impact statement on South Fork project.
Comments received by late February, and we expect to see a final EIS late this summer. BOEM is
scheduled to rule on our final federal premise for that project in January of 2022.

Assuming that the January date is met, we expect to begin construction early next year and complete the
project in late 2023. Additionally, in late March, the New York Public Service Commission approved the
necessary New York State siting permit for the project while the local town and trustees of East Hampton
approved the local real estate rights required for the project.

Turning to Revolution Wind. Late last month, BOEM released it's schedule for reviewing the 704-megawatt
project. The schedule calls for a final environmental impact statement to be issued in March of 2023,
and for a final decision on construction and operating plan by the end of July 2023. The release of that
schedule represents a significant step forward for this project.

Revolution Wind and South Fork are 2 of only 3 projects in the Northeast that have achieved that
milestone. Over the coming months, we in Ørsted, will be reviewing the BOEM in the state of Rhode Island
permitting process to develop a projection for the Revolution Wind construction schedule. Finally, we
expect to receive BOEM review schedule for our 924-megawatt Sunrise Wind project later this year.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

We continue to make significant progress in preparing for the commencement of construction. Over the
past couple of months, we have announced agreements with 2 critical ports that will serve as staging
grounds for construction. London, Connecticut will serve as a hub for turbine construction in Providence,
Rhode Island, will be the center for foundation construction. Enormous economic benefits will accrue to
these communities as a result of their role in our construction activities, including hundreds of direct jobs.

We are also very encouraged by the extremely positive signs we see from Washington. President Biden
has underscored his support for offshore wind construction along the Atlantic seaboard and has marshaled
multiple members of his cabinet to support it. The goal is to have about 30,000 megawatts of offshore
wind turbines operating in the U.S. by 2030. We expect to be a significant contributor to that output
through our partnership with Ørsted. Already, more than 1,750 megawatts are under contract to serve
load in Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.

Again, I look forward to speaking with many of you at the AGA Virtual Conference later this month. Now I
will turn over the call to Phil.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Joe. This morning, I'll cover a couple of topics. I'll review the results of our first quarter 2021 and
discuss -- and add to some of the regulatory developments in Connecticut and at FERC.

So I'll start with Slide #4 and noting that earnings were $1.06 per share in the first quarter compared with
earnings of $1.01 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results for both years included after tax costs
associated with our recent acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, and that's $0.02
per share this year and $0.01 per share in 2020.

Results for our Electric Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution segment showed the most significant
changes year-to-year. Electric Distribution earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of this year
compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Lower results were driven by
a couple of principal factors. The first is that we recorded a charge of $30 million or $0.07 per share,
primarily to reflect customer credits of $28.4 million and an additional penalty of $1.6 million to be
paid to the State of Connecticut. These credits relate to a notice of violation that Connecticut regulators
announced last week as a result of our performance in restoring power following the catastrophic impact
of Tropical Storm Isaias last August. The docket established by PURA to review the penalty is scheduled to
run through mid-July of this year.

Additionally, Electric Distribution results were negatively affected by approximately $20 million of higher
storm-related expenses in the first quarter of 2021, and that's compared to a pretty quiet and warm first
quarter in 2020. And in fact, in this quarter, we experienced 31 separate storm events across our 3 states
versus fairly limited activity in Q1 of 2020.

So by contrast, our Natural Gas Distribution segment showed a sharp increase in earnings because it's
now about 50% larger than it was a year ago. It earned $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2021
compared with earnings of $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2020, improved results were due
primarily to the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts, which earned $0.14 per share in the quarter.

In addition, we had higher revenues at NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, and these were partially offset by
higher O&M and depreciation expense. I should note that the transition process for Eversource Gas of
Massachusetts continues to progress extremely well. As we continue to migrate off of NiSource business
systems and onto Eversource platforms, reducing costs and improving service. To date, more than 80%
of the business processes have been transferred to Eversource from NiSource. Great progress has been
made. Eversource ownership of the distribution system is being well received by customers, communities
and employees. And we continue to meet or exceed the financial and operational targets we've set for
ourselves.

On the Electric Transmission segment, we earned $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared
with $0.38 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Improved results were driven by a higher level of
investment in transmission facilities, and this was partially offset by dilution of additional shares issued.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Our Water Distribution segment earned $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of
$2.1 million in the first quarter of last year. Improved results were due largely to lower interest expense
and a lower effective tax rate.

As you may have noticed, last month, Aquarion announced an agreement to purchase a small investor-
owned water system that is based in Connecticut, but also serves portions of Massachusetts and New
Hampshire. New England service company, as it's called, serves about 10,000 customers in the 3 states
and has a rate base of about $25 million. This acquisition is consistent with the growth strategy we've
discussed for our water delivery business. And assuming timely regulatory approvals, we expect to close
the transaction by the end of this year and for it to be accretive right away in 2022.

Rounding out the reconciliation, Eversource parent was down -- lost $0.02 per share in the first quarter of
2021, and that's excluding the Eversource Gas of Massachusetts transition cost, the same as during the
first quarter of last year. So $0.02 in each year.

As you probably noted in our news release and you can see on Slide 5, we are reaffirming our long-
term earnings per share growth rate in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. However, we modified our
current year 2021 earnings guidance to reflect the customer credits I mentioned earlier. We now project
EPS towards the lower end of the $3.81 to $3.93 range, and this includes the $0.07 per share impact of
the credits.

On the regulatory side, while our primary operating companies don't have any base rate reviews pending,
we have several regulatory dockets open in Connecticut, and I'll summarize the status of a few of them.

In addition to the penalty I described previously, PURA also identified a 90 basis point reduction in our
authorized distribution ROE. This is likely to be addressed in the current CL&P interim rate decrease
proceeding. Given the revised schedule that PURA released last week, we believe any ROE reduction would
take -- would not take place or take effect until October 1 of this year.

To help you size that impact, currently, CL&P's authorized ROE is 9.25%, and we have approximately
$5 billion of rate base at CL&P. Also on April 28, PURA finalized an interim decision on the recovery of
certain tracked cost by CL&P. This decision would result in a number of changes to those track costs that
would be implemented on June 1 with other modifications deferred until October 1. The interim decision
implemented a number of positive modifications to an earlier draft, and we appreciate PURA making those
decisions -- making those changes in its decision.

PURA also continues to review several other dockets, including potential for grid modernization initiatives,
including AMI, electric vehicle programs and storage. And the status of the major open PURA docket is
listed in an appendix to our slides.

Turning from Connecticut to Washington. We were disappointed last month in the developments around
the ongoing notice of proposed ratemaking concerning incentives that FERC has granted for many years
to utilities that participate in regional transmission organizations, or RTOs. FERC will be taking comments
and replies on the proposed changes over the next several weeks before deciding on a final order. I would
expect that the New England transmission owners and others will file comments opposing the change
which some see as being inconsistent with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and with President Biden's focus
on building out the nation's electrical infrastructure to bring more clean energy resources to market.

As a helpful rule of thumb, a 10 basis point reduction in our transmission ROE affects consolidated
earnings by about $0.01 per share.

In terms of financings, we completed $450 million of debt issuances so far this year, primarily to pay off
maturities at Eversource parent and at the Aquarion in Connecticut -- Aquarion company in Connecticut.
We've not issued any additional equity this year, other than through our ongoing dividend reinvestment
and employee incentive programs. However, as you know, and we've stated in the past, we continue to
expect to issue approximately $700 million of new equity through some sort of at-the-market program,
and that would occur at various points in time over our forecast period.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

In terms of our operations, we've gotten off to a very strong start this year. Electric reliability continues to
be in the top quartile of the industry versus our peers. Through March, our above-average safety record
improved even further with fewer employee injuries than we experienced in the first quarter of 2020. All 3
of our natural gas utilities are outperforming on their emergency response requirements, and Aquarion's
water quality is solidly exceeding its target.

So thank you for joining us this morning. I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Phil. And I'm going to turn the call over to Brandon, just to remind you how to enter questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Brandon. Our first question this morning is from Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

So my first question, you maintained the growth projections beyond '21 off of '20. So what is the offset to
the lower earnings in Connecticut related to the 90 bps ROE reduction?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Angie. Thanks for your call. And as you can imagine in our any forecast, it incorporates our best
results on a lot of key assumptions. So rates and ROEs, interest rates, CapEx forecasts, what we're looking
forward on in terms of O&M, et cetera. So incorporating each of those elements into the forecast, we're
comfortable in that upper half of the 5% to 7% range going forward.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then this incremental CapEx that you guys had proposed AMI, et cetera, in Connecticut, in light
of this reduced ROE, should we expect that you will potentially shift some of the regulated spending on
the regulated electric side away from Connecticut? I mean, if you could comment on your projections for
CapEx in Connecticut.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Our goal is to provide safe and reliable service and outstanding customer service to all our
customers, whether they be electric or gas or water, whether they be in Connecticut, Massachusetts and
New Hampshire. So our investment profile is geared to ensuring that those high standards can be met.
We're very proud of the results we've been able to put up year after year in terms of where our reliability
ranks. And then usually, it's in the top decile versus our peers.

So we're continuing to focus on our vegetation management and making investments there to ensure that
we have a reliable system. So that's the primary focus of how we determine the investments as to how it
impacts in a positive way, our customer service.

Agnieszka Anna Storozynski
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Great. And just last question about the Electric Transmission ROE. So I understand the RTO adder is still
up before debate. Now how about the resets of the base ROEs for New England in light of this proposed
removal of the RTO adder? Do you expect now that the base ROE will also fall?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Angie, that's a question that I've been asked for, I'd say, many years and many quarters now. And as
you know, we have 4 open docket -- open cases at the FERC on -- that really go back a decade, our oldest
one in terms of open dockets there. So it's hard to predict the timing or the outcome of what those cases
will show. So I'm not sure how exactly the FERC will look at the interplay between the incentive docket

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

versus the base case docket. But certainly, I think the thing that folks should keep in mind is something
I said in my comments, which is very public policy desires by the Biden Administration to electrification
and to bring -- connect clean energy resources. And there's no region of the U.S. that's connecting more
clean energy resources than New England. And obviously, we serve the primary load centers in New
England and can help deliver that clean energy, both from an offshore wind perspective, but also from a
transmission perspective.

So we'll have to wait and see the timing and how those play out, but I wish I had a crystal ball that could
predict an answer at this stage, but I don't.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question this morning is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just to clarify for 2021 guidance, Phil, are you incorporating the 90 bps reduction starting October 1
then in that guidance, the low end?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. That proceeding is underway now. And certainly, we would incorporate that outcome into the
guidance. So there's only -- if it was a quarter, if you say, it's October, that might be a $0.01 impact for
the year, Steve.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. Okay. Good. And then, Joe or Phil, you made -- Joe, you made the comment about kind of areas
to improve on your response plan and improving the relationship with PURA. Could you just give a little
more color on kind of how you're going to do that or just strategies there? And just you had open grid,
obviously, settle a lot of issues with pretty much all parties in your kind of profession. So how do you go
about that?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes, sure. Thanks, Steve. We've -- I spent a lot of time down in Connecticut. I spent several -- a couple
of days there last week. We're engaged with all of the communities that we serve. We're really focusing in
on their priorities, purest priorities. We obviously took that order. It's hot. It's a complex 150-page order.
There's areas that we know that, that we could use some improvement on, and that's what we're focused
on.

But I also did remind folks that the storm that equals an Isaias, we've never assembled that many crews,
2,550 crews, during a pandemic. It required double of everything, 6,000 hotel rooms, 14,000 meals a day,
double the number of trucks. So it was quite a unique situation.

And I think that we can always improve, and we will continue to work at that. And we want to win the
hearts and minds of our customers back in Connecticut. And obviously, we're sorry if we let them down
during that storm.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Maybe if I can throw the first question your way, Pivoting off of Steve's framework, how do you think
about performance-based rates here as an avenue to demonstrate change? And what's the time line for
implementation there? Do you see that as part of the next Connecticut case here? Just curious as to how
you end this 90 basis point impact, if you will.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Julien. It's Phil. In terms of just the mechanics, the performance-based rate docket is to be
opened by June of this year. So right now, there's no docket number, but the expectation is that, that
would be opened by June of 2021.

So we thrive on performance measures. I mean, our -- I think one of the keys to our success over many
years is we have a very aggressive performance management system. We measure and monitor all of our
key performance metrics, whether they be reliability, how frequently a customer has an outage, how long
the outage takes to restore, what's the safety performance of our employees, what's the diversity of our
workforce. So we measure many, many different metrics. And we perform well on them, whether you look
at comparison to kind of historical performance or where we fall relative to peer group. So performance is
part of our DNA, and I think we've delivered that. We have elements of performance-based rates in other
jurisdictions. In Massachusetts for many years, they've had these SQI or Service Quality Index measures,
where we've had to perform against and we've been very, very successful there.

So we -- but as you know, the design of those measures is important, and we would hope to work in a
collaborative and constructive way with PURA and other intervenors during that process. But the idea of
performance-based measures is something that we live with every day and the docket of that is -- the
docket for that is starting middle of this year.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And maybe to dovetail with that, just precisely, what is the expectation on when this 90 basis point
impact would roll off, if you will? I presume in tandem with the rate review or PBR or whatever it is, but
back to you on that.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Back to me. The decision itself said indefinite. So that's the only direction at this point, Julien, is that,
that wording in the order said that the 90 basis points will be indefinite.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Our next question this morning is from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just had 2 kind of Connecticut-related questions, really quick for your clarifications more than questions.
Just, Phil, there's a mixed bag in terms of the pass-through charges, some sort of going through or will be
effective June 1 and October -- and the other is October 1. Just high level, the impact or the cash impact
of that delay is a pretty miniscule. Am I thinking about that right?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I wouldn't say it's minuscule. I mean it's probably $150 million that would be spread out into the
future. So it's not insignificant, but it's not larger than that.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Got it, $150 million. And then just quickly, the -- roughly, I think the number is close to $270 million in
deferred costs, the Storm Isaias cost, when do we get a final ruling on that -- the recovery of that?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

So there's many states that have some costs that are deferred. With that, the largest is in Connecticut.
It's about $230 million of deferred storm costs related to Isaias. There were storm costs in Massachusetts
and New Hampshire also, but at a smaller level. So each state has their own protocol for timing of
when you go in and file for that. So we haven't developed that filing. We certainly have provided some
information on our cost during the previous docket. PURA had asked that we get the best estimate of what
we had seen to date. But unfortunately, we have some invoices that come in over time. And we have to
gather them all, make sure they're all accurate. We don't pay anything unless we've reviewed it 3x and --
I guess it's 4 ways from Sunday is the expression, but -- so we don't pay for things that are inappropriate
and we kick those back.

So we -- after we go through that process then we do a filing. So that filing could come in a future
proceeding. It could come in a base rate proceeding. It just depends on the various states. But I would
expect that those filings would be done over the next 1 year or 2 in the various states.

Next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is in -- going back to Connecticut, in the interim rate docket, there's been some
testimony filed about the allowed ROE, but also the equity layer and some of the parties suggesting that
the equity layer should be decreased meaningfully from the current 53%. Just curious on your thoughts
there and whether there's a way for you to potentially adjust the balance sheet to address this?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Insoo. Thanks for your question. Certainly, in ROE capital structure, all the revenue requirement
elements are part of any sort of kind of analysis that you would do. So those capital structure is one part
of it. And certainly, PURA has broad authority in a rate-setting process. So that's the framework that we
work within.

It hasn't been the practice in the past in Connecticut. It's been the practice to maintain the capital
structure for each of the subsidiaries in a way that's appropriate for that subsidiary to finance its capital
needs. We do that in a very disciplined manner. Obviously, we have rating agency considerations and any
change in sort of capital structure could have a positive or negative effect on ratings, just as regulatory
rulings have -- could have a positive or negative impact on ratings.

So we'll work collaboratively, constructively with PURA over whatever docket, these issues come up in.
But at this stage, the precedent has been that the operating companies would have their unique capital
structures that reflect their unique characteristics.

Don't forget, too, that at a parent company, that there's things that have nothing to do with the kind of
the customer rate issues. There's -- there could be investments like nonregulated investments, that's
where our offshore wind is financed. During construction, we financed that with debt. If you recall, sort of
painfully, I know -- I recall that we had a write-off of our Northern Pass transmission project that doesn't
impact customers, that goes right to the parent. So there's things that the parent takes that -- so to
protect the capital structure of the operating companies. But that would be something that would get
reviewed in any kind of rate-setting process.

Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Right. Okay. My other question is on offshore wind. And with Ørsted recently discussing some of the
structural improvements they need to make in some of the projects they have online, are there any read-
throughs or implications on like cost or construction planning process for the planned projects in the U.S.?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, we -- we're good on that. I think that -- in a broader case, if you look at, we've been closely
monitoring supply chain issues and you've got a pandemic. And our teams, both at our utility as well as
on the project, this is like priority #1 in terms of the supply chain. And this is where I think size really
matters, having the buying power of an Ørsted or having the buying power of an Eversource, and then
having the combined buying power really helps us to have relationships and schedules and multiyear
supply chain agreements that put us in good shape. So we haven't seen any significant impact at this
stage.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I wanted to switch gears to New England gas and the results there. And I'm just curious if the first quarter
results were influenced by any particular, developments that are not typical of the usual seasonality to
experience in the future. It seems like it's a very strong result. So I was wondering if there was any one-
offs or weather impacts there that we should consider going forward?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you for your question, Sophie. And so the subsidiary, when we purchased Columbia Gas of
Massachusetts from NiSource, we rebranded, renamed that Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. So that
Eversource Gas of Massachusetts is kind of the former Columbia Gas subsidiary. NSTAR Gas remains in
Massachusetts and Yankee Gas remains in Connecticut.

So I'll answer the question for Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. There's nothing particularly noteworthy.
It's just the operational results of that franchise delivered the $0.14 result. Just like our other gas
franchise, you can expect that the first quarter is probably going to be the strongest quarter that you see
out of -- because it's a heating -- a heavy heating quarter. And the fourth quarter is a heating quarter, not
as strong as the first quarter, but it's also a heating quarter.

Not a lot of heating going on in the second and third quarters in the gas business. So those tend to be
none -- there's nothing either small or limited contributions or even negative contribution in those months.
But the profile -- the earnings profile is very similar to NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, in terms of when the
earnings come in, and it was just from regular ongoing operations in that business. Nothing unusual.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question this morning is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just wanted to turn to offshore wind a little bit more if you might be able to provide a bit more
commentary. It seemed under the prior administration things have slowed a bit as far as the process,
and it seems like the opposite could be true with the new administration and things maybe moving a bit

faster. So just curious for your thoughts on that, if you see kind of potential for the things to move more
smoothly maybe than what the current outline is?

And then just with what you've received with revolution, and just any thoughts on when we might get
more color on CapEx or other project details, I guess, down the line, just looking for color on those
thoughts.

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. Thanks so much for the question. We've been -- obviously, it's been a breadth of fresh year, the Biden
Administration. We have had -- we have weekly meetings down there with various administration officials.
The White House hosted a meeting with the offshore wind developers, probably about 1.5 months ago.
They had 5 -- they had 4 cabinet secretaries and the 2 of the climate [advisors] on that call. And the focus
down there is what can we do to help move this agenda. We're already seeing decisions that are coming
out of there at a much faster pace than we've seen in previous administrations.

I just -- it's really been a sea change for this business, and we're very, very optimistic that the process will
move along much faster, and it will be much more orderly for all developers, not just for our projects. But
yes, it's been a sea change.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

In terms of the -- second part of the question in terms of construction investment, as you can imagine,
and we've said before, working with our partners, sort of the construction strategy, the investment
amount, sort of your -- I don't want to say that -- I guess the part of the competitive bid process is the
best way to say it, such that -- so we've been giving limited disclosure on sort of the CapEx base. And
there's an RFP coming up in Massachusetts. So obviously, we want to be able to look at that and put
ourselves in the best available position.

So I'd say that we have to get a little bit further down the road in terms of RFPs that are sort of in the
wind column before we would give out too many -- too much information that we would consider to be
kind of competitive interest in these bids.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just pivoting over to the water side. Curious, I guess, if you could refresh
us, how deep do you see the opportunity set there? Is this type of a pickup we should expect every year,
every other year? Or just looking for more, I guess, color on the strategy, how you see it coming together
at this point?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Well, our strategy in the water business, we've been consistent, and we've outlined that for the last
several years that we like the water business. We think that it fits very well with our clean energy story.
It fits very well in terms of our regulated infrastructure skill set. So we would -- we'd like to grow that
business, and we can grow it in a couple of different -- 2 or 3 different ways. Organically, through looking
at investments that we make in the system, we can accumulate small kind of roll-ups. We've done half a
dozen or 10 or so of those over the last few years or you could do something that is larger in scale and
scope, and not that this particular transaction is going to change the footprint so much of Aquarion, but it
does add 10,000 customers into the Aquarion family. And we'll look for opportunities that can do that.

We think there are opportunities that are out there, and we are active in evaluating those and then we're
active in searching out other opportunities. So we think that there's plenty of opportunities to be had. It
may not be just in the 6-state New England region. There could be opportunities in adjacent states that
would help increase that -- the number of customers for Aquarion.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

But I can assure you that our goal is not to just add customers. Our goals are always to do: One, there
has to be something in it for customers. We want to -- you don't want to get bigger just for the sake of
being bigger. What do you bring that can make for better customer service that can kind of lower cost to
customers over the long period of time and also be a deal that can be accretive on a financial side. So we
carefully -- we probably pass on more deals or lose out on more deals because of our discipline there, but
we'll continue to maintain that discipline in any business opportunity that we look at. It doesn't -- we don't
want to get bigger just to get bigger.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So can you hear me?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Paul.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So just to sort of come back to Connecticut, reading all these and it's a myriad of filings and orders and
what have you, I get the sense that there's sort of rate resistance there or concern about rates. And as
you guys have a -- they also want good transformation, and they want a lot of investment. So at least
that's how I'm seeing it, they want both these things. And I'm just wondering how you thread the needle
here or how do you picture this if -- on the one hand, there's a demand for more investment. On the other
hand, there seems to me at least to be whether it's what their comments on the Take Back the Grid Act,
just panoply of stuff here that they basically are apprehensive about rate increases or want lower rates.
How should we think about that? How do you think about it?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. I think when we look at the price per kilowatt hour rates in
Connecticut, I think it's important to highlight for folks just how clean and how carbon-free that power
is that's delivered in Connecticut. And you need to really strip out what portion of it is kind of not green
related, if you want to do a comparison across the country.

And I would say that the folks in Connecticut, really the folks in New England are getting a very clean,
green kilowatt hour. And these are initiatives that administrations and regulators have taken upon
themselves to bring to customers, and that's something that they need to balance. Obviously, there's
other things that they want to do down there. And I think it would only be fair that you break out what
really is the utilities and what is state mandates or regional mandates. And that's something I think we
work every day and trying to tell that story. But we're certainly very proud of kind of our initiatives as it
relates to a carbon-free future.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. But is there anything that we should think about in terms of potentially offsetting these rates or
I mean is there any -- I mean, it's one thing for them to be wanting green energy and everything and
another thing is actually wanting to pay for it. Is there any sense that we should get in terms of whether
or not how that might fall out, I guess, the 2 competing interests, so to speak?

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Sure. I mean, I think the biggest lever on that side would be energy efficiency. And as you know, we are
#1 in the country as it relates to energy efficiency. And I think what we're doing is helping our customers
use energy more wisely and reduce their consumption, which obviously will drive at that price issue. If
you're paying a little bit more, but we're helping you use less at the end of the day, the result was a net
savings. And that's what I think we're very, very good at, and we've obviously been recognized nationally
for that.

Phil, why don't you, if you want to add something, Phil?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Just one thing, Joe, on that, too, is our transmission investments are the investments we've made to
-- for increased reliability on our transmission grid really helped to lower kind of what congestion cost in
the region. So those are direct savings to customers as it flows through the kind of the energy part of the
customer's bill, for capacity market is down, things like that.

So those are the investments that we make in our transmission business are also helping customers.
So that's another way that bills can go down. And certainly, we don't -- we're sort of out of the supply
market. But certainly, as supply costs move down, that's a helpful benefit to customers.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I was just wondering, could you run through your latest outlook for equity needs here in light of some of
the moving pieces with earnings with ROE with track costs, et cetera?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, David. Our equity needs are the same as we've stated in the past, which is the total, let's call it,
$1.2 billion over 5 years. It's about $100 million a year through our dividend reinvestment employee stock
purchase type of issuances, that aspect is about $100 million a year. So if our forecast is 5 years, it's $500
million. And as I said in my remarks and we've stated before, over the course of our forecast period, we're
looking to do about $700 million of new equity through maybe some sort of aftermarket type of program.
So those needs at this stage have not changed.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Great. And I just wanted to double check, how much of the $0.07 from this quarter is one time or is
any of that recurring?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

No, that's just that it's related to the $30 million penalty, one time.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Great. I wanted to confirm.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 10, 2021

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I just wanted to clarify, does any portion of the Isaias penalty flow through the decoupling mechanism to
be deferred until the next base rate case? And what time -- what is the timing of the base rate case, next
one, for CL&P?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

So this is a direct credit to customers. There's no putting it back into the decoupling. This is a penalty
charge that goes back to customers. So this is -- flows directly back to customers. The timing of the next
proceeding would be when that PBR sort of mechanism, kind of maybe that kicks it off. But by statute,
so that we're ending a 3-year rate settlement that we had in place, we're required to file every 4 years in
Connecticut. So the next filing that we would look to do is next year in 2022 in terms of our expectations
of when we would file for new base rates in Connecticut.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. And a follow-up on Paul Patterson's line of thinking. I was thinking the same thing. I mean, does
this provide -- do you think the storm provides a boost to grid modernization in Connecticut as the state
continues to review that, maybe more of an opportunity for the utility going forward?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes, thanks so much for the question. So it does. I mean, there's a lot of dialogue actually in both
Massachusetts and Connecticut around grid mod, around AMI. We certainly have a seat at the table, and
we are fully engaged. And I do think there's an opportunity to demonstrate some of the technologies that
are available that would kind of: number one, empower our customers, but also enhance the grid to allow
for greater reliability and cost savings for our customers. So yes, I definitely agree that this should provide
us the platform.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. And can you remind us what you're assuming for FERC transmission ROE and the long-term
guidance? I remember you're fairly conservative. I think you have the current -- what you're currently
allowed, you're not going to have anything higher than that. Just curious what's in there.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. That's correct. The current allowed 10.57 base rate.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. I'd say it's striking just a year ago, right, the positive reaction from Massachusetts regulators,
right, and the governor, right, towards the company when they wanted you to take control of Columbia
Gas up there. And with what's happening in Connecticut, it's a striking difference across the company.
Hopefully, you can figure out a way to, I guess, get the Connecticut regulators to see it the same way that
they see you in Massachusetts.

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes, we agree. We're always sought after during natural disasters and crisises for our team to come in
and take care of business for folks across the country. So it obviously is disturbing when that takes place.
But rest assured that we will win back the hearts and minds of folks in Connecticut. It was a very unique

storm. And during a pandemic, folks had been kind of sheltering in place for many, many months. And
obviously, the loss of electricity and connectivity poses great challenges for folks, and we recognize that.
And we are going to do all we can to turn that situation around and have the same level of confidence that
folks have here in Massachusetts, certainly, when we get called upon for the Columbia Gas situation. And I
think that we can do that. I feel good about a path forward. So thank you for that question.

Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

You answered very comprehensively, most of my questions, but 2 quick ones for me. One on Connecticut,
does the PURA activity, both decisions and the ongoing stuff, does that take away any legislative actions
that were out there? Are there still any proposals on the legislation side?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. So yes, thanks, Travis, for the question. So the legislature, during this session, has really allowed
PURA to implement a lot of the stuff that they had done in the fall legislation. So we're not seeing any
activity. And right now, they are just trying to put the rules in place, and that's really what we're actively
involved in. So we have not seen any additional legislative activity other than some basic stuff around
maybe solar or storage.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Yes. Okay. Great. And then a quick one on offshore wind. With the schedule that you now have, what's the
flexibility in terms of technology? We're seeing technology develop almost daily in terms of offshore wind
efficiency and turbine size and stuff. What kind of flexibility you have in the next 2, 3 years before you
start putting steel in the ground to change that?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. So another helpful question. It's interesting. When you think of delay, everyone always thinks cost
increases. But I will tell you that in this business, the offshore wind business, it has been incredible, the
types of advancement in technology, turbine sizes. And I will tell you that our permits, all the permits
that we have filed, have that level of flexibility to be able to upsize. So I will tell you that delay in these
circumstances has been a very positive thing for our business. And we're very, very optimistic.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. So the EIS doesn't lock you in a kind of technology or anything?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

No. It's -- but it has caps on size. It's -- we can take it up to maybe a 14-megawatt, but that's the level of
flexibility up in that range.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

I know a number of folks have already moved on to the 10:00 call. So we'll end it here. Thank you very,
