Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the
IQVIA Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is
being recorded. Thank you.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nick Childs, Senior Vice President,
Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.

Nicholas Childs
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me
today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior
Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations.

Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our
webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section
of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management
during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. The actual results could differ
materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties
associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.

In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered
a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A
reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press
release and conference call presentation.

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today for our third quarter results.
Our strong momentum from earlier in the year has continued despite the resurgence of COVID-19 due to
the Delta variant. This has not had an impact on our operations as we have learned to manage through
these disruptions.

Our outlook for the longer term remains unchanged. The backdrop for the life science industry continues
to be very strong. Biotech funding continues to run at record levels. According to the National Venture
Capital Association, funding totaled $35.8 billion through September 2021, already exceeding the full year
of 2020.

The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all-time high with almost 3,000
molecules in active Phase II or Phase III development. Clinical trial starts are trending well ahead of
recent years, with the year-to-year date starts up 23% over 2020 and 13% over 2019. And finally, new
drug approvals by the FDA are keeping pace with the historically high levels of 2020, with 40 new drugs
approved year-to-date, which set the stage for a strong volume of upcoming commercial launches. The
bottom line is the dynamics in the industry are strong, and we remain bullish on our outlook for our end
markets and for IQVIA in particular.

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

As we think about our longer-term plans, I want to remind you of our upcoming analyst and investor
conference on November 16 in New York City. At that meeting, we will provide financial guidance for 2022,
ahead of our usual time line, which is normally coinciding with the end of year results in early February,
and we will share as well our midterm outlook and plans for the next phase of IQVIA's growth. We look
forward to seeing everyone and hope you can join us then.

With that, let's review the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter grew 21.7% on a reported basis and
21.1% at constant currency and was $64 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The beat was
driven primarily by higher pass-throughs, which, as you know, dilutes our margins somewhat, as well as
by stronger organic revenue growth.

Third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 20.5%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as productivity
measures. The $8 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger
operational performance.

Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 grew 33.1%. That was $0.07 above the midpoint of our
guidance, with the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through as well as favorability in below-
the-line items.

Let me now provide an update on the business. Our real-world evidence business continues to take a
leading role in informing health care. In late September, the FDA released their draft guidance on how
electronic health records and medical claims data can support regulatory decision-making, and it cited
several IQVIA publications.

With the growth of rare disease therapies and personalized medicine-driven trials, the number of single-
arm clinical trials increases every year, and external competitors provide important context for these
studies for both regulators and payers. Our clients recognize our leading expertise in this area. For
example, we had a recent major win to deliver an external comparator in a cardiovascular study for a
top 20 pharma client. In another example, we were awarded a 15-year follow-up study to demonstrate
the long-term effectiveness and safety of a newly launched gene therapy. Regulatory guidance requires
extended follow-up for patients exposed to cell and gene therapies. And IQVIA's innovative real-world
capabilities combining direct-to-patient solutions as well as IQVIA's technology platforms to capture
secondary data was pivotal in this award.

On the technology front, our suite of offerings continue to be adopted in the marketplace. You are familiar
with our OCE platform and other commercial technology applications. And we have, of course, continued
to expand our footprint here. We have 10 new client wins in the quarter, bringing the total number of OCE
wins to date to 169 customers.

But we are also very excited to see increased adoption of our Orchestrated Clinical Trials suite, OCT. This
quarter, for example, a leading biotechnology company in Asia selected our site portal module within OCT
to power site engagement across all of their trials. We now have 165 customers that have bought the site
portal module, representing 155,000 sites and 1,716 active studies that are using our site portal module.

Similarly, our award-winning eCOA platform continues to experience strong demand. We have successfully
deployed over 150 projects across 35 different therapeutic areas. To date, we have over 70 customers
using this platform, including 8 of the top 10 pharma clients. The platform has processed over 10 million
unique patient responses in 65 countries and across 28 languages.

Now I want to say a few words about a fast-growing part of our industry. You're familiar with Decentralized
Trials or DCT. The IQVIA Decentralized Trial offering combines several tech modules within our OCT suite,
including eCOA, eConsent, telemedicine and connected devices as well as other service capabilities,
including home nurses and phlebotomists, along with our Decentralized Trial patient concierge and
study coordinators, all organized around our Decentralized Trial platform. Importantly, we've developed
innovative clinical patient engagement offerings, including direct-to-patient services, to accelerate
recruitment and improve patient diversity and inclusion in clinical trials.

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

When we step back and look at the growing importance of DCT in our own portfolio, we find that up to
30% of our active full-service trials utilize one or more components of our DCT offering. Incidentally, when
our competitors speak about their own DCT offerings, this is often what they report as their DCT business.

When we look at trials that actually fully utilize our DCT capabilities, meaning they are fully run on our
Decentralized Trial platform, we've been awarded 89 trials to date totaling over $1 billion. These awards
are with 34 unique sponsors, of which 10 have multiple decentralized trials ongoing with us. These trials
span 12 different therapeutic areas, 32 unique indications and have recruited over 200,000 patients in 40
countries. Our ability to combine advanced clinical technology with an extensive network of investigators
and care professionals differentiates us in this space and makes us a partner of choice for decentralized
trials that utilize the full capabilities.

Our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum. We had approximately $2.6 billion
of net new bookings in the quarter, bringing our LTM net new bookings for the first time to over $10
billion including pass-throughs. This resulted in a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.39, including pass-
throughs; and 1.28, excluding pass-throughs. At September 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was
1.38, including pass-throughs; and 1.37, excluding pass-throughs.

Our contracted backlog in R&DS, including pass-throughs, grew 12.7% year-over-year to $24.4 billion at
September 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up
$300 million sequentially versus the second quarter.

As we have signaled several times in the past, we've ramped up investments in our lab capabilities.
We recently announced the opening of our new 160,000 square foot Innovation Laboratories in North
Carolina. This facility provides customers with access to cutting-edge bioanalytical, vaccine and genomics
capabilities, along with an expansion into exploratory human biomarker discovery services. These new
services will enable us to partner closely with sponsors in the development of essential biomarkers to
support new molecules moving into clinical development and throughout the life cycle. And this expansion,
of course, comes on top of the investment we announced last quarter in our 130,000 square foot facility in
Scotland.

I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.

Ronald E. Bruehlman
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. I will start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue
of $3.391 billion grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue
was $10.238 billion, growing at 27% reported and 25% at constant currency.

Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.337 billion, which was up 10.8%
reported and 9.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was
$4.38 billion, which was up 17.6% reported and 14.9% at constant currency.

In the third quarter, R&D Solutions had revenue of $1.853 billion, up 32.4% at actual FX rates and 31.9%
at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, third quarter R&DS revenue grew 24.7%
year-over-year. Year-to-date, revenue in R&D Solutions was $5.612 billion, up 37.7% reported and 36.2%
at constant currency.

Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, or CSMS, revenue of $201 million was up 12.3% reported and
12.8% at constant currency. Year-to-date, CSMS revenue was $588 million, growing 6.5% reported and
5.1% at constant currency.

Now let's move down the P&L to adjusted EBITDA, which was $728 million in the third quarter, up 20.5%.
Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion, growing 33.1% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net
income was $261 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. Year-to-date, we had GAAP net
income of $648 million or $3.32 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $423 million for
the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 33.1% to $2.17. Year-to-date, adjusted
net income was $1.264 billion or $6.48 per share.

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Turning now to the R&D Solutions backlog. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another
outstanding quarter of net new business. Backlog now stands at $24.4 billion. In the last 12 months, net
new bookings include -- including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion.

Okay. Turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and
debt was $12.2 billion. This resulted in net debt of $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at September 30
came in at 3.65x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.

Cash flow was again quite strong in the third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $844 million. And
with CapEx of $162 million, this resulted in free cash flow of $682 million. This third quarter performance
brought our free cash flow year-to-date, that is through the first 3 quarters, to almost $1.8 billion, which
continues the strong improvement trend we've had over the past 3 years. In the quarter, we repurchased
$125 million of our shares, which leaves us with $697 million of share repurchase authorization remaining
under our latest program.

Okay. Let's turn to guidance. As you saw, we're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $188
million at the midpoint, this reflecting the third quarter strength in the continued operational momentum
in our business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.775 billion to $13.850 billion, representing year-over-
year growth of 21.3% to 21.9%. I'll note that included in this guidance is a $30 million headwind from FX
versus our previous guidance. Now looking at the comparison to the prior year, FX is a tailwind of about
120 basis points to full year revenue growth.

We're also raising our profit guidance as a result of a stronger revenue outlook. We've increased our full
year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.980
billion to $3 billion -- $3.010 billion rather, which represents year-over-year growth of 25% to 26.3%.

Moving down to EPS. We're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. The new
guidance range is now $8.85 to $8.95, which represents year-over-year growth of 37.9% to 39.4%. Now
our full year '21 guidance assumes that September 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the
balance of the year.

Of course, the full year guidance implies a fourth quarter guidance, which we show here. And before
getting to the numbers, I'll say, for context, you'll probably recall that last year's fourth quarter was
unusual due to a snapback in the general business as we rebounded from the effects of COVID-19, picked
up incremental demand from mega vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within
TAS.

Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.537 billion and $3.612 billion, representing growth
of 7.2% to 9.5%. FX in the quarter is a headwind to growth of about 100 basis points. We expect
fourth quarter TAS revenue growth to be mid-single digits, reflecting the expected year-over-year
decline in government COVID-related work and the FX drag. I'll note though that underlying constant
currency organic growth for TAS will be in the high single digits, which is the level that TAS has recently
accelerated. R&DS revenue growth will be in the low teens, with services growth in the mid-teens despite
last year's difficult comparison due to the COVID vaccine work. CSMS will be slightly down.

Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $786 million and $816 million, up 6.9%
to 11%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.37 and $2.47, growing 12.3% to 17.1%.

So in summary, we delivered a very strong third quarter with strong results on both the top and bottom
line. R&DS backlog improved to $24.4 billion. That's up 12.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue
from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. We
reported another strong quarter of free cash flow, which at $1.8 million through the first 3 quarters of
the year, is a marked improvement over prior year. And finally, we are once again raising our full year
guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.
And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.

John Charles Kreger
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Ari, thanks for all the detail around the OCT and DCT offerings. That was great. Curious, if you could just
take that one step further, what do you think the operational implications are for you guys and your clients
as you see greater adoption of some of these newer technology tools?

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean, operationally, obviously, you know that one of -- the single most important challenge we
and actually the entire industry has is the ability to deploy people, again, the strong book of business that
we've all generated. And so this is a great development because what DCT does is it kind of increased
productivity, reduces labor and enables us to essentially execute more efficiently. So I think operationally,
we are just adapting to this.

Now again, the full productivity only comes when the trial is fully a decentralized trial as I explained
because there's a lot of confusion in this space. As soon as someone uses a digital platform, they say, well,
we've got a decentralized -- a DCT award here, but that's not the case. Now if we do that, as I mentioned,
about 30% of our full clinical trials, which is just -- probably we have a little bit under 1,000 trials that are
full-service clinical trials ongoing. So it's a larger number that already utilize one or several of our DCT
modules, eConsent or eCOA or other connected devices.

Our clients are experimenting with smaller trials and trying the full DCT platform, which puts together all
of the capabilities and the maximum utilization of the digital tools that we have at our disposal. I think
hands down, I believe we are leader in this space.

John Charles Kreger
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Sounds good. And one quick follow-up on staffing. Obviously, we've -- there's a lot of talk about a tight
labor market. Is that proving to be any sort of a headwind for you guys on EBITDA margins? And have you
seen your staff attrition rates change at all as we've moved through this year?

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

I mean there's no question about it. It's not a secret. This is true across industry sectors in -- and in
our sector, in particular, since we have such a strong industry backdrop. There's a lot of competition for
talent. We have -- all of the peers in the CRO space are a hunting ground for talent. So obviously, we are
responding. We are actively recruiting and hiring to meet this demand. We recruit dozens of employees
every year. So we've got whole talent acquisition capability that's global and that's active. Does it create
cost pressure? Yes. And it's already included in our guidance. That's certainly a headwind.

But as you well know by now, hopefully, you know that when you look at our overall results, you see that
there has been margin expansion despite these cost headwinds. In fact, even when you see in this past
-- in this Q3 results, that our operating margins are flat to slightly declining. When you actually take out
the pass-throughs, you actually see that our margin -- operating margins expanded quite nicely, and
this is despite the cost headwinds that we have. So yes, it is a headwind, and we are dealing with it and
offsetting with the usual productivity and efficiency programs that I hope we've been demonstrating we're
good at. Thank you very much.

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

The next question is from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I have a couple as well. First one, I think the #1 inbound this morning is on your M&A spend in the
quarter. Obviously, a much higher number than we were anticipating with the Myriad deal sizing being
known. I'm curious if you could address that in a couple of ways: one, the type of deals, nature of deals,
number of deals but also what impact you expect on a revenue basis, both in the fourth quarter; as well
as any thoughts on the run rate of the companies that you've recently acquired. And I might have a
follow-up as well.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. So let me take the latter part of your question first. In the quarter, the contribution of M&A was
minimal. I mean maybe a little over 1 point. And that's the same basically for R&DS and for TAS.

Nicholas Childs
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

That's correct.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

In the fourth quarter, Nick, a little bit more than that? 1.5?

Nicholas Childs
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Yes. In the fourth quarter, total company, we're a little over 1.5 points.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. 1.5 points of contribution to our revenue growth. Now yes, we had a big spend this year. It's going to
be lumpy. We always say acquisitions is binary. It happens or it doesn't happen. I will note that we didn't
spend very much last year. I think in the entire year, we spent $177 million. And there are quarters where
we spent $10 million or $50 million. And this quarter and this year, actually, we spent quite a bit more
money.

As you know, the largest acquisitions we've done is simply the consolidation of our joint venture request in
the lab business, and that was a $760 million transaction we did in the second quarter. So that represents
really a very large portion, almost half of the spend to date.

In the quarter, we were very active. We were -- we actually closed only a handful of transactions. The 2
largest account for the vast majority, let's say, almost 90% in sales, something like that, 80% to 90%
of the spend. It's 2 transactions only. One is the Myriad RBM lab, which we had announced during our
second quarter earnings, and it actually closed in the third quarter. It's a lab that performs sophisticated
biomarker detection and testing. It supports early- and late-stage drug development in very specific
therapeutic areas, oncology, CNS and immunology.

We also purchased DMD. DMD is a leading provider of analytics and digital marketing solutions to health
care professionals. It brings advanced tech-enabled analytics and insights for intelligent omnichannel
marketing, and we consider that acquisition to be a strategic asset. And yes, it did come with a lot of --
it costs quite a bit. So these 2 transactions, again, is basically the bulk of the spend. You have a second
question, right?

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Yes. Just a clarification on the first one. So the last one, I think you said DMV, if I understood correctly.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

DMD.

Nicholas Childs
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

As in David.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

David, yes.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

DMD. Okay. Got it. And then is that actually a CSMS segment deal? Or is that a Tech & Analytics deal?

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it's a Tech & Analytics deal.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then my follow-up is my typical burden on you to talk about COVID contributions in 3Q for
revenue and bookings, specifically in R&DS but also other segments as necessary. If you could update on
the backlog of COVID work in total in R&DS and then talk about bookings in 3Q related to total COVID-
related activity, it would be great.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean we -- as we think, COVID work is obviously going to -- it continues a little bit. There is a tail
to it. But certainly, on the TAS segment, it's a significant step-down. We had signaled this before. The
government-related COVID work is gradually going away and certainly will step down dramatically in the
fourth quarter and going forward. And we're just going to return once you eliminate the noise of what that
happened last year.

The TAS underlying organic growth rate is in the high single digits. If you remember, TAS historically was
in a mid-single-digit grower and in our investor conference in June '19, we said that TAS would accelerate
to high single digits, and that's where we've been most of the year. We've told you that when we reported
prior quarters that the TAS growth rate included significant COVID-related work. And excluding that, the
growth rate was in the high single digits, and it remains so when you take out the noise of the compares,
et cetera. On the R&DS, can you give us the numbers?

Ronald E. Bruehlman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Look, first, we like to look at the contribution of COVID to the backlog. And if you strip out the
mega vaccine trials, Eric, from the backlog of R&DS, it's less than 5% of the backlog. If you take out all
COVID-related work, it's less than 10% of the R&DS backlog.

And you were asking about the contribution of COVID to revenue, I think, too, in the quarter. And look,
R&DS had very strong growth, even excepting the COVID-related work. If you take out the large, fast-
burning COVID work, you were in the high 20s for R&DS revenue growth. And even if you take out all
COVID-related work, you were still strong teens growth. So COVID did contribute, of course, and the

10

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

work will trail down over time. But the underlying business in other therapeutic areas is very strong and
ramping up as we go forward in R&DS.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Wanted to continue on the COVID conversation. But looking at the TAS business, I think you referenced
when talking about the fourth quarter guidance some headwinds versus the prior year. But could you just
maybe talk a little bit about how you feel like the longer-term durability of COVID work in the segment?
Just your thoughts around that?

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Again, there's no headwinds in the fourth quarter for TAS. The growth rate is slower simply because
it's a mass question. We're comparing last year's fourth quarter, which was -- which included the COVID
work with the -- and a bunch of noise with the fourth quarter here, which eliminates that noise. Again,
when you eliminate all of that, the underlying organic growth rate for TAS is high single digits in the fourth
quarter. So there is no headwind in the underlying business, and we expect that trend and momentum to
continue.

We will, as you know, provide -- we generally provide guidance on the year concurrent with the release of
our fourth quarter earnings. Last year, because it was such an unusual year, we decided to give guidance
for 2021 concurrent with the release of our third quarter earnings. This year, we plan to do it at our
November investor conference, which is just 3 weeks away.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Great. And I don't want to steal any thunder from the Investor Day a few weeks from now, but just
curious if you could talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes for 2022. The funding environment,
as you referenced, seems very strong. Are there any takes that you would consider? And then the one
thing that stands out to me is pass-throughs. They've obviously been elevated this year. Just any color
around how that might phase in the next year would be helpful.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I mean, look, it's always important to put things in context and look at the longer-term trends as
you're asking. And if you go back to June '19, we gave a 3-year set of targets for revenue, profit, EPS,
capital deployment, leverage, et cetera. Now no one could have predicted then that 6 months later, we
would be starting the pandemic and we would have such disruption across the world for all businesses and
including for ours.

But when you -- and I think people like to look at '19 to '21 to kind of try to eliminate COVID. I don't think
that's fair because the whole COVID effect is not gone yet because you still have these disruptions that I
just talked about. I think it's important to look at the 3-year '19 to '22 time frame. And if you go back to
the targets we gave, we certainly are running ahead, actually well ahead of the growth rates we predicted
for 2022. We are ahead of that. And a little bit of this is because of COVID and the pass-throughs that you
just referred to.

But even if you strip that out, we're still ahead on every single one of the metrics. Now I don't know if
you were at that conference, but as you're doing now and as your colleagues are doing, trying to push me
for even more precision on what the numbers would be, I said then that I was hoping to exit 2022 at a
10% growth rate for the company. Now I've said before, earlier this year, that we reached our end of '22
targets in '21. And I believe that, that momentum will continue into '22. So that's all I can say, and I have

to wait for more precision in 2, 3 weeks. But I totally seated here, feel very, very confident that we will
certainly exceed those numbers that we gave you 2 years ago and set the stage for further acceleration
beyond.

Your next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.

Shlomo H. Rosenbaum
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Ari, can you talk about where you are in general with the OCE implementations, particularly with like
Roche and AstraZeneca? Have you gotten to the point where the implementations are not a significant
drag on the margins that you have to offset in other areas? And just where are you seeing the business
progress in terms of hitting kind of a steady state of revenue or revenue exceeding the cost to implement?

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

I mean you bring up a good point, implementations are very costly. And because we have a large number
of wins, and I referenced an additional 10 new wins. So every time we win a new award, again, you have
to implement. So it's not like when you are behind the curve of implementation and start generating the
license revenue, you still have to implement the new one that you sold, and we're happy we did. So we're
not past that headwind, if you will, in terms of the implementation costs. That's a significant drag, and
we've not seen yet -- we haven't passed, if you will, that inflection point where you're now essentially
plateaued, your market penetration, and you're essentially sitting tight and collecting license revenue from
all these installations. We're not there in aggregate.

Shlomo H. Rosenbaum
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then just maybe this one's for Ron. The free cash flow was incredibly strong. Something -- just
more this -- 33% more than you had all of last year, which was, I think, a record quarter. Could you talk
about what's going on? There was a significant increase in unearned revenue and some other working
capital changes. And how should we be thinking about this on a go-forward basis? Obviously, very healthy
numbers. Is this something that you can keep up? Or is it -- or adjusting and catching up on some of the
working capital items?

Ronald E. Bruehlman
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Shlomo, we've made a really concerted effort internally here to improve our processes around
receivables, which, of course, is one of our largest classes of assets. We don't have inventory like you
would in a manufacturing firm. Receivables are really where we have a lot of our assets other than our
deferred software investment.

And that's been -- our efforts have been on several fronts. First off is collecting on time. We had a -- go
back a little while, we had a large amount of overdue receivables. And that's just kind of focus, to go and
collect what's due from us.

The next is billing on time. I mean we had a large amount of unbilled receivables. And that comes down to
internal processes about billing more quickly, more -- in a more timely fashion. So we get paid in a more
timely fashion.

And of course, the third that you mentioned is the deferred revenue that the customer advances that
we get. We again made an effort internally to negotiate contracts with our customers so we get paid
more upfront so we're not out of pocket, and this has helped substantially. And I expect all 3 of those to
continue to be a driver of strong cash flow in the future.

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Now of course, having said that, cash flow is lumpy. Quarter-to-quarter, it's difficult to predict. And you
do get instances where you'll get an unusual amount of advances because of some of the work you're
doing that will burn out off over time and then rebuild up. So I would urge you not to focus too much on
the quarter-to-quarter. But yes, what you're saying is that fundamentally, we've improved our collections
processes and improved our underlying free cash flow generation as a result.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean if I just might add to that, we're very pleased with the performance, but let's be honest. This
was a bad point for us. And I think some of you had pulled that out, the past 3 years or so, our cash flow
performance was simply very poor. So the fact that we are now performing very well is not an unusual
thing.

I mean I think not too long ago, in 2018, we generated just barely over $600 million of free cash flow
for the entire year. And here we are, 3 quarters into the year, we've already generated 3x that number.
Obviously, we are a much bigger company and so on. But look, the outperformance was just not good.
And we said that, and it was on us, and we worked on it, and we will continue to pay attention and have
the right metrics and the right incentives and the team focused on it. And as always, when you shine the
light on something, it improves. And that's what will happen here. And where we are now is the normal,
not unusual.

Your next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to follow up on, I believe, a John Kreger question around DCT. He asked around operational. Ari,
I wanted to ask around financial as it seems like you now have a pretty substantial number of trials where
you're running pretty fully on your DCT platform. I'm wondering if you could relay to us what -- how that
changes the dollar value of a trial. And does that give you the opportunity to garner more margin in that
trial because of the technology-enabled efficiency?

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean, look, there's a high degree of interest from clients, okay, around how to operationalize DCT,
and it's not like it's going to overwhelm and all of a sudden become 100% overnight. As I said, large
pharma, in particular, is experimenting. A lot of trials are using one composite or the other. So it's going to
take time. So this is not next year or the year after that we're going to have to face the issue that you're
raising.

In our experience, customers are struggling with how to make various point solutions fit together. So we
are actually very -- being very aggressive here. We want to move to DCT. We've said this since the merger
we got 5 years ago, we want to accelerate and not slow down technology introduction and changing the
model.

Now obviously, the question you asked is the question people asked of us many years ago, which is as
you seek to replace labor in a model that -- where pricing is largely based on labor inputs, then aren't you
lowering the value of the trial and the -- and et cetera? What are the implications on margin?

So we don't believe so. We have -- as you know, we've had a long-run effort to switch pricing to value and
deliverables and outputs. That's number one, and that has made substantial progress. Our clients are not
really looking at saving a couple of pennies here or there. They're looking at getting what they need -- the
answers that they want faster, more efficiently with less error and with higher quality. And they are willing
to pay a premium for that. Now they're not going to pay more than what they were paying before, but
they're not going to pay less than what they're paying before.

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

And so now the margin implication is correct. Over time, the more we deploy technology, the less we need
people, the more there's going to be margin accretion. But again, this is going to take time. There are also
new delivery roles, which offset some of the reduced CRA visit activity.

So I think it's too early to comment on the exact margin impact for this overall. We are monitoring -- we
do not anticipate this to disrupt our margin performance. R&DS is a very long-cycle business. We have --
I mentioned 89 fully decentralized trial ongoing that we won. But we're working on -- if you look at, as I
said, just under maybe 900 to -- or so full-service trials. So it's a fraction of that.

As you look at the total trials we are involved in, it's over 2,500 clinical trials that we're involved in
globally. So it does take some time to penetrate. It's a slow-moving business. But it's a good point. We are
totally focused on it. We do not anticipate a margin -- I'm sorry, a value deterioration. We do anticipate a
margin accretion over the long term.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. If I could ask a second follow-up around a question on COVID. It seems like a lot of focus on how
much revenue now and how much in backlog now. It seems equally important to me, if not more so, to
focus on how that will phase out. And I think you've made comments in the past that you see projects
booked out through '22 and maybe even into '23. Would it be appropriate to call the COVID contribution
kind of a soft landing, so to speak, that it's not going to drop off, it's just going to slowly taper over time?
Is that the right way to think about it?

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

On the R&DS business, absolutely. No question. What you said is exactly what I would say. It's a soft
landing, '22, '23, and it -- frankly, we get lost in the rounding, by the time we get to '23. Unless, of
course, God forbid, there is another variant or another COVID or another -- but right now, as we see
based on what we know today, it's a soft landing. We get lost in the rounding by '23.

Operator

Your last question is from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Can you comment on trial site operations? Are there any continued bottlenecks you flag? Or is site activity
normalizing?

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Go ahead, Ron.

Ronald E. Bruehlman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Look, the site accessibility numbers remain around 80% or so. But look, we've managed to work
around that and operate at close to normal. And not all sites are equal. The larger sites are open, and that
hasn't been an issue for us. We've seen site start-up and patient recruitment at near prepandemic levels,
not quite, but near prepandemic levels.

The patient visits are still lagging a little bit, just gradually coming back. And so when we look at
our overall operations, we're not totally back to prepandemic level yet. And we'll expect a gradual
improvement over time back to prepandemic level, but it really hasn't been a major issue for our
operations. As Ari mentioned in his opening remarks, we've learned how to manage through and around...

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean the numbers that -- I got the numbers here in detail, but basically, we're over between --
it's 80% or so across all of those metrics. A little bit higher for site start-up, which is more -- again, as a
percentage of 2019 base levels, okay? So site start-up is a little higher, is that more 85% or thereabouts
globally. The bottom line is these metrics that we see provide confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline
is not only being awarded, as you can see from the strong bookings, but it's also starting to be delivered.
And the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling, and the patient visits are ongoing. So I think there
hasn't been any major change from this as a result of the new variants or anything like that.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And as a follow-up, Ari, can you comment on perceived market share trends in R&DS in the quarter?
You've been pretty open about the various strategic actions by your competitors, potentially allowing an
opportunity for share gain.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Look, it's hard to look at market share in a given quarter, okay? It's lumpy. A trial, well, it can be awarded
the last day of the quarter or the first day of the following. I wouldn't look at -- we like -- as we always
say, look, we've -- we were defeated and gave you quarterly book-to-bill ratios. But really, we don't -- we
believe we should focus on longer-term book-to-bill ratios because it's lumpy and focus also on business
from the backlog over the next 12 months.

Now if you look at our competitors, there's been a lot of disruption. And yes, I mean, we've had
conversations with customers, but just as you don't win a new customer overnight, you don't throw out a
CRO overnight or in the middle of trials, right? So some of those mergers will have an impact on market
share. I think it's favorable to us. Maybe we'll remain the last CRO standing, I don't know.

But we feel that -- and we know from experience what a merger and a large acquisition does to the
underlying business. There's a lot of disruptions. There is -- people lose their jobs, people who don't
like the new arrangement, and that's just life. And the result of that is some market share. We had that
problem after our merger in '16, let's be honest about it, and we had some market share issues, which we
rebounded once we put together the company and integrated.

I think we are -- the future is very bright for us. We continue to gain new customers. And the biotech
environment, in particular, is extremely, extremely hot right now. We are gaining new clients. In Europe,
we're making inbounds with the customers we never had before, in Asia as well. And the teams are
extremely energized, and I think we are on a winning momentum here. And there's no doubt that when
we look back, we will see that our market share has improved.

Nicholas Childs
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Can -- this is going to be our last question of the day.

And your last question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Ari, maybe a follow-up on that last question. You talked a little bit about kind of all the mergers going on
in the space, again, headcount disruptions. Following up on one of the earlier questions in terms of labor
costs, does that position you guys better in terms of being able to acquire some talent that got rattled
around during some of these mergers and kind of being a stable shift there and kind of grab some people,
maybe at not quite the inflationary costs you're seeing on the labor side?

IQVIA HOLDINGS INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

And then secondarily to that, maybe with a focus on R&DS, how much can you pass some of these price
increases on to customers? I know full-service contracts and backlog are particularly tough to adjust. But
just wondering how much you can pass on in terms of some of the price pressure you're getting there.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Well, on the personnel question, you've got to differentiate between the executive management,
leadership level and then the actual field force with CRAs, et cetera. So on the first group, in general, the
first category, you're -- yes, there is an opportunity to bringing talent that somehow are dissatisfied with
where they are, and that will or may occur, and it has happened already in a few cases. But again, these
are small numbers.

On the CRAs and the project leads and so on, that's much more difficult because it's driven by the book
of business and by the execution that our competitors are also in the midst of trials and they need those
people as much as we do. And so there's no -- not much -- there's just an inflation on wages, which is
the result of all the factors we talked about before. But that doesn't -- the mergers don't affect at least
immediately the CRAs and the people in the field. Your other question had to do with...

Ronald E. Bruehlman
Executive VP & CFO

With pricing and ability to passing on cost.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So as you noted yourself in your question, it's very hard. You can't -- we sold projects with certain
assumptions. And there are some escalations and some factors built into those contracts. So that will be
reflected. But by and large, the pricing was set based on different assumptions, and when you have higher
costs, then you have to absorb that. But then as we move forward, obviously, the pricing is affected.
There's no magic here. It's all going to get passed on, and there's no secret. But it's going to lag as --
because of the nature of our business, certainly in the R&DS business.

Ronald E. Bruehlman
Executive VP & CFO

Right. And of course, on the TAS side of the business, shorter-cycle business, a greater ability to pass
along cost increases.

Ari Bousbib
Chairman, President & CEO

Right. But there's less labor. So that's...

Ronald E. Bruehlman
Executive VP & CFO

Less labor, correct.

Nicholas Childs
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone at our Investor Day in a
