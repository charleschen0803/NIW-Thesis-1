Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to The Home Depot Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As
a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.

Isabel Janci
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining us on our call today are Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO
and President; Ted Decker, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for questions.
Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. [Operator Instructions] If we are unable to get to your
question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387.

Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations
made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of
these measures is provided on our website.

Now let me turn the call over to Craig.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2019 was another record year for our business
as we achieved the highest sales in company history. Excluding the extra week in 2018, fiscal 2019 sales
grew 3.5% to $110.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $10.25.

As expected, we finished the year with our strongest comp performance in the fourth quarter. Comp sales
were up 5.2% from last year, and our U.S. comps were positive 5.3%. Sales for the fourth quarter were
$25.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $2.28.

We saw broad-based growth across all geographies and merchandising departments in the quarter. All 19
of our U.S. regions posted positive comps. And internationally, both Canada and Mexico reported positive
comps in the fourth quarter.

As Ted will detail, both comp ticket and transactions grew in the quarter, and we saw growth with both
our Pro and DIY customers. We had a strong holiday season with record-setting sales on Black Friday and
during Cyber Week. These results reflect solid execution by our stores, our merchants, our supply chain
teams as well as our vendor partners and demonstrate the overall health of the consumer.

I'm proud of our results in fiscal 2019 as the team successfully navigated a number of external headwinds
by maintaining a relentless focus on our customer. 2019 was also a pivotal year in our transformation
to create the One Home Depot experience. We are now 2 years into our multiyear investment and are
realizing benefits. We have more conviction than ever that these strategic initiatives are creating a value
proposition that is unique to the marketplace and will extend our leadership position for years to come.

The majority of our U.S. stores have a new look and feel, and we addressed customer pain points around
navigation and checkout. Our enhanced signage and store refresh package, along with investments in the
front end of our stores, have improved the customer experience and driven associate productivity. These

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

store investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, which we believe is translating into
market share gains.

As a complement to our store investments, we are investing to strengthen the competitive advantages
that we have built through the blending of our physical and digital platforms into a more seamless
interconnected experience. For example, our chain-wide rollout of digital appliance labels, connecting
ratings from the digital world to the physical world, enhancing the in-store shopping experience.

Additionally, homedepot.com continues to be an engine for growth for our overall business, driving
increased traffic online and additional footsteps to our stores. Because of this, we continue to invest in
search functionality, category presentations, product content and enhanced fulfillment options to remove
friction from the online shopping experience.

Excluding the extra week last year, online sales grew 20.8% in the quarter and 21.4% for the year. And
over 50% of the time, our customers choose to pick up their order in a store. This is the power of the
interconnected retail strategy.

We have also expanded our digital capabilities by investing in a B2B website experience tailored
specifically for the needs of our Pro customers. We have now onboarded over 1 million Pro customers.
Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of a third-party, best-in-class CRM system
for all of our Pro sales and services teams. This enhances our visibility, enabling us to better serve our
customers. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to build capabilities to engage with
the Pro, no matter when, where or how they want to interact.

Another key component of the best-in-class interconnected shopping experience centers on the enhanced
delivery and fulfillment options. In 2019, we continued our multiyear journey to create the fastest, most
efficient delivery network in home improvement. We are now live with at least one of each type of facility
that we are building. Though it is early days, we are pleased with the initial results.

For example, we have opened a dozen market delivery operations, or MDOs, that have enabled us to
transition 20% of our appliance deliveries from an outsourced model to one in which we control more of
the customer experience. This has translated to meaningful improvements in our customer satisfaction
scores for appliance deliveries. Our supply chain build-out will continue to ramp from here, with the largest
number of new facilities coming online in 2021 and 2022.

Turning to 2020. Richard will take you through the details, but we expect another year of growth with
both sales and comp growth ranging from approximately 3.5% to 4% and diluted earnings per share of
approximately $10.45. Today, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.50
per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a
disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders.

I'm incredibly proud of the progress our teams made as we transform ourselves into the One Home Depot
of the future. While we define our sales growth in percentage terms, we capture share in dollar terms. And
through the second year of our One Home Depot investment program, we have grown sales by over $9
billion, a level of growth unmatched in our market.

As we look forward to 2020, I am more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead. We are investing
to unlock the power of a truly interconnected customer experience by enhancing our already strong
foundation to further extend our leadership position into the marketplace. As with any transformation, the
work we are doing is complex, and I'm proud of the way our associates continue to execute at high levels
and focus on what's most important in our business, our customers.

I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication in the fourth quarter and
throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores will receive Success Sharing, our
bonus program for our hourly associates. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

Executive Vice President of Merchandising

Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong finish to the year with fourth quarter sales
exceeding our expectations. We saw growth across the store at both our Pro and DIY customers. All of
our merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by our appliance department, which posted
double-digit comps in the quarter. Comps in decor and storage and tools were also above the company
average. All other merchandising departments were positive, but below the company comp of 5.2%.

In the fourth quarter, comp average ticket increased 4.4%, and comp transactions increased 0.8%. The
strength in our comp was partially driven by a shift in our event timing, which Richard will talk through
in a moment. In addition, we had an excellent response to our Black Friday and holiday events, and our
customers continue to trade up to new and innovative items. After experiencing significant deflation in
lumber and copper during the first 3 quarters of 2019, commodity prices had a more neutral impact in the
fourth quarter.

During the fourth quarter, big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, which represent
approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up double digits. The strength in our big-ticket sales was driven
in part by the shift in our event timing as well as strong performance in a number of other big-ticket
categories. During the fourth quarter, big-ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring and our
installation services business, all posted comps above the company average.

Consumer demand is strong, and this was evident during our annual Black Friday, gift center and
decorative holiday events. The partnership and collaboration between our merchants and supplier partners
helped in the fantastic lineup of great deals and special buys in categories like smart home, power tools,
hand tools and decorative holiday. Our unique assortment, together with excellent customer service and
execution, led to incredible results. Black Friday was a record sales day for our company, and our gift
center event grew double digits versus last year.

We also saw our customers tackle a variety of projects around the house. During the fourth quarter,
we saw comps above the company average in several kitchen and bath categories, special or window
coverings, cleaning and exterior paint. We also saw significant growth in our online-only home decor
categories, which we call HD Home, as we build awareness around these high-quality, style-forward
assortments. Sales to our Pro customers were healthy, driven by strength in categories like pneumatics,
concrete, hand tools and caulks, all of which grew faster than the company average.

Looking back at 2019, our team continued their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with
great everyday values and innovative products. And we did this while investing in a customer-backed
store and interconnected experience to ensure that we continue to be the product authority in home
improvement for years to come.

At our investors' conference back in December, we talked about investments we were making across our
business. We also shared our new ad campaign and tagline, How Doers Get More Done, that we launched
to highlight our investments into these new experiences and capabilities. We believe it is important to
signal to our customers that The Home Depot is evolving as their needs change. While it is still early in
our campaign, we see customers responding to our enhanced capabilities, giving us credit for saving them
time and helping them complete their projects. In response to our campaign, we saw one of our largest
single days of downloads of our award-winning mobile app and double-digit growth in usage of mobile
tools like product locator and image search.

As we look forward to 2020, we will continue our investments to better meet our customers' needs
and drive a great shopping experience. One of the investments you will see in the first half of the year
is a reset to our outdoor power equipment bays. We know the marketplace for outdoor power tools is
transitioning to cordless technology. And we learned in our tools department that once a customer adopts
a battery platform, they see tremendous value in sticking with that platform.

Similar to what we have done in our tools department, we are in the process of resetting our outdoor
power equipment bays to showcase our assortment by brand, highlighting EGO, Toro, Milwaukee, RYOBI,
DEWALT and Makita, many of which can only be found at The Home Depot. Through this new presentation,

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

customers can clearly see and easily shop the value proposition that these cordless platforms bring,
including being more environmentally friendly, safer and easier to use, all with the power and run time to
get the job done.

These powerful brands now have the lion's share of batteries in the marketplace with hundreds of millions
of batteries in customers' homes and job sites today. We currently offer over 1,000 cordless power tools,
and that number will continue to grow as our supplier partners are introducing innovative product all the
time. Our comprehensive and unique assortment of outdoor power equipment resulted in double-digit
comps in fiscal 2019.

With spring right around the corner, we are gearing up for another busy season. Our stores are stocked
with new and innovative product, and we just recently announced that we are hiring 80,000 new
associates to help us serve our customers during our spring selling season.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind
everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra
week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. When we report
our comparable sales or comps, we report them on a 52-week-to-52-week basis by comparing weeks 1
through 52 of fiscal 2019 with weeks 2 through 53 of fiscal 2018.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, total sales were $25.8 billion, a 2.7% decrease from last year, reflecting the
compare against the extra week in 2018. Our total company comp sales in the fourth quarter increased
5.2%, and comps in the U.S. increased 5.3%. Because of last year's 53rd week and the resulting calendar
shift, our monthly comps are distorted due to the timing of our annual Black Friday and Cyber Monday
events this year versus last year.

Our reported monthly comps for the total company were positive 1.2% in November, 9.9% in December
and 5.7% in January. Our monthly comps in the U.S. were positive 1.1% in November, 10.4% in
December and 5.8% in January. Given the distortion in our monthly comps caused by the calendar
shift, we believe it is more appropriate to look at November and December on a combined basis. For the
combined 2 months of November and December, our total company comp was 5%, followed by 5.7% in
January.

For the year, our sales totaled a record $110.2 billion. If we exclude the sales from the 53rd week in fiscal
2018, we grew sales by approximately $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019, a level of growth unmatched in our
market. For the year, total company comp sales increased 3.5%, and U.S. comp sales increased 3.8%.

In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. Similar to
last quarter, the change in our gross margin was primarily driven by higher shrink and a mix of products
sold compared to last year. For the year, our gross margin was 34.1%, slightly higher than our guidance at
the beginning of the year.

In the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 64 basis points to 20.7%,
slightly better than our plan. During the quarter, we saw approximately 77 basis points of leverage as we
lapped the fiscal 2018 impairment of certain trade names and the 53rd week last year. This leverage was
partially offset by expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, which
increased approximately $25 million from last year and caused 12 basis points of deleverage.

Fiscal 2019 operating expense as a percent of sales was 19.7%, a decrease of 28 basis points from last
year. Our fiscal 2019 expense performance was better than our initial expectations, driven by productivity
initiatives in our core business. During the year, we spent approximately $1 billion of investment expenses
related to our strategic initiatives, in line with our plan.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.2% and for the year was approximately
14.4%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $27 million to $292 million due
primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago.

In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 20.3%, and from fiscal 2019 was 23.6%. The lower-
than-expected effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by several
discrete tax items. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.28, an increase of 9.1%
from last year. For fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share were $10.25, an increase of 5.3% compared to
fiscal 2018.

Moving on to some additional highlights. We ended the year with a store count of 2,291, while retail selling
square footage was approximately 238 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square
foot were $455, the highest in our company's history.

At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories grew $606 million to $14.5 billion. And inventory
turns were 4.9x, down slightly versus last year. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the
investments we are making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in-stock levels than we had 1
year ago.

Moving on to capital allocation. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $13.7 billion of cash from
operations and used that cash as well as the proceeds from $2.4 billion of net debt issuances to invest in
our business, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase our shares. During the year, we invested
approximately $2.7 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. Further, we paid $6 billion
in dividends to our shareholders.

Finally, during the year, we repurchased approximately $7 billion or about 32.8 million of our outstanding
shares, including roughly $3.25 billion or 14.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the
average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested
capital was approximately 45.4%, 60 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2018.

Today's press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2020, and I want to take a few moments to
comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2020 guidance will launch from
our reported results for fiscal 2019.

At our investor conference in December of 2019, we shared with you some preliminary thoughts for 2020,
and we are reiterating that guidance today. The economy is strong and the U.S. consumer is healthy.
The foundation of our sales plan starts with GDP, and our 2020 sales guidance assumes U.S. GDP growth
of slightly less than 2% in 2020. To GDP, we add the impact that we think we will see from the housing
environment, including demand driven by home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation
and the age of the housing stock. As we look at these metrics, we see an environment that is healthy and
stable.

Our 2020 sales guidance also assumes that we will continue to gain share in the marketplace. For fiscal
2020, we expect both sales growth and total company comp sales growth of approximately 3.5% to 4%.
Fiscal 2020 represents the peak year of our investment program. And as a result, we expect our fiscal
2020 operating expenses to grow at 1.2x the rate of our expected sales growth.

For the year, we expect to grow operating profit dollars to $16 billion, giving us an operating margin of
approximately 14%. For fiscal 2020, we assume our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. We
expect fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 2% to $10.45.

For the year, we project cash flow from operations of approximately $13.5 billion. We plan to invest $2.8
billion of this cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. We also plan to use this cash
to pay $6.4 billion of dividends and repurchase at least $5 billion of outstanding shares.

Before I close, I would like to update you on how we're thinking about one of our capital allocation
principles. With regards to our dividend, in lieu of using a 55% payout ratio, we will look to grow our
dividend every year as we grow earnings, as we have for the last 11 years. This morning, we announced

that our Board increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per
share.
With that, I want to thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for
questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It's on any potential supply disruption coming out of Asia, what have you factored in? What's the current
status of your supply chain? Have you seen any issues with getting product from Asia at this point? And
if this extends for a meaningful period of time, what -- how do you size the potential impact to your sales
and earnings over the next few quarters?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

So Michael, let me -- I'll start off, and then I'll hand it over to Mark Holifield. First of all, the guidance that
we provided, obviously, does not include any guidance update for the situation. It's a very fluid situation
that we're monitoring closely. And all of our goods for Q1 are essentially onshore or on their way. So we
feel pretty good about that situation. And Mark, you might want to provide an update on...

Mark Q. Holifield
Executive VP of Supply Chain & Product Development

Well, sure, Craig. Yes, as you mentioned, it does change every day. Our Q1 merchandise is already here or
on the way. In Q2, the picture is still developing there. For our direct import, our sourcing offices in Asia
are in touch with our factories as they're returning to operations. For our domestic vendors, we're working
with them to understand and mitigate any potential impacts in their supply chains. Our team is working
with all of our suppliers, both domestic and import, and our logistics service providers on a PO-by-PO,
container-by-container basis to understand what the impacts to our product flow are, and they're taking
appropriate action. We are encouraged that we're seeing factories come back to work. Provinces coming
back to work in China, but it is a fluid situation, and it's highly variable in terms of what's the current
state.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And just to clarify, based on what you know today, do you think that there will be an earnings hit to --
over the next couple of quarters based on any supply disruptions if this -- even if things get back to
normal in the very near future? So -- or do you have time to adjust based on what you know at this point?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

Michael, based on what we know today, we couldn't say that there would be a hit. Again, the teams are
working this day to day, as Mark said, PO to PO, container to container. We're also putting plans in place to
mitigate any risk going forward.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

That's remarkable. And then...

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

[ 70% ] of what we do is domestic.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. My follow-up question is, you just wrapped up your second year in a row with about 1% growth --
comp growth in traffic after many years of higher traffic than that. Is 1% growth in traffic the new norm?
And how do you think the implementation of your strategic investment plan is going to impact traffic in the
next few years?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

I mean, Mike, the objective of what we're doing on the investment plan is to position ourselves to be able
to continue to grow faster than the market. I think some of the growth that we saw in years past was a
result of an accelerated recovery from a very difficult spot. What we've always focused on is how do we
balance ticket and transactions, and that's really where our focus is. And the market will determine what
level that's at.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.

Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I actually had a follow-up on Michael's question first. So like, I guess the question is, given the delta that
we've seen in transactions and average ticket, what would you guys point to regarding kind of what's
driving that divergence? I mean -- and you just referenced you had a recovery phase, but I would think
that recovery phase actually would help both sides of that ledger, not just one.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. So I'd say we have some opportunity areas that we've invested in to continue to grow that has
accelerated our ticket growth, largely being we put significant investment in appliances that has paid back
in a very big way in terms of the accelerated growth we've seen in that business. Same thing would hold
true for what Ted referenced as it relates to the lithium technology and the average ticket growth we've
seen in power tools and now in outdoor power equipment.

So I think there's some innovation and investment factors that have helped drive ticket, maybe even
above and beyond as we took share in those categories. But we've been pretty pleased with the
consistency of our traffic growth over time. And like I said, we'll work to balance traffic and ticket. We
always want to make sure there's a reasonable balance there.

Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

When you think about -- I'm sorry, go ahead.

Edward P. Decker
Executive Vice President of Merchandising

I was just going to add, Scot, I'd add to that, Q4, very much event-driven, our gift center, decorative
holiday and, as Craig said, appliances, and those all performed incredibly well. So that contributes to the
ticket and as we see consumers continue to trade up to the new innovative products that we're offering.
And while we're happy with transactions, they were a little bit depressed with the lack of cold weather.
So you'd think during a winter, you get a lot of people stopping in for ice melt, for that smaller pickup,
even carwash or fluid, et cetera. And with the more mild winter, a lot of the biggest suppression there of
transactions were those quick cold weather pickup items.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

Okay. That's helpful. And I guess when you think about all the investments you guys have been making
in the business and supply chain technology, should we continue to expect kind of the pattern that we've
seen here continue? Or does it have a more balanced impact as we go forward?

I mean I think, again, we look for kind of balance in that. Will it be perfect one way or another? No. But
we would look for a balance.

Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Long-term question first. So thinking again about the payback from investments, it sounds like we'll see
some costs moderate next year, so that will be good to margin. But in terms of the top line lift, and I
realize you're probably not going to quantify much, but can you tell us where the places we'll start to see
better comps? Is it the Pro wallet share? Is it MRO categories? DIY? So what are the -- some of the KPIs
that won't be as apparent as comps that you are seeing that tells you that some of these investments are
beginning to pay off?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

First of all, our investments are targeted for all of the above. They just rolled out. So when you think Pro,
you think MRO, you think consumer, our intent is to grow in all of those spaces. And -- but what we're
really trying to set ourselves up to do in the investment is to be able to position The Home Depot to grow
faster than the market growth on a consistent basis no matter what that environment is. That's really
what we're trying to get done.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And does that require waiting for the supply chain investment to finish rolling out? Or no, that should
stagger as all these other investments are taking place?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

I mean the supply chain is a part of the overall component. But as we've shared with you, we have
investments that span across our business, whether that's investments in the store, whether that's
investments in the digital world, in our marketing elements and our product development as well as the
supply chain. And we'll see the -- as we put more and more of these capabilities in place, as the supply
chain continues to expand, as we open more facilities in '21 and '22, the bulk of those, we'll see that
continue to grow as we put more capabilities against the market.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then my follow-up is in the fourth quarter, it looks like the business performed a little better
than planned. Can you parse out underlying housing signs that it may be improving versus some of the
seasonal? It sounds like December was a big month. I don't know if that's more holiday. But at the same
time, you didn't have as much weather impact. So if you can just talk about underlying housing versus
other drivers.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

Sure. Simeon, this is Richard. So from a housing perspective, all housing indicators wound up really sort
of where we expected them. And so we don't think that, that had any material impact on our business.
You mentioned December, there is a little bit of a timing shift there in the calendar from November to
December. But overall, it was really just strong execution across the quarter.

And Ted, maybe you want to go a little bit more into maybe the strength of the quarter?

Edward P. Decker
Executive Vice President of Merchandising

Yes. I think, as I said in my comments, we like the balance of ticket and transaction, and we certainly like
the balance of consumer and Pro. And our Pro was strong in Q4, but we really saw an engaged consumer
in what are more discretionary categories, in terrific artificial Christmas tree business, our gift center
record sales and growth in our gift center. And appliances, as I said, double-digit comps in appliances. It's
not always just a refrigerator that's broken and being replaced. It's increasingly discretionary purchases.
So we just saw a very strong consumer.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Again, normalizing for the event shift, sales are pretty consistent across the quarter. I'm just wondering
how we should think about the cadence of comps by quarter in 2020, and then wondering if you could
offer some thoughts on how February started out.

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

Well, thank you, Chuck. So we don't provide quarterly guidance. But we would say that 2020, we'll see
a relatively even spread across the 2 halves of the year with respect to comp sales. And with respect to
what we've seen so far in 2020, our guidance is based on the best information we have of the moment.
And so our results to date are consistent with that guidance.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. Great. And then just bigger picture. I was wondering if you guys could just amplify on the
opportunity that you have with the Pro as you onboard more of them onto the B2B website, particularly
now that there's going to be the CRM aspect included.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. I think when we think about the Pro customer, we're actually building an ecosystem for our Pro
customers that encompasses product and brands and delivery and credit services and our digital
capabilities with B2B tool rental and a whole lot more. Obviously, all of that coming together allows us
to be able to service our Pro customers in a more holistic way. And it allows us to continue to grow with
larger, more complex customers. And so when we look at the Pro business, we think we're in the 15% to
17% range. And we'd love to see that be much more in line with the consumer penetration of share that
we have as we go forward, which is why we're making these investments.

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

So want to -- a couple of follow-ups. So first, on the seasonal business and the impact of the weather
overall, how would you assess the weather impact last year? And December is really wet. I think you
called out 85 basis points of headwind a year ago. You also had warm weather in January against polar
vortex at the end there last year, but at the same time, you didn't get the snow melt and the snow blower.
So how would you assess your overall impact of weather?

Edward P. Decker
Executive Vice President of Merchandising

Chris, this is Ted. I'd say neutral. It's just, as you said, extended season in some markets. The grounds
not freezing, et cetera, that Pros could stay at work. But then on the other hand, you didn't get all your
cold weather categories. So our merchants in the chore and snow and ice melt business aren't as happy as
some of our other merchants. But I would say on balance, little impact, neutral.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then on the gross margin, so sequentially, the performance was better relative to the third
quarter. You mentioned shrink and mix were still headwinds and that, obviously, you talked about at the
Analyst Day, they persisted into '20, but it did get a little bit better. What was the -- what shifted in the
sands there and helped offset that? Or did one of those factors mitigate? And does it change your view as
you think about 2020?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

Shrink was consistent with what we had observed through the year, and we are taking steps to address
that in 2020, as we discussed. We had some great benefit as we've had all year from some of the supply
chain investments we're making in productivity and supply chain, but shrink was consistent.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And so the delta versus last quarter, anything to call out there?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

It's really -- it's a consistent trend. And as I said, we're looking to address it during 2020.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Nomura.

Michael Allen Baker
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

A couple here. So one, the comp outlook for next year, 3.5% to 4%. This year, you comped at 3.5%, but
you were hurt by at least 50 basis points from lumber. So essentially, you're guiding to a slowdown next
year and, in fact, the slowest comp in a number of years when you adjust for inflation, yet housing seems
to be getting better. So just curious, a disconnect there? Is it just sort of setting up for some potential
upside?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

I mean, like, our methodology that we use hasn't changed, and it's not a perfect model. But Richard, do
you want to just walk through the details?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

Yes, sure. We stay consistent with our methodology providing sales guidance. And if you look at the
elements of that methodology from GDP assumptions to what we're thinking with respect to support from
housing to the expectation that we will continue to take share, none of the assumptions behind those
elements have changed significantly since December. And so that's why we're reconfirming that outlook.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

And one comment, I guess, people have always tried to think about our business as it relates to interest
rates. Just so you know, we have never been able to correlate sales to interest rates. So that doesn't come
into our thinking as a result.

Michael Allen Baker
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

But I guess to follow up on that, you would think that your business correlates to housing, right, which, I
guess, in turn, correlates with interest rates. Is that a fair statement?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

It's a fair statement. We -- and certainly, we've seen some of the indicators in very recent -- in the very
recent time period tick up a bit. But we're not going to adjust guidance based on short-term fluctuations
or observations in housing. We think housing is healthy and stable. It's going to continue to provide
positive support for our business.

Michael Allen Baker
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. If I could follow up. As I recall, the third quarter was hurt a little bit by the
timing of Black Friday. So presumably, that helped the fourth quarter. I get the shift in the months within
the quarter, but third quarter versus fourth quarter, did that help fourth quarter at all? And if so, by how
much?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, it was roughly a 35 basis point shift both ways, so it hurt Q3 by 35. It shifted that to Q4 by 35.

Michael Allen Baker
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

Okay. If I could slide in one more. You didn't -- you said you don't change your methodology and how you
do comps, but you are changing the methodology on the dividend. Just wondering why you're changing
that. Is it just a new CFO and a different way to think about it? Or is there something -- some other
reason we should think about?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

So look, we are maintaining our policy of wanting to increase our dividend every year as we grow
earnings. We're not going to tie it to a specific payout ratio. But I think that this year's increase of 10%
is a great example of our intention to continue to increase the dividend and also a reflection of our
confidence in the business.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

Actually, just a follow-up on that comment on the dividend. So is there a specific relationship we should
think about as it relates to EPS growth versus dividend growth because obviously, as you said, a 10%
increase is very impressive, given that in 2020, you're kind of only looking for, call it, a 2% increase in
earnings and, presumably, earnings growth will accelerate in '21?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

Look, our general philosophy around capital allocation hasn't changed at all in terms of, first and foremost,
we're going to invest what we need to into the business to continue to position this business to win for
the long term. Then based on excess cash, we look at whatever opportunities might exist out there. And
we are committed to increasing our dividend on an annualized basis as we grow earnings. And then we'll
continue to look for ways to return dollars to the shareholders down any other opportunity through share
repurchase. So those are the fundamental basics that we hold true in this business. We still want to -- we
didn't want to control ourselves to a percentage basis.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then on the 14% operating margin guidance, obviously, you came in a little bit
higher this year at 14.4%. Is there anything to call out there in terms of the 40 basis point decline versus
the prior 30?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

No, it's really just a reflection of outperformance in Q4 and sort of rounding up to a 14.4% rather than
our expectations around 2020, which have not changed. But we have great execution across the business,
from sales to gross margin to operating expense. It was a team effort, and we're proud of the results we
delivered.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just last one for me. Is there any update you could provide on additional personalization
and functionality on the B2B? And maybe any color you could provide on behavior with the Pros and/or
conversion with respect to the ones you've onboarded?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

Look, we continue to drive engagement with the Pros that we've onboarded to the B2B website. We like
what we see as those Pros accelerate their engagement. But again, it's -- we are also -- as I mentioned
before, we're building a complete ecosystem around the Pro. The B2B website is one portion of that
experience, but encompasses all the things that I laid out before.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So I wanted to just take a step back a bit. So at the meeting in December, we spent a lot of time talking
about the investment initiatives. And then you had highlighted the benefits of some of these were not
coming as quickly as you initially thought, but they were still coming. I guess I want an update there. I
mean as we look at the business now, you had a very nice quarter. You seem excited about the initiatives.
Have you seen more progress on that front than was articulated in December?

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

Well, I think as we shared in December that we would continue to see the investments have a payback as
we move forward, and that is what we're seeing. I think the quarter, in particular, as Ted called out, was a
combination of the strength that we see in terms of the events that we put in place, the product offering
that we brought to the market, the continued development of our initiatives. It's all those things coming
together that actually delivered on this quarter.

So yes, we're pleased with the continued growth that we see in the initiatives. But at the same time, really
proud of the team. The execution by our stores was outstanding. The supply chain team did a great job.
Our suppliers gave us outstanding products and values. And the customer's ability to start that shopping
experience in the digital world and research product and/or purchase product there, all of that is leading to
the kind of performance that we saw in the fourth quarter.

Brian William Nagel
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then my follow-up, Craig, I guess a similar-type question is on shrink, another topic we spent a
lot of time discussing in the December analyst meeting. How much of a swing factor could shrink be here
in 2020 to the extent that you were able to improve the performance versus what we saw in 2019?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

I think as we shared in December, we are in the process of implementing our initiatives to mitigate the
impact from shrink. It will take time for us to actually realize the benefit as that flows through the P&L
because we basically do the inventory in the stores...

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

And it's a phased rollout. We've piloted approaches. We feel very confident about those results, but we still
learn as we go. We feel confident. And as Craig said, not only do you have the rollout, but you also have
the actual recognition in the P&L, which is on a lag basis as we take inventories.

Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Regarding the margin guidance for 2020, can you talk about what assumptions you're making for product
margin and the mix impact on gross margin?

Edward P. Decker

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

Okay. So on -- but there's no expectation that mix could be a negative, given that appliance sales have
been so strong, for example? Or there are -- is there anything built into your gross margin assumption in
terms of mix?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

Well, there is. And as we had outlined in December, and if you think about the walk to the 14.0%
guidance, you start with the fact that we're going to generate operating expense leverage on a business-
as-usual basis sort of underlying everything. But then recall, this is the peak year of investment of our 3-
year investment program. So that will put pressure on margin. And then we see the impact from shrink,
which, as we said, we're taking steps to address; and also from mix, but the mix pressure is a good
pressure. This is the pressure that reflects the fact we are taking share in categories like appliances, like
power tools, like outdoor power. And so while we do think that there's mix pressure there, our objective is
to grow incremental market share, incremental sales and incremental operating profit dollars, and we do
that through attacking our market opportunities in front of us.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And have there been products that have been excluded from tariffs retroactively where
you're now getting refunds? And are those refunds a positive offset to your cost of goods sold?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. I would say, first off, a huge thank you for our combined merchandising, finance, supply chain, global
sourcing team as they work through this tariff issue all year. I mean we've put a lot of effort on it, and the
teams did an exceptional job. That follows into the exclusions because that's a whole body of work that
you need to follow what's being submitted and requested to be excluded and literally get it down to the
SKU identifier and then file all the requisite paperwork to get the approvals that -- a massive body of work
that the team is currently undertaking. And one big category, a huge growth category for us that has been
excluded now is luxury vinyl plank in the flooring business. That's probably the single biggest one, and
we're actively working to get that refund back from tariffs previously paid.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. So those -- and have those refunds impacted your fourth quarter at all? Or are they more, going
forward, you're likely to see some of that impact in the first half of the year?

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, there was some of that. There was some benefit. But ins and outs to the quarter, we feel great about
the overall performance of the business.

Curious if you could speak specifically to the outlook for your e-commerce business in fiscal '20. And

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

We're excited about our e-commerce business as part of a whole interconnected retail strategy. We believe
that the front door of our store is now on the customer's pocket. It's on the job site, that most of our
customer shopping experience actually starts in the digital world even if it finishes in the physical world.
As Ted has talked about, we have expanded our assortments into more categories online around the
home. We think that is a continued opportunity as customers have shared with us that they believe that
we can bring great value in these home categories, and they trust us to bring that value. So we think that
our digital business continues to be an engine for growth, both in the digital world and in the physical
world.

Richard V. McPhail
CFO & Executive VP

And it's not a separate business. It is managed by our merchandising team, our one merchandising team,
right? And so rather than think about it as a separate business, you have to think about it as a capability.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And on the appliance category, curious if you could talk a little more about the impact of taking
home delivery in-house. And considering your share gains in the category over the past several years,
could you comment on how much you think, share-wise, is still up for grabs and where you think it's
coming from?

Mark Q. Holifield
Executive VP of Supply Chain & Product Development

Yes, we're really pleased -- excuse me, it's Mark. We're really pleased with the work we've done in our
market delivery operations or MDOs. Those are staffed with orange apron, The Home Depot associates
who are ensuring that the freight comes into those locations and is dispatched promptly to the customer,
damage-free. And they're also working to ensure that there's a great customer experience there working
with the delivery teams.

So really pleased with the progress there. We -- as Craig mentioned in his comments, we've got a dozen
of those up. We have another dozen or so leases signed, and we're going to continue to roll those out
through 2020. And as we do, we continue to see an improvement to our on-time performance, our
reschedule rate and our customer satisfaction.

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

And I'd say an opportunity to keep growing. There's still lots of participants, regional, super regionals,
even mom-and-pop furniture stores that have appliance offering. So we think there's still lots of share out
there. I mean, clearly, Sears had been a donor over the years and very markedly diminished store base.
But we still see just a huge market that we've had a disruptive attitude in this space for a long time, and
that's continuing to pay dividends as we take share.

Operator

Our final question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Crédit Suisse.

Seth Ian Sigman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

A couple of follow-ups here. First, on the guidance and specifically the cadence. Richard, I think you
gave us a comp cadence similar throughout the year. How should we be thinking about gross margin,
SG&A and, I guess, just the cadence of investments? Should we be thinking about more pressure on the
operating margin in the first half relative to the second half?

THE HOME DEPOT, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2020

First, we think about it in halves, and we don't provide specific half guidance. We're looking at a relatively
balanced year across the house.

Seth Ian Sigman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up on the exit rate, January being a better month here. Should we be
thinking about any sort of pull forward because of weather? Or do you think it's some combination of your
initiatives and just solid demand overall?

And then some related piece here around the macro. It sounds like you're maintaining a relatively
conservative view. My question is really, are you seeing any sort of improvement or divergence in maybe
markets that were slowing last year and are starting to get a little bit better? Any change in performance
there that would maybe lead you to believe that the housing backdrop is just better for the business right
now?

Craig A. Menear
Chairman, CEO & President

So I'd say, first of all, on regional variability, this past quarter was one of the narrowest we've seen in
recent times, and we don't see any widespread variability. It's really early to determine how the business
plays out for the first half. We've always talked about this in terms of halves because anything can happen
from a weather standpoint that could either accelerate or delay a spring, and then you generally work to
capture that in the first half. That's really our approach. We're not seeing anything that would have us
thinking any differently than that, whatsoever.
