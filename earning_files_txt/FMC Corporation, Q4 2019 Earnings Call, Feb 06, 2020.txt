FMC CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call for FMC Corporation. [Operator
Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Wherley, Director of Investor
Relations for FMC Corporation. You may now begin.

Michael J. Wherley
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's fourth quarter earnings call.
Joining me today are Pierre Brondeau, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Douglas, President and
CEO Elect; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Pierre will review FMC's fourth quarter and full year performance. Then Andrew will provide an overview of
select financial results and then Mark will discuss the company's 2020 outlook. We will then address your
questions.

The slide presentation that accompanies our results, along with our earnings release and our 2020 outlook
statement are available on our website and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made
available after the call.

Finally, let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements
that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors including, but not limited
to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Information presented
represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. Actual results may vary based upon these
risks and uncertainties.

Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA,
adjusted cash from operations and free cash flow, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please
note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings and EBITDA shall mean adjusted EBITDA for all income
statement references. A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial
terms to which we may refer during today's conference call, are provided on our website.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Pierre.

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. FMC's strong financial performance continued in the
fourth quarter, capping an excellent year for the company. Our performance was marked by volume
growth across all regions and once again highlighted the benefit of a balanced geographic exposure, the
strength of our portfolio and the impact of new product launches.

Turning to Slide 3. FMC reported $1.2 billion in fourth quarter revenue, which reflects a year-over-year
increase of 9% on a reported basis and 11% organic growth, excluding FX headwinds. This increase
was driven by double-digit organic growth in Argentina, Canada, France, Russia, India, China, Indonesia
and Pakistan as well as price increases across all regions, except North America. Adjusted company
EBITDA was $320 million, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year period and at the top end of our
guidance.

Company EBITDA margins were about 27%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, despite $28 million in
combined headwinds from raw material costs, tariffs and FX in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.76 in the
quarter, an increase of 21% versus recast Q4 2018. The year-over-year performance was driven largely
by a $0.34 increase on the EBITDA line and the benefit of reduced share count, partially offset by higher
interest expenses. Compared to a most recent guidance, adjusted EPS was also much higher due to very
strong operational performance as higher volume and solid cost control drove $0.07 outperformance

versus guidance, where the much lower-than-forecasted tax rate in the quarter resulted in $0.21 of the
beat versus guidance.

Moving now to Slide 4. Q4 revenue grew by 7% versus prior year, with volume contributing 11% growth,
offset partially by a 2% headwind from FX. Overall, price was flat, as increased rebates in North America
offset strong pricing in the other 3 regions. Given the start of the southern hemisphere season, Latin
America made up over 40% over fourth quarter revenue. Sales in Latin America grew 10% year-over-
year or 13% organically, driven by very strong growth in Argentina and single-digit growth in Brazil and
Mexico. Argentina posted significantly higher volumes for a preemergent herbicides and soybean. We are
very pleased with these results in Argentina. As you may recall, we talked about the significant changes
we made to improve our market access in Argentina, which are now delivering on our expectations.
As forecasted, following 4 quarters of very strong double-digit growth, Brazil growth slowed in Q4, but
continued to deliver increased volume. Channel inventories of our product in Brazil remain at normal levels
for this point of the season and are well under control heading into 2020.

In North America, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for Rynaxypyr insect
control in specialty crops, growth of Ethos XB, a combination insecticide and fungicide for in-furrow
applications and our new Lucento fungicide. Herbicide sales in Canada were also strong. Our overall
volume was above what was expected in the quarter, resulting in higher-than-forecasted rebates. These
rebates are accounted for in our pricing line, which offset price increases in other regions. We continue
to closely monitor channel inventories of our products in the U.S. as we head into the spring. To ensure
a reduction of those channel inventories on a year-over-year basis, we proactively sold less of Authority
preemergent herbicide into the channel in the second half of 2019 than we did in the same period in 2018.

In Asia, we had a very strong fourth quarter performance with a revenue increase of 9% and 10% organic
growth year-over-year in an otherwise down market. India, China, Indonesia and Pakistan, all recorded
double-digit growth rates, driven by insecticide volumes. Following a very strong Q2 and Q3, India
delivered over 20% revenue growth in Q4, driven by rice and sugarcane applications and new product
launches. China's strong revenue growth was driven by diamide demand and fungicide sales in citrus and
vegetable applications.

In EMEA, sales grew 5% overall, as France, U.K., Russia, Italy and Romania, all posted double-digit year-
over-year growth. Q4 organic growth in the region was 7% and was driven largely by sales in France and
Russia, which more than offset difficult drought conditions that impacted cereal plantings in Central and
Eastern Europe.

Turning to the fourth quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. You see a $75 million volume contribution which
came from all regions and which drove the year-over-year growth, relative to again both volume and cost
management led to the strong outperformance.

On Slide 6, full year revenue was $4.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Excluding FX
headwinds of 3%, this represents 11% organic growth. Full year adjusted EPS increased $0.85 year-over-
year or 16%, driven by EBITDA growth and the benefit of share repurchases.

On Slide 7, you can see that FMC growth for 2019. We're well ahead of the crop protection market in
every region. These percentages shown are all in U.S. dollar terms. Despite the extreme weather and
trade challenges in the year, our full year sales in North America were up 3%, which was ahead of forecast
and 900 basis points ahead of the market. FMC full year sales in Latin America grew 19%, 600 basis
points ahead of the market and 23% organically. In EMEA, the sales grew 4% in the year, which was 700
basis points ahead of the market and 10% organically. FMC revenue growth in Asia was 3% on a reported
basis, 800 basis points ahead of the market, and 8% organically, excluding FX headwinds across many
currencies. Globally, FMC grew 8% in 2019 in U.S. dollar terms versus a flat global market. We believe
our outperformance in every region was due to the strength of our portfolio, a crop balance and a strong
commercial presence around the world.

Moving to Slide 8 where you can see our full EBITDA and revenue drivers. Volume was the main driver
of revenue growth while price increased sales by 3%. Almost 20% of this year's revenue growth came
from 2019 product launches. And our vitality index, which we calculate as the proportion of total revenue

coming from products introduced in the last 5 years, was roughly 10% of total sales. The diamide grew in
the low-teens in 2019, and the rest of the portfolio grew in the mid-single digits. On our Q2 earnings call,
we outlined our plans to profitably grow our diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents
and all the way through the end of this decade via the engagement of third parties. We indicated we are
in place or negotiating 15 such commercial agreements. 6 months later, we have expanded the number
of agreements to cover 4 global partnerships and 41 separate local company agreements covering 11
countries. A number of these new agreements are active and commercial sales are occurring. We will
continue to expand the franchise through more of these commercial agreements. These partnerships are
important, and in most cases, allow us to access markets we are not selling into today. They are a key
extension of our commercial reach. 2019 adjusted EBITDA of $1.22 billion was up 10% year-over-year,
despite $228 million in combined headwinds from higher cost and FX. Revenue and the EBITDA growth
rate in 2019 are both above the high end of the 5-year growth targets we provided in December 2018.

I will now turn it over to Andrew.

Andrew D. Sandifer
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Pierre. I'll start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement, then move to the
balance sheet, cash flow and share count. I'll also give a quick update on progress in implementing our
new SAP S/4HANA system.

Interest expense for full year 2019 was $158.5 million, $3.5 million above our most recent guidance,
primarily due to higher-than-forecasted foreign debt and commercial paper balances. For 2020, we
anticipate interest expense between $160 million and $170 million, with the increase largely attributable
to higher foreign debt balances, particularly where we utilize local borrowings to reduce currency
exposures. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the full year 2019 was 11.6%, 290 basis points
lower than anticipated. FMC's corporate structure, particularly the principal operating companies that were
created as part of the DuPont transaction in 2017, provide FMC with structurally low tax rate. With this
structure, profit outside the United States is taxed at lower statutory or negotiated tax rates than profit
in the U.S., resulting in a weighted average tax rate well below the U.S. statutory rate. To be clear, even
at this lower overall rate, FMC does incur a significant amount of U.S. tax on these non-U.S. profits under
the global intangible low tax income or GILTI provision. The structural elements that drive our low overall
effective tax rate are highly sustainable, and we expect a low rate for many years to come. However, the
effective tax rate in any period is sensitive to swings in profitability between geographies, most notably,
the amount of profit earned in the U.S. The significant contributors to our lower-than-expected tax rate
in 2019 were lower-than-forecasted earnings in the U.S. due to the factors in our North America business
Pierre mentioned earlier, combined with stronger-than-forecasted earnings that flowed through our
principal operating companies outside of the U.S. Looking ahead to 2020, we expect a full year tax rate of
12.5% to 14.5%, based on our current estimates of taxable earnings by geography.

At year-end, gross debt was $3.3 billion, down roughly $300 million from the end of the third quarter.
Surplus cash on the balance sheet at year-end was in excess of $225 million due to timing of receipt of
end-of-year payments, which prevented us from using this cash to further pay down debt prior to year-
end. Considering the surplus cash at year-end, gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was just under our
2.5x target. We remain committed to solid investment-grade credit metrics and expect full year average
leverage to be in line with this commitment in 2020.

Moving to Slide 9 and cash flow. Free cash flow for 2020 was $302 million, up $172 million from the
prior year. Higher adjusted cash from operations, driven by higher EBITDA and lower use of cash for
working capital, and lower legacy and transformation spending, more than offset an increase in capital
additions compared to the prior year. We are pleased with the improvements made in trade working
capital. Trade working capital as a percentage of sales at year-end decreased 210 basis points to 32.5%
in 2019. Free cash conversion relative to adjusted net earnings was 38% for full year 2019, more than
twice the prior year on a like-for-like basis, with free cash flow growing 10x as fast as earnings. However,
free cash flow came in below the low end of our outlook range of $375 million to $475 million. 2 factors
largely contributed to this. The first was much slower-than-expected collection of refunds of value-added

FMC CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

and similar taxes, especially in India. The delays were driven primarily by the complexities of operating
in multiple SAP and non-SAP systems around the world. The second factor was delayed collections in
Pakistan and Indonesia, where weather conditions impacted grower liquidity late in the fourth quarter.
Both factors are execution-related and will reverse. We fully expect to collect this cash in 2020. In the
absence of these 2 factors, our free cash flow for 2019 would have been solidly in our guidance range,
with free cash conversion of roughly 50% on higher-than-guided earnings. We know we have more to do
to continue to improve free cash flow. Moving to a single instance of SAP S/4HANA this year will give us
a different level of visibility across our entire business and will provide us with state of the art tools to
continue to drive improvement in working capital and cash flow. Looking ahead to 2020, we're forecasting
free cash flow of $425 million to $525 million, with free cash conversion from adjusted earnings of
55% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. We continue to believe we can drive free cash conversion
substantially higher over the coming 2 to 3 years as we finalize our SAP implementation, ending the period
of high cash spending on transformation activity and as we drive further improvement in working capital
performance.

We repurchased over 4.7 million FMC shares in 2019 at an average price of $84.73. This included $100
million in repurchases completed in the fourth quarter for a total of $400 million of repurchases in
the year. Considering the $210 million paid in dividends, FMC returned over $600 million in cash to
shareholders in 2019. We are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, consistent with our
long-range plan. Further evidence of this commitment is the 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend
announced in December. We intend to purchase between $400 million and $500 million of FMC shares in
2020. In light of the seasonal working capital build in the first quarter and ongoing product line acquisition
discussions, we do not expect to make any meaningful share repurchases in the first quarter, but fully
intend to remain a regular purchaser of shares through the rest of the year.

Before turning the call over to Mark, let me also give a quick update on progress in implementing our new
SAP S/4HANA ERP system. We successfully closed full year 2019 with roughly 20% of the company on the
new system, and are already seeing many benefits. Today, we are going live across the acquired business,
which represents roughly 40% of FMC. This will allow us to exit the Transition Services Agreement at the
end of this month, delivering annual cost savings of $20 million, which were incorporated in our earnings
guidance for 2020.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Thank you, Andrew. Moving to Slide 10 and the review of our full year 2020 and Q1 earnings outlook. We
expect full year adjusted earnings of $6.45 to $6.70 per diluted share, representing an 8% increase at
the midpoint. This outlook for EPS does not include the impact of share repurchases in 2020. Revenue is
expected to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.95 billion, representing 6% growth at the midpoint and
7% organic growth compared to 2019.

Total company adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion, reflecting
8% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Looking at the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings
per diluted share to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.86, representing an increase of 5% at the midpoint
versus Q1 2019 and assuming a share count of approximately $131 million. We forecast Q1 revenue to
be in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.27 billion, representing 5% growth at the midpoint compared to the
first quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $346 million to $366 million,
representing a 4% increase at the midpoint versus the prior year period.

Turning now to our 2020 EBITDA bridge on Slide 11. Our EBITDA growth is expected to be driven by
volume gains and continued price increases. We should note that we are also expecting to invest about
$40 million more on R&D in 2020. This increase is driven by our continued success in moving molecules
into development from discovery in 2019. Total R&D spend should be approximately 7% of sales versus
6.5% of sales in 2019, as we continue to expand and progress 22 new active ingredients and 8 new
biologicals towards commercialization. Tariffs will be higher in 2020, while raw material costs will not
materially improve until the second half of 2020. We will realize about $20 million in annual savings as we

FMC CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

exit the transition service agreement this month. Foreign exchange is also forecasted to be a headwind
in 2020 as the U.S. dollar has further strengthened versus key currencies. However, if you exclude
the incremental $40 million in R&D spend, our price increases will cover over 100% of the combined
headwinds from cost and FX.

I would also like to highlight our revenue drivers. We forecast 2020 revenue growth of 6% overall and
7% organically. Volume is expected to contribute 5% to growth, including about 1.5% from new products
launched in 2020, and pricing is expected to contribute 2% growth. These are slightly offset by a 1%
headwind from foreign exchange. One aspect of our portfolio management that we do not often highlight
is the change in the makeup of our portfolio. As is the case every year, in 2020, we will have an adverse
impact from lost registrations on molecules as well as decisions to exit some product lines. This typically
represents a drag of about 2% of our revenues, and yet in 2019, we still grew volume 8%. These portfolio
impacts are factored into our long-term revenue growth targets. Our long-term product strategy of
investing in an increasingly sustainable product portfolio requires that we continually replace older
chemistries with newer, more sustainable technologies. As part of this effort, as of the end of year 2019,
FMC has stopped selling all carbofuran formulations, including Furadan insecticide globally.

Moving to Slide 12, where we will provide the key drivers for EBITDA and revenue growth in the first
quarter. First quarter performance will be driven by strong volume growth, including new product
launches, which are expected to deliver about 1/3 of our total revenue growth in the quarter. These
launches include Authority Edge preemergent herbicides for soybeans in the U.S. and Battle Delta
herbicide for cereals in Europe. Pricing actions are expected to fully offset the FX headwinds at the
revenue level. Shifting to the global crop protection market, we project the total market will grow in the
low single digits in 2020 on a U.S. dollar basis, with each region also growing by low single digits. We
forecast that Asia will have the highest growth rate, assuming a partial rebound in Australia and more
normalized weather conditions across the region. In North America, growth is expected to come from
recovery in acreage for row crops, offset by a higher-than-normal channel inventory levels heading into
the year. In Latin America, growth in soybeans and corn are expected to lead the crop protection market
in Brazil. In EMEA, growth will be driven by spring cereal herbicides following the challenging winter cereal
seeding.

I will now turn the call back to Pierre.

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Mark. Our company's outperformance in 2019 was the result of a very flexible and agile
supply chain, limiting the impact of raw material shortages and the delivery of market-driven technologies
that offer exceptional value to growers around the world. We strongly believe that our investment in our
discovery and development pipeline will continue to fuel long-term growth for the company. In 2020,
we will continue to effectively navigate through unexpected challenges that arise such as weather or
macroeconomic developments, and we'll deliver on the financial targets we set out for you today. We
believe 2020 will mark the third year in a row that FMC significantly outperforms the crop protection
market in terms of revenue growth and EBITDA margins. We expect our outperformance will be driven by
broad-based geographic growth, launches of new products and technologies and the continued expansion
of diamide franchise as we gain more registration in labels as well as grow via commercial partnerships.
I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you very much for your attention.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman
Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I was hoping to -- maybe to dig into the guidance details a little bit and just think through the cost side
and you gave some color in the prepared remarks about R&D -- about investments in R&D and raw
materials. But maybe just a little bit more color around the moving pieces there?

Andrew D. Sandifer
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. I think if we look at the full year guidance, we see it in many ways, a pattern similar to what we saw
last year, but with a less pronounced headwind from cost and FX. On the cost side, you're exactly right,
we are -- we have called out, we're increasing our investment in R&D about $40 million year-on-year.
So of that $61 million that you see in cost increase for the full year on our bridge on Slide 11, about $40
million of that is cost increase from R&D spending. If you remove that, we really do have -- we start to
see the benefit of the pricing actions we've taken over the past 5 quarters where price and mix ends up
covering more than the cost and FX headwinds. I do think we did see continued higher raw material costs
and tight conditions going into the second half of last year, that, as you know, as they flow through our
inventory in the first half of this year, will continue to be a bit of a headwind. And the U.S. dollar continues
to strengthen against a number of our key currencies. So we do still have some FX headwinds. I will note
that those headwinds are particularly heavy in the first half. As we start looking towards the second half,
we start seeing much more favorable comparisons on cost and lessening FX impacts.

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

On the volume front, to talk about growth in [indiscernible] but roughly 3 big buckets, I would say, of
diamide. We do believe it's going to be broad-based geographical growth and it's going to be in the low-
teens. Think about the rest of our portfolio, non-diamide, as in 2019 growing at about 5%. And as in '19,
we believe the products we will be launching in 2020 will also bring about 2% growth rate.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful color. And then just quickly on the cash flow conversion guidance of 55%. Just
apart from the continued investments in ERP and transformation, I mean, what else would it take to get to
that medium-term target of 70% as we think '20 versus '21 and '22?

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

Yes, let me -- let's do one thing. Let me just take a bit the trends from '18 all the way to '21 at a high
level, and then maybe, Andrew, you can go into more detail into the 2019-2020 number. If you look back
at 2018, we had a conversion rate of 18%. In 2019, we generated $300 million of free cash flow, which
represents a conversion rate of 37%. Now this $300 million normalized should have been $400 million. We
had $100 million miss, purely execution. Got our eyes off the ball on a couple of issues but the normalized
number would have been around $400 million, which should have been about a 50% conversion rate.
Looking into 2020. 2020, I would characterize as a year a bit along the same line as 2019. We believe
we're going to benefit from higher EBITDA, about 8% growth. But from the cost standpoint, we were
expecting about a year ago to be able to finish SAP implementation in the first quarter of 2020. But
there is no way around it. It's a 3-year program. It's going to cost $250 million. So we're going to have

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

FMC CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 06, 2020

to go all the way to the end of 2020 with SAP implementation costs. So we're going to have the same
transformational cost as we did in 2019. So we believe 2020 will be a conversion rate of about 55%.

Now you move into 2021, and that's when you still see, if we go along the line of a 5-year plan, another
8% EBITDA increase, but that's when the SAP implementation, transformation cost start to significantly
lower and that's when, just through this effect, we expect to be around 70% cash conversion from
adjusted earnings. So that's directionally how we're going to go from 37% in 2019 to about 70% in 2021.
Maybe, Andrew, you want to talk a bit more about '19 and '20?

Andrew D. Sandifer
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Let me talk -- get a little more specific on that bridge from '19 to '20. I think as Pierre referenced,
we have about $300 million in free cash flow in '19. We're guiding an increase in EBITDA of about $100
million. But we'll also be increasing the spending on CapEx about $10 million year-on-year, and our legacy
and transformation costs increased about $20 million year-on-year. So the combination of those factors
are -- leave you at about $370 million. The net impact of the reversal of the 2 factors we called out in the
cash flow shortfall this quarter and the impact of change in working capital in 2020 are the rest of the
difference to the rest of our guidance range. It gets you up in that $425 million to $575 million. So it's
important in that 2020 walk, as Pierre mentioned, we do not see a step down. We actually see a slight
increase in legacy and transformation year-on-year with about $100 million to $125 million of that being
really transformation activity and the remainder being legacy expenses that -- basically transformation
being flat to slightly down to prior year in total with legacy going up slightly. So again, that next real big
step in cash conversion, we get to a more normalized level this year for how we're operating on working
capital. And then in 2021, we see the step down from the end of the SAP program in the end of the
transformation spend.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

P.J. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Rebates in North America. Is that mostly rebates to retailers based on volumes, like a volume rebate? Or
is that more of a comparative action? And in what products is that occurring?

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

Yes, P.J., it's just a normal -- it's a normal process which happens. Every year we do the same thing. We
have rebates which are indexed on volume. And that's a normal process. There was no specific change in
the rates or anything of that kind. It was just a normal year. The only difference looking at the weather
condition and the pattern in North America, we ended up a bit stronger in the fourth quarter than we were
expecting. So when we had to look at all of the reserves and rebates we would have to pay, we ended up
having higher rebate to be paid to our customers for the full year and to be done in the fourth quarter. So
it's just -- we got a little bit surprised by the strength of the market in the fourth quarter versus what we
were expecting. And that, because it's purely proportional to volume, created a step-up in rebates we're
not expecting.

And the next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So you've done a solid job of evolving the portfolio from both the geographic and crop perspective, which,
I guess, is kind of the key to enabling you to outgrow CPC markets. However, you're still underweight
fungicides and kind of overweight insecticides. It seems like you're entering a lot of agreements regarding

texturing and the diamides over the long-term. But how should we think about your total portfolio
evolution as it pertains to further establishing your presence in fungicides? And is it a coincidence that you
mentioned product line acquisition discussions in M&A?

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes, Chris, you're absolutely right. We are heavyweight in insecticides. I believe, we're the world's leader
in insecticides. So we're not disappointed with that profile at all. However, you're right, we do want to
increase our participation in fungicides. And really, we're doing that in 3 ways. First of all is our current
portfolio, which is limited, but with very, very interesting products. We launched a new product this year,
or 2019, Lucento in North America. It's going extremely well. To be frank, I think if we'd have had more
capacity, we'd have been able to sell more. So there is the notion of selling what we have today. Second
to that is what we have in our pipeline when you think about our discovery and development pipeline. We
currently have today 5 new fungicides in our pipeline, 3 of which have brand-new modes of action, not
seen before. So we know we have the long-term view, which is very strong from the fungicide perspective.
Closer to home, we will be launching in 2021 a brand-new fungicide called Fluindapyr. We'll be launching
that around the world. That will also add to the growth rate as we go through sort of the second half
of our plan. And then third is how we acquire technologies or access to products around the world. We
are under active discussions. And in fact, some of the agreements that we have in place today for the
diamides allow us access to various fungicides in different markets. So we're pursuing pretty much every
avenue we know to really grow that fungicides as fast as possible, but it is a target for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So Pierre, last quarter, you talked about Cyazypyr and the pickup we saw there. Cyazypyr has been a sort
of a slow and steady success since the DuPont days. Are you seeing that continue? And if it is, what does
that say about the acceleration in demand coming this late into growth cycle?

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes, Mark, you're right. Cyazypyr was launched later than Rynaxypyr. It is -- I would say, it is somewhat
more of a difficult sell. As we've got our hands around the products, we understand that it has some
attributes when it comes to the performance, but also has plant health benefits in terms of how a plant
responds to Cyazypyr and how Cyazypyr removes the pests. We've talked about the size of our business
in diamides over 2019. It's about a $1.6 billion business. Cyazypyr is growing rapidly, much faster than
Rynaxypyr and is in the $350 million to $400 million range going forward. So it's already become a
significant molecule. We don't believe, at this point, that its growth profile is slowing down, certainly not
in the near term. So you can expect us to talk more about Cyazypyr and especially the growth rates as we
go forward.

Pierre R. Brondeau

Thank you.

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

Pierre, you mentioned that over the past 6 months, you've been signing multiple new partnerships. And
I'm just curious if you could kind of describe them in a little more detail? I mean, what products are these
covering? Are these just covering the diamides, geographic? Any more color that you could expand upon
this? And then perhaps just give us a sense as to what size of your total revenues you think this may grow
to over the next couple of years?

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I'll ask Mark to jump in. The only thing, Frank, I want to say before Mark talk a little bit is, with most
of these agreements, we do have secrecy agreements. So we are very limited to what we can say around
volume, especially being in an early stage, it would be quite easy to understand who is doing what. So
-- and as we said in the script, 4 are global agreements and 41 are local agreements, all of them our
diamides agreements. Mark, do you want to say a few things that they cover?

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes. Frank, they cover both Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr. As Pierre said, we are under pretty tight
confidentiality rules here. But suffice to say, 11 different countries so far, all major crops, and more
importantly, some crops and markets that we are not active in today with the diamides. So think of it
in terms of growth from a market access perspective in various countries around the world. And these
are not products that are just straight Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr. They are mixtures and sophisticated
formulations with active ingredients that we don't have access to. So the fundamental purpose here is not
only to defend our franchise and grow it over the next decade, but also to expand the pool of where we
operate. Think about it this way. The insecticide market is about a $15 billion market. A lot of the older
chemistries are going away. And we have about $1.6 billion worth of business with the diamides. We have
plenty of room to grow here over the long haul, and that is the purpose of what we're doing.

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

I think what Mark said is -- at the end is very important. We do believe those partnerships are going to
help us expanding the market penetration of Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr. Those 2 molecules are big, but we
believe they are far from being at the end of their market penetration. So that's one of the way to do it to
complement all of the marketing and commercial activity FMC has directly.

little bit more about what's driving the increase? Is it underlying cost inflation against the existing plan? Is

it spending more on discovery of, I guess, new actives? Is it changing scope on the formulations? Or is it
just a bit of everything?

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes, Laurent, really the $40 million is targeted at 2 new active ingredients that we moved into
development from discovery in 2019. So we now have that run rate cost of spending more money on what
is really the most expensive part of the whole R&D cycle, which is development. It's where we spend a lot
of money on toxicology, et cetera. So those products are now moving into a phase where, for the next 3,
4, 5 years, spending will be increased. 7% of revenue is not something that we see as a problem for us.
We actually have phased our R&D so that we should be in that 7% range on an ongoing basis. You should
expect to see that number change as we go through the years and the business continues to grow. We will
be spending more on R&D as we continue to expand, not only the pipeline of synthetics, but biologicals as
well.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. I was hoping you could comment on whether or not you're seeing any indications of some competitive
pricing from any one of the following buckets. One being the inventory -- the channel inventory levels,
Mark, that you mentioned in North America being higher than normal. Another potential one would be the
big seed companies are increasingly bundling crop chems with their seed platforms. Another one being
increased e-commerce offerings. Anything that you're seeing there that -- if you could comment on those,
please?

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

Thank you. Listen, first of all, we should know it's a highly competitive market. There is lots of companies
in this market we are competing. But at the end of the day, it is a market we are offering and technology
matter. So yes, there is competitive actions. But at the end of the day, if you price right the right
technology, you can protect your margin. Maybe, Mark, let's start the comment about seeds and bundling.
And maybe talk about the meeting you and I -- we had last week with our customers.

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes, sure. So let's put it in perspective. You're talking about seed bundling, you're really talking about
major row crops in the Midwest of the U.S. And frankly, when you look at that as an overall component
of our business, it's not the majority of our business by a long way. And even in the U.S., we have
tremendous exposure outside of the Midwest. We don't see the bundling aspect as a competitive threat
to us. The meeting Pierre was referencing, Pierre and I and the whole of the North America commercial
team, we were with 250 retailers and distribution companies in the U.S. last week. And we spent 3 to 4
days, talking about the market, where are we, what's our competitive offering. And I can tell you, no time
did we hear that the combination of seeds and chemicals is a detriment to our growth. In fact, we heard
the opposite. We heard the fact that our offerings are offering technology on anybody seeds. It doesn't
matter whose seeds you buy. Can be an independent, can be 1 of the big 2 or 3. So for us, we see this
as an extreme positive, and so do our retailers and so do our distribution partners. So in that sense, no, I
don't see the seeds combination has been an issue for us.

On the last bucket that you had, Steve, on e-commerce, we actually see e-commerce as having a place in
the marketplace. But frankly, we see it at the low end of the market. It's easy to sell a generic on price.
It's not easy to sell a very sophisticated preemergent herbicide or very sophisticated diamide insecticide
online. We don't participate in those forums. We will not participate in those forums. Our customers are

the people that are offering the service levels down on the ground with the growers. So for us, we're not
seeing anything impacting our overall North America business through e-commerce.

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

I want to repeat what Mark said because that is very critical, and it is a strategic decision of FMC. We will
not get into the seed business, we do not need to be in the seed business. When Mark talked about 200
customers, it is true. It was 200 to 250 customers with whom we spent most of the week. I can tell you
that to a person they told that it's very critical to have a chemical and biological supplier who is agnostic
to the type of seeds, and somebody has the right technology they can use with any type of seed. Our
customers are not big fans of bundling or being pushed to use a specific seed with a specific chemical.
They need the freedom to choose, and we provide that to them. So it is not something we are concerned
about. We do believe -- I would even go one step beyond. I think it's a competitive advantage for us to
not be in seeds.

I think you mentioned the non-diamides business is expected to be up mid single digits in 2020. Can you
maybe give us a little bit of color where the growth is coming from, new molecules, new geographies, new
registrations? I'm sure it's a little bit of all of the above. But just a little bit of help there.

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes, Mike, it is a little bit of all the above. As Pierre indicated, our legacy portfolio, we believe, is growing
in roughly the mid single digits, I would say, across the board. We've seen the highest growth rates
with the fungicide portfolio that we have, spent a lot of time on growing that around the world, mainly
in North America. Certainly, the legacy insecticide portfolio is doing extremely well, especially in Latin
America where we have some very, very good products that are going into the soy complex. And then
we would come to the herbicides, where we see growth in both the U.S., with some pretty sophisticated
preemergent formulations like Authority Edge that are replacing current technologies that are out
there. We see growth in Argentina on preemergence. And we also see significant continued growth with
herbicides in sugarcane in Brazil.

Moving over to Asia. India is a big market for us now, and we're offering brand-new herbicide formulations
that have not been seen before in India, especially for sugarcane. We continue to grow our rice herbicide
business in China. So all those pieces that come together, you can see it's quite easy for us to get into that
mid single-digit range.

Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.

Donald David Carson
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

I want to go back to raw material costs and your outlook for the year. Pierre, you mentioned that the
higher cost last year will flow through inventory in the first half. But once you get through that, as you
get into the second half, do you see raw material costs coming down? And I know you've recast your
supply chain, but is availability out of China a problem now that's perhaps grown with some of the recent
shutdowns, could that have a second half effect on the industry?

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So first of all, let me start with the cost, as we are forecasting in our guidance. You are correct, the
cost is turning into the second half of the year into positive, which means that most of the adverse cost in
our P&L is happening in the first half of the year with a disproportionate amount in the first quarter and
then in the second quarter. So -- and then when we get into the second half, that's when these costs are
improving. From an availability standpoint, where are we today? As you can guess, the issues we had last
year, which were due to environmental issues and industrial parks shutting down, those issues are over.
I think we are not suffering from any issues there. The thing we are watching, of course, is the impact of
Coronavirus. There is no impact of Coronavirus on demand today, as we see it. It is much more an impact
on logistics because of parts of the country which are being isolated or roads which are being blocked or
air freight. Today, we have not seen any negative impact on our ability to operate so far. We had some
issues where we had to find options to get raw materials from a different location. But all in all, the issues
we have been facing, we have been able to resolve them and operate normally. That being said, as you
can guess, it's a very dynamic situation. So we do have a team fully focused on that and only doing this
day after day, which is watching the flux of raw materials from a place to another, to make sure we do
a have a -- we do have what we need for our growth plan. But yes, it is something we are aware of and
carefully watching, but so far so good.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Looking at the one slide you have in there, 13% growth in the Latin American crop protection market in
2019, that seems like a lot. Were there really that many more planted acres? Or did we see increases
in the number of applications? Was this trade benefits? Just wondering if you can help us understand
the drivers of that very strong growth in the market itself, and maybe get us more comfortable that we
weren't just seeing a lot of inventory getting stuffed into the channel.

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes, Mike. Listen, I think it's a very good observation. I think most people -- when we talk about a 13%
growth rate, most people put that straight towards Brazil. I think you've got to parcel it out somewhat in
the sense that the other regions are growing. Mexico grew in the north, and then obviously, Argentina has
been growing certainly for us, but the market was relatively, I would say, low single -- mid single digits.
If you look at Brazil, surface area that was planted was probably about a 3% increase overall with soy
leading the way. We had a very good season on cotton, strong infestation, which obviously helped us. But
also, the market was up because of that. And cotton is a high usage of pesticides. I would say, though,
that overall, I think the market has more channel inventory in Brazil than the market would take. So I
think some of that 13% is setting warehouses right now. I'm going to be very frank and tell you that we
talk about this constantly on every call. And our inventories are exactly where we want them to be, normal
levels across Brazil for the rest of this season and then heading into the new season that comes in at the

end of this year. But I do start to watch the channel inventories in Brazil. I think they are higher than
normal.

Pierre R. Brondeau
Chairman & CEO

And to complement what Mark said and the level of inventory in the channel of FMC products, just to
remind what we said in the script, growth was not driven in the fourth quarter for FMC by Brazil. It was
other parts of Latin America and a big driver was Argentina. So that is part of the process we have in place
to make sure that in Brazil we control channel inventory.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Mark, a question for you on insecticides as it relates to some of the regulatory dynamics. With regard
to chlorpyrifos we understand that, that chemistry is being phased out in California and Europe. And so
my question is whether FMC foresees any opportunity to gain share via substitute chemistries such as
pyrethroids or otherwise? And then second, you mentioned the carbofuran exit. I just wonder if you could
address that in terms of opportunity to backfill there, what options you may have in the portfolio?

Mark A. Douglas
President & COO

Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, chlorpyrifos is a molecule that is, as you said, been removed in California. We
have very limited sales of chlorpyrifos around the world, and we have exited basically all of that business.
So for us, we see it as more of an opportunity. And you're right, pyrethroids, especially our bifenthrin
mixtures will be targeting those markets. So we'll be looking to grow there. And then on carbofuran,
yes, we do see opportunities for our portfolio to replace what we already have. And obviously, if we were
planning to exit, we had plans to replace. And those plans will be rolled out in Mexico and parts of Asia,
Indonesia, in particular, where we will be replacing our own products with some of the newer technologies.

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

You did a good job of bridging free cash flow conversion, major buckets over the next couple of years. I
just wanted to focus on the '19 versus '20 free cash flow conversion. If looking at the roughly $100 million
or 12% conversion that is expected in 2020 instead of '19, it looks like, normalized for everything, 2020
free cash flow conversion is actually less than 2019 conversion. Is that right? And maybe you could just
specifically walk through some of this, specifically walk through exactly the difference between '19 and
'20, if that's true.

Andrew D. Sandifer
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Joel, I think that the free cash flow conversion on a like-for-like is pretty consistent between the 2
years. What you've got are some puts and takes. We have higher capital additions and higher legacy and
transformation spending in 2020 than we did in 2019 to the tune of about $30 million combined. We do
see increased cash from operations. Part of that is the recapture of the delayed collections that we saw
at the end of Q4. And we also have to acknowledge, we're growing the top line, roughly $350 million --
$300 million, $350 million at the guidance point and generating $100 million of EBITDA. It does take some
working capital to continue to grow the business. So that -- when you think through that walk again, if we
take $300 million in free cash flow in 2019, $100 million in growth in EBITDA, a $30 million headwind from

higher legacy and transformation and capital spending, that gets you within $100 million of our guidance
point. That $100 million is the rebound, the reversal of the Q4 factors we've talked about and a very
minimal change in working capital beyond that -- very minimal use of working capital beyond that. So it
does imply continuing improvements in working capital efficiency. And that's a part of our continued drive
to drive not just waiting for the step down the transformation spending, but to continue to drive down the
working capital use in the business.
