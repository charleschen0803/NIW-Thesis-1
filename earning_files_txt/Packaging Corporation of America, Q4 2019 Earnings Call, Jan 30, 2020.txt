Presentation

Operator

Thank you for joining Packaging Corporation of America's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings
Results Conference Call. Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.

I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Fourth
Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of
PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our packaging
business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.

I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'm going to turn it
over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up, and then we'd be glad to
take questions.

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2019 net income of $136 million or $1.43 per share. Fourth quarter
net income included special items of $26 million primarily for certain costs associated with the company's
November 2019 debt refinancing, which included redemption premiums, financing fees and write-offs for
unamortized debt issuance costs and treasury lock balances.

Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2019 net income was $163 million or $1.71 per share
compared to the fourth quarter 2018 net income of $205 million or $2.17 per share. Fourth quarter net
sales were $1.7 billion in both 2019 and 2018.

Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $335 million in 2019 and $387
million in 2018. We also reported full year 2019 earnings, excluding special items, of $726 million or $7.65
per share compared to 2018 earnings, excluding special items, of $760 million or $8.03 per share. Net
sales were $7 billion in both 2019 and 2018. Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2019
was $1.450 billion compared to $1.500 billion in 2018. Details of the special items for both the fourth
quarter and full year 2019 and 2018 were included in the schedules that accompany the earnings press
release.

Excluding the special items, the $0.46 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2019 earnings compared
to the fourth quarter of 2018 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging business
segment of $0.57; and Paper segment, $0.02; higher operating costs, $0.05, primarily due to inflation
related increases with chemicals, labor and benefits expenses, repair, material costs and other outside
service costs. We also had higher nonoperating pension expense of $0.02, higher depreciation expense
of $0.01 and other costs, including start-up related costs at our new Richland, Washington plant of
$0.03. These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our packaging segment of $0.16 and Paper
segment, $0.01, lower annual outage expenses, $0.04 and lower freight and logistics expenses of $0.03.

Looking at our packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter 2019 of $303
million, with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 21% versus last year's EBITDA of $352 million,
and sales of $1.5 billion or a 23% margin.

We continue to run our containerboard system to demand in a very cost-effective manner. Our mill
production supplied the necessary containerboard to achieve a new all-time quarterly record for box
shipments per day and a new fourth quarter record for total box shipments, allowing us to maintain our
industry-leading integration rate.

PACKAGING CORPORATION OF AMERICA FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Our new box plant in Richland, Washington had an excellent start-up during the quarter, and we're now
beginning to take full advantage of the benefits from our machine conversion at the Wallula Mill with its
flexibility to produce from the heavier weight high-performance linerboard grades all the way down to the
lighter weight high-performance grades. This gives us the capability to further optimize the mix and the
inventory levels of the entire containerboard system, and provide the type and the quality of board needed
for our customers on the West Coast and in the Pacific Northwest and reduced our system-wide freight and
logistics costs, which in the fourth quarter alone, provided over $2 million of benefit.

For the full year 2019, packaging segment EBITDA, excluding special items, was $1.3 billion, with sales
of $5.3 billion, or a 22.1% margin compared to full year 2018 EBITDA of $1.4 billion, with sales of $5.9
billion or 23.6% margin.

I'm now going to turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales in the
corrugating business.

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

Thanks, Mark. As Mark indicated, in corrugated products, we had an all-time record quarterly box
shipments per day, which were up 0.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as a record fourth
quarter total shipments, which were up 2.3% over last year. Outside sales volume of containerboard was
6.2% below last year's fourth quarter while up 3.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to higher
export volume.

For the full year 2019, we established new annual records for total box shipments and box shipments
per day both up 0.9% versus 2018. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix,
together, were $0.43 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 and down $0.14 per share versus
the third quarter of 2019 due to a less rich mix. Export containerboard prices were $0.14 per share below
fourth quarter 2018 levels and down $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019.

I'll now turn it back to Mark.

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thanks, Tom. Looking at the paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter, was
$53 million with sales of $244 million or a 22% margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 EBITDA of
$52 million and sales of $227 million or 23% margin. We did a good job managing our inventories during
the quarter as we ran the system to demand and reduced our office paper inventories by almost 10%
versus the third quarter of 2019.

Volumes during the quarter -- or volume during the quarter was better than anticipated at levels above
last year as well as the third quarter of 2019, and prices and mix were lower as expected, although
slightly better than anticipated as well. Throughout the quarter, the mills

control over input costs and freight in logistics expenses.

For the full year 2019, Paper segment EBITDA, excluding special items, was $213 million and sales were
$964 million or 22% margin compared to full year 2000 (sic) [ 2018 ] EBITDA of $165 million with sales
of $1 billion or 16% margin. These results are the best we've ever achieved and reflect the hard work and
dedication by all employees in our paper business as well as the strategic decision to exit the white paper
and pressure-sensitive business at the Wallula Mill back in 2017.

I'm now going to turn it over to Bob.

PACKAGING CORPORATION OF AMERICA FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Thanks, Mark. We have very good cash generation in the fourth quarter with cash provided by operations
of $329 million and free cash flow of $194 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included
capital expenditures of $136 million, common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $31 million for
redemption premiums and fees associated with our debt refinancing, $34 million for federal and state
income tax payments, pension payments of $4 million and net interest payments of $35 million. In
addition, in order to generate higher interest income for a portion of our cash, $146 million moved from
cash to marketable securities on our balance sheet during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $679
million of cash on hand or $825 million if you include the marketable securities.

During the quarter, we refinanced $900 million of our existing 2.45% notes maturing in 2020 and 3.9%
notes maturing in 2022, with new 10- and 30-year notes. This resulted in only a marginal increase in
the company's average cash interest rate of just over 0.1%, and extended the company's overall debt
maturity from 4.1 years to 10.3 years. Gross debt remained unchanged at $2.5 billion.

For the full year 2019, cash from operations was a record $1.2 billion. Capital spending was $399 million,
and free cash flow was a record $808 million. Our final effective tax rate for 2019 was 24%, and our final
cash tax rate was 19%.

Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital
expenditures to be between $400 million to $425 million. DD&A is expected to be approximately $400
million, pension and postretirement benefit expense of $22 million, and we expect to make cash pension
and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $85 million. Our full year interest expense in 2020 is
expected to be approximately $81 million and net cash interest payments should be about $84 million.
The estimate for our 2020 combined federal and state cash tax rate is approximately 19% and for our
book effective tax rate, approximately 25%.

As we mentioned during the last quarter's earnings call, we have a heavy volume of scheduled mill
outages in 2020. In total, we are planning for 9 outages this year versus 6 in 2019. 4 of these scheduled
outages at 3 of our containerboard mills and 1 of our paper mills are planned for the first quarter versus
only 2 outages in last year's first quarter. This will have a negative impact on earnings per share of
approximately $0.09, moving from the fourth quarter of '19 to the first quarter of 2020 and $0.06 per
share versus the first quarter of 2019.

The total earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs
is expected to be $0.81 per share compared to $0.60 per share for 2019. The current estimated impact by
quarter in 2020 is $0.24 per share in the first quarter, $0.17 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter, and
$0.27 per share in the fourth quarter.

I'll now turn it back to Mark.

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move into the first quarter of 2020. In our packaging segment,
we expect lower prices as the remaining impact of the published domestic containerboard prices -- price
decreases from last year worked through the system as well as the negative impact from the recent
January decreases in the published prices for linerboard and medium. We also expect lower export prices.
Containerboard volumes will be lower due to scheduled outages at our 3 largest mills during the quarter.
But we do expect higher corrugated product shipments.

In our Paper segment, volumes will be lower due to the better-than-expected levels in the fourth quarter
as well as the scheduled outage we have at our Jackson and Alabama mill. As Bob mentioned earlier,
scheduled outage costs will be significantly higher than with the 4 scheduled in the first quarter versus
just 1 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Freight costs will be higher due to rail rate increases in certain areas
and scheduled outage related increases. Labor and benefit costs will be higher with annual wage increases
and other timing-related expenses. There will be inflation with purchased electricity and most of our
chemical and repair and material costs, while seasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood

costs. We also expect our tax rate and depreciation expense to be slightly higher. Considering these items,
we expect first quarter earnings of $1.20 per share.

With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements
we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current
estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties,
including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-
K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking
statements.
And with that, Mariana, I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you.

Question and Answer

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.

[Audio Gap]

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

And so the integration continues -- will continue to aid our margins.

Clyde Alvin Dillon
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes. So maybe -- just maybe I'll comment a little bit on the consumer integration elements that you
touched on. And just the way we look at this is in SBS, we have about 40% of our volume that serve some
specialty markets such as tobacco, commercial print and liquid packaging. And in those situations, we're
really specified down to the end user and sell the...

Your next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I know pricing discussion, we need to avoid too much of a forward look guidance, I don't want to go
beyond what you normally are comfortable with. But when we look at the bridge, fourth quarter versus
fourth quarter relative to third quarter versus third quarter, there was a bit of an increased amount or a
larger negative on price mix and packaging and I think the third quarter was around $0.36, and it was
more like $0.50-plus this quarter. Was that purely the rollover or the continued effect of prior pricing
rolling through the contracts? Was there any other effect that maybe we should be mindful of, either
mix or what have you? And while I wouldn't expect it was that big of a deal, is any of this related to the
recycled liner index that's gone in? And I had a couple of follow-ons.

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

George, this is Tom. I'll just tell you that it was -- the price variance was primarily related to the rollover
of the price decreases that had taken place through the year. But also as we mentioned, it was mix related
as well, both fourth quarter over fourth quarter and third quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So that's
pretty much it on the pricing side. The recycled liner, what impact did that have? I mean it's virtually not
impactful to us in our businesses, as we mentioned before.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. I wouldn't have expected it. I know you might not want to go too much into detail, if at all here, but
what was maybe a little bit less good for you in mix this quarter? Was it just export being up sequentially?
Or is there anything else there? And could you give us a quick update on e-commerce? And then my last
question, I'll turn it over. You mentioned paper volumes were better than expected. Why was that the case
relative to what was going on in the market? What do you think was going well for you from a commercial
standpoint?

PACKAGING CORPORATION OF AMERICA FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Okay. George, I'd say, your question regarding mix. I mean we don't really talk about our mix much.
It's obvious that export was up and that that had a dramatic impact, and that was -- as far as mix is
concerned, that was the biggest part of the impact. E-commerce, e-commerce remains strong. It -- I think
as we've talked about before, it's maturing somewhat as a market. So I think as an industry, we've got a
much better handle on it. And those sales were up earlier in the quarter than the emergency stuff that we
typically would see right at the end of the quarter. Regarding paper volumes, I'll turn it back to Mark real
quick.

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, the third quarter sales were lower than we had expected, but also if you compare year-over-year,
we were on allocation most of 2018. And then we came into 2019, and we're getting back in balance. But
again, third quarter was lower. And we had a number of key customers pick up their volume significantly
during the fourth quarter. So we can't provide a lot of details on that, except to say that obviously, we
were pleased with the volume that developed.

Operator

Our apologies for the quirks. Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research.

Clyde Alvin Dillon
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Hopefully, you guys can hear me okay?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, Chip, go ahead.

Clyde Alvin Dillon
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. Okay. My first question has to do with -- when we think about the downtime you guys are taking
quite a bit for maintenance this year. And my guess is there's a lot that I think a lot of -- we don't maybe
fully understand how much preparation goes into that. And so my question is, as you look at the world
from, say, 18 months ago, when the industry was so tight and now, it's a bit looser. Is that affecting the
timing of some of this maintenance? In other words, did you have an incentive to kind of push it out a
little bit, say, 2 years ago, 1.5 years ago? And now this is a better time to be pursuing some of this work?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

No, Chip. The way our shutdowns fall, some of the mills now are on an 18-month rotation. And so there
are some years that we actually end up with a skip year on some of the mills and then just the way
the boiler work and turbine generator work falls in, you end up with a first quarter such as what we're
describing. So it has nothing to do with meeting demand or managing inventories. It's just basically
adhering to our maintenance policies and our requirements to take care of the mill assets.

Clyde Alvin Dillon
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. If you could update us a little bit on the project to
add recycling capability to Wallula. And are you buying recycled board for certain box customers right
now? And will that mean you won't be buying recycled board, at least in the Western United States as that
project ramps up?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

PACKAGING CORPORATION OF AMERICA FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

For the first part of the question, we expect to have the OCC plant up and running by the end of the year
at Wallula, so that's well on schedule. And then Tom, do you want to address the second question?

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

Yes. Chip, we don't buy recycled on the outside market. As we've said many, many times, our customers
require a performance-based containerboard, which is primarily all virgin. Now even the recycled project
at Wallula is designed to just be able to add some recycling to the furnish, it does not change the fact that
it will be a virgin board.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.

Jesse Barone;BMO Capital Markets;Analyst

This is Jesse Barone on for Mark. Just our first question. You guys are sitting on quite a bit of cash. Can
you kind of talk about what your capital allocation is looking like for 2020? And kind of your plans for all
that cash?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

The plans haven't changed, and we called out the capital down in that lower $400 million level, $400
million, $425 million. We still remain -- in terms of our cash uses, we will be opportunistic, and that could
be share buyback, acquisitions, and then just capital opportunities in general, but we're quite content with
where we are and what the cash is doing. And again, as I said on a few prior calls, for every cash -- a
dollar of cash we're not spending, we're certainly not wasting it. So it's -- it will provide good value at the
right time.

Jesse Barone;BMO Capital Markets;Analyst

And then just 1 follow-up for me. Are you guys sensing any impact on the export markets from Finnish
pulp and paper strike?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I haven't seen anything. Tom, do you see anything? Bob?

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

No, no, we haven't seen anything to date, no.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Mark, we're accustomed to seeing you build inventories ahead of big maintenance outages. And now
you've got a really big maintenance outage and you've actually let inventories go down. So can you talk
about your inventory levels and whether you've sort of -- are inventories higher than I think? Or are you
just running better and you're content with less inventory?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, there are 2 factors there. When we came through the month of September, and we were looking
at our plans for 4Q. Obviously, we had to anticipate the start-up of the new Richland box plant. And that

10

PACKAGING CORPORATION OF AMERICA FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

obviously impacts the Wallula Mill production. So the fact that the Richland box plant was on schedule
and started up -- and started running extremely well. We had to supply that. Also our demand across the
board for corrugated products, for containerboard outside some extra export sales required that we had
to start running the system to full capacity during the last couple of weeks of September, and that full
capacity running mode continued right through the entire fourth quarter.

Now part of the equation also is that during the last year, we have also worked diligently across the
linerboard system to develop our own, what we'll call special grade mix of high-performance virgin kraft
linerboard for our own usage. And so it's moving the system into a lighter weight, high-performance
capability. And so we sold some extra tons. And then tons that would have shown up because you were
running an older grade mix would have been a heavier basis weight grade mix, that also was part of the
equation. But net-net, business was obviously good, and we continue to supply.

We also with the ability of the Wallula Mill, we can supply the entire system now in the West Coast. And
I mentioned that on the commentary that in terms of the total system inventory requirements and how
we look at that need, we also have to consider the fact that you saw boxes on a square foot basis. And
so when we look at our inventories now, we start to think in terms of square feet of containerboard in
our inventory system, not just pure tons because of the mix we're dealing with. So it's complicated. But
bottom line, we ran full out and we're having to run full now into this part of the year. Obviously, with
the outages that we're facing, we come out of these outages, as we've always done, we're going to have
to run very well to continue to supply the demand on the packaging side of the business. That's a long
answer to a short question.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

No, well, it's a good problem to have, too. You mentioned reoptimizing the whole system with the impact
of Richland, how long will it take for Richland to fill up with the right kind of business? And then how long
will that reoptimization around the system take?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

We actually started the plant up in November. And as of the first part of January, we're running right on
plan. Now plant obviously has a ramp-up with our customer base, but we're extremely pleased. The plant,
as you could imagine, is a high-volume, highly automated plant, high capacity, a lot of flexibility in the
plant, but Tom is going to be filling that order book out. Tom, do you want to comment, again, with just a
good start-up, and we're really happy with what we're seeing here.

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

Mark, I would just say that we're slightly ahead of plan right now, and I think we'll be well ahead of plan
as the year rolls out, and that's about the extent of what I'm going to comment on.

Operator

Your next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.

Brian P. Maguire
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Just wanted to come back to earlier questions around the mix. Just wondering why there was an increase
in exports in the quarter given obviously those are lower prices and sort of negative, what drove the sort
of shift towards the export market? And maybe if you could just remind us, the Board you sell externally,
how many times it is roughly going into the domestic market and the export market now?

PACKAGING CORPORATION OF AMERICA FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Well, again, as the fourth quarter rolled through, we ended up with a lot of the legacy customers. Again,
we moved tons probably into 35 different countries around the world, small volumes of these are legacy
customers that you've heard us refer to through many years. And we ended up with what we believe was
adequate volume in our own domestic system, and we were able to satisfy some of these requirements
from our legacy customers offshore. And Tom, do you want to add to that?

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

Yes. In addition, I'd just say that we typically have higher exports in the fourth quarter. I think in
this particular case, we had customers who were holding off, they were operating on very, very low
inventories, and became necessary to pick up the pace in the fourth quarter.

Brian P. Maguire
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And the overall integration level still in the sort of low 90s? And I guess within that remaining, if it's 8%,
9% or 10% kind of it's margin, is it roughly split between domestic and export or mostly export?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

If you look at the full year, as we're starting to look at things, we ended 2019 with obviously the Richland
box plant coming on as planned. And so when you balance all of that supply and demand, we're quickly
approaching that 94%, 95% level, which as we said a few years ago, at 94%, 95% level, that's what we
consider full integration. And so last year, through the first 3 quarters, we were down in the low 90%
range integration, but we've moved up. And so we're going to have to run full this year in order to supply
our anticipated order book. So we're in a good place.

Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.

Randy Devin Toth
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

This is actually Randy Toth sitting in for Anthony. In the release, you mentioned running to demand again.
And I think in the past, that was a direct reference to Wallula now running to design capacity. My first
question is, is that still what that is referencing? And the second question is with Richland coming up the
start-up curve, do you think you can start running Wallula full out in 1Q, 2Q? Just how do you think about
that?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. We're using that term running to demand in terms of where we are right now, that means running
full out because we have the demand across our system. With Wallula specifically and where the Richland
plant and the West Coast footprint is, we're running Wallula to capacity as we speak. We've been
running Wallula hard throughout the fourth quarter. And we'll have some opportunity to fine-tune the
operations over the next year or 2. I've spoken about that in the past year or 2 as we've always seen, on a
conversion project, like what we've completed out there. Over the following subsequent year or 2, you find
ways to stretch the machine out. Some of it will be some capital spending. But for the short-term period,
right now, Wallula is running hard and running full to capacity to meet the demand internally.

Randy Devin Toth
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And then with CapEx flat to slightly up year-over-year. Is there any large-scale box
plant project that we should know about similar to Richland in 2020? Or just how should we think about
that?

PACKAGING CORPORATION OF AMERICA FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

We have numerous projects going on across the system, optimization projects. We've got 1 big
corrugator project going on out in the West Coast in the Pacific Northwest region. But we have a lot of
projects throughout the 95 box plant system that are the small $0.5 million, $1 million projects, just
debottlenecking and taking advantage of the fact that, again, we've got a good opportunity to supply the
customer base, and we're taking advantage of that. So there's no 1 big new plant project like we just
finished at Richland for this year. It's just a host of smaller opportunities, which is actually good. It means
we don't have a lot of risk on the table.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

A couple of follow-ups. First, just wanted to clarify, I think you indicated that the maintenance outages
was going to be $0.81 this year. Was -- did you say that was against $0.60 last year?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. And now does that or doesn't include the impact of the reduced containerboard production?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. Yes, that's part of it. I think I said in the prepared remarks, Mark, that it included the tons that are
involved with those outages.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. I guess people are trying to figure out the drivers is to the extent of the decline in the 1Q guide
versus at least where the consensus numbers had been. And so kind of 1 of the questions is, what besides
-- there's something related, there's some number here related to the outages, which is timing related.
Is there anything else that you might call out as being more timing related than normal that would be
depressing the 1Q number relative to where profitability would typically -- the trajectory typically would be
over the course of the year?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, Mark. There are, as usual, going from the fourth to the first quarter. If you sort of look at the buckets
that are of that nature you're describing. Certainly, wages and benefits, certainly a lot of timing things
there as everything resets for a new year. The seasonal usage with the weather-related impacts on wood
and energy and chemicals, to an extent. And we also this year, we have a -- going from 4Q to 1Q, we
have a stock-based comp item of about $0.03 that just because the granting of these options, I mean
these restricted stock units and what have you, historically had occurred in the second quarter, now it's in
the first quarter. So you'll see a negative there, but you'll -- obviously, that turns back the other way as
you move into the second quarter. And obviously, outages, based on the guidance I gave, that will improve
going into the second quarter. Paper volumes, it's -- we expect that to normalize as we move out of the --
from the Q1 to Q2. And freight, some of that freight was outage related, less able to optimize our system.

PACKAGING CORPORATION OF AMERICA FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

So when you add all those things together, you could be, pick up $0.15, $0.20 kind of thing as you move
from Q1 to Q2.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And then lastly, I noticed that the cash balance went down in the fourth quarter.
And given the type of cash from operations I would have expected you to be generating, I guess, I would
have thought it would have gone up. And it looked like gross debt, even with all the refinancing stayed the
same. So can you maybe fill in the blank there?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, the cash, like I said, the -- we moved the $146 million out of what's considered cash on the balance
sheet to marketable securities. So you really need to -- you count that. And then I think your numbers will
work out.

Operator

Your next question comes from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And I apologize if you touched on this earlier, sometime a little bit late. But CapEx, I think you're guiding
to $400 million to $425 million, and I'm assuming embedded within there are some return-oriented
projects, the hydro pulper over in Wallula. Did you speak at all in terms of any capacity creep or additions
that you might be making? Or are these all centered on cost reduction, I'm assuming? But.

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

It's primarily the -- if you think about big projects that we're involved in right now. We've got the new
boiler up at Filer City Mill that's being completed this spring and summer. That's 1 bigger piece of CapEx.
It's -- again, that's a total project cost in that $50 million neighborhood. But for this year, the new projects
that we're looking at, as I called out without mentioning specifics, is a new corrugator at 1 of our Pacific
Northwest operations. And then just a host of a lot of the smaller opportunities throughout the converting
side of the equation to satisfy what we see as good box demand growth. And then the project at Wallula
Mill with the new OCC plant. But again, there's a lot of business opportunity, capital spending and then
cost reductions in capital spending.

Operator

Your next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Bob, just 1 clarification. Just 1 clarification on Mark Weintraub's question about the bridge, the $0.15 to
$0.20 that you mentioned, is that inclusive of outage cost being $0.07 lower sequentially, 1Q to 2Q?

Robert P. Mundy
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And Tom, forgive me if I missed it. Can you talk at all about January demand trends you're
seeing just relative to perhaps what you saw in the fourth quarter?

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

Yes, Adam. Right now, our January trend is, and we're pretty much through the month, we're up 1.5%.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That blended, I forget if there's a shipping day difference?

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

No, that's on a per-day -- that's on a per-day basis. 1.5% on a per-day basis.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Tom, just following on that last question, that up 1.5% in January, how much would that have been helped
by the Richland startup?

Thomas A. Hassfurther
Executive Vice President of Corrugated Products

It's slightly helped by the Richland startup, Mark. I don't have the exact breakdown, but I mean it's going
to be relatively small in this January number. And -- but as the quarter rolls on, it will become more
important to us.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. All right. And then Mark, I wondered if we can just come back to Wallula and that OCC system
you're putting in. It seems like when that's up and running, you're going to be long, a lot of fiber at that
mill. I know one of the plans might be to just kind of creep the volume on the paper machines over time,
but can you just help us understand how you plan to optimize between the existing virgin pulp mill and all
this additional recycled fiber?

Mark W. Kowlzan
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. Keep in mind that the Wallula facility is our highest cost fiber basket in the Lower 48 states. And
so the OCC and some of the DLK we currently use really will give us the ultimate fiber flexibility to take
advantage of the marketplace on the entire fiber basket in that Pacific Northwest region. And so it truly
will give us an opportunity to really satisfy the mill requirements. And also keep in mind, we do anticipate,
over the future years, of ramping up the Wallula #3 capability. We have some opportunity that does
require some capital, but we're quite satisfied with where we are right now on a machine productivity,
and so it's a matter of just finishing up this project. The OCC plant is, again, it's a 1,000-ton a day design
system, but it will give us truly some great opportunities to optimize the fiber cost at that location.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Just 1 other little one on that. So if you pivot more toward recycled fiber there, do you also have to
spend some more capital, just putting in more boiler capacity to kind of complement that OCC system?
