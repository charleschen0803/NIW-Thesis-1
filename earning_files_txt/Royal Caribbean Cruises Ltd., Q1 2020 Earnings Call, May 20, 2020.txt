Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Sia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to Royal Caribbean's Group Business Update and First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our business update
and first quarter earnings call. Joining me virtually from their home offices are Richard Fain, our Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and
Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few
slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.

Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is
on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements
do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in
our SEC filings and other disclosures. Please note that we do not undertake to update the information
in our filings as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures,
which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our
website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency-adjusted basis.

Richard will begin the call by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will then follow with an
update of our liquidity actions we have taken to date. I will then provide an update on the booking
environment, and then I will provide a recap of our first quarter results. We will then open up the call for
your questions. Richard?

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I hope that everybody on this call is safe and healthy. These
are troubled times, and we all need to take care of ourselves as well as remembering the first responders
and others who are working so hard to protect our communities.

Obviously, our industry and our company are undergoing unprecedented challenges, and we are having
to quickly adapt to this new and evolving environment. But our priorities are clear. We will work to protect
the safety of our guests and crew. We will proactively enhance our liquidity. We will protect the company's
brands and our travel partners. And we will define and prepare for a new normal.

In the 2 months since we suspended operations, we've been working tirelessly to safely repatriate our
guests and crew members to their homes. Our crew come from more than 100 countries around the world
with widely different safety protocols and travel restrictions. This has turned what should be a simple task
into a monumental one. It's really hard to convey the complexity of the process to somebody who's used
to making simple travel arrangements, but our teams are working around the clock with the multitude of
governing bodies to repatriate our crews as soon as possible. We've even gone to the extent of using our
ships as transport vessels and currently have 9 ships carrying more than 10,000 crew members back to
their home countries. It's a complex and expensive way to do it, but it's the most reliable way to get these
men and women home to their families as quickly as possible. And therefore, we've undertaken to do it
this way.

We've also implemented actions to provide guests with some flexibility and peace of mind as they look
forward to resuming their travel. To this end, we have implemented the Cruise with Confidence program,
where guests have the flexibility to cancel their cruises up to 48 hours prior to sailing and receive a full

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

credit on the cruise fare for a future cruise. We have recently enhanced this program with our lift and shift
program -- or lift and shift option, which gives our guests even more comfort for the time ahead. We're
delighted to say that these programs have been very well received as they benefit both our guests and our
liquidity profile.

In a few moments, Jason will provide more details regarding our results during the first quarter and the
proactive steps that we've been taking to address the current environment with a focus on cost reductions
and on liquidity. First, though, I'd like to talk about the future and the steps that we're taking to address
that future. It's useful to reflect on how quickly our world has changed and how quickly our understanding
of this awful disease has evolved. It's amazing to think it's only been 2 months since we suspended
operations.

When I think back to how little we understood then about this disease, it's remarkable. Over the period,
the pace of new information and understanding has been astounding. Things that we were told were right
one week became unthinkable merely a week later. The flow of information has been so fast, it's been
hard to assimilate. Fortunately, our level of understanding and that of governments around the world is
beginning to stabilize or at least seems to be. We're all beginning to understand the do's and don'ts. And
the tight strictures are beginning to loosen. It's still very early days, but these are auspicious signs.

Obviously, the most immediate question that you would all like to know is when cruising will restart.
And we'd like to know it, too. The world is clearly embarking on a program of gradually opening up. That
process is just beginning, and it varies widely between geographical areas. It's also highly dependent on
many different factors, including the availability of testing, contact tracing, therapeutics and, ultimately,
vaccines.

While it's very difficult to have any certainty around the timing or shape of recovery, we do intend to
make sure that we are prepared for it and for the changes it will entail. To this end, we are focused on all
aspects of our safe return-to-service strategy, with special emphasis on safety, security and health. We
know that the public expects that we will elevate our health and safety protocols to a new level. And we
are prepared to make sure that we meet and exceed those expectations.

We're trying to use this time wisely. We have been and are working on ways to up our game in this field
to ensure that we use our ingenuity, our passion and our innovation to raise the bar to new heights. We
are calling our aspirational program the Healthy Return to Service program. The program will have 4 main
focuses: upgraded screening prior to boarding, enhanced processes and procedures onboard, special
focus on addressing the destinations we visit and procedures for dealing with any reports of exceptions.
We recognize that this is an extremely complex area, and we have assembled a blue-ribbon team of
experts to advise us on the right approach. Our goal is to raise our standards to entirely new levels, and
we believe that the Healthy Return to Service program will help us get there. We have the time. We have
the determination, and we have the expertise.

It is tempting to start talking now about all the individual components of how things will change. However,
we're still defining all those enhancements, and we're still taking guidance from our expert advisers. And
this process will continue in keeping with our mantra of continuous improvement. We are better prepared
today than we were yesterday, and we will be better yet prepared tomorrow, but the one thing that won't
change is our determination that we will not start operations until we are fully ready to do so with all of
the hygiene and other health protocols solidly in place.

Besides addressing the scientific aspects of all things related to COVID-19, we also need to restore the
confidence of many by being transparent in our actions and communicating extensively. We will not rush
this work, but it is not an exaggeration to say that we're working on it around the clock.

The other area I'd like to briefly discuss is our longer-term strategy, the reputation of our brands, the
strong relationships with our travel agent partners, our great customer base and our innovative and agile
culture should all serve as an advantage when this crisis is over.

Just a few weeks ago, we were set to enjoy the best year in our company's history, fueled by a huge
demand for our products. That has not suddenly vanished. We know that the basic human desire to

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

explore and to travel will persist with a continued focus on seeking out experiences as opposed to things.
Our responsibility is to be in the best position possible when travel resumes.

I'd really like to draw an analogy to 9/11, which I think is quite apropos. I recalled that in the aftermath
of that horrible event, lots of people said that travel and tourism were history. People would never travel
again, especially on airplanes. On the other hand, soon after, I heard people refer to the exact same
situation and say that, ultimately, 9/11 had no impact on travel. These people argued that people were
traveling more and they were traveling as though 9/11 never happened.

My view is that both comments are simply wrong. It is demonstrably untrue that people stopped traveling
as a result of 9/11. In fact, after a period of adjustment, travel took off, sorry for the pun. On the other
hand, it equally isn't true that, after the period of adjustment, travel reverted to the status quo ante. In
fact, travel became very different from pre 9/11. What happened was that we adjusted. And all travel that
took place in the post-9/11 world was really quite different from travel previously. It's hard to remember
that, but that dynamic took place. Travel didn't simply revert to what it had been. Rather, travel adjusted
to the new normal, and it grew on that basis.

I believe personally that the same thing is going to happen in a post-COVID-19 world. Travel and tourism
will grow, but not by reverting to what it was, but by adjusting to a world where all activities, everything
we do in the world, will have changed. Our industry is resilient, and we will come back strong, but we'll do
so not by mimicking what we used to do, but by innovating our product to meeting the exciting demands
of the world as it is.

We've been proactive in taking the steps to reduce our costs, to manage cash flow and to secure liquidity
to weather the storm. And Jason is going to talk about that in a minute. We're also actively focused on
positioning our brands to emerge in a strong position as guests resume their travel over the coming
months and beyond.

With that, I'll turn the microphone back to Jason. Jason?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Richard. So I'd first like to thank our teams across the whole enterprise for their dedication
and tireless efforts during these unprecedented times. During the past few months since our pausing of
operations, we have intensely focused our efforts on preserving cash and enhancing our liquidity profile.
To keep investors and stakeholders up-to-date, we have provided several updates which detail our efforts
through press releases and 8-Ks.

Since our last earnings call, we have focused on reducing our operating expenses, also reducing or
deferring our capital expenditures, improving our debt maturity profile and securing additional capital.
We have significantly reduced our running expenses as the ships transition into various levels of layup.
We have eliminated or significantly reduced marketing and selling expenses during our out-of-service
period, and we have taken painful but swift actions to reduce G&A by reducing our teams or furloughing
employees.

As it pertains to our capital expenditures, our teams have done an exceptional job of reducing or
deferring our 2020 capital needs by more than 65%. Our updated capital expenditures for 2020 are now
approximately $1.7 billion with only $500 million that remains to be spent for the balance of the year.

Now shifting to our debt maturities. We have been able to obtain a 12-month debt amortization holiday
for most of our vessels' payments, bringing our debt maturities down to $400 million for the remainder
of 2020. And lastly, we have been very active in the capital markets, raising almost $4 billion additional
liquidity since our last call.

Overall, we estimate our cash burn to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million per month during a
prolonged suspension of operations. This range includes ongoing ship operating expenses, administrative
expenses, debt service, hedging costs and expected necessary CapEx. It excludes refunds of customer
deposits as well as cash inflows from new and existing bookings. More than 60% of this cash burn is

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

related to operating expenses, which we expect to reduce further onto a more prolonged out-of-service
scenario.

Through all these measures, we have been able to improve the company's liquidity profile by
approximately $12 billion for 2020 and '21 combined. Having said this, we continue to explore other
opportunities to improve our liquidity profile, given the magnitude and uncertain duration of the COVID-19
impact.

I will now update you on the business outlook, as I know this is top of mind for many. We began the
year in a strong booked position and experienced a record-breaking start to the wave period, which
resulted in a nice yield growth for January and February sailings. Then everything changed as COVID-19
spread beyond Asia and became a global pandemic. On March 13, we announced that, for the first
time in our history, we would suspend cruise operations for 30 days. Since then, we have extended the
suspension further. And in total, we have canceled 621 voyages and reduced our capacity for the year by
approximately 25%.

From a demand standpoint, our bookings started to deteriorate in mid-February and then fell to levels
that were materially lower than prior year on the onset of the global cruise suspension in mid-March. At
the same time, near-term cancellations increased substantially, while cancellations for '21 remain at more
typical levels. While bookings still remain suppressed, they are better now than they were in mid-April
driven by improved trends for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021 sales. For the remainder of 2020, we
are booked well behind the same time last year in load factor with prices down low single digits. It is still
very early in the booking cycle for 2021. But at this point, load factors are below same time last year but
are within historical ranges. Prices for '21 booked business are currently up in the mid-single-digit range.

Our current booking trends indicate that there is demand for cruising. However, our guests now require
more flexibility than ever. And to provide that flexibility, we have introduced the Cruising with Confidence
program. Also, we have provided guests who are booked on suspended sailings with the option of a 125%
future cruise certificate in lieu of cash refunds. To date, approximately 45% of the guests who are booked
on one of these voyages has requested a refund and the remainder are holding an FCC. Approximately
20% of the guests who have been issued FCCs have already rebooked on future voyages. Most rebooked
on similar itineraries and many are actually using 125% value to upgrade to a higher stateroom category.
As you may expect, that our loyalty guests are redeeming their FCCs at a much faster pace than non-
loyalty guests.

I will now shift the focus to our results for the first quarter of 2020. These results are summarized on Slide
2. This quarter was really a tale of 2 quarters. During the first 6 weeks of the year, booking trends were
strong across all our major geographies, except for Asia, with North American-based sailings trending
particularly well. While we were extremely pleased with booking trends for most itineraries, we were
particularly impressed with the prices we were achieving for sailings visiting Perfect Day at CocoCay,
particularly those on our modernized ships. Even though we started canceling sailings in Asia at the end of
January, we were still booked at a strong load factor in prices and were poised for another strong year of
yield growth.

On March 13, we suspended our global operations. This decision, combined with earlier cancelations
in Asia, resulted in the cancellation of 130 sailings during the first quarter, a reduction in capacity of
approximately 20% versus guided. The impact of COVID-19 also led to the recording of a $1.1 billion
noncash asset impairment charge. As a result, we recorded a net loss on a U.S.-GAAP basis of $1.4 billion
or $6.91 per share and an adjusted net loss of $310 million or $1.48 per share -- negative $1.48 per
share. The loss for the quarter was driven entirely by the COVID-19 impact.

The timing and trajectory of a recovery remains uncertain, so we are unable to provide further guidance
for the year. However, the company does expect to incur a net loss on both a GAAP and adjusted basis for
the second quarter and 2020 fiscal year. The magnitude of the loss will depend on the timing and extent of
our return to service.

As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, these are extraordinary times. We have made solid
progress in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our business and are prepared for the wide range of

scenarios that could play out. We feel confident that we will come through this successfully and can't wait
to start delivering amazing vacations again.
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Thanks for all the details. That was very helpful. So Jason, it's pretty clear that you guys are in a pretty
good liquidity position right now. But I guess if you remain in a zero-revenue environment for an extended
period of time, can you help us think about what other options you have down the road to further increase
liquidity? I mean we've seen your competitors go down the highly dilutive convert-an-equity path. And just
wondering what your appetite is for something like that.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Steve. And thanks for the comments. So this -- yesterday, we closed on our bond that we launched
last week. And we were really happy with the additional liquidity we were able to gain by raising that
money. But the other thing that we were really happy about is that, by raising that bond, it really provides
a lot of flexibility for us to raise additional capital, especially debt. So there's a pretty significant basket
and flexibility on our ability to raise additional debt. But -- and I would also add that we believe that our
return-to-service plans, as we consider them, that we have adequate liquidity. But if those circumstances
change, and depending on how things play out, we would certainly need to consider all alternatives that
would be available to us.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

But to add on to that, the equity/convert would be your last option that you would want to do?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

I would say that we are very sensitive to dilution. And I -- but overall, I think that we purposely made sure
we had maximum flexibility on the debt side.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then second question would be around, how do you see a return to service for your ships
around the rest of the world? It seems like everybody right now is so focused on the CDC and what they're
telling you to do here in the U.S. But given your strong position in China and your JV with TUI, couldn't
you guys start operations around the rest of the world sooner than here in the U.S.? And I guess if that
answer is a yes, do you fear there could be some potential negative pushback from the CDC or the U.S.
government?

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Steve, it's Michael. Interestingly, yesterday, I was on the CLIA European executive committee call, where
we had an extensive update from all of the national directors in the various European countries. And I
would say that, from the feedback from that call yesterday and then the discussion we've had with our
China team in Shanghai, it's a very different story by region and by country. And I think it's highly likely
that either the Asian markets and China, for example, or the European region could come back earlier
because, of course, they went through this experience earlier, and that's particularly true of China.

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

So we're very aware of these different landscapes. And I think we're also relatively pleased that we have
this global infrastructure that we can leverage to utilize that opportunity if it does materialize. I think with
your comments about the CDC, obviously we are highly focused on ensuring, as Richard started this whole
call, with ensuring the safety and a Healthy Return to Service. So however we return to service, we're only
going to return to service, regardless of regional market, when we believe that we have a Healthy Return
to Service plan that's deemed as the right way forward and our guests will be comforted by that plan.

So it's interesting. I think we will see different markets come back at a different pace. And I think
our global infrastructure and the strength of our brands is really going to power us through those
opportunities.

Operator

The next question will come from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Jason, just getting back to the liquidity question, it seems like so many companies across different sectors,
not just cruise, are accessing the markets as much as they can, given that the window is open now. So
some may view your decision to wait as risky. So I'm just wondering, should we read into the fact that you
haven't secured any incremental liquidity on top of what you've already done that you feel more optimistic
than others regarding the recovery?

And then also, can you just help us understand how you're thinking about your roll-up? You're mentioning
that -- you did mention that you're starting to see demand for fourth quarter. So just wondering how we
should think about the amount of capacity that you'll roll out as the industry opens.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I'll take the first one. I think the way that you would read it is I don't think we're overly optimistic.
I think we're being -- looking at the reality of the situation. And when we kind of evaluate our different
return-to-service plans and different scenarios, that was the impetus for us raising the capital that we
did this past week. So again, I think we have to see how things play out. And I think that we have a lot
of -- we have quality brands, quality assets. And I think that we would evaluate the market if we see
circumstances change outside of the different scenarios that we're evaluating. So I wouldn't read into it at
all that we're optimistic. I think I would read into it that we think we've taken the actions on the capital-
raising side based off of what we currently think. And we also think that there's more opportunity for us to
do on the cost and capital side to further reduce our burn rate.

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

And Felicia, this is Richard, and I'll just comment on the process of returning to service. I think we don't
expect that this is going to be that someday somebody blows a horn and all the ships start operating right
away. The -- we think that it will be a gradual start, a little bit like societies in opening up gradually. And
so we would imagine that we would start with smaller -- with fewer ships and more likely to be more drive
markets in the beginning, and it would then evolve and grow from there.

I also think, coming back to the earlier question, there's such big differences between what's happening
in different countries, what's happening in the local society, what different mix of where the ships are and
where they're going. So I also think that you'll see that high degree of variability depending on what area
of the world you're talking about. But to answer your second question, we see that as a slow and gradual
thing, not suddenly a lot of ships coming back in the market.

Felicia Rae Kantor Hendrix

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

And then just, Jason, just quickly a follow-up on your answer to my -- to the first question. Just when you
were talking -- you've said in several of your filings that you continue to look at reducing on the cash burn
on the cost and capital side. Just wondering, is one of those options to -- would be to transition more to
more cold layup among your fleet? Just from the language that's been in your filings, it seems that you
have much more of your ships in warm layup versus where your competitors are.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

That's one avenue. I mean our teams have done an exceptional job of really reducing the operating costs
while the ships are not operating. And there is opportunity to move some of them into a cooler type of
layup. But I think even if you look at our layup cost on a per-berth basis, we've found creative ways to
have the ships maybe of a warmer layup with really the cost differential being very small. So that's one of,
I think, many levers under evaluation to further reduce the burn rate.

Operator

The next question is from James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.

James Lloyd Hardiman
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

So I have a difficult question, but I think it's a fair one. I wanted to ask about that, the fourth component
that you delineated with your Healthy Return to Service program. Specifically, what happens in the
unfortunate event where somebody actually contracts the virus onboard? Obviously, there's a lot that's
going to go into preventing that from happening. But as potential customers are thinking about how that
would go, I guess: a, how do you ensure that you don't end up in an outbreak scenario? And then b, how
do you ensure that the ship doesn't ultimately get stranded? I think that was one of the striking parts of
what we saw over March and early April where ships that just had no home and the ports weren't allowing
them to return. So how do you give consumers the comfort that they're not going to be in one of those
scenarios as you reopen but there is ultimately no vaccine?

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I think what we're looking at, as you mentioned, is all 4 of those situations. And the fourth one is
very much a part of it. We think it is premature to come out. We're working with a series of experts on the
topic. We're obviously very conscious of the issue. I think it's premature for us to go through the thoughts
we have on any of the 4, both because we keep getting better, but also knowledge of and -- knowledge of
the virus and knowledge of what we can do -- what one can do with it keeps changing. So before we come
to service, that will be one of the questions that we have to address in a forthright way. And as I say, it's
both coming out with a proper way to handle it. And it's important to be transparent about how that will
operate. And as we approach our safe return to service and Healthy Return to Service, we will be providing
more information on that.

James Lloyd Hardiman
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then I won't ask the next question I was going to ask. But maybe can you help us
as we think about you've got customer outflows in the form of refunds and inflows in the form of deposits.
Can you maybe help us size the latter in any way you deem appropriate? And maybe any idea when you
think the 2 will essentially balance each other out? I'm assuming that, at this point, it's a net cash outflow
to customers. But when do you think that might even out?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. James, so the first way that I would frame it is there's a difference between sailing that you're
canceling, which obviously we've talked about that about 45% of our guests asked for their cash back.
And then the kind of ebbs and flows of customers that are booking further out in terms of path to canceled

sailings. So obviously, the ones when we cancel sailings, there's a lot of outflow that occurs for those 45%
more or less that we've been seeing.

But when you look out into Q4 and you look out into next year, you look at a kind of a period of time,
you do see more inflow than you see outflow occurring when you look at kind of Q4 and beyond. And it's
really -- where you see most of the outflow occurring is when you're canceling sailings and the guest is
considering whether or not they're going to hold onto an FCC or get reimbursed. And I think as we get to
the point where we're not canceling sailings, that's where I think you begin to see that inflection point and
also, as you begin to focus the customer more and more on booking into '21.

James Lloyd Hardiman
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. So -- but just to clarify, you think that, as we get into maybe July, August time frame, when ships
are resuming, you think those 2 could potentially offset one another?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think once you get to where you're back up and operating, I think you will see cancellations move
to much more of a typical level, which, obviously especially when you're canceling sailings, they're going
to be elevated. And of course, when everybody has been in a stay-at-home order, you would expect it
to be elevated. But when you look at -- if you just look at 2021, as an example, cancellation rates are at
very typical levels. And the other point I would add is our Cruise with Confidence programs and so forth
have really been very well accepted by the trade and by our guests. And I would just -- and as I made in
my comments, our loyalty guests have really just been absolutely incredible in their support. And you can
really see their love of cruising as they begin to want to focus further out.

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Yes. And James, it's Michael. I'd like to add a little bit of color to Jason's comments. I think we've really
seen surprising demand from our loyalty members. And remember, we've got close to 20 million loyalty
members. And their response to various promotions that we put into the market, just to understand what
the demand looks like, has been surprisingly positive. So as we move into Q4 and into '21, we've been
honestly surprised in terms of the demand that we've seen coming in, particularly from the loyalty guests.

[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.

Karen Tan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

This is Karen calling in for Tim. Jason, just the first question, following your latest round of fundraising,
can you just maybe quantify or remind us what is your remaining unencumbered assets, including bulk
vessels and maybe other assets as well?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Well, sure, Karen. And you sound better than Tim. So in terms of the unencumbered assets, so we
basically encumbered about $12 billion of our balance sheet. And so you've got the balance of that, that
is unencumbered. And not all of that would be available, for example, like an opco type of structure, but
a very large percentage of the balance would be available if we were to choose to raise additional liquidity
via debt.

12

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

Okay. Great. And given your latest pricing on the debt that was issued, is there any reason or
circumstance that you would, at this point, call your 7.25% Silversea bond?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think, at this point, cash is king. And of course, if we were to raise additional debt, likely at this
point in time, that would be at a higher rate than the Silversea. So I don't think, at this point, we have any
specific plans, but we are evaluating all different alternatives to square up our capital structure.

Karen Tan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And lastly, just a clarification on your booking commentary. Could you maybe define what historical
means for you? And when you commented that 2021 pricing is up mid-single digits, is that relative to --
that's relative to 2020, but what is it in relation to historical or '19?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. What I would say is typical levels is kind of looking back over the past several years. It is lower than
our '19 levels, but it's not much lower than what we've seen, call it, over the past 3 to 5 years on -- in
terms of that typical average.

The only thing I would say on the rate side is we are -- our rates are at mid-single digits today. That is
versus 2020. And I think that, that number will fluctuate up and down depending on load factor for next
year and also will be depending on -- as our guests continue to apply the FCCs, that will weigh a little bit
on that rate. But overall, what we're seeing is that we are seeing strong demand for '21. The volumes are
at typical levels, rates are up a little bit, and those trends continue to support that. And as I commented in
my remarks, over the past 4 weeks, we've seen even better demand trends for the back half of this year
and 2021.

Karen Tan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. I'm sorry. One more follow-up to that. Would you say that, in the last 4 weeks, that would be new
bookings? Or is it rebookings of those canceled sailings?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

No, I would say it's much more new bookings. On the FCCs that we have out there, about 20% of them
have been applied, but it's a very small percentage of the -- over the forward-booking period. So our
commentary about the booking environment really relates to new bookings.

Operator

The next question will come from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.

Jaime M. Katz
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

I have just one quick question. I'm curious if you'd help us parse out how the resilience of FCCs are
looking across the income demographics. I think Lindblad had said that more of their customers were
taking credits and were better booked. And I'm curious if you're seeing similar trends at Silversea versus
Royal Caribbean or RCI, if you're willing to break that out.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

The color that I would give -- I mean, overall, we've been relatively impressed with the numbers that are
taking the FCCs and also the utilization of the FCCs. Utilization and those taking FCCs are more skewed

13

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

towards our loyalty members. But what you would see is younger cruisers -- and I'm really talking the
millennials, or the younger part of the millennials, are typically looking more for their cash back, while
families and baby boomers are likely to take the FCC and utilize it.

Operator

The next question is from Brandt Montour with JPM.

Brandt Antoine Montour
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just quickly for Jason. Just wondering, for the system at large, what do you guys see you needing to do
in terms of how many ships you need to have sailing to reach breakeven on company EBITDA? And what
does that assume for load factor?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's an almost impossible question to answer because it's -- just the fluidity of the situation. What
I would say is that what we find is, for our newer ships, you need about 30% load factors to kind of
break even on an EBITDA basis. And then they skew to about 50% load factor on to our older ships. So
it's -- I would kind of -- if you wanted to kind of build a model, I would think about it that way. But yes,
we've done a lot to rightsize our costs. We've done a lot to minimize our capital so that as we return to
service, you certainly do not need the entire fleet operating at full levels to break even. And you don't
need load factors to be exceptionally high either. I think we just -- a slow return to service gets us back to
a breakeven EBITDA in a relatively short period of time.

Brandt Antoine Montour
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then I was just curious what your thoughts were on the industry's appetite to
scrap ships here and then yourselves specifically as well, if under certain scenarios where things were
suspended for a long period of time.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Well, I think there's a lot of opportunity that you'll see here on the capacity side. I do think that you
will see ships that are retired at a much higher pace than what we have seen in the past because it really
hasn't been that much on the scrapping side. I think the combination of what's happening with COVID and
then the IMO regulations, you'll see interest in some of the older vessels for possible sale.

And then there's just a reality that the newbuilding programs for us and probably for the industry will
slow. And they'll slow because the yards themselves are -- they're not really operating. They're just
beginning to think about getting back up and running. The supply chain has been impacted, and so it will
take time. And so you're going to see a permanent shift in the way of newbuildings for some time, which
is going to weigh on capacity growth numbers for the foreseeable future because the -- especially on the
newbuilding side, it's not a shift and catch up. It's likely to be a very permanent shift.

Operator

The next question will come from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

A couple of quick follow-ups. One, can you just confirm what percentage of the fleet is currently receiving
bookings on for 2021 and whether future cruise credits can still be redeemed for cash? And then at a
bigger-picture level, you mentioned access to other forms of liquidity. But how do you think about the
right debt level for the company both near term to ensure you still invest appropriately in a recovery, but
then also longer term based on the experience that you've had in this environment?

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

So I'll take the second one, Steve, just real quick. In terms of -- our ultimate goal, our key goal here, in
which we've been very consistent, is to be an investment-grade credit. And so obviously, when we are
evaluating additional capital sources, we're considering leverage, we're considering the negative carry
associated with that leverage and then looking at how do we get ourselves on a path here in order to get
back to our investment-grade metrics as soon as possible as we look to return to service.

Steve, can you just repeat the first question real quick?

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Sorry about that. We had a little bit of an intruder there. But can you just confirm what percentage of the
fleet is currently getting bookings on for 2021 and whether future cruise credits can still be redeemed for
cash?

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

So Steve...

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

So...

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Go ahead.

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

Go ahead, Jason.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead.

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

So currently, we have really 2 programs in place. One is Cruise with Confidence, which we launched really
as a way to give immense flexibility to existing customers and to customers who are considering sailing.
Because the key really of Cruise with Confidence is, even within final penalty and with full payment, you
can basically cancel your sailing within 48 hours of departure, and then you can receive an FCC for 100%
of the value, which you can then utilize at any point up until the early 2022. So that's an FCC that is really
utilized heavily because there is no refund – cash refund option that comes with Cruise with Confidence.
It's basically the ability to simply move your booking whenever you feel comfortable to sail.

And then the other FCC option is provided when we suspend our sailings. And then we give the guest
basically 2 choices. Either, one, you can have a cash refund, of course. Or secondly, we'll provide you
with a future cruise credit for 125%, which I think, as Jason has already mentioned, about 45% of our

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

customers are taking the refund and 55% are holding the future cruise credit to be able to utilize on a
future sailing.

And we've also introduced with these programs something called lift and shift, which allows guests to
simply lift up their booking and move it to a future booking whenever they choose. I'm not sure if I
answered your question, but I think I may have answered it.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And just to add on to it, currently, our entire fleet and brands are available for sale for 2021.

Operator

The next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wanted to get a sense of maybe if that operating expense burn rate you talked about, the $150 million
to $170 million, I think is what you've said before. Because you mentioned your ships are maybe in sort
of various as of layup. So just wondering if -- how much that $150 million to $170 million in operating
expense per month could come down when you're -- when you have everything laid up as much as you
expect it to be.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So it's -- I wish I can give you an exact number because some of it just has to do with -- there's the
layup costs and then also the movement of the crew and so forth. But there's definitely opportunity in
that $150 million to $175 million. I mean typically, when we're laying up a ship, if it's in a, call it, a cold
state, it's about between $1 million and $1.5 million a month. In a warm layup, it's somewhere between
$2 million and $2.5 million a month. So there's the opportunity to move more of those into a cooler layup.

The thing that we also have to think about is, as we bring them back up, the cooler you make them, the
more it will cost you to bring them from a cool layup into a hot space to be able to operate. So some of it
is just looking at your return-to-service plans and being thoughtful about which ships are going to come
up first. As Richard commented, it's not a light switch. It's more of a dimmer that -- as we bring the fleet
back on. And so that's one of the things that's kind of the consideration. But there's definitely opportunity
there. It's not going to be 0, but it certainly could be better than the $150 million.

Robin Margaret Farley
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just had a clarification. You talked about the number taking cash. And
you noted in the release was as of April 30. I'm just wondering if, in the last 3 weeks, you've seen an
increasing rate of that or not, only because another cruise line has talked about an increasing rate of
people taking the future cruise credits. So I'm wondering if you're seeing the same thing.

Richard D. Fain
Chairman & CEO

Sorry. I'm on, like, a stock call.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So overall, I mean, what we're seeing average-wise is about 45%. I think -- there has been a little
bit of an increase relative to what we were experiencing previously in the rate of guests that are taking
the cash versus the FCC. But most of that has to do with the mix of the guests. And so the more -- as you
start getting to be a little bit more internationally sourced on some things, what we're finding is guests

from other parts of the world more often than not choose cash versus the FCC, which is a different pattern
than what we've seen in markets like North America.

Operator

The next question will come from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Thanks for all of that color this morning. I guess one thing that would be helpful to understand is kind of
your ability to scale the costs on the ship as you resume operations. So typically, we've thought of the
ships as fairly fixed cost. I don't know what your ability is to scale labor to initial loads or how we should
think about that going forward.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

In current states like this, we have much more variability opportunity on your costs. And that's because,
as you know what your load factors are going to be or you think they're going to be, then you're able to
bring the crew on and off the ship in a more flexible manner, which is where a lot of your fixed costs are.
So I think that we see more variability than what we have historically seen as our ships return to service.
And a lot of that will be also deployment-based.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

And Jason, I might have missed this, but did you indicate any kind of range as to what initial loads might
look like?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

We have not. Yes, and you did not miss it, Sharon.

Sharon Zackfia
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Would you like to give us any kind of estimate there?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

I would not. I think a lot of it will be determined based off of the dialogues we're having with the
regulators and the CDC and so forth. That will be more of the -- how -- that will be more of what
calibrates our thinking around load factor.

Operator

The next question will come from Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.

Assia Plamenova Georgieva
Infinity Research

Given the fact that pretty much all Carnival brands have extended their pause of operations for a much
longer period than you had anticipated, and just a couple of hours ago, you may have -- you probably saw
it. Norwegian also extended their pause. Are you considering canceling further voyages? June 12 seems to
be only 3 weeks away and may be a little too soon. Have I missed the further extension?

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

Assia, it's Michael. Interestingly, our plan is, this afternoon, we'll be announcing further suspension
of voyages until the end of July, until July 31. The only exception to the suspension will be our China
operations.

Assia Plamenova Georgieva
Infinity Research

Michael, that makes a lot of sense. And separately, on the logistics front, it seems that ports allowing,
whether embarkation/disembarkation ports or ports that you visit, allowing ships to enter their
communities might be a big hurdle, is that something that plays into the thinking as to which itineraries
would open up outside of Asia?

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Yes. It's a great point. And interestingly, we are already in dialogue with over 40 different ports and
destinations around the world in terms of plans and return to service. And it's surprising how many ports
and destinations are very interested in returning to service and opening. And in fact, we got many calls
asking us when are we going to bring ships there. So we're in that discussion, and it requires a lot of
planning because it needs to be really part of our Healthy Return to Service. I think one thing's fairly true
is that, for example, in the American market, destinations like the Perfect Day will be key to us directly.

Assia Plamenova Georgieva
Infinity Research

I kind of lost you there, but I think you mentioned Perfect Day would be available to open up a lot sooner,
and that makes perfect sense. Oh, I didn't mean that, the Perfect Day, perfect sense. But it works, I
guess. It also seems to me -- and since you were on the call yesterday with members of CLIA and the
European nations, and that probably, ports in the Caribbean might be a lot more willing and interested in
opening up sooner as opposed to European ports, despite the fact that Europe is probably further along
the curve that we're on. Is that a fair assessment?

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

It's a very -- it's -- I don't think you can generalize one over the other. I think it's a very -- it's a mixed
story. I think, in many ways, every region, every country is on their own journey. And I think it's -- maybe
you can generalize to say that, certainly, China and Asia went through this first. So it's just logical that
they're emerging from this first. And I think that's the same thing with Europe. And now of course, with
everything in the U.S. and the Caribbean, so there's a kind of a logical relationship with how people first
went into this as a society and how people are thinking about coming out of it.

Assia Plamenova Georgieva
Infinity Research

That makes sense. And then if I can sneak one last one in here. Jason, you mentioned that the newer
larger vessels would get to EBITDA breakeven at about 30% occupancy. They also provide an opportunity
for better social distancing. Does it make more sense to actually go with those vessels first as opposed to
the smaller vessels?

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

So -- yes. So a good point, Assia. So first, I would say is their load factors can be lower because they
have great economies of scale. They're extremely fuel-efficient. And the cabin category makes it very rich.
But really more broadly within the fleet, our fleet is very -- the public space per berth is very good. But
certainly, the newer ships have a more public space for passengers and would be heavily in consideration
for the return to service as well as other ships that we've modernized and have more venues on to.

The next question comes from Vince Ciepiel.

Vince Charles Ciepiel
Cleveland Research Company

A variety of folks in the travel industry keep mentioning the unprecedented nature of this fall-off in
demand. So when you look at your '21 pricing, it actually sounds quite healthy. Can you compare what
you think the industry is doing, what you're doing with pricing for the next 6, 12, 18 months out relative
to kind of what happened in the '08, '09 time frame? Because it seems like people are kind of holding the
line in a stronger manner.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So -- I'm sorry for all the background noise. I'm not quite sure what line is open.

Michael W. Bayley
President & CEO of Royal Caribbean International

Yes. I think we should ask the operator because it's not one of our lines.

Jason T. Liberty
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I would -- so I think that, to your point, one of the things that we've generally been seeing is that
I think all the effort around price integrity that we've done and I think others in the industry have done,
what we've seen is people being much more measured in terms of taking pricing action. You see more
packaging, more promotional activity, but we are seeing pricing stay relatively stable. And of course, the
likelihood that there's going to be some lower load factors for a period of time will also help support that
pricing going into the early part of next year.

Okay. So thank you for your assistance today, Sia, with the call today, and we thank all of you for your
participation and interest in the company. Carola be available for any follow-up you might have. And from
our homes, we wish you all a really great day and take care. Be safe.
