Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Extra Space Storage Fourth Quarter
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norman, Vice President of Capital
Markets. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.

Jeffrey Norman
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Thank you, Cindy. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. In addition to
our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please
remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-
looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ
materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties
associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary
statements contained in the company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to
review.

Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, February 23, 2021. The
company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement because of changing
market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer. And Joe, you may be on
mute? Or operator, do we have Joe's line connected?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

Jeff. Can you hear me now?

Jeffrey Norman
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Yes. We hear you now. Thank you.

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

Sorry, everyone. Thanks, Jeff. And thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. I hope everyone and their
families remain healthy and that your 2021 is off to a good start.

In my 35 years in real estate, I can't remember another year with as many positive and negative twists
and turns in such a short period of time as we saw in 2020. The range of emotions I felt from March when
I was worried about the daily safety of our employees and customers, to April when I wondered when
rental demand in our sector would return, to September, when we saw some of the strongest occupancy
and rental rate fundamentals in our company's history are hard to describe.

I am proud of our team's resilience and how well they responded to 2020's unprecedented challenges.
Our team's efforts, together with our balanced portfolio, sophisticated platform and innovative external
growth efforts, yielded a great result in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with same-store occupancy
of 94.8%, an all-time year-end high for Extra Space.

Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which we have experienced since August
and a return to positive same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2.3%, a 380 basis point

acceleration from the third quarter. We also had excellent expense control with a 0.6% decrease in same-
store expenses, resulting in 3.4% NOI growth in the quarter.

Our return to positive NOI gains, coupled with strong external investment activity, yielded core FFO
growth of 16.5% in the quarter. Despite the challenges of the year, the fourth quarter was full of
accomplishments, including completion of 2 preferred equity investments totaling $350 million, $147
million in acquisitions, $168 million in bridge loan closings, the addition of 44 stores to our management
platform and receipt of NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award, recognizing Extra Space for its sustainability
efforts. This is the first time a storage company has received this award.

While we are excited about the accomplishments of 2020, we are even more optimistic about how our
efforts have positioned us for 2021. Rentals continue to be steady and vacates continue to be muted.
We are heading into 2021 with the highest occupancy we have ever experienced at this time of year and
expect rental rates to remain strong.

We have already added 51 third-party management stores in 2021. And our acquisition, management and
bridge loan pipelines are robust. But we are also mindful of the risks we face. We recognize that current or
potential government regulations could impede same-store revenue and expense performance. We believe
that vacates may eventually return to more normal levels, and we recognize that the challenges related to
new supply have not subsided completely and will continue to suppress rate growth in many markets. As
in the past, our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance in the face of any
risks which materializes.

In short, despite significant turbulence, we had a very successful 2020 and look forward to an even better
2021. We continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholders' long-term value and to deliver
the results our shareholders have come to expect from Extra Space Storage.

I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a great fourth quarter with reaccelerating
same-store revenue growth, driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new
customers.

Late fees and other income continue to be lower year-over-year and partially offset rental income, but we
saw improvement in both line items from levels experienced in the third quarter. We lowered expenses
in all controllable expense categories in the quarter. And despite property tax increases of 6.4%, we still
delivered a reduction in same-store expenses overall. This resulted in same-store NOI growth of 3.4%.

Core FFO for the quarter was $1.48, a year-over-year increase of 16.5% and well above consensus
estimates. Our same-store performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional
contribution from growth in tenant reinsurance income, management fees and interest and investment
income. We continue to evolve our balance sheet to reduce secured debt and increase the size of our
unencumbered pool. Our efforts resulted in Moody's issuing Extra Space a BAA2 credit rating on January
28, our second investment-grade credit rating, now providing us access to the public bond market.

We are excited to add another capital option to finance future growth, reduce total cost of debt and further
ladder our maturities. At year-end, we had higher-than-normal revolver balances and variable rate debt
due to the elevated capital activity that took place in the fourth quarter, including settling our convertible
notes, completing preferred equity investments and closing substantial bridge loan and acquisition volume.
A significant portion of these transactions were temporarily funded by draws on our revolving lines. We
were comfortable doing so knowing we were actively issuing on our ATM, had pending bridge loan sales
and are recapitalizing stores into a JV, which bring our revolver balances down to historical levels.

Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2021, with ranges that are wider than
in previous years to address some of the uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on customer
behavior and government regulation.

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

Our new same-store pool includes a total of 860 stores, which is essentially flat with last year. The
number of new stores added to the pool was generally offset by sites removed due to disposition or
redevelopment. We anticipate the changes in the same-store pool will benefit our 2021 same-store
revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points.

Same-store revenue is expected to increase 4.25% to 5.5%, driven by higher occupancy in the first half
of the year and elevated rates in new and existing -- to new and existing customers. Same-store expense
growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, primarily driven by higher property tax expense. Our revenue and
expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth range of 4.25% to 6.25%.

The acquisition market continues to be expensive, and we will remain disciplined but opportunistic. We
expect to do significant acquisition volume and plan to close a number of transactions with joint venture
partners. Our guidance assumes $350 million in Extra Space investment, approximately $180 million of
which is closed or under contract. We also expect to close approximately $400 million of bridge loans and
plan to retain 20% to 25% of those balances or approximately $100 million in 2021.

We have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for
shareholders, and we will be creative as we deploy capital in the sector. Our full year core FFO is estimated
to be between $5.85 and $6.05 per share. We anticipate $0.16 of dilution from value-add acquisitions or C
of O stores, down $0.04 from 2020.

We also added additional guidance related to our expected interest income for 2021 as well as notes
clarifying the recognition of our preferred investments in SmartStop and NexPoint, which can be found in
the outlook tables of our earnings release.
As Joe mentioned, 2020 has been a memorable year for extra space. We are excited to turn the page and
are already on our way to a very strong 2021. And with that, let's turn it over to Cindy to start our Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

And our first question comes from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America.

Alua Noyan Askarbek
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. And it looks like 2021 is going to be great for you guys as well. So I just
wanted to start off and ask a little bit more on what you guys are expecting for revenues this year? So
how are you thinking about occupancy for the first half versus the second half and a little bit more on the
rental rate assumptions?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Alua, this is Scott. I can give you a little bit more detail in terms of what our guidance assumes.
We're assuming that our occupancy stays strong. So in January and into February, our gap has actually
expanded to be just over 300 basis points. So what's happened is January and February typically have
lower occupancy, declining occupancy. We haven't seen that. So we moved from 240 basis point delta in
occupancy to over 300 basis points where we are today. So we're assuming that occupancy holds at this
high level through the end of the summer, at which point, we expect occupancy to fall more to historical
levels. So last year, in the fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter, we saw occupancy 200 to 300 basis
points higher than normal. This year, we expect that to be a 100 to 200 basis point headwind for us. So
we expect it to be lower in the fall back more to historical levels.

We expect the first quarter to be strong in terms of revenue growth continuing to accelerate from the
fourth quarter. The second quarter should be the peak, and that is mainly due to some easy comps from
last year and then continued good into the third quarter with that, the end of the third quarter and fourth
quarter being challenging.

Alua Noyan Askarbek
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then, I guess, just a little bit more on the third-party management for
2021. You mentioned that you already added 51 new stores. Can we expect a larger acceleration in third-
party management compared to 2020 and 2019?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So the -- this is Joe, and thank you for your kind words about our performance. It's not Scott, it's me. It's
over 4,000 employees who every day bring their best to work and have really done an outstanding job.
With respect to third-party management, our activity in January and February with 51 stores added is a
little elevated because we took 37 stores on in connection with the JCAP transaction. So I would expect
our 2021 activity to be similar to our 2020 activity in terms of gains.

Operator

Your next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

Can you guys just provide a little bit of color on how existing customer rate increases have been trending,
just relative to your historical norms? And do you suspect that you're going to be able to continue pushing
these pretty aggressively in '21?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So we're still subject to restrictions on existing customer rate increase in many markets across the
country, and that we abide by all those regulations, and that, of course, is the limit to us. Absent that,
our ECRI increases average high single digits, 10%, about the same as always. And interestingly, we
continue to monitor move-out rates in response to ECRI, and we have seen no increase in move-out rates.
So hopefully, at some point, those regulations, restrictions are lifted, and we can get back to fully normal
behavior. But we are limited now. We understood that and took that into account in our guidance. And
hopefully, we can get back to normal sooner rather than later.

Spenser Bowes Allaway
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then just on the external growth front, are you guys currently seeing more opportunity
with stabilized assets or with assets in some sort of lease-up right now?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

I'm sorry, more opportunities with what type of assets? I couldn't understand you.

Spenser Bowes Allaway
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Stabilized versus assets from some form of lease up.

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

Yes. So -- and sorry about that. So what we bought is more lease of assets. Stabilized -- pricing on
stabilized assets is very hard for us to make sense of. We will probably be more active on that front in
2021 with joint venture partners, just start to make the pricing make sense to us, but everything we
bought in 2020 was lease-up. I think, on average, we were in the mid-3s first year and stabilized on
average in 17 months in the mid-6s. So I think that's the best use of our acquisition dollars today.

Operator

Your next question comes from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.

Richard Wynn Skidmore
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Question on Joe for the -- on the supply growth. How are you seeing supply across your markets? You
mentioned kind of flattish. But are there any particular markets where you're seeing outsized supply
growth? Or how are you thinking about supply in 2021 and into 2022?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

Sure. Thanks. Good question. So supply is still an issue. That's the short answer. We did see a substantial
pullback in 2020 due to COVID. We -- I'm going to speak to our same-store pool, not national statistics.
I'll speak to what matters to us. We had projected in 2020 that about 30% of our same-store pool would
be impacted by new supply. And when you look at the actual numbers, it was only around 21%. So almost
1/3 got pushed or canceled because of COVID.

And in 2022, we project 22% of our same-store pool will be impacted by new stores. And I think that will
be like there is every year some number of those stores get delayed or maybe even canceled. So we are

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

seeing an incremental decrease in new supply, and that's good news. But I would caution you on 2 fronts:
one is, we still have significant supply delivered in many markets over the last several years, and we're
working through that, and that affects our ability to push rate. And secondly, with the performance of
storage, particularly in comparison to other asset classes, I would not be surprised if that attracts more
capital, more developers to the market. So new supply isn't going away. It's not in every market, but in
the markets where it is, it's something we need to deal with.

Richard Wynn Skidmore
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And then, Joe, just maybe one other follow-up on the bridge loan program. You mentioned, I think, $400
million targeted for 2021. Is that sort of in the pipeline? Or is that an aspirational goal? Maybe help us
frame that? And then how you think about the path forward from some of these bridge loan and other
investments that you're making to help with the FFO growth?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So we have about $196 million in the pipeline. So we believe $400 million is an achievable goal? And the
bridge loan program is very accretive for us because the whole note rates may be in the 5% to 6%, but
by the time we sell the A and keep the B, the rate we're getting is 9%, 10%, 11%, plus we're getting
management of the stores and the economics there. We also hope to buy a bunch of these. And I think we
bought one in F2 that we're targeting to buy and it's an immature program, but as we get deeper into it, I
hope it turns into an acquisition pipeline as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.

Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask you so migration has been a big topic over this period of this pandemic. And I was just
wondering, are you starting to see that at all across your portfolio? And does it make you sort of change
where you're thinking about where you might want to invest in the future as you look at acquisitions?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So we haven't seen differential in performance between the markets that have been called out as people
are fleeing San Francisco or people are fleeting New York in the markets that people are supposedly
fleeing to. And I don't know if that's because people are storing their stuff in Manhattan before they go out
to New Jersey, and at some point, that will unwind. But as of now, we don't see performance differential
based on that reported phenomenon.

What we do see is performance different based on new supply. If you go back to the previous question,
that's where we have the weakest power. I'll also tell you, there's been a number of articles coming out
recently that question whether the urban flight is as widespread has been reported in COVID. I just read
an article that most of the people leaving San Francisco are settling in the counties around Francisco.
They're not going to Utah or Florida or Texas.

And then lastly, and this is just one man's opinion. I don't believe COVID is the death of New York City. I
believe young people like to live in cities. Cities have a lot of advantages. And I don't believe that this is
the death of the big cities. So to answer your question, we're much more focused on micro markets as we
look to buy things, and we're -- we have not yet trusted our investment strategy based on urban flight.

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

Okay. I just want to ask you, too, your net adds in the fourth quarter for third-party management were
quite a bit lower than the growth additions. I just was wondering what sort of caused that churn? And is
that something that you would expect to see going forward, perhaps I guess so far in the first quarter?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

Yes. Great question. So we had 38 stores leave our platform in the fourth quarter and 87 leave our
platform in 2020, almost all of them were because of sales, very, very few were changing managers. We
bought 15 of those 87 stores, not a huge percentage, and the issue is pricing. We try to remain disciplined
and not overpay in our view for things. There's also some subside of these stores that are not of a quality
we want to own. We're happy to manage to not own. So given where prices is, I would expect that we
continue to have sales. I hope we can do a better job through structures that we buy more of them. But
our #1 goal is not to do something that's dilutive to our shareholders' value. So if pricing gets beyond
what we think is reasonable, we're going to do our best to transition the store to the new buyer.

Operator

Your next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

First question, Scott. Apologies if I missed this, but what were move-in rates or move-in rate growth, I
guess, in the quarter and in January? And what are you seeing early in February?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So our achieved rates in the fourth quarter and really for the back half of the year were about 10%,
year over -- ahead of where they were the prior year. And in the first quarter of this year, January and
February, we're seeing rates be at very similar levels, about 10% ahead of where they were last year.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just following up on rental rate trends. And just given how the industry has tightened up
here over the last couple of quarters. And you've seen a lot of rent growth during the off-peak season,
which, Joe, I think you noted began in August. As we think about the peak-leasing season ramping up
now, is it possible that we see rate increases similar to what Extra Space and the industry has experienced
historically during the peak periods from where rates are today? And is that factored into guidance?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

So we are assuming that the first quarter, we continue these rates that we've been experiencing. Second
quarter, our achieved rates, we would expect to be very strong. Because if you remember in the second
quarter, when things really dropped, we dropped rates 20% to 30%. And so when you're looking at a rate
that was 20% to 30% lower and then it's already 10% above, you're going to see some significant rate
growth for customers that move in at April, May, even into early June, and those are all factored into our
guidance.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. How far above -- where are rates today relative to sort of that March, April, May time frame?

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

So if you -- I'll just give you one point of reference, and that's our achieved -- I mean, our achieved rate
compared to our in-place rents, and this isn't necessarily the move-out rate versus the move-in rate. Our
in-place rents are actually above our achieved rates today. Now remember, this is the time of year when
this is usually the most negative. Meaning you achieved rates in January or February, it's the highest. Your
existing customer rates are compared to your achieved rates on an annual basis. So the fact that our rates
are up 10% year-over-year in February is good. So our in-place rents are about high single digits above
where the achieved rates are today.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just one question. The taxes in the TRS that are forecast to be up to about
$19 million to $20 million. I know in the past, you've executed on sort of a variety of different strategies
to minimize that tax expenses. Are there any opportunities that you see today as you look ahead?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

So we are continuing to take advantage of some solar opportunities. We continue to use it from an ESG
perspective and a sustainability perspective as well as some tax benefits. That's the big one that we have
today.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Do you see any potential downside to that -- the tax expense in the TRS going forward?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

So I think it will depend a little bit on where rates -- tax rates go and then also what happens with solar
credits. I think that you've seen them burning off, I would expect with the change in President, they could
initiate additional credits, but those are -- we'll continue to monitor those.

Operator

Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Great quarter and great guidance. So I'm curious, are the kind of rent increase ceilings like California and
other cities might have put in place, what is implicit in your guidance in terms of those policies loosening
up? Are you assuming that you can push rates further in the back half in California? Or is that just going
to be upside -- potential upside to guidance?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So we don't assume that we get relief from those in the first half of 2021. The back half of 2021, I believe,
we still are moderating some of those rates. So there is some upside to that, but there's also downside if
something turns in the wrong direction and additional restrictions are put into place.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And just going back to the supply topic, you talked about the percent impact everything to the
pool, but I'm curious about is that's the impact? So not just 30% being impacted or 21% being impacted,
but the definite impact is at the end of the day, when all is said and done? If it doesn't impact, that's even
better.

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

CEO & Director

Not sure I understood the question. So we've tried to be clear on this call and others that supply is the
biggest factor that's impeding our performance in that -- in markets like the Boroughs in Northern New
Jersey and Texas markets, Florida markets, et cetera. Our ability to raise rents -- we can fill the stores
up. We can keep them at very high occupancy rates. It's our ability to raise rent is impacted by the new
supply. Ki Bin, I don't know if that answered your question or not. If not, let me know and I'll try better.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Well, you said, I think, about 21% we're seeing sort of impacted by supply, but that could mean 10%
more supply coming to those markets? Or it could mean 2% more spike into those markets? So that's how
I was trying to gauge if it's leaning one way or another.

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

Yes. Listen, this is a micro market business, and that's an astute comment. It varies widely. We've
had situations where we've had properties come in very close to the existing property, brand-new
development. And because of traffic patterns or barriers, like bridges or rivers or whatever specific reason,
we've had absolutely no impact on our property. We also see that it is better for a store to -- new store
to come into a market where it's 10 square feet per person than 2 square feet per person. Because the
percentage increase on a market that's full and has 10 square feet per person, you only have to capture
a marginal part of everyone's demand to fill your store up. Where if it's only 2 square foot per person and
you're increasing supply by 50%, that's more difficult, at least in the short term, a more difficult problem.
So it is absolutely -- we get the numbers, 21%, 30%, whatever, it is a market-by-market, store-by-store
analysis and that's how we do it for our guidance. We create individual budgets based on what we know is
going to happen in the markets for each store. We do our best to project performance, and we roll that all
up and that becomes our guidance.

Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.

Todd Jakobsen Stender
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just listening to your posture calling for some moderation in occupancy. Certainly, these are historic highs,
and it's probably prudent to do so. But what drives that move lower? Are you assuming some housing
transaction slowing? Is it frozen consumer behavior that begins to thaw and people naturally start to move
out after 13 or 14 months? Maybe what do you kind of point to?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So our...

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

So Todd, I would tell you -- go ahead, Joe.

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

Sorry, Scott. So our elevated occupancy, one of the very important factors is moderation in vacates. And
at some point, COVID is going to be in the rearview mirror, and we believe customer behavior will return
to normal. Now I don't think that means there's going to be an end of COVID day and someone's going to
foot the switch and everyone runs to move out of their storages, right?

We know that our customers are -- have a great deal of inertia. That's not high on their list, and it may
take them some time. We know that the largest increase in reason for storage, we've seen over COVID
is decluttering of the house. And I don't think just because COVID is over, people are going to want to
reclutter their house, right? That this may be a more permanent change. But with all that being said,
we do believe vacates will eventually get back to more normal levels, and that will cause a reduction in
occupancy.

Todd Jakobsen Stender
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Understood. One more, just in the terms of maybe just sticking with bridge loans. You did sell some of
your bridge loans. It looks like you have a little bit more sold already this year. So it gives you a seat at
the table when you want to go acquire a property, but now you've sold some, does that now limit your
ability to acquire on that deal? And that's one. And then two, how liquid is that market if you guys are
trying to lighten up on loans or maybe it's a risk mitigation effort, maybe just some context there?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So there -- once we have sold an 8 piece, and we have sold $76 million of additional 8 pieces in 2021. It
does complicate the purchase because we can waive our portion of the prepayment penalty, but the 8-
piece holder is not going to do that because they're not getting any benefit from our purchase. So that is a
challenge. Obviously, as you get closer to maturity in those burn off, it's less of a challenge.

We -- the second part of the question, when we started this program, we had a co-lending partner that we
would co-originate the loans, and at closing, close them with the -- where we only held the P piece. And
we found that better execution over time was for us to close and hold both pieces, package up the As into
more meaningful chunks and then sell them. So that means we hold the As on our balance sheet for some
period of time, and you saw in the fourth quarter how having those sold elevated our debt somewhat.
But it gives us better execution, particularly because now we have 2 buyers, OBA notes. So there is some
competition and redundancy for that, and that seems to be working really well for us.

Your next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Scott, I want to go back to -- when you were talking about occupancy being strong, up to 300 through the
summer. And then you made a comment about a headwind down to 100. Were you implying that by year-
end, the occupancy cost was going to be a negative 100? Or your 300 positive was going to shrink to 100
positive?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

So in the back half of 2020, it was 200 to 300 basis point benefit. And we are assuming that in the back
half of 2021, it is a 100 to 200 basis point headwind. So it's a negative comp year-over-year in the back
half of 2021.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then when you were talking about the portion or the markets where you
still run into rental increase restrictions, how significant is that as a percentage of the whole portfolio?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 23, 2021

Starting to think how to measure that. Some of the rental rate restrictions are at a level that it's not that
meaningful, right? In Alabama, you can't increase your rates more than 25% or Kansas is 25%. Now those
aren't biggest states, but it gives you the idea.

In others, like California, where it's 10%, and it's a meaningful state for us, that is much more of a
restriction. So we think the opportunity cost, if you will, in 2021 because we're not able to raise the rates,
is meaningful. It's likely over $10 million, but it's all included in our guidance.

Your next question comes from [ Ronald Camden ] with Morgan Stanley.

Unknown Analyst

Congrats on the quarter. Just 2 quick ones for me. One is just on the same-store expense guidance. If you
could just -- if you have an ROI just talk about what -- how should we think about sort of the property
taxes and the payroll, which are sort of the largest items in terms of their contribution?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I can give you our assumptions in our guidance. The -- over -- about 55% of the increase actually
relates to payroll, to property tax increases. And we are assuming that they're about 5.5% higher than
they were in 2020. Our payroll increase is about 2%, increase year-over-year and that makes up another
10%. And then we are assuming R&M is going up. We've had a couple of years with it down, and we've
had some benefit from lower comps with snow removal. So we think that's going to be a tough comp.
We've seen some of that in the Northeast already to date. So that's some of the larger assumptions in the
2021 guidance.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. My second question was just on the 4 assets that were sold. Just any color around there? Maybe
cap rates or why was it sold? Was it just a great offer? Just curious what situations were there?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

I would tell you we thought the pricing was very good. Otherwise, we wouldn't have sold. We retain
management of the stores. We retain certain right-of-first refusals to buy them if they ever want to sell
them. I would tell you it was a tax-motivated buyer, and we were able to drive what I thought was very
attractive terms because they have that motivation.

Your next question comes from Michael Lehman with Evercore ISI.

Michael Lehman
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a quick follow-up on supply. How much of your outlook includes the possibility of conversions from
retail to storage with the amount of kind of reliance on e-commerce that's been happening?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So when we know about it, it's absolutely included in our projections. Our folks in the field are charged
with knowing what's going on in your micro market and what can be converted. That being said, I think
that is -- and we've done a bunch of that. We have a number of stores that are old retail centers. There's
challenges to that. I don't think that's going to be a giant source of new self-storage. Some of the dark
retail is dark retail for a reason. You don't -- we wouldn't want to put a storage site there. Some is dark
retail but not zoned properly for storage. And there's a lot of other physical issues with doing that. So

there certainly will be some of that, but I don't see a wave, a giant wave, of new supply from retail
conversions.

Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Didn't really think I'll be back so quick. Just wanted to talk big picture about your bridge loan program.
Not just like what's in 2021 guidance, but just longer term, should we view this program as going to
be in place for the indefinite future? Or is this more -- there's a market opportunity that you're taking
advantage of? So maybe in 3 years, it really winds down? I'm just trying to understand the scope of the
program, long term?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

So we don't have a perfect crystal ball. Our belief is that there will be a demand for what we're doing now
into the future. I also believe that it's incumbent on us to always understand where the capital voids are
in the market and how we can make good risk-adjusted returns based on those capital voids. So if our
current program gets smaller in the future because that capital need is not as great, I hope that our team
and I expect that our team to find the next opportunity.

One thing, I think Extra Space has done well over the years is being innovative with the external growth.
And that means not executing the same strategy regardless of where you are in the market cycle. Just
trying to understand that market cycle and see where you can make outsized returns at acceptable
levels of risk. Right now, that's bridge loans. And I hope it continues forever, but if it doesn't, we'll find
something else.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Right. And obviously, I'm assuming there's a pretty wide funnel and what you end up closing is pretty
selective. But just curious, can you just describe, like, the deals that you've actually turned down and how
big that funnel is at the top?

Joseph D. Margolis
CEO & Director

Sure. So the -- I think the 2 biggest limitations on the funnel at top is we won't make construction loans.
We could make lots and lots of loans if we are willing to make construction loans. But the great thing
about the bridge loan program is if it goes bad and we have to take the property over, that 75% or 80%
of underwritten value, we already operated. We're happy to own it. That's not a bad result as opposed to
taking over half-built defaulted construction project, we have no interest in that. So that's one limitation
on the top of the funnel.

The second is, we have to manage the store. And that's -- some people are self-managed and want to
continue that, and they don't want us to manage the store, and then we won't do it. After that, we get to
property quality, location, underwriting. We can't get to the proceeds that the borrower wants. But there's,
we have a substantial pipeline, and we feel confident we can hit our guidance for this year.
