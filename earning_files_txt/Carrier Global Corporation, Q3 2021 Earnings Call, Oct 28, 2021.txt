CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at
ir.carrier.com.

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Samuel Joel Pearlstein
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.
With me here today are David Gitlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief
Financial Officer.

Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding
restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often
referred to by management as other significant items. The company reminds listeners that the sales,
earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call
are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K provide
details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in
the forward-looking statements.

This morning, we'll review our financial results for the third quarter and discuss the full year 2021 outlook.
We'll leave time for questions at the end. [Operator Instructions]

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Dave Gitlin.

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone.

I'll start with a summary of our Q3 results on Slide 2. Q3 was another strong quarter for us, particularly
in light of the widespread supply chain challenges. Our growth continues to benefit from our ability to
leverage broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and our
strategic investments and execution on our growth initiatives.

Demand and orders remain encouraging. We are experiencing record backlogs, positioning us well for
continued growth in Q4 and 2022. Our key challenge remains operational, both in mitigating the continued
inflationary headwinds and supporting customer demand. I will provide more details on the next slide, but
I want to thank our team who has been working tirelessly to support our customers, and I also want to
thank our customers and suppliers who continue to partner with us as we address these issues.

You see the efforts of the team reflected in our Q3 results. Organic sales were up 4% over Q3 of last year
and up 7% over Q3 of 2019. Adjusted EPS of $0.71 was better than we anticipated, helped by a lower tax
rate. Given the rising input cost headwinds, we have been aggressive on price and controllable costs, while
preserving investments critical to differentiation and growth.

Our HVAC team more effectively manage price/cost, and that was reflected in its segment margins of
19.1%. Our Fire & Security team also reacted aggressively, but it is our business that is most impacted by
chip shortages.

The Refrigeration story is mixed. While the segment drove solid 14% organic growth and continue to gain
traction on strategic initiatives, we did not react aggressively enough on both price and cost, resulting

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

in disappointing segment margins. I am confident that Tim and the team are taking the right actions to
position us well for 2022.

All in all, this is shaping up to be a strong year for Carrier. We are raising our top line expectations from
10% to 12% organic growth to about 13% over last year, indeed, up 6% over 2019. We are also raising
adjusted EPS range to the high end of what we previously indicated, now projecting approximately $2.20,
up 33% over last year. Despite inflationary challenges, we remain on track to deliver over 70 basis points
of margin expansion this year while generating about $1.9 billion in free cash flow.

Turning to Slide 3. The supply chain challenges are significant. Between raw material escalation, supplier
price increases, chip shortages and logistics costs, full year input cost pressure has now increased from
about $250 million in our July forecast to about $375 million. We are tackling this situation both tactically
and strategically.

Tactically, we have a virtual global supply chain war room that operates 24 hours a day. We have devoted
significant additional resources into supply chain management, many of whom are on site at our suppliers.
We have redirected ocean freight routes to avoid extended port delays using a newly implemented digital
tool.

Strategically, we are taking actions to emerge from this period with a more resilient supply chain. For
example, we are working to minimize single points of failure. 2020 had roughly 25% dual sourcing of
critical components. We will end 2021 with over 35%. We are targeting 75%. Integrated circuits have our
acute focus, and we are working directly with our chip OEMs on securing supply. We are also localizing
certain commodities to remain low cost and reduce logistics costs and complexity.

We have increased our investments in automation by 50% this year. We will have more than 3 million
automated manufacturing hours by the end of this year, and we have a plan to have 6 million by the end
of 2026. Our investments in digital tools provide better visibility and drive more proactive actions across
our factories and supply chain, and we are deploying Carrier Excellence to drive productivity.

For 2022, we expect inflationary headwinds at a minimum to be offset by the price increases that we have
already implemented and others that we will be announcing by the end of this year. Equally important is
our focus on managing the controllables on the cost side, including G&A.

We remain committed to investing and playing offense on growth, and you see our progress on Slide
4. Our north star remains consistent, to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent
building and cold chain solutions. In healthy buildings, we have over $350 million in orders and a pipeline
of over $550 million, ahead of our full year expectations. We continue to see strong traction in key
verticals, including K-12 with a pipeline that is 30% higher than Q2.

We are very well positioned to address our customers' sustainability needs. Over 30% of our residential
heating sales in North America are now heat pumps. We were honored to win a prestigious innovation
award at the recent AHR Expo for our Infinity 24 heat pump with Greenspeed Intelligence, the industry's
most advanced heat pump with premium energy efficiency. Globally, 33% of commercial heating sales are
now heat pumps, up from 15% 5 years ago, and we project this to be 50% within 5 years.

We plan to capture more than our fair share by driving differentiation. For example, earlier this year, we
launched our new air-cooled chiller heat pump platform in Europe. Its global warming potential is 70%
lower than our previous chiller and improves our customers' energy efficiency by up to 30% versus legacy
technologies. Our chiller and heat pump sales for this platform were up 30% year-over-year through Q3
contributing to share gains.

On Abound, it is the connective tissue for intelligent connected buildings. For example, I recently visited
with Dr. Scott Boden from Emory at his newly opened state-of-the-art health care facility. Carrier and
Emory are innovation partners in this healthy, intelligent and sustainable facility with the full suite of
Carrier technologies: HVAC, building automation systems, fire detection, access and video management,
digital solutions and Abound, which ties it all together.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Our progress on Lynx is equally encouraging. Our truck/trailer and shipping fleet customers are
increasingly adopting our subscription-based connected fleet monitoring digital solutions. We have seen
mid-teen growth in our subscription portfolio year-to-date, and we have a strong order book and pipeline.
We recently signed an agreement with one of the largest refrigerated truck fleets in the United States
to provide subscription-based telematics and reefer fleet monitoring. The customer will benefit from
increased efficiencies, less downtime and lost products and overall lower energy consumption and costs.

We continue to see progress on our 3 pillars of growth, with share gains, VRF, expanded geographic
coverage and increased digitally-enabled aftermarket and recurring revenues, which I'll discuss more on
Slide 5.

Q3 aftermarket revenues were up about 12% year-over-year, and we are tracking to double-digit
aftermarket growth this year. We have launched a broad portfolio of aftermarket solutions, including
spare parts, preventative maintenance, break-fix repairs, mid-life modifications and upgrades, remote
monitoring and other digital services.

Digital enablement is foundational. In addition to Abound, we recently launched Breeze, a new e-
commerce platform focused on capturing high-margin parts sales with our national account customers in
residential and light commercial HVAC.

Our service coverage levels are at all-time highs. In commercial HVAC, we remain on track to have
60,000 chillers under service contracts this year. In Refrigeration, we signed a 3-year BlueEdge Service
contract with ScottsRL, Australia's largest national refrigerated transport fleet. Tangible progress on these
strategies is driving strong organic growth in 2021 and positions us well for continued top line sticky
growth in 2022 and beyond.

Another component of our growth is acquisitions. As you can see on Slide 6, we are making great progress
in this area as well. Our strong balance sheet enables us to play offense on capital deployment, including
M&A, both focusing on digitally-enabled recurring revenues. For example, Nlyte is complementary to our
ALC building management system offerings in the fast-growing data center vertical.

Nlyte Software optimizes rack loads and monitors power and heat generation. ALC has market-leading
technology, which automates the cooling systems to effectively and efficiently dissipate that generated
heat. Together, we provide an integrated solution to monitor and control both the power and the cooling
systems to optimize data center operations.

Similarly, BrokerBay is complementary to our Supra business. Supra leverages the mobile credentialing
capabilities used across our broad security portfolio to give us high market share in locks that support
residential real estate showings, enabling 45 million property showings in 2020. Agents love our
technology and have been pushing for more digital offerings such as scheduling, real-time communication
and actionable insights.

BrokerBay brings a highly differentiated real estate management cloud ecosystem that adds these sought-
after capabilities. Together, we provide a one-stop shop to improve agent productivity. Early customer
response has been tremendous.

Last week, we announced the acquisition of Denmark-based Cavius, an innovative residential alarm
company. Cavius has a complete range of smoke, heat, flood and carbon monoxide alarms, including
the world's smallest photoelectric smoke alarm. In combination with Kidde, we can further enhance our
innovative residential fire safety product offerings and strengthen our connected technologies innovation
pipeline globally. The market opportunity is very attractive as fire safety regulations expand across the
globe. We continue to build out our M&A pipeline, and we will remain focused on our strategic priorities.

With that, let me turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with comments about the quarter and provide
details on our outlook. Please turn to Slide 7.

As expected, the results were very similar to Q2. Price realization was better than expected, but that was
offset by higher-than-expected input costs. All segments were on track to over-deliver on top line growth,
but increasing supply chain constraints impacted availability and led to shipment delays and contributed to
record backlogs.

Sales of $5.3 billion were up about 7% compared to last year. Currency was 1 point tailwind for sales in
the quarter and acquisitions, mainly Giwee,added another 2 points of growth. Given the unusually strong
residential HVAC performance last year, this quarter had a more challenging comparison. Nonetheless, we
delivered organic sales growth of 4%.

Adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was down about 120 basis points compared to last year, but was up
about 100 basis points from the second quarter on lower sales. The year-over-year margin decline was
impacted by the absence of last year's cost containment activities. As expected, price/cost was modestly
negative in the quarter.

I'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but I'll
share that we plan additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply
chain. Some of these price increases were announced earlier this week, including up to double-digit price
increases in our residential and light commercial HVAC businesses in North America. Fire & Security and
Refrigeration are also planning additional price increases.

Free cash flow was $505 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion through 9 months. Inventories are higher
than expected as we incur shipping delays given component shortages. Last year, Q3 benefited from
timing around payables which did not recur this year. Finally, we repurchased about 2.7 million shares in
the quarter for $146 million, and we remain on track to repurchase about 10 million shares this year.

In the appendix, we included the year-over-year Q3 adjusted EPS bridge summarizing many of the points
I just discussed. You will note that Q3 operational performance reflected the impact of the absence of last
year's temporary cost containment actions and benefited from $0.05 in discrete tax items not included in
our July guidance. This benefit is separate from the tax charge of $136 million included in GAAP earnings.
In essence, we're in the process of some legal entity reorganizations to enable the pending Chubb sale
triggering tax liabilities.

On our balance sheet, you will note that Chubb's assets and liabilities have now been reclassified as
assets and liabilities held for sale. As previously communicated, we still expect to net about $2.6 billion of
cash from the sale of Chubb. As to timing, we currently estimate the transaction to close in December or
January.

Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 8. HVAC organic sales were up about
2% in the quarter, including the better-than-expected 2% decline in residential HVAC given the tough
compares. Distributor movement was up about 3% over an exceptionally strong quarter last year. The
result is that residential field inventories were down high single digits sequentially from the end of Q2.

The North American light commercial business continued the growth we saw in the second quarter, up
14% versus last year. Distributor movement was about 9% and light commercial field inventory levels are
now down about 11% year-over-year. Overall, commercial HVAC sales were up about 4% organically.

As expected, HVAC margins were down about 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by the tough
residential comparison, last year's benefit from the temporary cost actions and the impact of additional
pricing to offset cost inflation. Margins were up about 40 bps from the second quarter and the segment
remains on track to generate about 16% adjusted operating margin this year.

Moving to Refrigeration on Slide 9. Sales were up 14% organically as the growth in transport demand
continued. Transport refrigeration was up about 24% in the quarter, with very strong growth in both global
truck/trailer and container. Our Sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was
up about 20% in the quarter.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Commercial refrigeration was slightly down year-over-year due to a mid-single-digit decline in China.
Margins were up about 40 bps in the quarter compared to last year as the benefit from higher sales was
offset by substantial supply chain and labor challenges, the timing of price increases as well as last year
benefiting from temporary actions. We continue to incur higher costs to meet customer demand in this
segment. As Dave mentioned, we're disappointed in the margin performance in this segment, and we now
expect 2021 operating margin to be in the mid-12% range, lower than we previously expected.

Moving on to Slide 10. Organic sales for the Fire & Security segment grew about 2% as products were up
about 3%, while field was flat. Within the product business, which represents about 60% of the segment
sales, residential fire was down slightly, while commercial fire was up. Access solutions and industrial fire
were both up high single digits.

Operating margins were down about 100 bps compared to last year as last year benefited from the
temporary cost actions. Margins were up 240 basis points sequentially, and we continue to expect overall
margins for this segment to be in the [ mid-13 ] for the year.

Now let me review the order activity we saw in the third quarter on Slide 11. As you can see, our
residential and light commercial orders remained positive despite the very strong third quarter last year.
Within that business, orders were down in residential in the high single digits on tough comparisons
but light commercial orders were up over 40% as the recovery in that business continues. Backlog in
residential is up sequentially and remains some 70% or so higher than at this point last year.

Commercial HVAC orders were up about 12% compared to last year and backlog increased about 5%
sequentially and about 20% year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the global truck/trailer
business remained solid and up about 15% year-over-year driven by strong growth in Europe. The order
intake and backlogs exiting Q3 continued to position the Refrigeration segment to achieve the expected
high-teens organic sales growth for the year.

Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also remained strong. Product orders were up 10% year-
over-year, with strong double-digit growth in access solutions and industrial fire. Field orders were up mid-
to high single digits organically.

On the right, you can see that orders are up in all geographies, except in China. In China, HVAC orders
were up in the mid-single digits while orders in Refrigeration and Fire & Security were down in the double
digits.

Let's move to Slide 12, updated outlook. To reiterate what we said last quarter, we are including Chubb
in the outlook until the transaction closes. Based on our Q3 performance, price realization and higher
backlogs, we now expect organic sales to be up about 13% for the year, which is higher than our prior
10% to 12% outlook.

The benefit of higher organic sales is offset by higher input costs. We now expect to exit 2021 with price/
cost being neutral in Q4 versus our prior guide of positive price/cost in Q4.

We continue to expect an adjusted operating margin of a little over 13.5%. Full year incremental
investments are expected to be about $150 million, consistent with prior guidance. The Q3 discrete tax
benefit of $0.05 carries over, so this all leads to an updated 2021 adjusted EPS outlook of about $2.20. As
you build your models, note that Chubb represents about $0.24 of the 2021 annual earnings, including the
noncash pension income. Also, if we thought 2021 outlook would be above $2.20, we would have included
that in a range. We continue to expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion.

Slide 13 shows the bridge from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the current guidance. As you can
see, the biggest driver is the lower-than-expected adjusted tax rate as higher volume is offset by price/
cost. Just to note about the fourth quarter, we expect incremental investments this year to mostly offset
the benefit of the absence of $0.04 of unusual items in the last -- in last year's fourth quarter.

In closing, the first 9 months of the year was strong, with double-digit organic growth and 35% adjusted
EPS growth. Thank you all. Thank you to all of our colleagues and partners managing and supporting
strong demand in a very challenging supply chain environment.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can you hear me?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes, Andy.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just a question on just sort of philosophical approach to Carrier 700 in this inflationary environment,
right, because you actually are putting numbers, but sort of the optics of it seems like you're missing your
targets despite the fact that your pricing is very, very strong. So how do you guys think about maybe
changing the framework here to change incentives, right? Because clearly, it seems that this plant was
designed for low inflation/deflationary environment, and we're in a very, very different world. What are the
thoughts? What are the management and the Board's thoughts about it?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes, Andrew, thanks. And let me start and Patrick can add. You're absolutely right. Carrier 700 is an all-in
number. And what happened last year is that it was such a unique year where you had some onetime cost
takeouts that we were doing with furloughs and other things and some onetime benefits we were doing
seizing on the productivity side. And it got a bit tortured as we went through last year into this year, which
is what we're seeing is sort of inflationary pressures that we haven't seen in a few decades.

So what we've really fixated on as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that we
are price/cost-positive, which means aggressively pricing as much as we can and also being controlling
the controllables on all things that are related to cost. So we are doing a lot with Carrier Alliance. We're
driving productivity. We're managing commodities as best we can.

So our focus as an organization is doing everything we can to make sure that in this very unique
environment, we stay price/cost-positive. So we still mention where the Carrier 700 number is to make
sure that we didn't lose that thread. But as we go into next year, obviously, Chubb will be gone, which will
form a bit of a reset. And then we have to kind of step back and look at where we are.

The underlying principle of Carrier 700 and having 56,000 people around the world focused every day on
making sure that we control everything we can control on the cost side is still there, and it will never stop.
What we'll do in our February 22 Investor Day is kind of give some context on where that is to reframe it
going forward. But the underlying DNA of cost takeout will always be a part of Carrier.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then just a question about -- thinking about connection between orders and sales into next year
because I think this year has been very different in terms of how long the sales season was, right, the
strength of the orders, the comps. So how should we think about what the existing backlog and order
rates in September, October? What's the early indication for 2022 given how unusual '21 was, specifically
with resi HVAC?

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes. I think if you look broadly, Andrew, the backlog almost across the portfolio is at record high. So we
feel very, very good about where we are in terms of our order -- our sales forecast for the rest of this year.
And as we start thinking about next year, we're more booked now for early next year than we normally
would be at this time, given the record backlogs. If you think about our residential backlogs, we're up
40% in terms of our backlog. Sequentially, we're up 70% year-over-year. So we're at very high level of
bookings. Our challenge is making sure that we continue to keep up with the demand. But we feel very,
very encouraged by our backlog positions pretty much across the portfolio.

Operator

And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I'd like to start with light commercial HVAC. That 40% plus orders really does stand out. Just talk about
the drivers, how much of this might be catch-up? Is it easy COVID comps, but is it part of an underlying
rebound in non-res construction? That would be helpful.

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes, Deane, clearly, the comps are a bit easy compared to last year, but there's just a lot of strength.
What we had said when we were forecasting like commercial coming into this year, as we reminded people
that it's 80% replacement, 20% new. So there was a lot of pent-up demand coming out of last year. Some
of the key verticals that have been strong all year continue to be strong.

We see a lot of demand in places like warehouse. K-12 has been extremely encouraging. We have a
whole dedicated focus on making sure that we support that vertical. Retail restaurants are coming back
online, and we gained share. It looks to us like we gained 300 basis points of share year-to-date in light
commercial. And I think part of that is driven by our ability to support the customer. It hasn't been without
input cost pressures, but we've gone to great lengths to make sure that we can support our customers.

So when you look at all the different variables, orders up more than 40% year-over-year when we look
at the quarter. Field inventory is down significantly, which bodes well for the future. Our backlog is up
sequentially. It's up almost 3x over 2020, and movement from our distributors into our end customer base
remains in the double-digit range. And we -- then we just announced a price increase of up to 12%. So a
lot to like in light commercial.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then as a follow-up, can you comment on China? It looked like HVAC was a bit better, but it's
certainly, overall, you -- there were more pressures. And just give us a sense of what the demand is, any
operating conditions that you would comment on?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes. China orders for HVAC were up in that mid-single-digit range. The rest of the portfolio did see some
orders challenges. So the one watch area given the Evergrande attention would have been commercial
HVAC, and what we're still seeing there is some orders tailwinds. I think -- look, the good news is that
China is a very strategic important market for us. It's 8% of our sales, and we continue over the long term
to lean into China. We want to be in China for China, and it's a very strategic market for us over the long
term.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

If you look at the Evergrande situation, that seems to be most acutely impacted in some of the Tier 3, Tier
4 cities focused on multifamily residential, which is, for us, is a very, very small percent of Carrier sales.
It's probably 0.5% of our sales, that specific area. So I think we're well -- and well calibrated on some of
those issues. Overall, when you look at China, real estate is a very important part of China. So I do think
the government is going to be incentivized to support that industry, the overall real estate industry. But we
feel, overall, very well positioned in China.

Operator

And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wanted to focus on the HVAC segment and just a bit more clarity on your outlook for Residential
HVAC in North America. I think you mentioned the sales are down very slightly in Q3. The orders down a
little bit more. Maybe help us understand how you're thinking about that business for the next couple of
quarters, how comfortable you feel with the inventory levels in the distribution channel and the degree of
your concerns around any sort of major step down in that market coming up.

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Well, Julian, residential HVAC in North America continues to be encouraging for us. We did say that resi
was down a couple of percent in the quarter, which was less than what we thought. We had previously
thought it would be down in the 5% to 10% range. So what it really means for us is that the second half is
going to end up being probably up low single digits. And we previously thought the second half for us was
going to be down 5% to 10%.

So the good news is that movement continues to be positive. Field inventories, Patrick mentioned,
sequentially was actually down 7% versus Q2. And even splits are down versus prior year. And our
backlog, as I mentioned to Andrew, is up significantly over last quarter and even more significantly over
previous year.

So look, when we look at orders, there's some -- going to be some tough comps in the third quarter. We
look at October, orders continued to be strong. And all the underlying fundamentals with new housing
starts this year is in the plus 13% range year-over-year. I think for the homebuilders, there's going to be
some pushout into next year given some of the supply chain challenges that they and like the rest of us
are seeing.

But the work-from-home phenomenon, units kind of having a slightly shorter life. A lot of those underlying
factors continue to give us some confidence as we go into next year. So when we get into February, we
will give more specificity. But for right now, a lot of the underlying factors that have been supporting the
demand continue.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then just my second question. Okay...

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

No, I apologize, Julian. And look, what it means for the full year is that we had said that we thought
resi was going to be up low teens. We're now looking at it being up high teens. So I know that it does
naturally, when you're in that range, trigger questions about comps. But again, the -- and we'll be very
cognizant. We work extremely closely with our distributors to keep inventory levels in balance with them.
But I think as we go into next year, a lot of those encouraging signs that have been supporting us continue
to be there.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's great. And then maybe on Refrigeration. You had called out the sort of sluggish price increase and
that helped drive that disappointing margin performance. Maybe help us understand sort of how quickly
you think you can catch up on that price/cost aspect. And in particular, sort of how you're managing it in
transport refrigeration, where you've got extremely volatile orders and build numbers in the market right
now.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Julian, Patrick here. So first of all, there are good things happening within that segment. So you
noticed a very strong sales growth, double-digit growth in transport. CCR, Commercial Refrigeration, was
about flat. But as we mentioned, the margin performance of this is disappointing given the strong sales
growth. And so a focus in that segment now is a closer -- a better control on the cost side, but also, and I
would say especially being more aggressive and timely on price increases.

You mentioned that we have significant backlogs there. Those started at the end of last year that has
given a somewhat limited ability to pass on pricing, but that is changing now. And so as that window
opens up and as we take on orders for next year, we are ensuring that, one, the prices for these orders
are higher; and two, that we retain the flexibility for these orders to adjust pricing if raw material prices
change. And so it's a significant focus for Tim White and the team.

Operator

And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Interesting times. So very strong performance in light commercial, plus 14% revenue and obviously very
strong orders. We haven't got a whole lot of detail on the market right now, but when you compare, it
had much weaker trends with supply chain. So I'm just wondering if there was some share shift around
the quarter. So any context there would be good. And then within applied, that seemed to be a little bit
weaker than the first half run rate. So maybe I'm wrong there. But any color on applied trends by market?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes. When we look at light commercial, it's hard to look at share in just a quarter. But year-to-date, we
do think that we've gained 300 bps of share. So that can swing, of course. We're not spiking any balls.
But we do think that we've gained share in light commercial. It's a very core strategic market for us, and
we continue to -- we will continue to lean in with new products and working with our distributor base and
really making sure that, that's a market that we go aggressively after.

With commercial HVAC, look, there's a lot of encouraging signs there as well. ABI, it's been higher than
the Architectural Billing Index. It's been higher than 50 now for 8 consecutive months. Patrick mentioned
that, overall, we were up mid-single digits. North America was kind of in line with that. Europe was a bit
higher. China was a bit higher. Orders were up over 10% for commercial HVAC.

And a really important thing for us is we really like our ALC controls business. That was up very strong.
Those sales were up in the high teens, high margin, very differentiated, important business. And
aftermarket has been very thematic for us, and we grew double digits there. So we're encouraged by
commercial HVAC. Overall, when you look at just equipment applied orders, those were up 15%. So our
key focus for CHVAC, like the rest of the portfolio, keep driving orders and then turn the world upside
down to make sure we can deliver.

And then on the residential, what kind of reaction are you getting to the price increases? How much of
that headline price increase do you think will stick? And as we go into next year, what price increase --
well, are you planning another pricing, say, assume you offer Jan 1? And what kind of price parameters or
price range do you think will stick for 2022? And is that enough to offset the [ volatilization ]?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes, I think the short answer is yes. So we announced actually earlier this week that we would have a
price increase effective January 1 of up to 10% for resi. We're seeing realization in the range of 6% last
quarter. We probably will see about the same number this quarter, which is higher than historical price
realization. These conversations are always difficult, the earlier question on transport. But we have to have
these direct discussions with our direct and end customers because of the inflationary pressures we're
seeing.

So we're very encouraged by the price stickiness we've seen this year. I would say the resi business has
been the most effective within Carrier, ensuring that we try to stay out in front on these price increases.
And I think that will bode well for us as we go into next year.

Operator

And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. Can you hear me?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Yes, I guess, so first question. Patrick, you were probably one of the earlier ones out there in the
industrial talking about kind of the reset or wrap around inflation into the first quarter of next year that
you have contracts and other kind of locked-in buys that will reset. Do you feel like you have enough price
out there right now as we kind of flip over the line into '22 to cover that in the first quarter? It sounds like
you're okay in 4Q, but I think you've already made mention that, that will kind of mechanically go higher
sequentially.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Josh. I'll talk about our current thoughts about 2022 rather than being a quarter specific. But for
planning purposes, we're actually including additional price increases to address the continued input cost
headwinds and the hedges that are rolling off from which we benefited last year. As Dave mentioned, just
in HVAC this week, we've announced price increases of up to 12% in residential and light commercial. I
think it is safe to say that we're assuming input cost headwinds next year that exceeded the $375 million
we're seeing this year.

And so I think Dave mentioned in his comments that total headwinds this year are about $375 million
input cost. So we expect it to be more than that next year. If I look at the carryover of the pricing
actions that we have taken this year, the carryover is about $350 million to $400 million. That excludes

14

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

the additional price increases that we've announced this week in -- for resi and light commercial and
excludes additional price increases that we will be announcing and implementing in the remainder of our
businesses.

And so from an overall perspective, our goal remains for 2022 to be at least price/cost neutral. Of course,
we want to do better than that. But the key takeaway for our team is in this environment, we need to be
very agile and be able to react quickly on what input costs are doing.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then on the commercial business, Dave, I appreciate the commentary on the
earlier question there. I guess orders earlier in the year were pretty strong. I get comps are a factor.
Anything that would have held back the quarter delivery-wise or order-wise, like a project getting pushed
out or supply chain kind of making delivery a little tougher? Just kind of wondering how we square up the
order commentary with the sales growth this quarter.

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes, Josh, we do continue to see some supply chain challenges affecting some of the output. I would
say that if you look at our Charlotte facility, which does a lot of the production for our commercial HVAC
business here in North America, we had some initial issues about a year ago that we then addressed. And
just as we were coming out of those kind of 3PL-related type issues, we then ran into a bunch of supply
chain issues.

So our sales could have clearly been higher in the quarter if we didn't have that. We're working closely
with our customers to make sure that they know what they're going to get when. But order is strong. It's
in one of the factories that we would expect to start to recover as the supply chain issues from their Tier 1
start to recover.

Operator

And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So I know we've talked a lot about price/cost and touched on Carrier 700, but just to make sure we've
got this straight for next year. Carrier 700 hasn't included the pricing increases. And so is the way to think
about the benefits we should expect next year, I think, is being somewhat below the [ 2 25 ], I think that
we were originally expecting, but more than offset by these pricing increases that you're taking through
the rest of your organization?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think, Joe, that the easiest way to think about this is that from a price -- overall price/cost point of
view, and that explains some of the pricing actions we announced this week and we'll be announcing over
the coming weeks, the intention is to be neutral in worst case. And so -- and that would include anything
we do on the Carrier 700. And as Dave mentioned earlier in the first question from Andrew is, however, we
measure Carrier 700 gross or net.

The most important thing is that the entire organization is focused on continuously to drive out costs and
driving efficiencies to help offset any input cost increases such as merit or inflation. And will enable us, of
course, to continue to invest in our business long term.

David L. Gitlin

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

What I'd add, Joe, is that I think the good news is we're going into next year with eyes wide open on the
inflationary pressures. And I think our team is pricing accordingly.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And I guess the other question is, clearly, with Chubb coming out, you're going to
have some proceeds to put capital to use. Just any updated thoughts on your priorities for use of cash and
offsetting some of the dilution associated with Chubb next year?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Joe. I would say very -- completely consistent with what we mentioned last quarter. Our first priority,
fund organic growth, then to fund inorganic growth, then funding a growing and sustainable dividend and
then returning cash through shareholders through share repurchase. What we mentioned last quarter
with the proceeds, one, we expect to pay down about $750 million of debt. That's kind of prorated from a
capital structure point of view with the EBITDA we lose from Chubb.

What we've also said last quarter, we announced a share repurchase authorization of about $1.75 billion.
We still expect to buy about 10 million shares this year. And what that would leave us at the end of this
year, it will leave us with about $1.6 billion of authorization remaining at the end of this calendar year.
And what we've said from a repurchase point of view is that we would redeploy this over 12 to 18 months
toward share repurchase.

So that kind of gives you an idea of the sequence for the share repurchases. But of course, as I
mentioned, priority #1 is funding growth, including inorganic growth. And obviously, we have significant
capital that we can put to work, and that's why we have a growing pipeline of acquisitions. We've made
some acquisitions this year. We covered them in some of the slides. But there are some acquisitions that
are a little bit larger in size in the pipeline as well. And so we're working hard on getting some of these
onboard. Dave, anything?

Operator

And our next question comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens.

Thomas Allen Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I appreciate all the commentary around price/cost, Carrier 700, et cetera. If we boil it all down for 2022,
is high 20s still a fair aspiration to think about for a core conversion? And then if you think about --
sometimes we talk about core operational versus what's actually going to be reported in the P&L. Any
big delta between those 2 that you would want to make sure to point out for folks. Obviously, the Chubb
divestiture would be one, but anything else you want to make sure to point out today?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Tommy, Patrick here. I understand there are lots of moving pieces in conversion. And this year,
particularly what's playing an important role is one, some of the acquisitions we've made that in year 1
don't contribute yet as much earnings; two, the impact of currency. And then, of course, an important
element this year is, of course, the whole price/cost dynamic, where we're adding this year pricing of
well over $300 million for the full year, yet that is not falling through the bottom line. Of course, it has a
negative impact on our conversion number.

That being said, for next year, and I'm going to exclude any significant changes in mix because we
don't want to get into that, good or bad. But from an operational point of view, we absolutely would
still target earnings conversion in that high 20s to about 30% range. Depending on what do we do on
the acquisition side, depending on price/cost, that might be slightly different. But operationally, that's
absolutely something that we target and work towards. No change.

Thomas Allen Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. Thank you, Patrick.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Tom.

Thomas Allen Moll
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Dave, I wanted to follow up a big picture question here. You've moved quickly as a pure play on a lot of
fronts. I'm curious what's a body -- a big body of work that remains in front of you maybe for next year
just in terms of changes you envision making to the business with that pure-play flexibility? I mean, G&A
transformation or process improvement is one area that comes to mind. But what are some of the big
priorities in your mind at this point?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Tommy, we continue to stick with the playbook that we laid out at our February 10 Investor Day of last
year. We said that we would invest in growth. And this year, despite all the input cost challenges, we're
going to continue to invest $150 million in growth along the lines of our 3 pillars of growth, continue to
grow the core and continue to look at adjacencies like VRF and geographic expansion like you saw with
Cavius.

And then continue to really lean into recurring revenues, aftermarket digital. We're in the first inning on
that journey. We have a long way to go with our aftermarket growth and recurring revenues, and that will
be very thematic for us certainly going into next year and for years to come.

We said that we would be super aggressive on cost. And despite the fact that the Carrier 700 number itself
is what it is, the focus on cost within the organization, G&A transformation is a major theme for us. We've
set up these global centers of excellence. We're going to be pushing more and more work into these low-
cost centers of excellence, more G&A reductions, simplification across the portfolio, that will continue to
be.

And we have -- we've gone from $10 billion of net debt when we spun to now. We'll end, after we sell
Chubb, to closer to $4 billion of net debt. So our ability to play offense on organic and inorganic growth is
in a great place. So we'll continue to look at where we can really complement our existing portfolio to play
offense. So we like our playbook. We like our focus. What we have to do is now transition from doing what
we said we were going to do to doing best-in-class in everything we do, and that's going to be our focus in
'22 and beyond.

Operator

And our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So just on the realized price in the quarter, what was that for total co on an absolute basis?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

You can think of pricing, Steve, of about $125 million in Q3, significantly better than Q2, growing to about
$150 million in Q4. And so from a price realization point of view, you'll recall because you asked me the
question after Q1, we started from less than 0.5 point in Q2. We're above 2 points, give or take. And in
Q4, we'll be between 3% and 4% of overall company price realization. So we're seeing it pick up, but of

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

course, we've been trailing a little bit of the input cost increases. But in Q4, we do expect price/cost to be
neutral. So it is clearly picking up.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. And I have resi at around like $65 million, $70 million of that?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

The way you can think about resi for both Q3 and Q4, about 6% realized. We did that in Q3. We expect
the same in Q4. I don't know the exact dollar amount. But that's kind of what we realized in resi, Steve.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then just trying to kind of parse this out a little more for -- to
follow up on Joe's question. I mean there was a pretty big number next year of kind of carryover cost
savings, if you will, I mean in a couple of hundred million dollars at least. Are you now saying that like
that's not -- like because of everything that's happened, like it's still kind of a cultural mission statement
Carrier 700, but like as far as the bridge is concerned, it's kind of been blown up by a lot of this stuff and
that we just really shouldn't dial in that kind of -- those kind of savings if we're thinking about kind of a
mechanical bridge for next year?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes. Let me start, and then Patrick can kind of give some more specificity. The -- we have really tried to be
as specific as we can on what's the pricing cost we're seeing by quarter, and we'll give it in that color next
year. Carrier 700, when you see the kind of input costs we're seeing, it did change when it costs 10x as
much to get a container out of China into the United States. When we're buying chips on the spot market,
there have been some clear inflationary pressures that have affected the overall Carrier 700.

Having said that, if you were to step foot in this building, you would see an entire war room focused on
commodity management with our suppliers. You would see productivity being rolled out across the world.
So we will give specificity on cost carryover, inflationary pressures going into next year and how we're
going to offset that at a minimum with price that, again, like Patrick said, being price/cost positive is our
clear intent. But the Carrier 700 number itself is lower this year than what we thought. Patrick, do you
want to add to that?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think, Steve, our -- we still intend to drive cost out next year compared to this year. That has not
changed. And so all else equal, we would expect our earnings conversion next year to be better than this
year.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Just a follow-up on that. All these kind of like you said you're going to
more sources like dual-sourcing, et cetera. I mean, I guess, in a stable environment, that can lead to
better margin because you're kind of playing them against each other. My guess is when you're dual-
sourcing in this environment, it's actually -- I mean that's kind of like structurally higher cost, you're
trading off higher cost for availability. I mean is that the right way to look at it?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Well -- go ahead. No.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Actually, because there is shortages of some of the components, we do have to go to sources that
otherwise we would not have gone. And so that's one of the reasons why today we are incurring some
higher costs just because our normal sources have some constraints as well. And so some of the increases
we see this year are associated with that. But clearly, in a more stable environment, having more dual
sourcing should help from a cost point of view.

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes. I would add, Steve, that, look, there is an investment. When we say we've gone from, say, 1 million
automation hours to 3 million this year on our way to 6 million, that's an investment. But what happens
is that really starts to pay back. When you look at the investment to set up dual sources, there's an
investment. But when we get, hopefully, towards the second half of next year as you get out there, then
you have more supply/demand in balance, and then we will feel much better about our ability to get back
on the kind of year-over-year cost reduction numbers that we're used to seeing.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then one more. Sorry, a quick one. Sam is going to kill me. I [indiscernible] myself, I believe,
anything on the table, though. The $150 million in investments, how much of that is like rebates to
distribution or stuff like that, that you're kind of investing in installed base, if you will, in commercial or
resi or something like that? How much of that is that kind of activity versus like R&D and pure sales dollars
of hiring people and things?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

For this year, it's nothing.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Got it. Got it.

And our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky from Citigroup.

Vladimir Benjamin Bystricky
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

We've covered a lot of ground here, obviously. Just going back to labor. Obviously, labor availability seems
to be a growing issue. And we've now seen some labor actions in the U.S. in terms of strike activity. So
can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of wage inflation and labor availability in general? And then
more broadly, how you're thinking about labor relations overall and the risk of potential disruptions?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

Yes, Vlad. We -- to set the stage, we have 80% of our people outside the United States. And I would say
the real labor challenges we have are at a couple of our sites in the United States. And we have very close
relationships with our union partners and -- what we've -- in some areas in the United States, we've had
to raise wages a bit and we've also put in place some bonus structures for output. But we stay very, very
close with our union partners here, and we feel confident that we continue to create the right environment
where people want to work here, then we'll manage that.

Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And I think it makes a lot of sense around the incentives for production. So it seems
like it's helping with the results. Just following up, if I think back to last year, I think you added 600 or so
salespeople. Now that we're approaching the end of '21 and they've been onboard for a while, can you talk
about what you've seen from those incremental resources in terms of them ramping sales productivity?
And just more broadly, how you're thinking about the sales force positioning today, whether you see
opportunity to continue to add incremental talent and resources there?

David L. Gitlin
CEO & Chairman

We're very pleased with the results of the additional sales folks that we've added. We've been very
targeted where we've added them. We've been very focused in certain areas in North America and in
China, where we've added salespeople. We've seen very good additional sales. Look, we came in the year
thinking that we were going to grow 5%. And after all is said and done, we're going to end up growing
organically by 13%. And our investments in salespeople and things like digital R&D, that's all contributing.

So that's -- we felt we were underrepresented on the sales side. We've added the, I think, the right
number. And we did say that our total investment starts to modulate a bit as we go into next year. We're
going to end up with 50 additional investments. Clearly, salespeople take some years -- take some time to
pay back. But we look at it internally, we measure it on selling as a percentage of our gross margin. But
pleased with the investment and the payback.

Samuel Joel Pearlstein

And that was our last question. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave, closing remarks.
