THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the 2020 fourth quarter earnings conference call hosted by BNY Mellon.
[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist
of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.

I will now turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Magda Palczynska
Global Head of Investor Relations

Good morning. Welcome to BNY Mellon's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today, we will
reference our financial highlights presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at
bnymellon.com.

Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon's CEO, will lead the call. Then Emily Portney, our CFO, will take you through our
earnings presentation. Following Emily's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session.

Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP
measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings
press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor
Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today,
January 20, 2021, and will not be updated.

With that, I will hand over to Todd.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Thank you, Magda. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief summary of the fourth quarter
financial results, which Emily will then review in more detail, and then I'll come back with some thoughts
on our franchise and our outlook for 2021.

Starting on Slide 2. In terms of the fourth quarter, we reported revenue of $3.8 billion and earnings per
share of $0.79 or $0.96 after excluding notable items, which Emily will cover in a few minutes.

Turning to the full year 2020 financial results on Slide 3, and I'm referring to them on an adjusted basis.
Earnings per share of $4.01 were flat to the prior year on revenues of $15.9 billion. Fee revenue increased
over 5%, excluding notable items and almost $370 million impact of fee waivers in 2020. Expenses
were flat as our cost discipline and productivity gains essentially offset incremental investment, and the
operating margin was solid at 30%. Now we have a lower risk fee-based business model that positions
us well for this environment. We had no net charge-offs. We also delivered strong results through the
2 rounds of Federal Reserve stress tests announced in June and December. Our model is highly capital-
generative, and our common equity tier 1 ratio increased to 13.1% from 11.5%.

Now when I shared my 2020 priorities with you a year ago, of course, no one expected that the world
would change so rapidly and dramatically. Throughout the pandemic, we have supported employees,
clients and our communities. And we're proud to provide the infrastructure for several critical government
programs for COVID relief, including the term asset-backed securities loan facility, the municipal liquidity
facility, the primary dealer credit facility and the payment protection program. Now while navigating
the extraordinary environment, we continue to advance our long-term growth in net agenda across all
of our businesses. That agenda includes accelerating our digital and data transformation, investing in
several growth opportunities and leveraging the power of the open architecture platforms and solutions we
provide to help our clients grow their businesses.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

In Asset Servicing, we have seen no let-up in client onboarding this year. This is a testament to our focus
on client experience, data and digitization. Half of our ACA growth in Asset Servicing year-over-year was
from organic growth with new and existing clients, and we built positive momentum. We closed out the
year with significantly higher win ratios and retention rates and had our best sales quarter in the less
-- last 10 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Once onboarded, these wins will start to benefit revenue in late
2021.

We've been pursuing a strategy of moving up and across client value chains beyond just supporting
operations to revolutionize data and digital-enabled solutions across front, middle and back offices. For
example, we were recently mandated one of the largest asset managers in Europe to provide front-to-
back services adding custody, accounting and transfer agency. This includes a collaboration to integrate
an order management system to deliver portfolio and risk management, improve sales and distribution
and operational efficiencies. This is another example of our open-architected security servicing platform,
which we call OMNI. We are currently integrated with the leading OMS providers that cover 98% of the
addressable market. And our partnerships are starting to help us win business as the above example
illustrates.

We also have a leading data and analytics business and are now building on our 20-year track record
in software and service to create robust, cloud-based data and analytics capabilities. With the help of
several new clients who are early adopters, we have introduced a new platform called the Data Vault,
which allows clients to quickly onboard and manage both structured and unstructured data from many
sources. To share one example, we were selected by Janus Henderson to transform their global data
platform, including implementing the Data Vault, which will help improve the quality and ease of access to
investment information across the enterprise.

We also have a suite of new business applications for the front office, such as our ESG investment
analytics application, which has recently won a significant award as well as our distribution analytics
offering to help clients with asset growth. These applications, together with the Vault, position us well to
drive growth.

Pershing is one of the unique businesses that differentiates us from our custody peers that helps us build
deep relationships and is a powerful source of additional connectivity to the fast-growing wealth estate.
Fourth quarter results in Pershing benefited from elevated transaction volumes, which are expected to
moderate a bit in 2021, as well as continued strong underlying fundamentals. Net new assets for the
year were $82 billion. Pershing's business, which includes over 600 broker-dealers and 500 registered
investment adviser firms, is a very attractive and efficient platform for our asset servicing clients to access
their points of distribution. In fact, today, through Pershing, asset managers have placed $1 trillion of their
product and continue to value this unique opportunity that only we can offer.

Clearance and Collateral Management fees were up in 2020, excluding the disposal of an equity
investment last year and are -- and we continue to innovate in this space. For example, as a result of
intense collaboration between our market business, Asset Servicing, Clearance and Collateral Management
and Group Treasury, we are in the process of launching an innovative solution that offers clients the
ability to pledge money market fund shares to meet tri-party collateral obligations across a wide range of
transaction types, such as repo and securities lending agreements, securities note programs, collateralized
deposits, and also allows segregation of initial margin for derivative contracts, all in a straight-through
processing models. So clients can now buy money market funds on our Liquidity DIRECT platform and
seamlessly pledge them as collateral in these types of transactions.

In Treasury Services where we delivered good performance, we have continued investing in automation
and are advancing our real-time payments capabilities. We are actively working on an exciting large-scale
commercial payments pilot with one of the world's largest billers. This capability is expected to reach tens
of millions of consumers via their retail banks throughout 2021, leveraging continued adoption across the
RTP network that's called as the real-time payment system.

Within Investment Management, flows have been largely in step with industry trends, and we've offset
equity outflows with strong fixed income cash and LDI inflows. We've had 3 straight quarters now of long-

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

term inflows and have improved investment performance. Across the top 30 ranked strategies by revenue,
75% are in the top 2 quartiles on a 3-year basis compared to just over 70% a year ago.

In 2020, we launched 8 ETFs with more to come this year. We've also been building out sustainability
funds, such as the Future of Humans Fund with UBS, and a series of Mellon funds focused on pressing
global themes, for example, aging populations.

Finally, we continue to build out our leadership team. John Tobin was recently named as Chief Investment
Officer of Dreyfus cash investment strategies, bringing into this role deep and broad money market
industry expertise. We will continue to build on our leadership across the entire cash ecosystem to position
our business for long-term growth.

And just a couple of weeks ago, we announced that Euan Munro would be joining us as CEO of Newton in
June. Newton has proven and highly relevant track record in the investment industry, spanning 3 decades.
He'll be a great addition to Newton. So we're excited to have both of them join Hanneke's team.

Before I hand over to Emily, I'd be remiss if I did not comment on our push of BNY Mellon towards ever
greater diversity and inclusion. We have one of the most diverse Fortune 500 boards, and our Executive
Committee has become increasingly diverse. To accelerate progress in our most underrepresented ethnic
populations and help position our firm as a competitive choice with Black and Latin ex-graduates and
experienced professionals, we set some concrete short-term representation goals in the U.S. It's important
on many levels. And we know diversity is highly correlated to long-term financial performance.

And finally, during the year, I made a number of appointments to my leadership team. We have a highly
motivated group of talented employees implementing our strategy, which is centered on driving growth,
creating differentiated value for our clients, digitizing and optimizing our operating model and fostering a
high-performance culture that is focused on delivering excellent client service in new and innovative ways.

With that, Emily will now review our fourth quarter results in more detail, after which I will make some
concluding remarks.

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I will walk you through the details of our results for the
quarter and briefly review the full year as well. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I
specify otherwise.

Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported
revenue of $3.8 billion and EPS of $0.79. Both the current and prior year quarters included a number
of notable items. The fourth quarter 2020 results included an unfavorable $0.18 per share impact from
charges related to litigation, severance expenses, losses on 2 noncore business sales and lease exits and
real estate sales. For real estate, the charge is a result of plans to exist around 8% of our overall footprint,
and we expect this will be breakeven on an annualized basis within a year. Remember, our results in
the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from a gain on the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by
severance and litigation expenses and net securities losses. When excluding these notable items, the
fourth quarter of 2020 revenue was down 2% and EPS was down 5%. Results were negatively impacted
by continued low interest rates and associated money market fee waivers.

Net interest revenue was down 17%. Excluding notable items and fee waivers, fees grew 5%, driven by
the impact of higher market levels and continued positive momentum across most of our businesses. FX
and other trading was roughly flat due to $33 million of new capital hedge losses in the fourth quarter of
2020 or about 18% negative impact to that line item year-over-year, which is offset in investment and
other income.

Expenses are down 1% on both a reported and adjusted basis, with adjusted results due to savings
in G&A and distribution and servicing expenses, offset by continued investment in technology and the
unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

Our provision for credit losses was $15 million, reflecting reserve additions related to our commercial real
estate portfolio. Pretax margin of 24% or 29% excluding notable items, which, considering the impact of
interest rates and waivers which have minimal expenses associated with them, show the resiliency of our
model. ROE was 6.9% and ROTCE was 13% and included approximately 150 basis points and 300 basis
point impact, respectively, for the notable items.

We also continue to generate substantial excess capital as our CET1 and Tier 1 capital each increased by
about $700 million this quarter.

Page 5 sets out a trend analysis of the main drivers of the quarterly results and is adjusted for notable
items were indicated. Investment Services revenue was $2.9 billion, down 4%. The decline was primarily
a result of lower net interest revenue and fee waivers. These headwinds masked benefits from higher
market levels, volumes and liquidity balances as well as strong underlying momentum across many of our
businesses, which I'll get into later.

Investment & Wealth Management revenue increased 2% as higher market values and the impact
of the weaker U.S. dollar, along with improved investment performance, offset the impact from fee
waivers. The impact of money market fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and
servicing expense, was $134 million in the quarter, at the lower end of the $135 million to $150 million we
previously guided to and an increase of $33 million quarter-on-quarter. Whereas in prior quarters, most of
this impact was felt largely through Pershing or clearing service lines and, to a lesser extent, Investment
Management, this quarter, we began to see a more meaningful impact within Asset Servicing and Issuer
Services. We have provided you with a detail of the impact by business in the appendix of this highlight
deck.

Turning to Page 6 and 7, setting out full year results and trends. Our full year 2020 results demonstrated
resiliency and balance sheet strength during an unprecedented time. Excluding notable items, fees
grew 3% despite a roughly 250 basis point negative impact from fee waivers. Full year expenses were
essentially flat on an operating basis, in line with the guidance we have provided throughout the year.
Operating EPS was flat despite the impact from low interest rates and as we absorbed a higher credit
provision. And we delivered a solid pretax margin and strong ROTCE through a challenging year.

Turning to Page 8. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and
regulatory minimum. Common Equity Tier 1 capital totaled $21.9 billion as of December 31, and our
CET1 ratio was 13.1% under the advanced approach and 13.4% under the standardized approach. Tier 1
leverage was 6.3%, down 20 basis points from the third quarter due to higher deposits. As we have noted
in the past, we are comfortable operating with a ratio of around 5.5% to 6% versus the 4% regulatory
minimum. Our current Tier 1 leverage ratio is well above our target. Finally, our LCR in the fourth quarter
was 110%.

In terms of shareholder capital return, we continue to pay our $0.31 quarterly dividend, which totaled
$278 million this past quarter and are looking forward to resuming open market share repurchases in the
first quarter. This will be in compliance with the Federal Reserve's modified limitations that apply to all
CCAR banks and allows us to repurchase approximately $625 million of common stock in the first quarter.
We look forward to operating under the stress capital buffer framework, which will give us more flexibility
in terms of capital return.

Turning to Page 9. My comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Q4 net
interest revenue was down 3%, primarily driven by the impact of lower short-term rates. And although our
deposits increased significantly in the fourth quarter, they had minimal NIR value.

Turning to Page 10, which summarizes deposits and securities trends. Deposit balances continued to grow
over the course of the quarter and, on average, were up $28 billion or 10% from the third quarter and $75
billion or 32% from a year ago. On a sequential basis, a larger driver of the growth was excess liquidity in
the system, driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus. On a year-over-year basis, strategic deposit initiatives
across Treasury Services, Asset Servicing and Wealth Management business tied to underlying transaction
activity, which supports our client relationships with [ deep ] generation objectives, was a significant driver
of growth.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was negative 6 basis points, minimally changed from
the third quarter. As a reminder, about 1/4 of our deposits are in foreign currencies, including euro and
yen, which had negative rates. In the U.S., our average interest-bearing deposit cost was about 4/5.

Turning to the securities portfolio. On average, the portfolio was flat to the third quarter and
approximately $35 billion over the prior year or 27% as we deploy a significant portion of the growing
deposit base throughout the year. As the bar chart shows to the right, we continually -- we continue to
gradually increase our non-HQLA securities to increase yields while maintaining our conservative risk
profile. As a result, average non-HQLA securities, including trading assets, was $36 billion in the fourth
quarter, up $24 billion from a year ago.

Turning to Page 11. We provide you with some color on our asset mix and specifically the loan portfolio.
Exposures and statistics at year-end were largely similar to the third quarter. As a reminder, our portfolio
is predominantly investment grade. And for the year, we experienced net recovery. We recorded a $15
million provision this quarter as we internally downgraded a modest number of [indiscernible] main,
primarily in our commercial real estate portfolio. Our assumptions around the macro outlook as well as
the relative weighting of the scenarios were largely unchanged from the last quarter. And we continue
to closely monitor this portfolio, particularly the commercial real estate exposure in other sectors more
acutely impacted by the current environment.

Page 12 provides an overview on expenses, which we covered earlier. Turning to Page 13. As mentioned
earlier, total Investment Services revenue year-on-year declined by 4%, mostly due to the impact of low
interest rates. NIR was down 14%. These were flat or up 5%, excluding $113 million of fee waivers. FX
and other trading revenue had a strong quarter as FX revenue grew by over 30% in investment services,
driven by higher volumes and volatility. Assets under custody under administration increased 11% year-
over-year to $41.1 trillion, and we continue to see organic growth with new and existing clients as well as
the benefits from a high -- from higher market values and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.

As I move to the business line discussion, I'll focus my comments on fees. Within Asset Servicing, fees
were up modestly as higher market levels and FX and higher liquidity service fees partially offset the
impact of fee waivers, lumpy repricing associated with a few client renewals and lower sec lending.

In Pershing, continued strong underlying fundamentals offset the impact of fee waivers. Clearing house
were up 5%. Mutual fund assets up 10%, and we saw continued strong net new asset inflows of $28
billion in the quarter. Transactional activity also remained high as it did for most of 2020, and we would
expect that to normalize a bit as we head into 2021. Issuer Services fees decreased 3%, primarily due
to the impact of waivers. Ex-waivers, mid-single-digit growth in DR fees was offset by a small decline in
Corporate Trust. Treasury Services fees were up. Our payment volume growth, particularly in the second
half of the quarter, and the increased fees also reflect the improved product mix and client wins and higher
money market fund and deposit balances on the back of targeted initiatives.

Clearance and Collateral Management fees were down slightly. Good organic growth in our non-U.S.
business, where tri-party balances and clearances both grew double digits, was offset by declines in U.S.
volumes, lower intraday financing fees and the absence of income associated with an equity invested --
investment divested last year.

Page 14 summarizes the key drivers that affect -- that affected the year-over-year revenue comparison for
each of our investment services businesses.

Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 15. As noted earlier, total Investment and
Wealth Management revenue in the quarter increased 2%. Overall assets under management grew to a
record $2.2 trillion and were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to higher market value, $73 billion
of inflows and the positive impact of the U.S. dollar weakening. In the fourth quarter, we had net inflows
of $20 billion, including long-term strategies inflows of $15 billion, driven by a second straight quarter
of inflows in LDI as well as fixed income. Wealth Management had its strongest flow quarter in 2 years,
resulting in positive organic growth in the quarter. Investment and Management Revenue grew 3% as the
benefit of higher market levels and a weaker dollar were offset by the impact of fee waivers. Fee waivers
impacted growth by about 300 basis points. Wealth Management fees were down 1% due to the sale of

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

our Canadian wealth management business. Client assets grew to a record $286 billion and were up 8%
year-over-year.

Now turning to our Other segment on Page 16. The year-over-year revenue comparison was primarily
impacted by the gain of an equity investment in the fourth quarter of '19 and a business fair loss in the
current period. Expenses increased, reflecting severance and real estate impairment charges noted earlier.

And now a few comments about the outlook before I turn it back over to Todd. First, the more recent
usual caveat that the macroeconomic environment remains fluid. So as we think about full year 2021, for
NIR, our guidance remains unchanged and that a run rate slightly lower than the fourth quarter, call it
about 3%, remains a good proxy for the quarterly run rate expected this year. Although recent yield curve
deepening provides a modest tailwind, short-term rates have continued to decline. Also, we expect MBS
prepayment fees to remain at current levels despite this deepening yield curve as mortgage rates have
only risen slightly.

Finally, we are currently planning for average deposits for the year to be slightly lower than our fourth
quarter average as we help our clients to redeploy liquidity into more efficient investments on our
platform. For transaction-related fees, we expect volumes to normalize a bit versus the healthy levels
we saw in the fourth quarter. On money market fee waivers, we still expect to be at a full run rate in
the first quarter. We now, however, expect the impact of first quarter waivers net of distribution expense
benefit to be approximately $175 million, assuming short-term rates stay at current level. So as we
think about full year fees for the entire company, we expect them to be relatively flat as the impact of
equity appreciation, organic growth and the weaker dollar will be offset by fee waivers and lower volume.
Excluding labors, fees would be up 3%. By the way, we assume equity market will rise approximately 5%
from the beginning of 2021.

Regarding expenses, we continue to expect them to be flat for the full year on an operating and constant
currency basis. But due to recent weakening of the dollar, this means that in absolute terms, full year
expenses are now projected to increase by approximately $150 million or 1.5%. This currency impact is
offset by a light increase in fee revenues as previously discussed. Finally, in terms our -- of our effective
tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 19% for 2021. Specific to the first quarter, the items I just
mentioned will have a proportionate impact. But as a reminder, first quarter staff expenses are typically
higher relating to long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees. Also, in
the first quarter of 2020, we made an accrual adjustment that has -- that reduced the expenses that will
not be repeated this year. As a result, we expect first quarter total expenses to be up 3% to 4% year-
over-year, including the impact of currency.

With that, let me turn it back over to Todd.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Thank you, Emily. Before opening up for questions, let me share some final observations speaking
to Slides 17 and 18. Our franchise is powered by a wide breadth of services and capabilities. This
differentiates us and certainly makes us unique amongst our closest peers. We are a top 3 provider across
Asset Servicing, Issuer Service, Clearance and Collateral Management as well as Pershing, and we rank
among the leading players in more fragmented businesses, such as Wealth Management, Investment
Management and Treasury Services. This gives us a strong platform and scale, both of which are crucial
for success. We are responding to the evolving needs of our clients and actively connecting different parts
of the company to drive growth. While significant pandemic-related challenges remain, we are entering
2021 with confidence and momentum in our core franchise.

At the same time, overall revenues year-over-year will be impacted by the full effect of low interest rates,
money market fee waivers and the absence of COVID-related transaction activity. For the full year, we
expect to deliver modest organic fee growth similar to 2020, which we expect to accelerate beyond 2021
as our growth initiatives gain traction.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

As we look out to 2021, I have 3 overarching priorities for the company: one, execute our growth
initiatives; two, scaling and digitizing our operating model; and three, fostering a high-performance
culture that is focused on delivering excellent client service in new and innovative ways. While focusing on
these priorities, we will continue to vigilantly manage operating expenses, which we expect to be flat for
2021 on a constant currency basis.

Between 2018 and 2021, we funded approximately $1.1 billion in new investments by generating internal
efficiencies with no increase in expense. We will continue to invest in technology, although the profile
spend is more focused on initiatives to grow and make the business more efficient.

Turning to capital returns. We are pleased that we can resume share repurchases in the first quarter. We
remain committed to returning at least 100% of earnings to shareholders over time, including the excess
capital we have built since the second quarter of 2020. We have the capacity to drive meaningful EPS
growth through buybacks.

In conclusion, we have navigated an extremely challenging year well. Our capital-generative and low-risk
models deliver what is -- it is supposed to doing in terms of stability and capital generation. I'm proud
of the leadership team and the dedication and hard work of our employees during unprecedented and
challenging times.
And with that, operator, can you please open the line for questions?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brennan Hawken from UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Emily, there was a lot of walk-through there on the revenue guide, so I just wanted to make sure I heard
that correctly and understand where I should index. And you guys provide a lot of disclosure in -- on Slide
22.

Is the right starting point that we use the fee revenue ex fee waivers and notable items for 2020, which is
the 13.1% and then we layer in the different various impacts that you laid out and then take the new run
rate for fee waivers expected in 1Q and then kind of annualize that? Is that the right way to think about it?
And how does the strengthening of the dollar play into that? Sorry.

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. So just to -- I guess just to -- I will break down each and every piece. But ultimately, if you'd look
at our full year 2020, if you actually -- and you'll -- if actually take into account, we try to spell out as best
as possible, the impact of waivers. Likewise, we are expecting an increase in market appreciation as well
as we're going to have some favorability in terms of the weakening dollar. If you put all of that together,
year-on-year revenues will be essentially flat and up 3% ex fee waivers.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Fee revenue. That's fee revenue, Brennan.

That's fee -- yes. Sorry. That's fee revenue, yes.

And that is assuming -- and who knows where the dollar is going to be, but we just used the spot dollar at
year-end.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Fair enough. So the 12.77% is the number we should focus on to be flat basically ex all those puts and
takes?

Yes.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

Correct.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. Excellent. And then expenses flat, which is in line with what you gave in December on a constant
currency, but we've seen the weakening dollar. And so when we think about the expense line, if the
dollar remains unchanged from where we are now, and of course, we can calibrate that through the year,
depending on the different factors, we'll see a roughly 1.5% uplift on the operating expense line from the
2020 level. Is that fair?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Correct, correct.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay, okay, okay. Excellent. I just wanted to try to clarify some of that. And when we think about the
deposits dropping from the 4Q average level, are we -- is it fair to assume that we'll probably shake out
at a level that's above the third quarter? Or are you guys thinking that we might actually even revert to
down to that level or below? Is there any help you can provide in trying to think about how to gauge the
magnitude of that normalization in the deposit side?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. So ultimately, we're projecting deposits to be relatively flat from here or potentially to decline a bit.
Now in fairness, we could see excess liquidity in the system. But of course, we are monitoring our capital
ratios, and we have to optimize returns to shareholders. So we will be actively, very proactively, managing
the size of the balance sheet. So that's what we've -- that's ultimately roughly flat from here or slightly
lower.

Operator

And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Emily, just to follow up on the -- your organic growth outlook. I'm just wondering if you could help us put
in context like just what that measures, right? It's not necessarily a stock measure of just revenue growth.

So like is it taking the core building blocks of the segments and just kind of like measuring the unit
growth? And how do you put that 1.5% into context with the overall fee guide, right? Can -- do we -- I
don't know if you can maybe just walk us through that.

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. So when we think about organic growth, we define it as pretty much growth excluding market
appreciation or depreciation, excluding currency impact and excluding waivers. So I mean, that's generally
how we think about it. I think Todd had mentioned that we -- and over the course of 2020, it was around
between 1% and 2%. We're expecting it to remain pretty much stable at that -- at those levels, and that's
embedded into the fee forecast that I've just given.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a specific question on asset servicing fees that -- on the income
statement side, seeing that there was a little bit of a -- there was an increase in fee waivers in that

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

11.38% number, but even if you exclude that, Asset Servicing was down. The press release mentioned
something about some repricing. I'm just wondering if you can walk through just what happened, the
pushes and pulls there of why the core was down sequentially, whether it being organic growth repricing
activity, et cetera?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. So we had -- in Asset Servicing in the fourth quarter, we had higher -- we were helped by higher
market levels, higher FX and other trading and higher liquidity balances, but that was offset by waivers,
sec lending was down a bit. And yes, you are correct. There was a bit of some lumpy repricing in the
quarter, not -- ultimately, we don't control actually the timing, obviously, of repricing we happen to have
had 2 or 3 large relationships reprice on the back of renewal. So we ultimately retained the business, but
that was a modest headwind as well.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess just sort of a quick follow-up to that, is that -- have we rebased? Does it kind of
build off of here? Or how do you think about those repricing versus renewals as you think forward?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure, sure. So as you all know, repricing is very lumpy. You will see the full impact of those repricing
throughout the year, but it's not like we've seen anything structural or underlying -- an underlying change
in the trend of repricing. It's always been a modest headwind that we've offset with greater efficiency and
net new business.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Can you hear me?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes, Betsy.

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. So first question just on, I think the deposit commentary. I wanted to get a better understanding
as to why you think deposits aren't going to be continuing to increase as much as they have been. I mean
I think the Fed is still increasing the size of the balance sheet. I expect that you would get some benefit
from that.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. I think I'll start, and then I'm sure Emily will join in on this. I would expect that the Fed is going to
continue to buy securities, which kind of adds to the deposit base. And there's still some question exactly

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

how the very large balances that sit at the U.S. Treasury at the Fed, whether they're going to wind those
down. So the 2 of them could increase the overall reserves and deposits in the system.

That being said, we can manage some of that. And now that we're back in -- and we did that a number
of years ago. So we targeted some of the less valuable balances. And once we're able to use our capital,
that's not how we're going to use it. It's not -- it won't be particularly efficient. So we've demonstrated
that we can do that. And of course, any valuable deposits we'll take on, but if they're just short term with
very little benefit to them, we'll discourage that.

Betsy Lynn Graseck
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That's via pricing or what have you. I guess the other question, Todd, is you mentioned kind of one
of the strategies here that you're going to be executing on this year is to increase the efficiency and the
delivery of the products and services.

And I wanted to understand how you're thinking about that with regard to some of the OCC rules that
have been out there recently regarding stablecoin. I'm just wondering is how much does the blockchain
initiatives that you've got underway drive that efficiency improvement? Or is that more of a hobby? And
does it matter that the OCC has approved banks for stablecoin? Does that factor into your strategy?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. I think it clarifies things a bit. And there is a fair amount of activity. And by the way, we have
appointed somebody in front of what I'll call the tokenization efforts. They're really across 3 fronts, and we
are seeing some acceleration around tokenized assets, tokenized fiat currencies and also cryptocurrency.
So we're seeing a lot more interest in cryptocurrency and custodizing and other services associated with
it. We've done a little bit there. We have been a custodian for a big futures contract, and it's kind of like
getting it started.

In terms of tokenized currency, we've been a member of utility settlement cloud, which now finality from
an investor and a participant in development from the beginning, and we do see that having a meaningful
applications. And we're also involved in tokenizing assets, and we're looking at what we might be able
to do to tokenize into tri-party repo to make it more -- even more efficient. So I think it's going to be
an important element, and we're investing not hugely in it right now. It's not a -- I don't see a lot of
imminent revenues, but it's something that we will definitely be on the forefront on.

Operator

And we'll move to our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Emily, just a quick one on the net interest revenue outlook. The -- I think that you were implying it after
a 3% drop in 1Q versus 4Q would be the guidance will be stable for 2Q,3Q, 4Q. Just wondering what
the headwinds are if we are -- if we do have this steeper yield curve, I guess. Is the forward curve your
assumption with that? And then what would be the headwinds that would keep that stable if we were to
see a steepening yield curve and lower prepaid fees as we go throughout the year?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. Brian, our got -- you've got that spot on. Our guidance is take the fourth quarter run rate, discount
that, call it, about 3%, and that's a good proxy, not only for the first quarter, but when you think through
the average run rate for the rest for the year, at least based on what we know now. We don't try to get
cute. We just use the forward curve. And despite a steepening of the curve, we're still very sensitive to
short-end rates, which have actually come down.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

Also, when you think about where we play the duration of our investments, that part of the curve is
actually not up as much as the longer end. And I guess the last thing I would just point out about
prepayment fees, which you've mentioned, is that, despite a steepening of the curve, we really haven't
seen mortgage rates increase that much. So we're not expecting those at the moment anyway to really
decline much. So that's really -- all of this, of course, is subject to change based on the rate environment,
but that's how we're projecting.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That's clear. And then a second question...

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Brian, I'll just add just to make sure it's particularly clear. I mean when you think about the steepness
of the yield curve, we've seen that, but we've also seen short-term rates come in a little bit, and that's
meaningful. So if we do continue to see it, and we continue to -- and that starts to slow down prepayment
speeds or even mortgage spreads were to widen a little bit, that we would expect prepayment speeds to
slow down. But all we do is we use the current market's expected future rates, really the forward curve.
So that's what's in that estimate.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Right. Okay. That really makes sense. And then maybe, Todd, just going back to some of the initiatives
you mentioned in the early part of the call and trying to triangulate that with the organic growth rate.
So the 1.5% organic growth rate, I think that implies that your number is around $250 million of organic
revenue expectations for '21.

And then you mentioned -- I wrote down 5 different initiatives: The front-to-back mandate, the Data
Vault, ESG investment analytics, the collateral management, money market for intraparty repo solution
and the commercial payments, real-time payments system as well. Are those more -- just to get a flavor,
are those contributing more to, I guess, what -- if we could sort of frame what portion of the organic
revenue growth in '21 may be attributable to that. Or is it really more for building that in '22 and continue
with potentially the organic growth rate improving in '22 as a result of [indiscernible]?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean a little bit of both. So part of the -- we had a very strong sales quarter in the fourth quarter.
But most of those won't be implemented, Brian, until the end of -- towards the end of the year, so they're
going to have de minimis impact on the revenues for this year, but they'll go into next year.

Some of those are because of the -- of what we've done around data and analytics, the Data Vault. And
the ones with Janus Henderson. They're an early adopter. And so that will take some time to implement.
And then we think we're gaining some additional traction. When we look at some of the applications,
we've had many, many, many demonstrations and many users on a trial basis, for example, on our ESG
app. So that's starting to build some momentum. The trial management program that we're investing in,
we don't expect -- we expect to start seeing some of the benefits of that toward the end of the year. So
there's a little benefit in the organic growth rate this year. And we would expect that to accelerate a bit
next year.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

A follow-up -- a question on one positive trend, one maybe negative trend. But on the negative trend, you
said you had elevated transaction volumes encouraging and they should moderate. Have they moderated
already? And what kind of see-through do you have to the kind of market situation if those transaction
volumes are moderating?

And on the positive side, you said Asset Servicing, you had the best sales in 10 quarters in the fourth
quarter and that should help in about a year. How are you able to close these deals in the pandemic
environment? I mean are you closing deals over Zoom? Are these existing relationships? Because I keep
hearing like getting new relationships is tough, so just wanted some color behind both of those trends.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. No, we -- one of the big transactions that we're closing was entirely virtual. And that was with a very
large -- and a lot of these have been entirely virtual. And we've built a very good relationship with that
particular organization's large European asset manager. In fact, right before the pandemic or right at the
time, I was going to travel to see them. And unfortunately, I was unable to do it.

So there have been, from soup to nuts, things slowed down for a while. But it's getting a little more
normalized on the institutional front. I'd say on the wealth front with individuals, that's a little bit more
challenging, Mike. But on the institutional front, it's certainly not ideal, but we've had many instances of
where we've been able to handle that.

In terms of your question around Pershing, I mean, we're only a couple of weeks into the new year, and
volumes generally have stayed pretty strong relative to the fourth quarter. I just think that's a little bit too
early to call. Our estimate is that they would normalize a bit. Maybe they won't. Maybe we'll stay up here.
But that's our best guess at this point.

You had a third question in there, and I don't recall what it was, Mike, but I'll try to take it.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a read-through of capital markets when you think things settle down. But it sounds like they haven't
settled down yet based on what you're seeing with Pershing.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. I think that's right. I think you're seeing more retail activity than you've historically seen.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. Just a follow-up around the organic growth target that you guys put out there at 1.5%. Can you
talk a little bit about what you're assuming for pricing dynamics within that across sort of your various
businesses?

Obviously, it sounds like Q4 maybe was a little bit of an anomaly of several large accounts just kind of
happened to reprice at the same time. But maybe give us a sense kind of what like that unit repricing
looks like? Is it 1%, 2%, kind of what that is? And how do you incorporate that into your guidance?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. Emily, why don't you take that? You want to take it?

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 20, 2021

Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. I'll start and please add. So I mean, repricing pressure is just the norm in our businesses. So it's
always a headwind, but a very modest headwind. And we are -- we routinely and always actually offset
that -- more than offset that with greater efficiency and net new business. So we don't -- look, there has
been some lumpy repricing, but we don't see any underlying structural change or trend. So from that
perspective, it's not hugely material.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

And part of our pricing schedules, too, are graduated. So as the value of the assets increase, the pricing
does reflect that volume. So -- but this is specific to repricing existing clients as they benefit from some of
the operating efficiencies and the growth in their own business. And typically, it's fairly -- it's been fairly
stable for a number of years, the downdraft on that. It was just a little lumpy this year. We don't -- we see
it going back to normal, but that lumpiness will have a little bit of an impact on 2021.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Understood. And then just a clarification around NIR. It sounds like you guys are assuming MBS
prepayments will remain at current levels for '21. Can you just remind us what premium amortization
was in the fourth quarter? And any sort of sensitivity you guys can provide around that with respect to
prepayment speeds?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Off the top of my head -- you have it, yes?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

I'm afraid I'm going to misquote, but I think -- you know what? Let's follow up with HR -- with IR, sorry.

We'll take our next question from Rajiv Bhatia from Morningstar.

Rajiv K. Bhatia
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Just a quick question on the Pershing LOB. Within Pershing, how does your revenue growth compare
in independent broker-dealer clearing channel versus RIA custody? And how big of a headwind is
consolidation within the independent broker-dealer space by self-clearing firms like LPL?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. And so we are growing faster in the registered advisory firms and -- than the broker-dealer side of
the business, but the broker-dealer side of the business is still meaningful, and it's a large component of
it. And so as we look into next year, some of the consolidations or the [ self-tuning ] decisions have offset
the very strong growth that we've seen so that's going to be a little bit of a drag for Pershing for this year.
It's basically offsetting. But the pipeline continues to be very strong, especially in the advisory space.

Got it.

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. Todd, just going back, if Alex is still on the call, just -- I didn't have it at my fingertips. MBS
prepayment speeds or MBS prepayments were about a headwind of $173 million in the quarter. And yes,
you are correct. We just are expecting despite a steepening yield curve at the moment for that to remain
stable.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Rajiv, do you have a follow-up question?

Rajiv K. Bhatia
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

No.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Just Todd, I just wanted to circle back on the front-to-back mandate that you won. It sounds like
the largest of the ones that you been servicing. But just wanted to get a flavor of how many others that
you're doing, given that you are integrated with virtually all of the OMS providers. Or is that a sizeable
type of mandate for you if we consider other contract wins? And maybe [indiscernible] with them, too.
Yes.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes, I -- okay. Sure. So I mean, they -- we've integrated now with 6 OMS platforms, partnerships with
Bloomberg, Aladdin and so forth. And through that, we're offering custody insights, information around
liquidity, and it's kind of unique capability that we're able to do transactions, holdings and so forth. And
I think what it does is it very much enriches the experience of the doing business with us, so I think it's
helped us to retain relationships. I think it's helped us to grow a couple of relationships that I've just
indicated. So we are starting to get some traction with it.

Moving on to the data business, which we've been in for some time, but now we've cloud-enabled it and
made a much richer capability. We've had a number of large beta clients that have been operating it, and
we're now starting to convert some of them. So I think, like, it's not just what they can do with us, but for
the first time now, we're starting to see some meaningful wins that I would attribute, maybe not entirely
to it, but certainly, that was a helpful driver.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just real quick on Pershing. Consolidation in that -- in the RIA space fee,
can you actually benefit from that? Or is that mostly a -- do you see most of the providers going to a self-
clearing option?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. I mean as we look back historically, more often, we are winners to it, but there are -- there can be
just bad luck. And so either the acquirer was self-clearing or had some other approach and so -- or some
other provider. So typically, we found that we have won. More recently, we had a couple of losses.

Operator

We will take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Great. I was wondering if you could just kind of walk through again the tier 1 leverage comments that you
made. You had said that this quarter where it was at 6.3%. I think you gave that your target was at 5.5%
to 6%, but then you said you thought you were well above where you needed to be. It seems like you're
just above kind of what your targets are. So how does that impact your aspirations for capital return?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. So Tier 1 leverage is 6.3%. I think we've been pretty clear that we're comfortable running more at a
rate between 5.5% to 6%. So that does imply that we have significant excess capital. And you can assume
that we're going to look to return that to shareholders over the course of the year if we're permitted to do
so.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Brian, the other I would add to that, Brian, is that we have excess deposits right now. And so since we're
not able to do anything with our capital, we did -- we're not really pushing them away or managing them
as carefully as we could. Once we get back into a normal capital management cycle, deposits that aren't
worth anything, we're not going to keep them here.

Brian Matthew Kleinhanzl
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And so then when you talk about the deposits, how does that play into the money market fee waivers? Are
you anticipating pushing those off into the money market funds, which has been the driver of the fees? Or
if that were to happen, that could be an incremental negative to the fee waiver guidance?

Emily Hope Portney
Senior EVP & CFO

Sure. I can take that. So I mean the fee waiver guidance and the increase in that is really tied to what
we're seeing in the short end and T-bill rates and repo rates have actually come down since we originally
projected. And that's really what the $175 million now that I mentioned. You are correct, with a lot of
excess reserves that, if that all ends up in money markets, that could ultimately put more pressure. So
that is a potential risk.

The one thing also, just while we're on waivers, that I just would highlight is that Pershing did hit its full
run rate in terms of waivers in the fourth quarter. So you will start to see those waivers increase in other
lines of business. So Asset Servicing, Issuer Services, IM, Treasury Services, for example.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

So Brian, if money market mutual funds increased as the balance has increased, we would certainly waive
more fees. But net-net, we'd have more fees. And so it's just that we would -- it's 100% of the component
that we get. So they've basically been relatively stable. So when we do these comparisons, the volumes
have been relatively flat. So that hasn't created any noise. So if money has moved into money market
funds, there probably will be much less fees than they typically would have been, but there will probably
still be some fees.

And with that, that does that...
