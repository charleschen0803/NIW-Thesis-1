MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Masco's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name
is Beverlin, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being
recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may
begin.

David Chaika
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Beverlin, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2020 Second Quarter
Conference Call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs,
Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Our second quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available
on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst
questions. [Operator Instructions] If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at (313)
792-5500.

Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-
looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks
and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial
metrics. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise
noted. We reconcile these adjusted metrics to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which
are available on our website under Investor Relations.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your
families and loved ones are healthy and safe. This is certainly a difficult time for all of us. Despite
the numerous challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am proud that the Masco team has
demonstrated support for one another, support for our customers and support for the thousands of
communities we serve. Our team has risen to the challenge, and I'm grateful for their dedication.

Similar to the responsiveness that Masco has shown throughout the pandemic, we are not standing
on the sidelines in the fight against racial injustice and inequality. We are concerned about systemic
racism, passionate about creating lasting change and committed to doing our part. Over the last 5 years,
our enterprise-wide diversity and inclusion strategy has included actions within our company and our
communities. We fully recognize that we have more work to do, but we've laid a solid foundation that will
enable us to accelerate progress in the future. At Masco, we are committed to creating an environment
where all employees are included, all employees are treated with dignity and respect and all employees
have an opportunity, an equal opportunity, to thrive.

Now turning to our quarterly results. Please refer to Slide 4. We executed extremely well in the second
quarter, and demand for our products improved as restrictions on production eased and our distribution
channels reopened. This strong demand resulted in a record sales quarter for our paint business and along
with our focus on cost control, resulted in better-than-expected decremental margins in our plumbing
segment and strong incremental margins in our decorative segment. Combined, sales for the quarter
decreased 3%, excluding the impact of currency, significantly outperforming our expectations.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Operating decreased just $5 million, while operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 19.5%. Net
income from continuing operations increased 3%, and earnings per share grew 14% to $0.84 per share,
highlighting the strength of our capital allocation and portfolio moves.

Turning to our segments. Excluding currency, plumbing sales declined 13%. Sales varied widely across
our businesses in plumbing, mainly driven by the extent of production facility and distribution closures.
Our spa business experienced the largest sales decline in the segment due to facility closures. However,
production resumed quicker than expected during the quarter, and we were able to achieve a sales decline
of less than half of what we originally forecasted in this business. We continue to see record levels of
demand and backlog for our spas, which speaks to our industry-leading brands and to the desire of
consumers to enhance their at-home living experience.

Our international plumbing business saw significant improvement throughout the quarter. Germany,
our largest market, saw positive sales growth in June, while other European countries, such as the U.K.
and Italy, have been slower to reopen. Our North American plumbing business also saw a significant
improvement throughout the quarter with Delta achieving a record sales month in June, with strong
strength in its trade, retail and e-commerce channels of distribution. Our stronger-than-anticipated sales
performance in plumbing, together with our disciplined cost control, resulted in decremental margins of
28%, significantly better than expected.

In our Decorative Architectural segment, extremely strong paint volume drove both comp and bottom line
performance. DIY sales were up high teens for the quarter and even stronger in May and June. Our pro
paint sales declined low double digits for the quarter, but we did see notable improvement in June. With
our leading Behr brand, we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the strength of the DIY market,
and we remain committed to invest, along with our partner the Home Depot, in the large pro opportunity.

As we discussed last quarter, we are in dynamic and uncertain times and accurately predicting the
depth and duration of the impact of this pandemic is difficult at best. While we have withdrawn our full
year guidance, here's how we are currently thinking about our expected third quarter performance. We
anticipate third quarter, excluding currency, to be in the range of flat to up 10%, with plumbing sales in
the range of down 5% to up 5% and Decorative Architectural sales growth to be in the range of 17 --
excuse me, 7% to 17%.

Third quarter operating margins for both the company and each of our segments are expected to be
similar to last year. Importantly, this outlook assumes no further shutdowns of facilities or points of
distribution, which is obviously a concern as COVID cases spike in many parts of the country. While the
third quarter appears to be robust based on the demand we are seeing and the backlog for our products,
we have concerns that demand could lessen in the fourth quarter if government stimulus reduces and if
the economic impact of the pandemic worsens.

Additionally, while we are focused on short-term cost control during this pandemic, we remain committed
to driving long-term growth, and we will continue to invest in brand, innovation and service to ensure we
win in the recovery.

Lastly, I'd like to update you on our current thoughts on capital allocation. We have suspended our share
repurchase activity indefinitely due to the uncertainty of the current environment. I'll remind you that we
repurchased approximately $600 million of our shares prior to suspending our activity at an average price
of $39.30 per share. There is no change to our thoughts on M&A. We remain active in the M&A market and
have the balance sheet and liquidity to execute transactions during these uncertain times.

Lastly, expressing confidence in our future prospects and the strength of our balance sheet, our Board
announced its intention to raise our annual dividend by 4% to $0.56 per share beginning in the fourth
quarter. This marks our seventh consecutive year of an annual dividend increase.

With that, I'll now turn it over to John for additional detail on our second quarter results. John?

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus
on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items. Turning
to Slide 6. Sales decreased 4% and 3% excluding currency. Foreign currency translation unfavorably
impacted our second quarter revenue by approximately $13 million. In local currency, North American
sales in the second quarter matched prior year. This performance was mainly due to lower volumes in
our plumbing business, which were offset by strong volume growth in our DIY paint business. In local
currency, international sales decreased 17% in the quarter driven by lower volumes.

Gross margins was 35.8%, down 90 basis points. Our SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 140 basis
points to 16.3% as a result of our focused cost containment in the quarter. We do, however, expect a
portion of these costs to come back and impact the remainder of the year as demand improves. These
costs are related to investments in advertising to further strengthen our brands, displays to support new
program wins and additional funding to advance our e-commerce initiatives and the continued rapid
growth of this channel.

Operating income was $344 million in the quarter, down $5 million from last year, with operating margins
expanding 50 basis points to 19.5% despite lower volumes. Our EPS was $0.84 in the quarter, an increase
of 14% compared to the second quarter of 2019. While we do not normally provide monthly sales trends,
in this environment, we thought it would be helpful for you to understand the improvement we saw
throughout the quarter. April was the low point, with sales down 22% due to numerous restrictions,
improving to down only 3% in May. And turning to growth of 14% in June as restrictions were eased and
some of the pent-up demand was fulfilled. We anticipate continued solid demand in the third quarter
with sales expectations, excluding currency, of approximately flat to 10% growth as this pent-up demand
continues to get fulfilled with operating margins similar to Q3 of 2019.

Many uncertainties remain that can impact these results, such as the effect of government stimulus
programs and the impact of the virus on the overall health of the economy and consumer. Additionally, it is
important to note that our expectations for Q3 assumes no further closures of our manufacturing plants or
points of distribution related to COVID-19.

Turning to Slide 7. Plumbing decreased 13%, excluding the impact of currency but improved sequentially
during the quarter, with June sales up high single digits, resulting in better-than-expected segment
performance. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted this segment sales by approximately
$10 million in the quarter. North American sales decreased 11% in local currency as solid growth in our
retail and e-commerce channels was more than offset by declines in our wholesale and specialty dealer
channels.

The trade channel was more impacted by the closure of wholesale locations and plumbing showrooms.
However, we saw a significant improvement and positive sales growth in the trade channel in the month of
June. While Delta's sales in the quarter were down low single digits, it recovered exceptionally well from a
significant decline in April to a record sales month in June.

North American sales in the quarter were also unfavorably impacted by approximately 7% as a result of
facility closures at our spa business in California and Mexico due to government orders. Spa manufacturing
did ramp up in May and June as restrictions were eased. However, Watkins continues to operate at less
than 100% capacity due to ongoing employee limitations and labor constraints in our facilities, which we
expect to continue throughout out the third quarter.

International plumbing sales decreased 17% in local currency. Hansgrohe experienced a low single-digit
decline in the quarter in its home market of Germany, however, sales improved in June with mid- single-
digit growth. Hansgrohe saw larger declines in the quarter in other European markets, including the U.K.,
France, Spain and Italy, due to a slower easing of restrictions in those countries. Sales in China also
declined low single digits for the quarter, a significant improvement from the approximately 20% decline
experienced in the first quarter.

Operating profit in the quarter was $159 million, and margins were 18.3%. Our decremental margin of
28% was better-than-expected due to improved volumes and solid execution on cost containment. In

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

terms of monthly sales trends, plumbing sales were down in April 33%, improved to down 17% in May
and rebounded to 8% growth in June.

Turning to the third quarter. We expect sales, excluding currency, to be in the range of down 5% to up 5%
as we currently see good demand for our products in North America, while international demand remains
slower to recover. We anticipate margins will be similar to prior year margins of 18.7%.

Turning to Slide 8. Decorative Architectural grew 8% for the quarter. This strong performance was driven
by low double-digit growth for our paint business, with high-teens growth in DIY paint, partially offset
by low double-digit decline in propane, resulting in a record sales quarter for Behr. Our outstanding DIY
paint results benefited from the continued resurgence in DIY painting. While it is still too early to call this
a trend, we remain well positioned with Behr's compelling quality and value proposition to capitalize on
shifts in consumer behavior. While propane demand declined in the second quarter, we saw sequential
improvement within the quarter with June sales down only low single digits.

Our builders' hardware business also experienced growth in the quarter, driven by solid performance
in their retail and e-commerce channels. Growth was partially offset by lower sales in our lighting
business. As we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, lighting sales were impacted by the loss
of a portion of our private label program and inventory rebalancing at a customer, but results were
better than anticipated. Sales were also negatively impacted by the closure of lighting showrooms due
to state shelter-in-place orders. Lighting sales improved sequentially in the quarter with year-over-
year sales growth in June. Operating profit increased in the quarter by 17%, driven by incremental
volume and focused cost containment, such as reduced marketing and advertising spending. In terms of
monthly sales, decorative sales were down approximately 9% in April but were up 13% in May and up an
outstanding 23% in June.

Turning to the third quarter. We expect the strong demand for paint to continue and anticipate segment
sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 17% and margins to approximate prior year margins of 18.9%.
We also anticipate higher investment in the third quarter in advertising and marketing in this segment
and additional display expense in our builders' hardware business related to a program win at a retail
customer.

Turning to Slide 9. Our balance sheet remains very strong with net debt to EBITDA at 1.3x as we ended
the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of
our $1 billion revolver. Note that our quarter end cash balance includes a $200 million benefit due to the
deferral of taxes owed on the sale of our Cabinetry business. This tax was paid on July 15. Working capital
as a percent of sales improved 50 basis points versus prior year to 18.1% due to lower inventory levels
and an improvement in accounts payable.

Lastly, during the second quarter, we received 2.3 million shares at no additional cost to complete our
$350 million accelerated share repurchase agreement at an average share price of $36.63. As Keith
mentioned, our share buyback activity remains suspended, therefore, we continue to estimate our 2020
average diluted share count will be approximately 266 million shares.

And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Keith.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, John. The COVID-19 pandemic may have lasting structural effects on the economy, consumer
behavior and homeownership, all of which we will continue to assess. There could be increased interest in
single-family housing with more space in the house and more distance from neighbors. Increased remote
working could lead to higher remodeling spending. Homeowners may take on more do-it-yourself projects,
especially easy-to-do projects, such as painting as opposed to having other people in their homes. And
record-low mortgage rates and lack of supply could lead to home price appreciation, which historically has
a strong correlation with our sales. All of these factors bode well for our lower ticket repair and remodel
products. The changes we have made to Masco over the past few years, our culture of execution and our

commitment to continue to invest in brand, innovation and service to support our customers, positions us
well to drive long-term growth and value creation.
With that, I'll now open up the call for questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley of Barclays Capital.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I guess I wanted to start perhaps on the sales guidance for Q3. It's a relatively wide range, and thanks for
all the details around the monthly cadence, but I'd be curious if you could give some color on sort of the
starting point for the quarter and how July trended in both segments? And kind of what's keeping you a
little more conservative on providing such a large range there?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Matthew, July was strong for us, and we are starting off the quarter confidently. However, when we think
about the large range, I think it's clear that there is volatility and variability as we look forward in terms of
what can happen with the consumer. And that's fundamentally what's drive -- what's driven our thinking
as it relates to the range on possible top line.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And secondly, just on DIY paint specifically. Obviously, very strong results and seems
like it's going to continue strong through the summer months at least. And I hear you on making some
investments there into Q3. But what are you doing or what's kind of the intent around share through this?
Is there an ability to kind of maintain or even -- or really grow your market share while this underlying
demand is the strong or does it make more sense to kind of limit the promotional investment and sort of
ride the underlying wave there?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

No question, there's an opportunity to gain share, and we're doing just that. A significant change as we
look at the performance from a demand perspective, DIY related to pro, and when you overlay that with
our strong position with the leading DIY brand, we most definitely are gaining share here. And that's
our intent to continue to do that. We -- as we've talked about consistently, Matthew, our focus has been
on 3 things: Number one is the safety of our employees, full stop. That's our focus; number two is to
make sure we're ensuring business continuity and keeping a close eye on our liquidity, and we have
very strong liquidity as a result of the strong cash flow of our portfolio. So that's strong; and number
three, consistently, we've talked about winning in the recovery. And part of that winning in the recovery is
making sure that we're investing appropriately in brand and innovation. John talked a little bit about some
new displays, particularly in this Decorative Architectural segment that we'll also be spending in. So it's a
judgment call and it's a feel, if you will. But we are committed to ensuring that we spend appropriately to
win in the recovery, and that's how we're thinking about it.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim of Evercore.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Good quarter. I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you're seeing in the U.S. with respect to
inventory levels and restocking. Wondering if it's happening yet, how long could it last? And I'm imagining
that would probably be more impactful in maybe your wholesale specialty dealer channel. Just want to
confirm, was that like down as much as high teens in second quarter?

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I'm sorry, Steve, but I didn't hear that last portion of your question.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I'm sorry, the wholesale and specialty dealer channel was -- in plumbing, was that down as much as high
teens in 2Q?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. Stephen, it's John. No, I would say, no, actually -- a couple of points I'd like to make. Sell-through
has been very good. It is probably better than sell-in across our channels. And we've seen -- once we saw
the trade channel start to reopen, we saw very good sales trends there. And so no, our sales were not
down. The themes that you described, it was less than that.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

In terms of inventory, Stephen, it really varies a lot business to business. As you know, we had some
shutdowns in Q1 driven by government orders that certainly put a dent in our inventory levels as
consumers continue to buy our products and paint, for example, we're seeing an unprecedented amount
of demand, particularly demand for the 1 gallon DIY-friendly containers. So there were some inventory
fluctuations, both from a business-to-business perspective as well as within our businesses. But our
facilities are ramping production back up, we're catching up on that backlog, and we believe we're in a
good position to serve our customers as we go in here through the summer months.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Great. Just to clarify, so are you saying that you feel like in 3Q, you can pretty much catch up on
whatever destocking occurred? Or do you think that this is something that we're going to be talking about
through 4Q or even further?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

No, I think we're going to catch up.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo of Bank of America.

John Lovallo
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

First one, maybe I'll just try Matt's question one more time. June sales trend is obviously very strong, plus
14%. I mean would you say July was comparable to that at least on a year-over-year basis?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, John, I think it was -- yes, I think it's very similar, yes.

John Lovallo
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just turning to SG&A, the $39 million or so pulled out on a year-
over-year basis is just very significant. And I know you guys talked about some investment in displays and

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

e-commerce and so forth. How should we think about absolute dollars of SG&A on a year-over-year basis
in 3Q and 4Q? I mean will they actually be down on a year-over-year basis? Or do you think those trend
upwards again?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

I don't think they'll be down year-over-year -- I'm sorry, they'll be -- I'm sorry, I think SG&A year-over-
year, John, will add some additional investment that we're going to make in the things that we described,
like advertising, some head count coming back in. As you might expect, we really pulled back on head
count. We had a hiring freeze, we had wage freezes across the enterprise as we came in the second
quarter. And as demand has come back, we're starting to look at putting some of those things back
into the system. One of the things that goes through SG&A, as Keith mentioned and I mentioned in my
prepared remarks that some of the displays that will be going into to support Liberty and the program
win that they had at retail. So I think we'll have some additional investments, some advertising that we
pulled back on pretty significantly will come back in the third quarter. So I think overall, I think we'll be in
good shape. I can tell you, we are monitoring this very, very closely. And to the extent that we see any
changes, we'll be very quick to react on our SG&A spend.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on all the hard work. Is it just, again, kind of zero in on 3Q a little bit. And number one,
appreciate the additional color around July. If you're talking about the high-end of the 3Q range being
a few points below June and maybe July, are you seeing anything in your order book or anything from
-- in terms of like a forward look into the last 2 months that puts you maybe 10 points at a midpoint
below what you're seeing in July? And then I guess also on the operating margin side, when you look at
operating margins being similar to a year ago but down a bit sequentially, how much of that is maybe
coming back of some of those temporary cost measures, holding back on some advertising and some
other types of spend, how much of that is a function of some of those costs coming back rather than
perhaps just seasonality?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Well, certainly, seasonality is a part of that. If you look, Mike, at paint, Q2 is our heftiest quarter and then
it backs off a little bit in Q3. So there's an element of seasonality when you look at volume, particularly in
paint. The biggest driver would be costs that we are planning to put back into this business when we look
at Q3. And I think -- we had a keen focus on business continuity, as I mentioned, in liquidity, and we did
not know what this pandemic was going to deal with us in terms of overall demand.

So we were cautious, and we -- I think it's favorable that we were able to demonstrate that we do
have the levers to be able to control our spend because this is an unpredictable environment. So we're
balancing that spend control with investment to win in the recovery. And we feel where we sit today that
it's appropriate for us to start to layer that investment back in. We've talked about program wins and
the displays costs that we need to put in to support that program. That's a good thing. We're going to
continue to drive advertising, promotions, those sorts of things in terms of continuing to build our brand
and continuing to take share in this recovery. We also admittedly have some increased cost as we look into
the third quarter as it relates to hiring costs, over time, there will be a little bit of premium freight as we're
continuing to smooth out our supply chain. So when you roll all those in and you look at that variability,
that's why we're making the call for Q3 margins to be similar to last year.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

And then just on the sales question, again, I appreciate it.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

On the order book, what are we seeing...

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We have a real solid order book, and we have -- as John mentioned, the sell-through has been very
strong, stronger than the sell-in, so we have some ability for us to continue to put some inventory back
into the channel, and our order book is strong.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener of KeyBanc.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

What a quarter. Focused on plumbing, 2 parts. First, what is the plumbing SKU mix you're seeing? So kind
of rough versus fittings, focused on the U.S. and then kind of the thoughts about if retail is picking up a lot
of traffic from the trade. So I mean Stanley talked about record retail. So it's -- are we just seeing people
going to retail and it wasn't so bad in the trade? And then also just between the rough trends in the U.S.
and fittings is the first question.

CEO, President & Director

I think, generally speaking, the rough tends to have a little bit more new construction component to it
than finish as you can certainly do a remodel or a repair and remodel job with a faucet, et cetera, versus
going under the deck and working with stops or working with rough plumbing. So there was a little bit of a
tougher impact on rough as it relates to the temporary shift we saw earlier in the quarter away from new
construction.

Now we're starting to see that build in the last month of June in the quarter as it relates to rough. But to
answer your question, I would say that finish fared a little bit better than rough for that demand mix. In
terms of retail versus wholesale, I think a pretty consistent story to what us and others have been saying,
when you have points of sale and points of distribution closed, i.e., plumbing showrooms, that volume
goes down. So there was a shift to retail, a shift to e-commerce that we've -- we saw in the first, call it, 2
months of the quarter. And then in June, we're seeing that start to come back, and we're seeing actually
some very nice traction in showrooms as people are starting to interface with that channel more as they're
reopened.

Kenneth Robinson Zener

And is there a big difference in the consumer behavior in plumbing specifically in the U.S. versus Europe?
If you could kind of contrast that if it might offer some insight?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I don't know that I'd say so much that it is consumer behavior so much. We really haven't seen that.
And the best way to tell that really is to look at channels of -- and traffic and channels and look at mix.
Really, what we're seeing, I would say, broadly speaking, is that Europe has been slower to recover than
a recovery here in the United States. And that may say something about our infection rates here in the
United States versus Europe, frankly. But it's been a little slower in Europe. You look at the U.K., just
thinking here, Spain, Italy, I would say those countries' approach to reopening has been significantly less

aggressive than the United States. And that's where I would say there's a difference more so than, say,
consumer behavior.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's quite a quarter against such a fluid backdrop. First question I had just on dec arc and paint
specifically. You kind of commented that propane got back to down low single digits in June. If we think
about that business being, I think, roughly 20% of the total coating segment, it sounds like that was
maybe like a 2-point drag in the quarter based on the overall trends. So when you're looking at the guide
for 3Q, up 7% to 17%, any thoughts on just like how to frame what pro paint expectations are and how
much that could either contribute or continue to drag on the segment results?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. Mike, so first of all, the pro business is about 25% of our paint sales. And as we look forward to
Q3, we expect it to be just modest growth from here on. I mean we don't expect significant -- slight
improvement from where we're at today, but not a significant improvement is what we're counting on in
the third quarter.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then the second question, just back on margins. I appreciate the -- certainly, the
investment and some of the cost returning. At the same time, if at the midpoint, we're back in a growth
environment and you'd normally lever on that, and at least in plumbing, not sure about on dec arc, but in
plumbing, you may also have some cost tailwinds from raw mats potentially. Is the reason for flat margins
then overall just -- is it timing of when these investments come through on a year-on-year basis? Or is it
-- I guess trying to think about how to frame whether the investments are significantly larger in general
or whether it's truly just kind of catch-up from deferred 2Q into 3Q, so a little more stacked year-on-year
than you'd normally be?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. Mike, I'd say it's more of the latter part. It's more just kind of a catch-up from some of the Q2 spend
that we did not incur. And across both segments, it's pretty much the same story that we're putting the --
other displays for the builders' hardware business, a lot of the investment that we're putting back into the
business, as Keith mentioned a couple of minutes ago, it's similar, right? We're reinvesting in some of the
head count because we're slowly loosening the head count freeze that we had -- the hiring freeze that we
had on. We are starting to reinvest in the brands appropriately. We're not trying to get too far out there,
but we think appropriate investment in the brands makes sense at this point to continue to support our
brands and the brands with our retail partners.

In terms of price cost, I'd say as you think about the commodity basket that we're seeing, Mike, now, I'll
break that apart, I guess, into the 2 segments. Zinc has been relatively flat, maybe up a touch. Copper
has risen in the last month or so. And so today, it's above where it was a year ago. So that could be
potentially a little bit of a headwind in the future. Recall that it takes about 2 quarters for raw material
deflation to flow through and hit our P&L. So maybe a little bit of the tailwind that we'll enjoy on the
commodity side will help offset some of the tariff impact and we'll continue to feel as we go into the
second half of the year on the plumbing side of the business.

Then if you turn into the -- and look at the raw material basket on the Decorative Architectural side, our
TiO2 has been relatively stable through the year, and we expect it to be -- continue to be stable through
really the balance of the year. The one area that we have seen a little bit of easing is on resins. And we

do -- we are seeing a little bit of potential for that to -- maybe Q2 to be the bottom of that and to see
a little bit of inflation as we go into the last half of the year. So there's the potential for some price cost
headwinds in the second half of the year on the Decorative Architectural side.

Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is a bit higher level. It feels like from your commentary that what we've been seeing
over the last couple of months is that some of the mix shift that we historically see in recessionary periods
really has not come together to the same extent. Do you think that that's accurate? And I guess how are
you thinking about mix shift going forward and the sustainability of some of the trends that we've seen?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I think, Susan, that is an accurate statement in terms of the mix shift that maybe you would say is typical
of, let's say, a recession that we haven't seen. And there's several different theories on why that is,
perhaps, is more affluent customers that would buy the higher level mix haven't really been affected in
terms of unemployment or haven't been affected by the pandemic so far. So that's an aspect of it. But we
are seeing good high-quality mix at that high level, and we're seeing it across our segments. We talked
about record backlog in our spa business, and that's a high-dollar discretionary purchase. And we have a
very solid demand. So I think that's a fair statement.

In terms of where we think mix will go as we look through the rest of the year, we really don't think it's
going to be much of a factor. We had a little, call it, channel mix early on in the quarter as retail was
stronger than trade. And we have a little bit of a mix headwind in Europe as that economy has yet to
really pull back through, but we anticipate that when we look at the full year impact, that really isn't going
to be that material as it relates to mix.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And Keith, in your comments, you talked about capital allocation, and it sounds like
the M&A pipeline has perhaps ticked up a little bit for you. Can you just give us a little more color on what
you're seeing there? And how you're thinking about perhaps M&A relative to shareholder returns and that
kind of breakdown?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

The pipeline has really been about the same. We to continue to work and to drive it. We have interesting
targets. I think probably in this type of an environment, there's less of a willingness to sell, clearly. But
we're still talking to people. So I wouldn't expect much activity or much difference in terms of how we
think about M&A and shareholder return and how that fits into our capital allocation. As I talked about,
really no change. Our capital allocation strategy is to fund the good idea of our businesses and to support
our core business, first and foremost, and we're going to maintain a respectable and healthy dividend and
continue to grow that dividend. And then as it relates to share buybacks and M&A or acquisitions, we're
going to be patient and I think we've demonstrated that. And we will take advantage of episodic times to
buy our stock a little bit more heavily as we have in the past. And we'll also be patient and make sure that
our M&A targets are shareholder value-creating and that they're, by and large, we're looking at bolt-on to
our existing segments. And that hasn't changed.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

What's the right way to think about either incrementals or decrementals in either plumbing or decorative
if sales come in at the -- either book end of your guidance. Are there -- I know you talked about some
temporary costs, but would those scale with revenue growth if you come in, in decorative, for example, at
the higher end of the 7% to 17% range? Or should the fixed cost base stay fairly consistent?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. Seldon, I would tell you that our incrementals really haven't changed much. Overall, from a company
perspective, we're in that 30% to 35% range. The plumbing segment should be in approximately that
same range, 30% to 35%. The Decorative Architectural segment will be a little bit less than that, close
to the 25% to 30% range. So that should reflect some good leverage of our fixed cost, but really no
significant change from what we've experienced historically.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just a couple of quick ones on the spa business. First is just how much
seasonality is there in that business? And you talked about seeing a significant amount of pent-up
demand. But did you lose any market share in the second quarter? Or are all the major manufacturers
constrained from a production standpoint?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

When you look at the industry, everybody is constrained at this point, so you're right on that assertion
for sure. There's no question about it. In terms of seasonality, typically, this is a very seasonal business.
However, with our strong order book and our backlog, we anticipate that seasonality through the summer/
fall and into the winter, frankly, to not be there this year. We've got a tremendous backlog, and we're
looking forward to filling it.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. Quite honestly, Seldon, this is clearly not a demand issue. This is a supply issue. I mean this was --
we were not permitted to manufacture. And so to Keith's point, we're seeing really good strength in this
business.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten of Crédit Suisse.

Adam Michael Baumgarten

Just in paint, curious if you saw any meaningful difference in sales growth between exterior and interior
and maybe how that trended throughout the quarter?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. Given the nature of the season, generally in the second quarter, we saw stronger sales in
exterior paint than we did in the interior paint during the second quarter, Adam, and probably a little bit
stronger than we would normally see versus historical second quarters. But I take it, that's the nature of
the current environment in the pandemic.

sales growth for the pro paint business? And also, will Kichler and Liberty be up in that guidance that you
gave?

John G. Sznewajs

So Kichler and Liberty will continue their growth, so it will be modest overall in the segment because
they're relatively small pieces of the segment. And then we are expecting modest growth for the pro
business in the third quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Loop Capital.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Just want to follow up on the pro question. Do you think we're at a point, just given the trends that you're
seeing in July and expected in Q3, there were more [ higher ] levels for pro demand. I guess, conversely,
if not, do you think that over the next several quarters and years potentially that you're going to see a
secular shift in that category due to the resurgence of DIY interest?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Garik, I'm going to ask you to repeat the question. There's a little bit of interference on the call when you
were asking your question.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Sorry. No, just wondering if you're starting to see pro paint sales normalize into July and in the third
quarter. And then conversely, if not, do you worry that there could be a secular shift away from this
category due to the resurgence in DIY interest?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

The -- we are seeing throughout the quarter, we are seeing pro pick up a little bit. It was strong in exterior
as I think people obviously are more comfortable having people on the outside of their home than inside.
And we saw, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, a lift up in the quarter. In terms of -- if we're
concerned about the resurgence of -- or lack of resurgence of the pro, no, we're not. We have a solid plan
and track record for share gain in the pro, and we're going to continue to do that. But fundamentally, we
have the leading DIY brand, and DIY is our sweet spot for lack of a better word. And we're excited about
this, particularly when we look at some of our research, where we think a full, call it, 30% of the painters
that have painted in the pandemic were first-time painters. And if you peel that back, about half of those
first-timers were millennials.

Now this is a thesis that we have been talking about for some time as it relates to the millennials coming
into the market, forming households and that big cohort being able to be a tailwind for our DIY business.
And we do think that this will be a structural shift and we are poised and ready to take advantage of that.
So our -- having both an incredibly strong brand in DIY and a growing and solid business in pro, I think, is
a good spot to be.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. A follow-up question is, are there any incremental costs associated with transitioning to 1-gallon
paint production in a way maybe from 5 gallon? And how quickly -- or is there any sensitivity if you have
to toggle between the 2 quickly in production?

gallon fill rates as with 5. One of the things we will be doing is we will be investing in additional 1-gallon

can improve our efficiency and get back on track there.

Your next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson of Wells Fargo.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Nice results. First on Kichler, there are some moving parts there. Previously, you had to push price pretty
meaningfully to cover the increased tariff costs. It seems like demand is rebounding in that category in
June. But can you just discuss, has that continued into July? And are your margins starting to normalize in
that business? Are you actually able to recapture the tariff costs in this environment?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We are seeing continued improvement in the demand throughout the quarter and then into July here,
so that's a good sign. We continue, as we've talked about, to work to strengthen this business. And we've
worked on restructuring. We talked last quarter about closing a DC and some workforce rationalization.
So that's advancing well, and we're largely on track for our turnaround plan with this business and we're
continuing to drive it. So we feel good about the team down there and the progress that they've made.
We continue to advance our strategies, cost strategies, brand-building strategies, 80/20 and assortment
simplification so that we can invest in growth more, and it's on plan.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then just following up on a few other questions. DIY has been very robust past few
months, double-digit growth rates plus. I don't think anybody expects that to really continue forever. But
more recently, in July, have you seen any sort of deceleration or consumer fatigue or anything in the DIY
category?

John G. Sznewajs

No, Truman, not at this point, and July continue to be very strong.

Appreciating how the pandemic is impacting the U.S., your international business, it's having an impact on

of your U.S. versus international plumbing business? Any big delta out there?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I think we're equally positioned and well positioned on both sides of the Atlantic here. We've got the
strong franchise of Behr. We've got both oars in the water, if you will, as it relates to DIY and pro in an
effective way, where we've worked to have significantly improved our margins in pro. So we're very much

in tune to growing both sides of that business, leading brand in Delta in the United States that continues
to grow well, and as we said, had a record quarter in June.

So that momentum is -- continues to be strong. And then when we look over in Europe, we've got an
outstanding brand with Hansgrohe. And because of the nature of that brand, we're able to operate
really around the world quite profitably and still have a significant amount of white space and share gain
potential and opportunities. So I think we feel equally strong and feel good about our share gain and our
growth opportunities, both here in North America as well as abroad.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's really helpful. And then just given the strength you're seeing in plumbing and things kind of
firming up with Kichler in recent months, any concerns that we should be mindful of in terms of logistics
importing components from China due to the pandemic and does that pose a risk on just kind of meeting
that demand, whether it's on the plumbing and lighting side?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I'd tell you, I really have to hand it to our supply chain. And when I say supply chain, I mean the folks
that work in our factories, the folks that plan our inventory and our suppliers. We have really leaned
on that group. And manufacturing is not typically set up to go from 60 to 30 in a matter of a couple of
weeks and then jump from 30 to 90 in the following month. And our supply base and our factory and the
professionals that work there have done a phenomenal job and particularly from a supply chain standpoint
and a supply base at our big suppliers. They have been there to support us, and we're not going to forget
that. We're very thankful for the supply chain that we have. And we do not -- things can change. Clearly,
this is a dynamic environment, but we do not anticipate any significant or material issues as it relates to
our supply chain.

Just a quick question, high level, I guess, pontification. I mean given that Q2 has come back strongly and
the Q3 results are expected to be pretty solid, and you talked about the factor shaping up for single-family
R&R being very positive. There's still a lot of macro uncertainty, but it's still -- I would just like to get your
thoughts on bridging 2020 into your original, but now taking off 2021 guidance given at the Investor Day,
it seems achievable. But just curious if the factors are setting up now for 2021 to be a strong year?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I think so. We look at -- we're reviewing that original Investor Day targets, and we think it's very
possible that we could be in there. As I recall, plumbing at 18% to 18.5%, deco in that 17.5% to 18%,
Masco overall at 16.5% in terms of margin. Yes, I think that is doable. We have, without a doubt, seen
the benefit of our portfolio reconfiguration. Certainly, the pandemic played into that but when you look at
our resilience, the fact that low-ticket items and the DIY orientation are right in the sweet spot of where
the consumer wants to be at this point where they want to spend their money, I think that bodes well for
what 2021 could be for us. I will also say, Steven, that we're in a dynamic environment, and that we're
not -- we are not giving guidance for the full year here in '20 and we're certainly not going to give specific
guidance for '21. But as we look at small ticket, DIY, the overall health of the consumer and how we're
positioned against that, it feels pretty good.

markets as you see it? Or is there anything else that explains some of the disconnect in terms of the
differences in growth?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

I think it's -- as I mentioned a little bit on a prior answer, I think it's more country and nationally oriented
as it relates to closure and associated reopening cadence U.S. versus international than it is so much
consumer behavior. Our demand for spas, which interestingly enough, our spa business is one of the
most global we have in Masco as it relates to percent of volume from outside North America, and we have
strong demand in Europe as well.
