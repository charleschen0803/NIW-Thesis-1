JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Welcome to Johnson Controls' First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference
is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over
to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Ma'am, you may
begin.

Antonella Franzen
VP and Chief Investor Relations & Communications Officer

Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' First Quarter
Fiscal 2020 Results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the
conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at
johnsoncontrols.com.

With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Vice
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain
forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-
looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.

In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through
the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the
call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs
as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules
attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website.

Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis, excluding the results of Power
Solutions.

GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary
shareholders was $0.21 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.19 related to special items, which
Brian will address in his comments. Excluding these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per
share from continuing operations was $0.40 per share compared to $0.26 in the prior year quarter.

Now let me turn the call over to George.

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call.

Before we get into the details of the quarter, I would like to provide a few thoughts as we look ahead to
the rest of fiscal 2020.

Starting on Slide 3.

We continue to see good momentum across the majority of our key performance metrics, with Q1
providing a strong start to the year. We saw 70 basis points of margin expansion this quarter. This resulted
from a reduction in structural costs, improved project execution, accelerated service growth, expansion
in gross margin and driving innovation. All of these initiatives will remain key focal points for us as we go
forward. We've also made significant progress in improving our cash generation profile, with important
steps towards better management of our trade working capital and continued discipline around CapEx
spending. We still have more work to do to bring free cash conversion up to 100% on a sustainable basis,
but I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made to date.

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

As we will discuss on the next slide, orders were flat in the quarter. But I am confident, given the
continued strength we see in our pipeline, we will see acceleration in Q2. Our primary end markets,
commercial HVAC, building controls, Fire & Security remain healthy, and we are well positioned as leaders
in each market.

We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet over the course of the last 9 months, with ample
flexibility when it comes to future capital deployment opportunities.

Finally, as I've said many times in these calls over the last couple of years, we remain intently focused
on execution and building a strong performance culture to drive sustained performance and maximize
shareholder value.

Turning to some of the details for the quarter, starting with orders on Slide 4.

Orders for our Field businesses were flat in aggregate in Q1, as we faced tough prior year comparisons
given the timing of announced price increases. Last year, our announced price increases were effective in
January, which resulted in a pull forward into Q1 fiscal '19. This year, we accelerated our announced price
increases to be effective in October, which resulted in a pull forward into late fiscal '19.

Looking forward, our order pipeline remains robust, with an attractive mix of service and a balanced
profile of small and large projects.

We expect order growth in Q2 to be in the mid-single-digit range, and we remain very confident in our low
to mid-single-digit growth target for the full year.

Backlog ended the quarter at $9 billion, up 6% organically versus the prior year and up 2% on a quarter
sequential basis, which provides high visibility through 2020.

Turning now to Slide 5 for a quick recap of the financial results in the quarter.

Sales of $5.6 billion increased 3% on an organic basis. Within the Field businesses, total service revenues
grew 3% in the quarter, on top of mid-single-digit growth in the prior year. Our service business
represents over $6 billion in revenues or a little more than 40% of our Field revenue base and provides us
with a very profitable, resilient revenue stream. As growing and expanding our service offering has been
a key priority, we recently appointed a dedicated global service leader. Ganesh Ramaswamy joined the
team from Danaher and will drive improved consistency of fundamentals across our global direct channel,
leverage our infrastructure and investments and work closely with regional leaders to execute on our
strategic priorities.

With the strength and depth of our portfolio, we have a tremendous opportunity to strengthen our core
service business while building and deploying new service solutions, leveraging our digital capabilities.

Adjusted EBIT of $448 million grew 13% on an organic basis, driven by a solid 7% growth in segment
profit and a continued focus on reducing corporate expense. Overall, underlying EBIT margins expanded
80 basis points year-over-year, excluding a 10 basis point headwind from FX.

Adjusted EPS of $0.40 increased 54% over the prior year, with solid operational performance and a
significant contribution from the deployment of proceeds related to the Power Solutions sale.

Adjusted free cash was an outflow of under $100 million in the quarter, in line with our normal seasonal
pattern, but a significant improvement over the last 2 years.

With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in more detail.

Brian J. Stief
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone.

So let's get started with a look at our year-over-year EPS bridge on Slide 6.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

You can see that operational performance, including synergies and productivity save, contributed $0.06.
Deployment of the Power Solutions proceeds benefit both our year-over-year share count and net
financing charges, which added $0.06 and $0.03, respectively. Other net items in the first quarter were
roughly $0.01. This results in our first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.40, up 54% year-on-year.

So let's move to Slide 7 and look at our segment results on a consolidated basis.

Sales of $5.6 billion increased 3% organically, led by 4% growth in our Field businesses and 2% in global
products. Segment EBITDA of $625 million grew 7% organically, driven by volume leverage from the
field, strong price/cost realization in our products businesses, and continued productivity save and cost
synergies. Lastly, Q1 segment EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 11.2%.

If you look at the margin waterfall, underlying operational improvement contributed 50 basis points, and
this included a 10 basis point headwind related to our retail business in North America. This was partially
offset by 10 bps related to other items in the quarter.

Now let's take a look at each segment in more detail.

So starting on Slide 8, North America.

North America sales grew 3% organically, with balanced growth in both install and service activity. Growth
was led by Fire & Security, which grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by higher install activity. Our
applied HVAC & Controls businesses increased low single digits in the quarter, given the double-digit
growth in equipment last year. Performance Solutions declined low double digits this quarter, due primarily
to a tough prior year compare of over 30%.

As we expected, adjusted EBITDA increased 2% and EBITDA margin was in line with the prior year at
12%. Favorable volume leverage and benefits from synergy and productivity save were offset by a 30
basis point headwind related to our retail business. And as we mentioned on our Q4 call, we expected to
see continued margin headwind in retail, given the change in mix to increased project revenue.

Orders declined in the quarter, as George mentioned. This was primarily due to the timing of price
increases in our applied HVAC business, which did provide a 3 percentage point headwind. We expected
to start the year off a bit slower in North America, but we're confident that orders will accelerate to mid-
single-digit range in Q2 given current pipeline activity. Backlog in North America remained strong at $5.8
billion, up 7% year-over-year.

Turning to EMEA on Slide 9.

Sales grew 7% organically, with install up 10% and service up 5%. Growth was positive across all regions,
and across HVAC & Controls, Fire & Security and Industrial Refrigeration. Our HVAC & Controls business
grew high single digits, helped in part by easier prior year compare, but also benefiting from order
strength in the back half of 2019 for our shorter-cycle controls business. Growth was particularly strong in
Europe, which increased low double digits. And in the Middle East, which was a soft spot through fiscal '19,
we saw a mid-single-digit growth. Fire & Security grew mid-single digits, with solid growth across both
install and service activity, and in all regions, led by mid-teens growth in our subscriber business in Latin
America. Industrial Refrigeration, which is predominantly in Europe, remains a bright spot in the region
and was up high teens in the quarter, with solid growth in both install and service.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 21% and EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points to 9.7%. We continue to
benefit from favorable volume leverage as well as our continued efforts around reducing structural costs
and improving project execution in this business.

Our orders in EMEA increased 4%. This was led by continued strength in our controls platform, particularly
in Latin America. Orders in Europe were up slightly on a tough prior year compare, and backlog ended the
quarter at $1.7 billion, up 8% year-on-year.

So let's move to Slide 10 on APAC.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

6

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

APAC sales grew 3% organically, led by higher demand for project installations, which grew 5% in the
quarter. Fire & Security, which, as you know, represents about 30% of APAC sales, saw a continued
strength, up low single digits overall. HVAC & Controls, which represents the remaining 70% of APAC
sales, was relatively flat year-over-year.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, with margins up 60 basis points to 11.4%. Favorable volume leverage,
productivity and synergy save and improved execution were partially offset by a higher mix of install
versus service in the quarter.

Asia Pac orders were up 1% against a tough 9% prior year compare, consistent with the trend we've seen
over the last several quarters. Backlog in APAC increased 2% year-over-year to $1.6 billion.

I'd just point out that the environment in APAC remains competitive and the economic conditions in some
areas remain uncertain. We continue to experience macro-related headwinds in some of our key markets
in Asia, including the ongoing trade dispute and now the coronavirus, which are overhangs in China as well
as the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong. That being said, we are seeing nice improvement in the underlying
fundamentals in our APAC businesses, but we are monitoring these situations very closely.

So let's turn to Slide 11, Global Products.

Global Products sales in the quarter increased 2% organically, driven primarily by strong price realization.
We saw BMS sales grow high single digits in this quarter despite a low double-digit compare in the prior
year, and this was led by strength in our security products business. HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment was
flat, with mixed performance across the individual platforms.

I'd also point out that we have recently restructured our distribution channels in Canada to allow us to
better serve the residential and light commercial markets and to accelerate our growth.

Total resi HVAC declined low single digits, driven by a high single-digit decline in our APAC residential
business as well as a mid-single-digit decline in our North American business.

Let me go through that in a bit more detail.

So as we detailed for you last quarter, we expected continued pressure in our APAC residential business,
primarily due to the softer market conditions in Japan. Our North American business was negatively
impacted in the quarter by the Canadian distribution restructuring I mentioned previously and as well
as the lower-than-expected shipments in our furnace business due to lower heating degree days in the
quarter. Given the low double-digit prior year compare, we expect this weakness to continue into the
second quarter.

Light commercial unitary grew low single digits on a low teens prior year compare, with sales in
North America flat due to weakness in our national accounts business. Our VRF business continues to
outperform, growing mid-single digits, while our applied HVAC equipment declined mid-single digits,
primarily due to the pressures in APAC. We continue to see very strong demand for replacement chillers in
North America. IR equipment grew mid-single digits in the quarter, helped by a relatively easy prior year
compare. Finally, Specialty Products grew low single digits on solid demand for fire suppression products,
particularly in North America.

Product segments EBITDA increased 6% and the EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points, as the under-
absorption on lower volumes was more than offset by positive price/costs and the ongoing benefit of cost
synergies and productivity.

So let's move to Slide 12 and corporate expense.

Corporate expense was down 13% year-over-year to $81 million, driven primarily by the continued
benefits of synergy and productivity save as well as our ongoing actions to reduce our cost structure given
the Power Solutions divestiture.

On Slide 13, free cash flow.

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

Reported Q1 free cash flow was just under $400 million. Excluding a little more than $100 million in
onetime cash outflows related to integration and the $600 million tax refund that we received in the
quarter, adjusted free cash was an outflow of less than $100 million, which is $100 million improvement
versus last year. This was primarily due to continued improvement in working capital management, as
we saw trade working capital as a percentage of sales declined 60 basis points. We continue to expect
adjusted free cash flow conversion of 95%, excluding the $300 million in onetime cash outflows related
primarily to integration and the $600 million tax refund.

So let me turn to the balance sheet on Slide 14.

Net debt was up slightly as we continued to deploy cash towards share repurchases, despite Q1 being our
seasonally weak cash generation quarter. You can see share repurchases in the quarter were $650 million,
roughly in line with the cadence that we expect for the full year.

Before I turn it back to George for his closing remarks, I want to briefly mention a couple of items on Slide
15.

First, during the quarter, we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of $111 million. About half
of that is cash and about half of that is noncash. And the cash impact of that, we'll expect to see in the
current year and is included in our guidance. The cash restructuring charge reflects costs associated with
the final year of the JCI-Tyco merger integration activities as well as the ongoing reduction in costs related
to the Power Solutions divestiture.

Secondly, in the quarter, we recorded a noncash stock charge of $30 million related to Swiss tax reform,
and this will not impact our 13.5% rate for the year.

And then lastly, we also adopted a new accounting standard related to operating leases, which results in a
gross-up of other noncurrent assets and other current and noncurrent liabilities in our balance sheet.

So overall, we're off to a great start in fiscal '20 with strong earnings and cash flow and improving
margins.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to George.

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Brian.

Before we open up the line for questions, I just want to reiterate that we continue to expect our fiscal
2020 earnings per share before special items to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, which represents
earnings growth of 28% to 33%. We have included the full details of our guidance as previously provided
in the appendix to the slides.

Our first quarter reflects -- results reflect a strong start to the fiscal year and a continued commitment to
solid execution and to improving the underlying fundamentals of our business. I am confident that we are
well positioned to deliver continued long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, please open up the lines for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just -- obviously, nice margin trends in the Asia Pac and EMEA/Latin America segments. You've had
some challenges especially in Asia Pacific. Do you feel like you're now in a better position going forward?
And based on the backlog and the mix kind of outlook, do you expect to continue to see sort of margin
leadership from those 2 segments?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Nigel, we've made really nice progress, as Brian talked about, within the margin structure within
Asia Pac, with growth being in low single digits. We worked -- this quarter, we delivered 60 basis points
year-on-year. And that's also with unfavorable mix with our installed growth growing faster than service.
But I think the fundamentals, the way that we're pricing, the way that we're selling value, all of that is
playing out within the structure. And we believe that now with the fundamentals, we're going to continue
to improve on a go-forward basis.

Brian J. Stief
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

I would just add to that, that in 2018, Nigel, as you probably recall, we took a restructuring charge and
some of that related to our European businesses. And I think we're really seeing the benefit in '19 and
now into '20 of the results of some of those actions that were taken in 2018.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. And then my follow-up is, your comments on the residential HVAC markets, we all know it's quite
a warm winter, but well, very warm winter, but the comments on continued challenges in 2Q, is that more
a function of the -- some of the restructuring you're doing in Canada? Or is that a reflection more of the
market?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Nigel, what I would say, it's both. When you look at our performance here in Q1, it's been -- globally,
we're down a bit, and a lot of that's driven by our performance or the market in Japan, which we're down
in line with the margin -- market in Japan. In North America, it's been, too. When you look at the overall
furnace market, we're extremely strong in that space. And that market is down kind of high single digits,
and right now, that's continuing. And when you look at our restructuring of our Canadian distribution
channels, what we've done is we've taken multiple channels. We've consolidated that. And now we're
going to be expanding our points of distribution to be able to effectively now be much better positioned to
accelerate growth in that region. That is all playing out here in the first and second quarter, and we'll be
positioned in the second half to be able to pick up from a growth standpoint from there.

Operator

Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

George, on the price kind of pull forward on orders, we normally think of that being potentially kind of
a residential phenomenon, but not something that would kind of impact the larger company given the
nature of kind of applied and commercial projects. Can you just kind of speak to how broadly the timing of
orders might have been affected by pricing and your kind of visibility on Q2 orders?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean we've -- historically, we've had our price increases in January. And as we've been working
on price/costs over the last couple of years, we've made a lot of progress. And so as we have been
planning for 2020, we made a decision to pull forward. And with that, with the announcements, there is a
behavior that goes along with those announcements. And when you look at last year, for instance, in North
America, we had high-teens growth in our product last year in North America because of the price being
effective in January. When we announced the increase in coming -- being pulled into October, certainly,
we benefited in the fourth quarter of last year because of the same phenomenon. So there is a behavior
around our price increases.

What I would tell you, Jeff, is that the underlying activity is very strong across the board. Our pipelines
pretty much across the board are high single digits, mid to high single digits. And so my confidence in
being able to deliver low to mid-single-digit order growth in the second quarter and be positioned here for
the year is very strong. And that ultimately correlates to the revenue that we're projecting for the total
year.

Antonella Franzen
VP and Chief Investor Relations & Communications Officer

And Jeff, just to quantify the impact of that for you. When you look at our overall field orders, they would
be up low single digits on an underlying basis.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And just on investment spend not called out in the bridge. Has this now kind of normalized and it
will just kind of track with revenue growth from here? Or should we expect kind of other initiatives maybe
to pop up and be part of the earnings equation?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. As we've committed over the last couple of years, our reinvestment in the sales channels as well
as the reinvestment in products now as a percent of revenue is flattening out in 2020 and beyond. And
so what's happening, Jeff, is that we're continuing to add sales in line with what we see with the market
activity to be. So we're continuing to add sales, but we're getting productivity with all of the expansion
that we've done over the last couple of years. In engineering and R&D, we're continuing to, obviously,
increase the dollars with the reinvestment, but maintaining that now as a percent of the overall revenue
that's being achieved. And so we feel good. And we're also, similarly -- we're doing, combining the
footprint, we're making sure that we're getting good productivity on the dollars that we're spending, and
ultimately, tracking that to the new product introductions that we're bringing to market to make sure that
we're getting the appropriate volume returns on those investments.

Operator

Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I just want to follow up on Jeff's questions on pricing. And George, so just so we're clear, will price
increases be more of a dynamic decision based upon material costs? Or will there be a strategy around
anticipating customer behavior? But just address the timing of price increases going forward.

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. What I'd say, Deane, if you go back 2 years ago, we had negative price/costs in the market. With
the market changes, we weren't positioned to be able to move quickly to stay ahead of that. We've made
significant improvement now building on our strategic pricing capability across our businesses. So it is
more dynamic. We're tracking the markets. We're tracking our win/loss. We're making sure that we're
selling value and bringing value propositions to our customers, instead of this just annual price increase.
Now there is -- historically, that's what's happened within the industry we're in. But I believe that now
we're much more dynamic relative to what's happening in the markets that we're serving. And as a result
of that, you saw nice progress with our price/costs last year, when we actually turned the headwind that
we had in '18 to a tailwind in '19, and that's continuing now in 2020, with probably -- I estimate over 1
point of our top line will be driven by continued very positive price/cost.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And then just as a follow-up. Now that they've declared the coronavirus a global health emergency, I know
your 2020 guidance does not anticipate impacts, but it's likely happening given all the shutdowns going
on. Any sense of where and how you're tracking, steps you're taking internally? Just anything you could
share would be helpful.

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Well, I would start by saying, about 6% of our revenue is achieved in China. So overall, it is significant,
but in the grand scheme, relatively small. We've been working very well across all of our teams that are
positioned in China. We've got not only all of the business units totally aligned, but we've got full support
of our EHS professionals, our facilities leaders and security where we get a daily update from our Asia Pac
leader, certainly a top priority for us to make sure that all of our people are safe, and protecting them. As
you know, most provinces have mandatory holiday extension now through February 10 and that most of
the travel within China now has been curbed or curbed significantly. And so what -- we are also assessing
the supply side to have a pulse on what's happening with our supply. There could be some supply chain
disruptions. To date, it's been minimal. What I would say, it is a fluid situation, and that we're monitoring
it very closely. At this stage, Deane, it's hard to assess, difficult to assess, but it could have some deferral
of activity. And certainly, we'll have to keep everyone updated.

Operator

Our next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

I don't want to fixate too much on the price today because it's been beaten to death, but it's pretty
interesting that, after all these years, pulling it forward to October, did -- were the competitors been -- did
they do the same thing? Or are you out there for a whole quarter with higher prices generally than your
competitors and that would have had some negative volume impact perhaps?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I believe that given the way that price increases occur within the industry, we're now ahead. So
therefore, we had the issue that last year, we had a very strong first quarter with our HVAC equipment.
And then this year, because we had pulled it forward, we had seen some of that benefit, Scott, in the
fourth quarter of last year. And then what I would tell you is that when you look at the underlying pipeline
and how the pipeline converts, we have a very strong pipeline. It's high single digits. We usually -- there's
pretty good predictability of how we convert into percent. And so I have confidence that we're going to
get back to, like I said, kind of low to mid-single-digit order growth in the second quarter and for the year,

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

a very strong pipeline to deliver the mid-single digits. So I mean, overall, we're in line with where we
thought we'd be.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay. Yes, just the mechanics are interesting. My follow-up is just on the replacement -- the North
America replacement chiller market. Is there a sense -- I've never seen the data out there and kind of the
age of the installed base when you're talking about the bigger chillers. Is there a sense that the installed
base is old and there's a long tail, that there's a greater sense of upgrading or replacement for energy
efficiency? Any -- just -- some of that is a little bit obvious, but just trying to get a sense of how long that
tail of demand is?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean it's all of the above. I think given the value proposition with our new chillers and the ability
to be able to reduce energy consumption and drive efficiency, there's certainly a big value proposition
there. And so it's looked at in total value. So when you look at what their current cost is to maintain and
what the energy consumption is, we typically will go in and create a value proposition that not only we can
improve their operating cost, but also reduce energy. So you've got to look at it as in total cost. And so I
think as we now launch new products, we bring our digital capabilities in how we optimize the operation of
the equipment, how that integrates with the overall building systems. I think there's a real attractive value
proposition for our customers. So we're seeing a nice pickup there.

Our next question is from John Walsh with Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I guess a question around the retail business. You've kind of called it out the last couple of quarters. It's
now in the bridge. Just wondering, it can be lumpy. How long should we expect to kind of hear you calling
out the retail headwind as it relates to the North America business?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

John, our retail business, when you size the business, it's roughly about $900 million. We have a presence
globally. We are the industry leader in loss prevention, inventory intelligence, traffic insights. It's a very
profitable business because there's a high-value proposition for our retail customers. And now that all
being said, there's been lots of change in the industry given the proliferation of online shopping requiring
-- as we look at our overall offering, more towards digital solutions, a lot more installations that occurred
during the quarter.

But I believe that with the value proposition, the way that we're aligned, we're going to continue to see
the business perform, but there's going to be a different mix within the business. So it's something that
we're watching carefully. We're working very closely with each one of our retail customers in laying out
what the year looks like and how we're going to be positioned to be able to support their year. But it is --
given what's happening within the retail space, there is a lot of change that's happening, and we're going
to make sure that we're positioned to be able to capitalize on that change and support the customers
through that.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then, I guess, in the past, you've talked about the impact around PFAS and the AFFF,
wondering if you can just provide us any kind of update there.

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

John, there's no change in our position. You have to keep this in perspective. Tyco and Chemguard
make life-saving firefighting foam, not PFAS chemicals. And Tyco and Chemguard purchased compounds
that contain trace amounts of PFAS, which they blend to make the foam. And their firefighting foam is
made to exacting military standards. The majority of the foam in issue is specified and used by the U.S.
government and military, and therefore, subject to the government contract of defense. And so Tyco
fire products and Chemguard have always acted responsibly in producing these firefighting foams, and
therefore, we feel confident in our ability to defend these claims.

But I also would like to share a few other facts. PFAS chemicals have been used by other companies
since the 1940s in many, many products and applications. And we didn't start producing firefighting foam
until the mid-1970s, which was over 30 years later. And these foams are used only intermittently and
predominantly at very specific sites, such as military bases. And then last is, when you look at third-
party scientific studies that also recognize that firefighting foam accounts for only a very small percentage
of PFAS than has historically been used in this country. So overall, our position hasn't changed. We feel
very good given what we've done for our government military customers. And certainly, there's really no
additional updates.

Our next call -- or question, I'm sorry, is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

What's going on in the -- so I think the -- one of your businesses in North America, I think, was down. It
was the solutions business or something. Is that like the performance contracting business? Do you guys
still do that stuff?

Brian J. Stief
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean it's -- our solutions business are the large performance contracts, Steve. And as we've always
talked to the order intake on that can be pretty choppy given the size of the contracts. And then the flow
of those contracts can give you some pretty significant variations quarter-to-quarter. But it's not a huge
part of our business, but it can impact -- when we talk about that particular business, you can have some
big swings quarter-to-quarter.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then any -- just to kind of level set people, any color on whether the second quarter, anything
stand out as far as abnormal seasonality anywhere? You mentioned the orders, do you expect the orders
to pick up a bit? Anything on free cash or the underlying business results that we need to kind of keep in
mind for second quarter?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Steve, I'll take that. On the organic growth, we're looking at low single digits, and that's, again, against a
prior year compare of 6%. When you break that out, the Field businesses will be low to mid-single digit,
and that's to a compare of 5%. And Products will continue low single digits, and that's to a compare of
7%. So overall, continued performance on the top line. It will be, as Brian mentioned, within products,
some additional pressure here in Q2 on North America resi. But as we go through the year, we still feel
very good in the second half of the year. The EBITDA margins expanding in line with the guidance for
the year, 40 to 60 basis points, and we see expansion across all segments. And as you know, the normal
seasonality to our year is typically 30% in the first half, 70% in the second half. But because of the
share repo this year, it's a little bit more skewed to the first half. And then when you look at the overall

13

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

consensus, it is in line with our guidance for the year. And the guidance that I reiterated earlier was EPS
range of $2.50 to $2.60, and that would be an increase, Steve, of 28% to 33%.

Brian J. Stief
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

I would just add to that. Steve, I think from a corporate expense standpoint, we had a pretty low quarter.
As you've probably seen in the past, the second quarter tends to be a little bit higher. So I think we're --
our guidance that's out there for corporate expense is still pretty solid as we sit here today. And then when
it look -- when you look at cash flow, I think cash flow, we will continue to see some improvement like we
saw in the first quarter. So I think all in all, we feel real good about the second quarter.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

George, just one more quick follow-up on the -- on just the general strategic question. I don't think
anybody's asked it yet. But obviously, a lot of these companies progressing on their splits. How do you
guys view -- any change in your view on kind of the strategic imperative to grow the residential business
more structurally?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

I mean we've been focused -- when you look at our strategy, Steve, we've been focused on executing and
getting the fundamentals in place, delivering on our commitments and ultimately driving results. That's
the focus for us here in 2020. We've been returning in line with what we committed, a significant amount
of capital to our shareholders. And we have a lot of underlying momentum across the organization,
whether it be the margin fundamentals on how we're launching new products. We're upgrading our
leadership and ultimately now deploying our digital strategy. So I think when you look at our positions,
that's one that we've been investing heavily in -- the residential space is we've been investing heavily with
new products and technology. We are seeing progress because it is a critical element of our line card and
how we ultimately support our customers. And so we're going to continue to stay focused on executing, on
delivering on the commitments and certainly keeping a pulse on what's happening within the industry as
far as any type of consolidation.

Operator

Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just a question around the EMEA/LA region. I think the Middle East Africa piece for you and a lot of
your competitors, that's been pretty soft for much of the last sort of 12, 18 months, albeit lumpy. I think
you sounded better, Brian, in the prepared remarks on trends in Middle East, Africa. So maybe just help us
understand how you're looking at the applied markets there. And also just remind us of the scale of that
piece today.

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I'll -- Julian, I'll give you the overview of EMEA/LA. We've made a tremendous amount of progress
in EMEA/LA over the last couple of years, not only in expanding our footprint from a sales, from a service
standpoint pretty much across the region. And when you look at our performance in the first quarter,
organic growth, 7%. It was both install and service. HVAC & Controls up high single-digit. Fire & Security
up mid-single digit. And Industrial Refrigeration, as Brian said, to an easy compare but up high teens.
We've made tremendous progress. And with that, we've seen good leverage on the margin rate, with the
volume, good productivity savings and cost synergies. And so overall, we're executing extremely well.
Even within the current environment, we're seeing a pipeline continue to expand, and we're converting
orders kind of mid-single digit, with the backlog up 8%. So overall, we've done over the last couple of

14

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

years of restructuring, as Brian talked about, the work we've done from a go-to-market is really beginning
to play out.

Now that all being said, in the Middle East, certainly, a part of that, it does represent about 10%, 12%
of the overall EMEA/LA revenue. Last year was a tough year. 2019 was a tough year for us. But we're
beginning to see, obviously, with the easier comps, the work that we're doing around service and seeing
some of the project installations come back. But I mean, overall, I'd say, when you look at the whole
region, we've made a lot of good progress in the last couple of years. And competitively, I think we're
positioned in an extremely strong position.

I don't know, Brian, you want to?

Brian J. Stief
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

No. I think you summarized it well. I think we had a pretty easy comp in the fourth quarter or the first
quarter of fiscal '19, and so that benefited certainly in the current year. But I think we're better positioned
today than we were a year ago, for sure.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then my second question, just around corporate costs. Heard the color on second quarter versus first
quarter. But for the year as a whole, maybe just highlight the confidence in that range for corporate costs
that you've given on Slide 21, particularly in light of a very good performance in Q1. And also, where do
we stand today in terms of realized stranded cost reduction since the Power divestment? And how much
stranded cost is still left to come out from that, and whether that view has changed in the past 9 months?

Brian J. Stief
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

So our corporate expense guide for the year is $330 million to $340 million, and we ended up at $81
million in the first quarter. That tends to be a lower quarter for us. And so I think there is going to be a
tick up in the second and third quarter. So I think that guide of $330 million to $340 million is still a pretty
good number, maybe on the lower end of that, but I think that's probably a good number to use for now.

As it relates to the Power Solutions stranded costs takeout, I think we had communicated that we were
going to have about a $10 million benefit that we saw in '19. It was going to be about $30 million in 2020.
And then the full run rate, $50 million benefit, we would see in '21 forward. We saw probably about what
you would expect a pro rata portion of that $30 million here in the first quarter. And we would expect that
$30 million to be delivered throughout the course of the year.

Operator

Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

George or Brian, obviously, it was nice to see the tax payment helping your GAAP cash, but adjusted cash
is maybe slightly better than your normal seasonal weakness. When you look at 2020 and the initiative
that you're going to keep your cash conversion down to 95%, such as equity income from your JVs versus
dividend and pension, do you see any more improvement in trade working capital versus your expectation
that can help you in 2020? And how are you thinking about your ability to collect dividends from your JVs
in 2020?

Brian J. Stief
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

So the trade working capital as a percentage of sales, as I mentioned, did improve by 60 basis points
quarter-over-quarter. We saw a day improvement in DSO, a day improvement in DPO. We saw a 5-day

15

JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 31, 2020

improvement in days on-hand in the inventory side. So all in all, we made progress really across the 3 key
metrics.

As we look at the 95% for the year, that type of improvement was contemplated when we gave the 95%
guidance. I would tell you that, as you know, this is the first year that we're going to end up in a situation
where we've got reported cash flow in excess of adjusted cash flow because of that the $600 million tax
refund we got in the first quarter. But we still tend to be a little bit short of 100% converter because of the
level of our CapEx, the fact that we don't get as -- the entire amount of our equity income out in terms
of dividends from our JVS. And then we still have this pension income that doesn't come with any cash.
Now that's offset with some amortization benefits. So I think longer term, we're going to get to that 100%
level. But sitting here today, the headwinds are still a little bit more than the tailwinds we've got. So our
target is 100%, but I think 95% is a good number for this year.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then, George, can you give us more color into the inventory destock situation that you had last
quarter in Japan and Taiwan? Resi HVAC was still down in Q1 there, but it wasn't -- it didn't seem
embedded last quarter. I know you talked about the headwinds in North America impacting Q2. But do you
still see the APAC situation not being a headwind as we go into Q2?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

So specifically, on the unitary commercial, is that what you asked, Andrew?

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Yes. On the -- because you said Japan might sort of be an overhang as you go through, at least into Q1, it
looks like that may be getting a little better, but just your comments on Japan and Taiwan as we sit here
over the next couple of quarters.

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So when you look at the -- we talked a little bit about the softness we had in our furnace business,
which the market itself was down about 9%. We have a strong presence in that market. And certainly,
that hit us. And then Brian did talk a little bit about the restructuring that we're doing in our Canadian
distribution which, short-term, we did see a little bit of a headwind. I think as we get through this first and
second quarter, that's going to turn into a tailwind on a go-forward basis, and we're going to significantly
increase our points of distribution. And so you see a little bit where you got a lot of different factors
playing together here. We think that Q2 will continue to be a little bit soft. But as we get through the year,
we're going to be positioned to get back to above-market growth within our business. So does that get at
what you're...

Antonella Franzen
VP and Chief Investor Relations & Communications Officer

And Andy, just to -- specifically related to Taiwan and Japan. As we said last quarter, we expected the
destocking to be complete in Taiwan in Q4, and it was, so our Taiwan business was fine. On the APAC side,
and as expected, we did continue to have some pressure in Japan in our APAC residential business. We do
expect that to start flattening out as we get into the second quarter.

A couple of questions. First, I was wondering, George, can you comment on the M&A pipeline. I know you
talked about $1 billion sort of set aside for potential acquisitions. Where do we stand there?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We're constantly looking at bolt-ons, Gautam. We're continuing to reinvest organically. We've got a
pipeline across our businesses where we have gaps, technology or products, looking at both bolt-ons. So
at this stage, there's nothing significant, but we are continuing to strengthen our regional footprint and
continuing to look at our product portfolio to make sure that we're making the appropriate plays in line
with the organic investments we're making.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And just as you look at the portfolio, do you see any incremental potential for divestments as we
move forward?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We've been continuing to review the portfolio across the board. And we've been making small
divestitures with businesses that are noncore and businesses that we don't want to continue to reinvest in.
But again, there's been nothing significant there. But that's a process that we continue. We're constantly
looking at the portfolio, Gautam.

Brian J. Stief
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

Gautam, I would just say to that. I think when you look at the activity in the current year, we've got our
Hart & Cooley business held for sale right now. We would expect that to close in the current year. And
there are some other investments that we'll probably make. But I think you can almost look at our M&A
activity in the current year as that the inflows and the outflows will be relatively the same. I don't think
there's going to be anything significant in fiscal '20.

Gautam J. Khanna
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful, Brian. One last one for me. Just as we look out to fiscal '21, what do you think the lingering
integration costs will be out 4 plus years on?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Let me just frame '21. We gave a framework that when we gave guidance for '20 and what that
ultimately would look like in 2021 as it relates to the deployment of capital with the buybacks and the like.
And in addition to that, I'm very confident that when you look at the fundamentals that we're building
across these businesses from a margin standpoint on a go-forward basis that we're going to be positioned.
We have a pipeline of productivity and savings that ultimately is going to position us to sustain margin
improvement year-on-year, similar to what we've seen here over the last couple of years. So I want
everyone to understand that, that's going to continue.

Now with that, there is some restructuring as it relates to some of the take out of some of the structure
that we have in place across the globe. And normally, that would probably be in the $50 million, maybe
the $50 million, maybe a little bit more range on an annual basis, but with very strong payback within
the year relative to the margin rate that we can achieve. So I feel very confident that with the framework
that we provided relative to the buybacks and how that's going to play out as we position for 2021, the
work that we've done in reducing the debt costs, and then now with the margin rates that we're achieving,
that we're going to be positioned to deliver what I would say is incrementals that are 30-plus on our
incrementals. And so that will position us extremely well to continue margin expansion and be able to

deliver longer-term on the margin rate that we originally said we could get to, which is somewhere 15% to
16%.

Operator

Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

If we could look at North America, we're seeing some improving indicators, both indicators: ABI and
Dodge Momentum. Can you maybe just talk about the pace of quoting activity on the longer-cycle project
business? And what kind of confidence that gives you in sustainability of growing the backlog?

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

When you look at North America, and if you look at the quarter, organic growth was 3%, a mix pretty
much across all of the domains, the capabilities. Margins were flat. But overall, the margin rate, we did
operationally deliver, not only with the volume and the productivity, 40 basis points, but that was offset
with the retail mix and some of the cost pressure there.

When you look at orders, we did talk about the orders down 1%, a lot of that was timed because of the
price increases. But when you look at the backlog, backlog year-on-year was up 7% to $5.8 billion. So
when you look at the mix of that backlog, that is both short and long-term projects, and as we project the
year, we are positioned here for kind of mid -- low to mid-single-digit top line growth. We are positioned
here to continue to deliver orders that are kind of mid-single digit, low to mid for the year, mid-single
digits in the second quarter. And then within the mix of those orders, then we'll be positioned to be able to
convert those orders similar to what we're doing this year as we position for 2021. So the cadence that we
have and how we look at backlog and how we look at turn absolutely supports what we're going to achieve
for this year. And as we build the backlog, as we plan for 2021, we feel confident that with the pipeline
that we're currently working to convert, that will position us well for 2021.

Antonella Franzen
VP and Chief Investor Relations & Communications Officer

And operator, with that, I'm going to pass it over to George for some closing comments.

George R. Oliver
Chairman & CEO

So thanks, everyone, for joining our call this morning. Again, as we discussed, we're off to a strong start
for the year, positioned well to deliver on our full year commitments. As it relates to orders, I feel very
confident in mid-single-digit order growth in Q2, which then ties to the overall guidance of low to mid-
single-digit growth for the full year. And with all of the sessions that are coming up, I do look forward to
seeing many of you soon. So on that, operator, that concludes our call.
