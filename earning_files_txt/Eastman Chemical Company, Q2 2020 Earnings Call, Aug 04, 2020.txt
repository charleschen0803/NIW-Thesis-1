EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Eastman Chemical Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website, which is
www.eastman.com.

We will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company, Investor Relations. Please
go ahead, sir.

Gregory A. Riddle
Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications

Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today
are Mark Costa, Board Chair and CEO; Willie McLain, Senior Vice President and CFO; and [ Jake Laroe ],
Manager, Investor Relations. In case you missed it yesterday after market close, in addition to our first
quarter 2020 financial results press release and SEC 8-K filing, we posted slides and related prepared
remarks in the Investors section of our website, which is www.eastman.com. We've continued this practice
from the first quarter, and I hope it continues to be helpful to you.

Before we begin, I'll cover 2 items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-looking
statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially. Certain
factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company's second quarter 2020
financial results news release during this call, in the preceding slides and prepared remarks and in our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for first quarter 2020
and the Form 10-Q to be filed for second quarter 2020. Second, earnings referenced in this presentation
excludes certain noncore and unusual items and use an adjusted effective tax rate using the forecasted
tax rate for the full year. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and
other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items, are available
in the second quarter financial results news release, which can be found on our website in the Investors
section.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Greg. Before we turn it over to questions, I want to take a few minutes to make some comments.
The first half of 2020 has been unprecedented, given the serious threat to health and safety, the
reminders of racism and the need for positive change, the incredible amount of economic volatility and the
lingering uncertainty that confronts us all. I'm grateful to the health care community, our first responders,
along with government local leaders who are helping at this difficult time.

As importantly, I want to thank the women and men of Eastman, their families, who continue to come
together in tremendous ways. They've gone above and beyond, working long hours, many times in
challenging conditions. Most important, they have been diligent to keep people safe, continue to support
our customers, and keep our businesses going.

While COVID-19 has caused us to shift some priorities this year, we're renewing our commitment to
drive a more inclusive and diverse workforce, which is a core value of Eastman and critical to our growth
strategy and ability to innovate. During the quarter, we took steps to strengthen our efforts to build
more inclusive teams by increasing our efforts to mitigate the impact of unconscious bias and expanding
resources to equip employees for their role in driving a more inclusive culture. We're making progress and
have much more work to do to ensure every team can show up and contribute fully at work and in their
communities.

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

As we look at our first half performance, we believe that we have performed relatively well with our focus
on free cash flow. Sales revenue for the quarter and for the first half of the year, when compared to peer
results, demonstrated resilience, which is a function of our innovation-driven growth model as well as the
diversity of our end markets and a testament to the great work of Eastman employees as they navigate
this challenging and unprecedented environment. We also made great progress in our $150 million of cost
reductions in the quarter and are on track to hit our full year target.

With our focus on free cash flow, we also manage our inventory aggressively to respond to the fall in
demand and go beyond that to generate even more cash, delivering our best free cash flow for the first
half.

Turning now to our expectations for 2020. In the second quarter, the cost from the lower capacity
utilization was $120 million sequentially. We expect this will decline by about half in the third quarter and
be partially offset by increasing maintenance spending and a moderation of the impact from cost reduction
actions as we ramp back up. Advanced Materials will have the biggest impact from the improvement and
capacity utilization at between $30 million and $35 million for the quarter. AFP will see some benefit, and
CI will face a net headwind as higher maintenance shutdowns will be more than the utilization tailwind.

The third quarter is off to a strong start as we benefit from volume recovery and start to realize the
benefits of inventory management actions we took in the second quarter. As a result, we expect a
substantial sequential increase in earnings. Most importantly, we are maintaining our focus on cash
generation, which is our priority for the year.

Building on a very strong start in the first half of the year, we are on track to generate over $1 billion of
free cash flow for the year. Given the continued uncertainty related to COVID-19, we are not providing
2020 guidance.

While the actions we're taking today are making a significant difference, we remain focused on our
innovation strategy and are continuing to invest in our growth and our commercial capabilities. At the
same time, we will be driving an operational transformation program to structurally remove costs by
greater than $200 million by the end of 2022, with a significant impact in '21. Altogether, these actions
we've taken in 2020 are -- we are well positioned to benefit from the return of economic growth as we
look at the future in '21 and beyond, as we lead from a position of strength with our innovation-driven
growth model. It's the heart of how we win.

Our strengths have never been clearer during this pandemic: our portfolio transformation to specialty
businesses; the outstanding innovation capability we've built, along with our decisive operational execution
capability, generating excellent free cash flow as a top financial priority; our balance sheet is strong; and
we have significant sources of liquidity.

With that, I'll turn it back to Greg.

Gregory A. Riddle
Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications
Okay. Thanks, Mark. And Brian, we're now ready for questions.

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We now take our first question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.

Angel Octavio Castillo Malpica
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

This is Angel Castillo on for Vincent. So just had a quick question regarding your carbon renewal
technology. It sounds like you're getting good customer receptiveness. So I was wondering if you could
give us a little bit more color in regards to the economics, whether what premiums you're getting versus
nonrecycled product.

And then as we think about the product moving toward that $200 million, $300 million type number that
you mentioned, could you give us a sense of what checkpoints you're thinking about and what the time
line of that might be and maybe when we move from a pilot plant to a full-scale rollout?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Great set of questions, and one of the most exciting growth platforms we have at Eastman that
we've been working on for the last, I guess, 18 months now.

As all of you know, attention to carbon footprint, circular economy, the plastic waste problem we have
in landfills, the ocean is a critical issue that we, as an industry, need to solve. And it's also just a huge
waste of carbon, letting that all go into the environment as opposed to recycling it. And what's exciting
about Eastman is we are leading, I think, with commercial scale investments to close that loop and create
a circular economy that is both economic and great for the environment.

So one of those 2 technologies, as you noted, is the carbon renewal technology, where we're repurposing
our gas fire to reforming waste plastic. And so we take it in on the front end, instead of the coal, and we
can completely clean up that waste plastic to its molecular elements and rebuild acetyls and cellulosic
products. So we went commercial on that quite some time ago and are scaling up for their customers,
both in textiles, with our new Naia products that have already 50% bio content from sustainably
grown forest. Now the other half will be based on recycled plastics. So it's -- and these products are
biodegradable as microfibers in the ocean. So it's the hat trick of all offers in textiles, when you're half
bio, half recycle content, and you don't have to worry about the micro fibers. So we get -- we have
tremendous interest in a number of customers who are adopting this. One of the biggest wins we've had
recently was with H&M who have put that in their conscious collection, and we're seeing a number of other
companies adopt.

Now obviously, in the COVID environment where the textile market is severely down, it's hard to see
a lot of that benefit. But we can still see it in women's wear, which is our target growth market where
we're only down about 15% when the underlying market is down 30%. So we're seeing good substitution
growth even in a very challenged market, where people are still adopting sustainable solutions at a
premium compared to other alternatives in the marketplace. So we're getting both a price premium as
well as accelerated growth. And we would expect as the textile market recovers, that would accelerate.

Same is true with a variety of cellulosic plastic offerings we have on the specialty plastic side.
Ophthalmics, we've had a number of customers now adopt to recycle their cellulosic waste for sunglasses,
eyeglasses. We're the dominant player in that marketplace with a very strong leadership position, and
we're going to be taking back their product actually and circulating it back into a true circular solution for
sunglasses and eyeglasses. So we've had a number of wins there. And that's only 1 of 2 technologies.

The other one is our polyester technology, where we can recycle polyester and then zip it back into its
intermediates and then return that back to market. And what's great about both of these technologies is

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

that they're truly circular where we can close the loop into the same level of application or even a better
application. We're not down cycling products, which is what happens to a lot of waste.

And what's great about molecular recycling is the product is identical, so there's no trade-off in
performance. The performance is identical to the fossil-fuel-based product. The quality is identical. There
are no safety concerns because we're breaking it down to the molecular and clean it all up before we make
the new polymer. And it's infinite like aluminum, so we can continue to recycle the product forever. There
is no limitations. Mechanical recycling starts to break down over time. So there's only so many times
you can do that. So it truly is a solution, and we believe that, as we've said, there's $200 million to $300
million at least of incremental revenue associated with this in both share gains and price premiums that
we can get from the marketplace. Provides a very attractive return on investment.

Angel Octavio Castillo Malpica
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's very helpful. And then just in terms of the portfolio optimization. So you're doing some savings,
cost savings initiatives. I think on your last earnings call, you had mentioned that perhaps in this
environment it's a little bit hard to look at monetizing some of the maybe 1/3 of AFP that's struggling a
little bit more. I was wondering if you could give us an update on how you're viewing this strategically and
if there's opportunities to do some of that as well on top of the cost reductions.

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

So yes. This is Willie speaking. So on the 1/3 of AFP first. So let me just reiterate that we're taking action
now, actions to improve the business, including progress on our innovation as well as the restructuring
of our footprint. You'll see that we announced the closure of an asset in Asia. And we continue to work
through other actions and choices that we have to improve the near-term business performance.

We're pursuing all options, which includes partnerships to improve the overall business performance and
reduce our exposure. In addition to that, we would be looking at, call it, also divestitures over time. So
we're looking at all fronts, and we're taking actions now to improve that performance.

As you can imagine, in this environment, it is a more difficult environment. But I would say that we've
gotten through, I'll call it, the first phase of COVID. There has been renewed engagement and interest on
multiple fronts, and we're pleased with those engagements.

On the $150 million of cost savings, to pivot there, what I would highlight, again, is we're on track to
achieve that in Q2. We were a little ahead and on you would expect Q4 to be the lowest quarter and
Q3 to be about on average. But again, on track to achieve that. And as we highlighted, we're looking to
also structurally make structural changes of which we think roughly 1/3 will be structural from that. And
our objective right now is to ensure that as the discretionary spend comes back in 2021, that we have
structural actions that at least offset that as we move forward.

Operator

Moving on to our next question from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank.

Benjamin Isaacson
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I noticed that your sales by customer location was down about 20% in the U.S., 20% in Europe but only
around 9% in Asia. So could you split that between China and the rest of Asia? Remind us what your China
exposure is. And are you working on any risk mitigants with respect to potentially a worsening U.S.-China
trade?

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Yes. Just to give a little bit of color around our Asia Pacific exposure. What we've previously said is roughly
half of that exposure is in China, half of it's outside of China. As you think about also the way COVID
impacted around the world, the impact of COVID was much more impactful in Q1 in Asia. As the economy
returned, you saw that pick up. And basically, I think what you're seeing in the revenue is how it impacted
Europe and North America, more so in Q2.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And as you think about the trade war question, sometimes we forget we're just in Phase 2. We
started with a trade war in '19 and a pandemic, just to make it more interesting, this year on top of it.
And we're already living with a certain amount of trade war that didn't exactly get completely abated. It
got stabilized, I would say, in the beginning of this year, but it didn't go away. So we're -- that's still there.
And I think we've done a good job of managing our way through it last year, and we certainly were seeing
strong improvement in our results once it's stabilized in the January and February part of this year.

But we have a diversity of end markets. We've shown we can be stable with our end markets as well as
our regions. There's a lot of upside in North America and Europe in a pandemic recovery in front of us.
That would certainly mitigate some risk to China as we sort of move forward. So I think we've got a good
diverse position on not just geographies but in markets. And I've already demonstrated we can manage
our way through a trade war.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Can you speak to the inventory reductions in the second quarter as well as where you ended the quarter
and what that might mean for your operating rates moving forward?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Kevin. This is Willie. We've made very strong progress on working capital and specifically,
inventory in the quarter. I think sequentially, you saw inventory down roughly 15%. And again, applaud
all of our business teams and operations and supply chain for executing on that very effectively. We
would expect only, I'll call it, very modest additional inventory reductions throughout the year. So you can
expect, I'll call it, the utilization rates to pick up quite substantially here in Q3 as we bring our auto plants
back on board and the -- definitely in the transportation end markets. And I'd also reference that as you
look at that on a year-over-year basis, we were building inventory. So it's in that 20% to 25% level year-
over-year of inventory reductions.

So great progress. Still more to do as we think about our receivables and payables as those, I'll call it, get
back to more normal levels in the back half of the year. But effectively improving overall.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The other thing I'd note is, as you think about utilization, the upside of utilization headwinds this year
is in 2021. So we've generated a lot of cash this year. We're really proud of how much progress we made,
and incredible actions by our teams on how well they did it. And it wasn't just falling demand, right? We
went way beyond that and pulling inventory down to generate cash, which created a good portion of that
headwind. So as we said, $140 million year-over-year headwind in utilization in the second quarter. Half
of that was doing that inventory management beyond just following demand. So if you look at next year,
if you just assume volumes next year are equal to this year, that half of that $140 million is an earnings
tailwind next year relative to this year. So not only are we holding costs flat with our structural actions
into next year on the fixed cost, this utilization set of actions we took in the second quarter and, to some
degree, continuing in the third quarter, will create a pretty substantial earnings tailwind for next year as

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

long as volumes are equal to this year. And then once volumes get better than that, obviously, you get
even more tailwind because the incremental margins become quite significant for all the volume and mix
growth beyond that.

So I think the utilization really sets us. It was great for cash this year as our priority. We've been very
clear that's our priority as opposed to worrying about how the earnings look from an accounting point
of view, especially with the period charges in the first -- in the second quarter, but really sets us up for
recovery next year.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I see. And then secondly, I wanted to ask you to elaborate on restructuring. It looks like you foresee $200
million or more savings to the end of '22, fairly large number there. Where will that be coming from in
terms of your businesses and regions? Perhaps you could talk about how much is headcount versus asset
rationalization and other sources of savings.

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, Kevin, let me start out here. As you think about the actions that we're taking, first and foremost,
we look to optimize our asset footprint, specifically in the 1/3 as well as the Singapore announcement
that we've previously announced. So you can see that number being at least $50 million or greater.
Additionally, as we had highlighted earlier this year, we were talking about continuing to improve our
site utilization. So as you think about leveraging our integrated facilities, we've highlighted with air
products and other assets along the Gulf Coast, the benefits that we'll achieve in earnings there. And then
additionally, we're looking at how do we use digital solutions as well as transform how we do maintenance
on our sites and optimize our networks around the globe in a post-trade war, post-COVID environment.
And those will be additional monies on top of that.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. There's quite a bit of value around network optimization. And we've done a lot of acquisitions over the
years, as you guys know, building up our specialty portfolio. So as you look at those plants, warehouses,
networks of how we do everything, there's opportunities to optimize all of that. And there's headcount
reduction as well. So as we optimize our business operating model and our investments about making us
more effective and nimble, agile in our commercial operations, all the way through how we improve our
effectiveness of operations, especially a lot of lessons learned here in the last 4 months, we see a real
opportunity to sort of streamline the organization and take costs out there.

So there's a lot of different levers of it. It's all line of sight. There's very detailed programs to that total
number, Kevin, on how we get there. It's no one silver bullet, but a lot of heavy lifting by people across
the entire organization to make it happen. But it's a great year to sort of step back and say how do we
complete the transformation to a specialty company, both on the commercial capability and innovation
investments, which we're continuing to do, but also on how we become very cost-competitive to create
value for our shareholders and stay competitive against the people we face in the marketplace. So a lot of
great work there, but very clear set of action plans.

Operator

We'll now take our next question from Matthew DeYoe from Bank of America.

Matthew Porter DeYoe
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So one of your competitors had talked about the fact that the outperformance -- that they outperformed
autos in 2Q given the position on the supply chain and the fact that insulated them from the sell-
off initially. However, that would represent a lag both in operating rates and demand pull-through as

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

transportation rebounded. Are you seeing a similar implications on your businesses, particularly as it
relates to those on OEM? Or do you see orders already kind of coming through your system?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

I think the answers are a little bit different between AM and AFP, so I'm going to sort of give it to you on
both fronts.

So in Advanced Materials, the supply chain there is very short. So we feel the changes in OEM behavior at
production or sales level when it comes to performance films business because that's at the point-of-sale
as opposed to production pretty quickly. So that's why you saw Advanced Materials take the bigger impact
from COVID in the first quarter where the earnings weren't nearly as good as the recovery of earnings you
saw sequentially from 4Q to 1Q in AFP. So we felt it quickly. We acted quickly, and that's also why you saw
us take down a lot more operating facilities in Advanced Materials, and that demand came off in March
through April, May. And we have more stand-alone facilities. These are -- shut those facilities down in AM.
So very quick impact, and we already saw a very quick recovery in those businesses as we got to June.
And hence, the much stronger forecast for earnings recovery and utilization benefit for Advanced Materials
in the third quarter. So that played out much faster than what we're seeing in advance -- I mean Additives
& Functional Products, where supply chain is much longer. So we didn't feel the impact really in the first
quarter, hence, a strong earnings performance and stronger, as a result, bigger sequential drop when it
finally caught up to us in the second quarter in AFP. Coatings just has a longer supply chain, same with
aviation. And so we felt that and -- through the second quarter, and it's not going to come back quite as
fast in the third quarter on the AFP side.

I would also note, there's a couple of other differences. One, aviation is obviously not coming back as fast
when it comes to transportation, as we call it. And about half of our automotive coatings is refinish as
opposed to OEM. So AFP also doesn't see that sort of snapback in OEM production as much as AM because
the refinish, obviously, is, based on our customers' comments, is going to take a little longer to recover.
We do see traffic improving, and we expect a good solid recovery there, but it's not going to be as fast.

Matthew Porter DeYoe
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And so the $200 million number is pretty chunky. And in that light, I guess, absent an acquisition, is
it reasonable to think you can get back to that mid-$600 million EBIT range for A&FP by 2023? And if not,
what is a reasonable assumption for mid-cycle kind of earnings in that business?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Well, I think that as you look at AFP and earnings, first of all, we're not going to be giving forecast out to
2023 so -- but what I can say is that it's a great business, and the vast majority of the impact that this
business has faced since 2018, which is where I think about where earnings were in a stable environment
before the trade war started, compounded by a pandemic. The vast majority of our hit between now
and then was volume mix, right, less auto demand, B&C demand, a variety of different places where
we realized some impact on demand. And all that demand will come back with the market. And you got
to remember that mix is a huge part of the story in both AM and AFP. So when that volume dropped in
those -- in transportation or B&C or in consumer durables, that's the highest margins we have relative
to company average. So big impact on the way down last year, this year. And big impact on the mirror
image of it recovering. It's not just about volume recovery. That mix is a huge impact in driving value and
earnings and cash. So we expect that all to come back.

The other part, of course, is we're taking aggressive action on the cost side, right? So if we take $150
million out this year, make that structural into '21 and even add on another $100 million, that means
we've taken out $150 million relative to 2018, '19. That offset some of the spread and competitive
pressure, more than offset the spread and competitive pressure that we've seen in tires and adhesives.
So there's no reason for the earnings not to be able to come back for the company to a pretty substantial

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

level and get back. When volumes come back, we should get back to earnings being better than '19 or '18
when the volumes get back to that level.

Matthew Porter DeYoe
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. So message being just structural cost cuts plus volume recovery equals pressure on adhesives,
animal nutrition, businesses like that, maybe, give or take, plus volume growth from there?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We still leave out the mix part. A lot of the margin comes back with that mix, not just the volume.
That's -- we were trying to be very clear about that back to the Innovation day in 2018 to give you guys
some sense of the significance of mix, and it's a big part of our story and growth. Of course, it cuts the
other way when you have demand to come off.

Operator

We'll now take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Could you just help -- because there's been a couple of cost takeout programs, some temporary, some
permanent. If we just use Q2 as the base, how much comes out the rest of this year? And how much of
that's permanent versus temporary? Then how should we think about the sequencing in '21 and '22?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

So Duffy, as we think about this year, there's an additional $100 million of which we'll take out. And I'll
say, let's think about roughly half of that being more discretionary and half of it being structural as we
make momentum on the structural aspects here in the second half.

As we pivot into next year, I think I highlighted earlier that we're making decisions and taking actions
this year that will build roughly $50 million more of structural as we look at our asset footprint. And I'll
build that connection to what Mark highlighted, and we expect network optimization to be a major driver
of structural changes also in 2021. So that would basically, in that sense, keep you cost neutral year-
over-year as the discretionary goes away, and we replace it with structural. Then on top of that, we see
a pathway to an additional $50 million to $100 million in '21 and '22 to grow the additional increases and
deliver to the bottom line.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then if we look at your outlook, the $120 million, half of that back $60 million offset by $10
million, that would walk to an improvement of $50 million from Q2 to Q3. Is that the baseline that then we
should think about making adjustments for kind of the pricing trends and these cost takeouts? Or that's
your best view on kind of all in, incorporating everything, but just a way to get us to that $50 million
number? How can you parse those 2?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So the first step I would take is, to your point, the removal of the inventory and the impact of that in
Q2, partially offset by, I'll call it, the reduced maintenance and the slightly lower cost actions. That gets
us, I'll call it, to that 30 to 40 range as we think about structural cost and operational improvement. And
then on top of that would be, I'll call it, the variable margin improvement for volume growth that we have
sequentially.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

And we're encouraged, right? So we're seeing a good build in volume, right? So we saw 8% increase
in July -- I mean, June, compounded by another 4% in July. Order book so far, it's early August. But
the orders being similar to July and August is good compared to the normal seasonal decline you see
in August with Europe shutdowns and everything else. So, so far, off to a good start. But as we know
painfully well, it's a very unpredictable year, and we'll have to see how economies are impacted by the
resurgence and if there's things we don't see coming that mitigate demand.

Operator

We'll take Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

If I could follow up on that, really appreciate Slide 5. It gives us a good confidence level in terms of the
snapback and most impacted and the mixed impacted businesses. The resilient business looks like it is
down 10% year-over-year in July. In the text, you suggested a moderation in that area as consumers go
back to a new normal. Can you elaborate on that and perhaps offer thoughts on when that moderation
may be over and what you're seeing -- what your order books are seeing in August?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Sure, Frank. And thanks for the question. As far as the resilient markets go, obviously, some of those
markets had a real benefit from the people stocking up for COVID from grocery stores and things like
that or care chemicals, same type of product. So packaging care chemicals did well, and there were some
people buying some product ahead of time because they're worried about security of supply and want to
make sure they had enough inventory on hand to run their operations. So you saw a little bit of that going
on in some of these resilient markets.

The -- and really, what we see is demand coming off in some of those cases to what we call more normal
than sort of that additional buying. So that's part of the story in some of the sort of packaging consumer
markets that we all talk about and read about.

You also have to just remember, there is a seasonal trend down in volume from 2Q to 3Q in some markets
like ag, right? So some of this volume is coming off because those markets just naturally seasonally come
off sequentially from 2Q to 3Q. So you got those dynamics going on.

I wouldn't say there's anything more dramatic than that. The only other place I can think of is in medical.
We had a very high-value product in Advanced Materials where people were buying to make sure they
had inventory. Then elective surgeries, obviously, didn't play out as well. So some of the demand of those
products wasn't as great as they expected. And so there's some of that destocking going on.

But I think that from a timing point of view, Frank, it's this month. July, August is where people are sort
of adjusting their inventories. I don't think it extends through the rest of the year as far as some of that
volume adjustment goes, and we just sort of level back out to more normal in these end markets. But
we're not seeing a steady decline for a long period of time.

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

That's very helpful. And one of the key focuses of the "new better Eastman" is innovation. And these are
obviously not normal times, but what might be helpful when people talk about innovation is providing
some metrics around that in terms of the pace of progress and -- that you're making in that regard. Is
there any way that you can provide some quantification on the innovation front?

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Well, I think that the key metric we've been using with you in the past is one we'll continue to use in the
future, it's just not as useful at the moment, and that's the amount of new business revenue we close
from innovation products, right? So we have a very detailed tracking system with our digital tools on every
business we win, whether it was innovation-related or just good market segmentation strategy or just
transactional as well as why we lose every bit of business and what we can do about it.

And so we've been driving towards the $500 million number this year on new business from innovation,
and we are well on track to hit it, even with the trade war last year, where we delivered a very good
number. But obviously, this year, we're not going to get to that $500 million number when everyone has
been sheltered in place for a good period of time.

What is encouraging is we see people stay highly engaged. We've had a number of wins in the circular
economy, with like H&M, as I mentioned earlier, with the story we told in the prepared remarks around
Triton Renew in the hydration area with Nalgene, CamelBak and a bunch of other brands that are coming
on board with that recycled content offer that is so important to that customer segment that buys those
kind of hydration vessels.

So we are seeing good wins. But there's also a lot of places where virtually, we're still working with our
customers on coating additives, tire additives, odor-free adhesives, the next-generation of HUD and
acoustic interlayers that we're launching. There's activity in every place where people are still working
their innovation agenda, which is the only way you grow out of this and create your own growth. But we're
not going to have a -- we're not going to get to the $500 million in this context. But I do expect with the
activity we're seeing that we'll snap to it pretty quickly once we get into recovery mode and people can
start interacting with each other physically.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Your fluids business, I think, in 2019 was $460 million in revenues. How much of that is aviation fluid? And
how much is the aviation fluid down? Or where do you expect it to be down this year?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

So when I look at the fluids business, Jeff, I'd say it's about half and half. And clearly, the aviation side of
that portfolio, which is very high-margin business, is down dramatically, consistent with the miles flown of
airplanes. We're very sort of miles flown-driven with that business, and so it's going to recover slowly.

When it comes to the other side, though, I want to highlight the heat transfer fluids business is actually
doing great and actually going to deliver growth this year over last year. So one of the bright spots in the
2/3 of AFP in addition to care chemicals and pharma and packaging and even residential architectural
businesses, we got a lot of growth going on in a number of those businesses that's held in fairly well.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And secondly, you talked a lot about cost achievements. But as best as I can tell, SG&A was down $10
million in the quarter, which is about 6% and your sales were down, I don't know, 19. Why isn't SG&A
down more? Do you have an SG&A target in terms of the cost reductions?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

So Jeff, this is Willie. What I would highlight to you is if you think about the $150 million, we're going
to get roughly $100 million of that through the, I'll call it, manufacturing cost line is roughly $50 million
through the SGA/R&D lines.

As you've seen from Q1 to Q2, we've got some, I'll call it, variable compensation plans that are linked to
market-based. And with the recovery in the stock market that occurred in Q2, that basically offset the cost
savings within the quarter.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

How much was that? How much got offset?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

The way I think about that, roughly, it's in the -- I'll call it, the $10 million range.

Operator

Moving on to our next question, we will take David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Mark, can you discuss trends in raw materials, what you saw in Q2 and what you were expecting in the
back half of the year?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Dave, so the raw material trends, as you think about it, obviously, have come off in first quarter,
second quarter. And it's actually helpful to think about raw material trends back to the third quarter of
'18, right? So with the trade war, we saw price of our petrochemical derivatives that we're buying, for
example, come off a lot last year faster than oil did. So even though oil came off a lot this year, many of
the derivatives of oil had already come off pretty substantially. So a big part of the raw material trend
from all of this happened last year as opposed to this year. But we certainly have seen some benefits in
raw materials through the first half of this year.

As we look to the second half of the year, some raws, I think, are expected to stay relatively flat or
moderated, if you will, like paraxylene. But then you've got other places like you saw already in the second
quarter where propane moved up pretty dramatically and PGP didn't. So you've got things moving around
a lot of different directions.

We're not expecting a huge raw material headwind as we look at the back half of the year. Our forecasting
and plans assume that there's going to be some increase in some of those raw material costs, but we have
a bunch of plans in place like in Chemical Intermediates, we're moving prices up already consistent with
the raw material environment to stay track. But we think we're in good shape as far as spreads go when it
comes to the back half of the year.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Very good. And just lastly, just on -- do you see those capital allocation priorities for the back half of the
year, you did some buybacks in Q1 and Q2. Maybe discuss buybacks versus debt reduction as well as
other actions.

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Thanks, David, for the question. Obviously, first and foremost, focused on our strong and solid dividend
being the first priority. Also, as we've highlighted, we're expecting to pay back greater than $600 million.
Our net debt is down almost $200 million in the first half. We would expect that to grow to roughly greater
than $600 million in the back half. And we've paused the share buybacks until we meet those objectives.
And as we look into 2021 with growth and recovery, we'll reevaluate the pace at which we do that.

Operator

We will now take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Mark, can you discuss your intermediate business? Some products like glycols, you already had new
capacity before the pandemic started. And that was weak -- actually, this was weak also for you. So can
you just discuss what happened and then outlook for second half?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Sure. So obviously, in an environment where demand drops significantly relative to capacity available in
Chemical Intermediates products, the prices are going to follow raws, which is predominantly what we've
seen. The only place where we've really seen material spread compression due to competitive activities is
in this disconnect we saw in the second quarter between propane and propylene. And that really resulted
in some challenging raw material costs in the market that sets the price in the marketplace, which is PGP
obviously didn't go up and went down, and that was a tough combination. Fortunately, we've already seen
that sort of corrected back to a more normal relationship through July into the beginning of August here
where PGP has gone up dramatically, where propane has been sort of holding steady. So we feel good
about how that's corrected already into this quarter.

On the acetyl side, we've seen some compression, obviously, as oil prices and methanol, that sets the
price in the marketplace, comes off. We feel some of that compression relative to our cost structure, which
is principally based on coal.

So those are the places where we're seeing some of the pressure. But the big -- but spreads overall have
been relatively good. So that's not the story. As you can see in our revenue table, the bigger impact for us
has been volume as opposed to price on a first half basis, where you've really -- especially in the second
quarter, had that impact on COVID-related demand not being there and some of the export markets that
we would normally clear capacity not being as available when oil prices drop so much. And generally,
that's not a high-margin business for us, but still it has a significant impact on the volume and that
contribution margin that comes into pay for some of the integrated fixed cost to the overall complex. So
those are really the sort of the key stories there. I think they're all due to extraordinary circumstance in
the second quarter. A lot of this will continue into the third quarter, but no reason this won't recover as we
go into next year.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And my second question is on the charge that you took in tire additives. There was quite a large
charge of $128 million in that segment. What triggered that? Is that due to low utilization? And then what
happens when volumes come back next year?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Sure, P.J. This is Willie. So as you think about the impacts that COVID has had on the transportation
market more broadly as well as the impact on utilization, which you've highlighted, we had to assess the
value of certain businesses and specifically, tire additives. So the biggest piece of the impairment was
related to, I'll call it, the trade names of Crystex and [ Saflex ]. And that's related to a revenue outlook
as you look at valuing those on a royalty basis. So as the revenue outlook is much deteriorated at the

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

starting point of where we're valuing this as well as the rates being lower resulted in the impairment that
you see. Obviously, with accounting, once you write it off, you don't get to write it back on when things
recover.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

The great part of accounting, which is we dramatically improved the value of businesses like performance
films and interlayers from what we bought it, but you don't get to write up the asset values, but you have
to take the impairments wherever these kind of issues occur.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Right. You are not alone in taking these charges this quarter. But does that mean that margins look better
next year when volumes come back?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

No. P.J., I think as we've highlighted through this, if you take roughly half of the $140 million across
the company, $70 million of that was due to the, I'll call it, utilization impacts across the company, and
that will result in a tailwind at even flat volumes. So as we think about growing volumes next year in a
recovery, holding costs flat, this will result in good momentum as we go into 2021.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

And specific to tires, we're actually seeing a strong recovery in volumes into the third quarter. So that's
one of the -- when you look at that line on Page 5 about volume recovering back, a big part of the
snapback in that volume is actually in tires. The competitive dynamics are still there, so pricing is going to
improve for some period of time, but the volume is really starting to come back.

Operator

We'll now take our next question from John Roberts from UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

It used to be that cig tow held up well in a recession because people smoke more when they're under
stress. It was down a little in the third quarter. It looks like the outlook is to be down a little bit further.
How comfortable are you that this is just order patterns or that maybe there's something else going on
here?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

So we don't have any evidence that there's something else going on, John. As you said, it was incredibly
stable in the '08, '09 recession. There is a general trend where the market is always sort of declining in
that 2% to 3% range, as we've said in the past. And we expect that to be the story this year.

There's a lot of different stories out there at the moment that are all sort of breaking in the last couple
of weeks where different cigarette companies are having -- doing well and others are not doing well.
So you really have to get into the details of what's going behind each of those companies. But overall,
when we put it all together, we think market demand is sort of decline in that 2% to 3% range outside of
China. China and the data suggests it's stable to sort of up maybe 2%, which is about half of the cigarette
demand in the world. So that's all sort of put together in the market outlook.

When it comes to customer buying patterns, as we have discussed many times in the past, it is a bit, as
we called it, chunky. And what we saw is good demand, obviously, in the first quarter as well as good

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

demand in the second quarter. Some of that was buying some incremental tow for security reasons with
all the uncertainty of COVID. And that's why we expect volumes to trend off modestly as we go into the
third quarter. But overall, we still view this as tow very stable and especially with the cost actions we're
taking at the earnings and cash flow level.

On the textile side, of course, which has been growing to offset some of this underlying market decline on
tow, we're not going to get that this year with the textile market being so challenged. It doesn't give us
any concern for the long term. I think textiles is an incredibly exciting opportunity for us, especially now
with the circular economy, as I answered in the first question. Really, see a lot of opportunity to grow in
the target markets, right? So if you think about women's wear, down about 15% year-over-year in the
first half of the year versus a market of 30%. As I said, when we look at the forecast for this quarter,
probably a 40% sequential improvement off of the second quarter in women's wear. The problem right
now is some of the traditional markets that we've gone into, like suit linings, obviously, not much demand
for those right now in this environment as everyone is working virtually. And so that's offsetting some of
this. But that will correct itself, and we expect good growth out of that in next year as a way to continue
filling the assets and levering the integrated complex up.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then are you having any issues getting recycled material for your gasification process? And is pricing
for green material an issue now that virgin raw material is cheaper or virgin materials are cheaper?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So it is a very complicated market when you look at recycled content, and we are doing our best to
segment it. What's great about our strategy is molecular recycling does not require high-quality recycled
content. We can use which product that has no other use. So we can take carpet, we can take textiles,
we can take plastic that cannot be used in mechanical recycling and grind it up and use it in the gas part
and we can grind it up and use it in the methanolysis plant for polyester recycling. So we don't have to
compete against that high-quality stuff that is -- and the price there is going up a lot, significantly higher
than virgin PET in Europe right now. Last year, almost 60%. But we don't have to compete with that. I
mean there's a little bit of that we'll buy in the beginning, but we can really access what is truly has no
alternative use that's going into landfill.

Operator

We'll now take our next question from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just curious how you think about the fourth quarter. And I know it's a lot of variables there, but can
you get sequential improvement in earnings again? And you do have cost savings pick up some of the
inventory reductions. But clearly, the question is, what you're hearing from your customers. Do we
see a normal seasonal downtick in the fourth quarter? Is it possible that we can continue to improve
sequentially? So just curious your thoughts there on the fourth quarter.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think that the fourth quarter is awfully difficult to call at this point with all the uncertainties of what's
going to happen with COVID, the election, et cetera. But what I do think will happen is there'll be some
markets where you'll have just normal seasonal decline demand like construction activity in the winter.
But I don't think you're going to see the same kind of inventory destocking that you've seen in the past
because we've all been doing it pretty aggressively in the second quarter and the third quarter. So I
think you avoid that relative to what happened last year. And if people are looking at next year and the

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

economy is looking positive, you're going to actually probably having some people start building inventory
to serve that demand as they go into the first quarter.

So I couldn't pretend to know how all those are going to balance together. I know that we've managed our
inventory aggressively in the second and third quarter, so we're not going to be doing much destocking
in the fourth quarter. So that's certainly going to help not just where we go with inventory, but also asset
utilization will continue to get better as we go from 3Q to 4Q.

So I think we'll have some benefits on the cost structure side, both in asset utilization getting better as
well as the cost actions we're taking. Demand could be a bit better than you might think. So as we look
at it as a sequential improvement from 3Q, I'm not sure we can get all way back to 4Q of last year, but
somewhere in that range seems feasible. But I got to emphasize, we're not giving guidance for the year
for a reason, which is we have no idea what fourth quarter is going to look like at this stage. No one does.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Understood. And then one quick one on the inventory reduction, $140 million number that was reduced by
EBIT. I think you said that you got $70 million or half back on flat volume. What volume level do you get it
all back in '21?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So the way I think about that, Mike, is, basically, you've got to get back to 2019 levels, as we think
about fully absorbing all of that. Because at the end of the day, what we did is we pulled fixed costs from
2019 inventory levels into the P&L here in 2020 as we reduced it.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

And you use the $140 million number for the year-over-year number when you think about '21 versus '20,
not the $120 million sequential from 1Q to 2Q. So it's about half of that $140 million. You definitely get
back with just flat volumes, and then the rest is upside with volume growth.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Alex Yefremov from KeyBanc.

Aleksey V. Yefremov
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Based on what you saw in July and early August, so how are volumes tracking for the third quarter versus
second quarter on a year-over-year basis for the company overall?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

I think, as we had highlighted earlier, we've got good momentum. We had 8% growth from June to July.
And we continue to see things in August to be roughly flat with July, which is, I would say, positive overall.
Normally, we would see a seasonal decline in the August in Europe, but continued good momentum.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

We certainly see volumes for the third quarter and second quarter.

Aleksey V. Yefremov
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Right. It's just hard to do the math because the base effect is so difficult in the second quarter. So maybe
I'll try a little bit differently.

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

In your monthly volume slide, it appears to show that you were about down 12% year-over-year in July
for corporate average. So that seems to be roughly in line with minus 13% that you posted for the second
quarter on average. Am I looking at this correctly? And do you expect on a year-over-year basis, August
and September to be better from a volume perspective than July?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Alex, I think that's a reasonable assumption based on the momentum that we see.

Gregory A. Riddle
Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications

Let's make the next question the last one, please.

Operator

Sure, and that comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Can you help on 2 things? In the markets where you are outgrowing the end market because of innovation
and better market relevance, should we expect a slingshot effect where volumes come back, you should
have a multiplier on that? Or should we see the spread as being roughly stable in the recovery because it
makes quite a difference in how we think about operating leverage over the next 2, 3 years?

And secondly, to the extent that you're -- the structural realignments that you're doing, to what extent
should this be viewed as establishing a playbook so that future acquisitions will be integrated with a higher
level of synergies upfront? Or is this a kind of one-off geometry and we shouldn't read beyond that?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

I'll take the first part and let you take the second part, Willie. On the revenue side, look, we expect
recovery. And as I said, the mix hit that we took on the way down was our highest value segments. And
the innovation we're driving also tend to have margins way above company average in all the different
products we've launched. So as you see volume recovery come, that mix leverage is pretty significant.
You'll see that in Advanced Materials this quarter, and you've seen it for years in Advanced Materials. So
we expect a lot of pretty high incremental margins in a recovery scenario, especially with the cost actions
we've taken. So you don't have any fixed cost headwinds offsetting that variable margin growth. And
you've got this utilization benefit we've identified.

So I think we're feeling pretty good about how the earnings can come back in that scenario, but it requires
economies recover. We're not about to try and tell you when we think we're going to get back to '19 or '18
levels in this economy. But we certainly expect, given what we know today, '21 to be better than '20 when
it comes to economy and demand.

And innovation, I think, is still key. You've got markets where we've had incredible success in innovation
like performance films, where we set a record in revenue in June in this very down automotive market,
heads-up display, Tritan, the circular economy, new coalescence and architecture, et cetera. We have a
lot going on across all 3 segments, including fibers, where we're creating our own growth despite the
economic circumstances.

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

And on the synergy question, what I would say, we were very pleased with the synergy levels that we
achieved on our previous acquisitions, with above, I'll call it, industry benchmark levels. But what I would
say is, obviously, we've gone through a trade war. We're going through a pandemic. And also on the digital

apply those as we move forward and as we think about future acquisitions and portfolio changes.
