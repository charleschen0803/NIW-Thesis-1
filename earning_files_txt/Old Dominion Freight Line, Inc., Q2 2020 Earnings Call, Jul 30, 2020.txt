At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and
Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir.

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam
Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team
delivered solid financial and operating results for the second quarter despite the operating challenges we
faced with the economy. Although our revenue declined 15.5%, we were pleased to improve our operating
ratio to a quarterly record of 77.8%. We accomplished this by focusing on improving our yield, managing
our variable cost and controlling our discretionary spending.

Our yield management process has strengthened the quality of our revenue and profitability over the
long term. Through this process, we manage profitability on an account-by-account basis. We believe
this approach is consistent and fair for our customers. It is also supportive of our ongoing investments
in capacity and technology while helping offset cost inflation. We believe customers appreciate the
consistency of this approach as they know what to expect from us each year. Providing superior service
at a fair price is our value proposition, which is critical to our long-term customer relationships. Our team
is relentless in its commitment to providing the very best levels of service to our customers regardless
of the economic environment. While we continued with many operating challenges in the second quarter,
including the 16.6% decrease in shipments per day, we produced a new company quarterly claims ratio
of 0.1% while also improving productivity. There are many components of our industry-leading service.
And based on customer feedback, we believe the gap between us and our competition has widened in the
current environment.

It has historically become a common practice in our industry to focus primarily on cost in a recessionary
environment. This narrow focus generally leads to customer service failures, which is why we are so
committed to the service standards that support our revenue quality. We have long believed that this
creates a competitive advantage for us in our industry, and it is especially critical now because the
importance of high-quality and dependable service seems to have recently increased for many of our
customers. As evidence to this trend, we have been awarded new business in the past few months from
customers that have historically provided lower rates rather than overall value. This trend not only leads
us to believe that many of our competitors are remaining relatively disciplined with their pricing, but it is
also encouraging for future market share opportunities.

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

While the quality of our revenue is critical to our operating ratio, appropriately managing our cost is just
as important. Minimizing our cost inflation on a per shipment basis is an ongoing process based largely
on the productivity of our employees as salaries, wages and benefits represent our largest expense. As
a result of operating efficiencies and improved productivity, we are able to improve our direct cost as a
percent of revenue during the second quarter. The unfortunate reality of the sudden significant reduction
in revenue that occurred in April 2020 was an adjustment to our workforce to balance our employee count
with available work. Believing that the economy could recover quickly, we implemented an employee
furlough program that initially resulted in 15.5% year-over-year decrease in our full-time employees in
April. While the economy is still recovering, our volumes increased sequentially in May and June, and we
are cautiously optimistic that this accelerating trend can continue. Many of our furloughed employees have
been able to return to work as a result of this improvement. We took various other measures to reduce
operating expenses while also controlling discretionary spending to reduce overhead cost. In addition,
circumstances associated with the COVID-19 environment created certain cost savings that are expected
to diminish in future periods such as a reduction in group health and dental claims, travel and customer
entertainment.

Second quarter of 2020 was one of the most difficult periods I have experienced in my career, and I am
especially proud of our team's ability to respond quickly and manage our operations in this environment.
I think the quality of our results shows that our business model works in both good times and bad. While
certain challenges will likely continue until the economy recovers, we believe there will be long-term
changes to supply chains that should create opportunities for the LTL industry. With our industry-leading
service, our unmatched long-term investments in service center capacity and the dedication of our OD
family of employees, I'm confident that we are in a better position than any other carrier in the industry
to respond to increased customer needs for LTL services. As a result, I am also confident in our ability to
continue our long-term producing profitable growth while increasing shareholder value.

Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our quarter financial results in greater
detail.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $896.2
million, which was a 15.5% decrease from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 10 basis points
to 77.8%, which contributed to our earnings per diluted share of $1.25 for the quarter. Our revenue
results for the second quarter reflect the 12.1% decrease in LTL tons and a 3.8% decrease in LTL revenue
per hundredweight. The decrease in the average price of diesel fuel reduced our fuel surcharges, which
had an impact on our top line revenue as well as our yield. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per
hundredweight decreased 0.5%, due primarily to the significant increase in weight per shipment. Multiple
factors can have a significant impact on revenue per hundredweight, most notably being the average
length of haul and weight per shipment. Changes in revenue per hundredweight are also not linear with
respect to changes in our mix. As a result, revenue per hundredweight is a tough measure to evaluate
when the mix of our business changes so significantly like it did during the second quarter. While the
change in revenue per hundredweight might suggest otherwise, we continue to negotiate rate increases
during the second quarter and believe underlying pricing trends remained relatively consistent.

We believe revenue per shipment is a better measurement as we focus internally on maintaining a positive
spread between our revenue and cost per shipment. The 4.9% increase in revenue per shipment excluding
fuel surcharges for the second quarter was relatively consistent with the change in the first quarter 2020
as well as our long-term trends. With respect to our revenue trend during the second quarter, revenue per
day on a year-over-year basis was down 19.3% in April, but then sequentially improved in the remaining
months of the quarter. Average revenue per day in June, for example, was down 11.4% as compared to
June 2019.

Our changes -- our change in volumes also followed a similar pattern. On a sequential basis, LTL
shipments per day decreased 15.7% in April as compared to March 2020. Shipments per day then
increased 9.7% from April to May and increased 7.1% from May to June. The sequential acceleration in

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

shipments and revenue has continued into July. With only a couple of days remaining in the month, our
current revenue per day is trending down approximately 3%, plus or minus. As usual, we will provide the
actual revenue-related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q.

Our operating ratio improved 10 basis points to 77.8%, which was a record for us despite the significant
decline in revenue. More than 2/3 of our costs are variable or semi-variable, and our team was effective
in matching these costs with the change in revenue while also controlling our discretionary spending.
Our operations team also did an outstanding job with improving efficiencies during the quarter. We have
historically improved productivity during recessionary environments. And from experience, we believe
we can maintain much of this productivity once we return to a growth environment. While the loss of
revenues certainly had a deleveraging effect on our fixed cost, the improvement in our direct cost as a
percent of revenue more than offset the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue.

Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $312.2 million and $516.2 million for the second quarter
and first 6 months of 2020, respectively, while capital expenditures were $67.9 million and $120.1 million
for the same period. We returned $146.1 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter
and $342.7 million for the first half of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total included $306.8
million of share repurchases and 34 -- $35.9 million in cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the
second quarter 2020 was 25.7% as compared to 26.1% in the second quarter of 2019. We currently
expect our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter of 2020.
This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions
at this time.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.

Jack Lawrence Atkins
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Thanks, Jack.

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Jack Lawrence Atkins
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So Adam, if I could maybe start going back to your commentary on the pricing environment for a moment
because I think in your prepared comments, you said that the pricing environment remains relatively
consistent with what you've been seeing over the past several quarters with regard to the second quarter.
We have heard some anecdotes on public conference calls here, though, over the last couple of days that
maybe there's been a little bit of an acceleration in pricing in the third quarter. And I'm just curious if you
could maybe talk about, have you noticed a shift in tone around pricing in discussions with your customers
over the past several weeks, maybe a couple of months?

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

I don't know that we've heard a shift in tone at any point recently. Certainly, our approach is always one
of consistency, and I think that's what our customers appreciate. They know what to expect out of us, and
we're pretty disciplined in that respect to focus on what our cost inflation is every year and the pricing
and the operating ratio on an account-by-account basis that we try to target with our customer accounts
as well. So for us, we just continue on with our consistent approach, and we've been getting increases
all year long. And in some cases, in the early part of this quarter, that may have impacted some of our
volumes as well. But like we mentioned earlier, we are starting to see some volumes coming back to us.
That's been an encouraging trend in some of the business that we may have lost back in April, some of
that business coming back to us just based on the service that they received from the other carrier that
they might have switched to. And when they look and think about the total value equation, they didn't feel
like they were getting the value there and they came back to us. So that's what we'll continue to focus on.
It's just our consistent long-term type of approach to offset cost inflation that's worked for us, and that's
what we intend to continue.

Jack Lawrence Atkins
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then, I guess, for my follow-up question, just kind of thinking about
the operating ratio here. I guess normal seasonality 2Q to 3Q would call for some modest deterioration,
but your commentary around revenue trends per day in July would indicate that maybe revenue is
trending better sequentially. But there may be -- or there's some temporary costs that are getting layered
back in now that the business is stabilizing. So Adam, can you maybe help us kind of think through those
puts and takes and how that relates to OR progression as we move into the third quarter?

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Sure. Yes. It typically is about a 50 basis point deterioration from the second to the third. But in a normal
environment, which clearly we aren't in, we would have seen the second quarter revenue up about 10%
over the first quarter, and then third quarter increases slightly typically from the second quarter. So you
get, historically speaking, most of your operating ratio improvement there in the second quarter on a
sequential basis, that is. And so in this environment, if we can keep this accelerating revenue trend,
then some of the leverage that we lost, particularly in overhead and within that overhead category on
the depreciation, we lost quite a few basis points there from the first to the second quarter. So if we can
continue this revenue trend and revenue can meet or exceed where we were in the first quarter, then
certainly that depreciation, in particular, unwinds and there should be some other costs that would unwind
along with that. And we fully expect to try to maintain the productivity. That should continue. Certainly,
there will be some costs that will be coming back online in the third quarter. But given all those factors,
we certainly think that we should definitely be able to beat what that long-term deterioration is, simply, if
nothing else, just the improvement that we should have the leverage on the depreciation.

Operator

We'll now take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Todd Clark Fowler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Greg, in your prepared remarks, when you talked about the quality of revenue and kind of improving that
here in this quarter, I would think that that's maybe a little bit more challenging in a negative tonnage
environment. And maybe in the stronger tonnage environment where you can pick and choose the freight
that you want, it's a little bit easier. So can you expand on that comment and essentially what you're
focused on and what you're able to do from a quality of revenue standpoint right now?

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Sure, Todd. No doubt, in this deteriorating environment that we just came through, we did see customers
more likely to put out bids and rebid the freight and that kind of thing, and that was definitely a challenge
for us. As Adam mentioned, some of our -- we did lose some business in that process, but we gained
some from others. And fortunately, in other cases, we are gaining back some revenue that we lost earlier
because of -- that couldn't meet the service -- same service standards that they had with us. So it's ever
a challenge. That's our business. And there's always -- you win some, you lose some. But fortunately, at
the end of the day, you hope that your service outshines -- the value outshines your competitor. So far,
so good. We are regaining some of the business that we lost. That's a good thing. We've taken on some
new additional business of late. So I think there have been some opportunities that did open up for us as
the quarter went on. And as we roll into the third quarter so far in the month of July, it's definitely looking
stronger.

Todd Clark Fowler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. So Greg, just kind of comment that -- yes. So some of the business that you lost early in the
quarter maybe was more some price-sensitive business and it didn't fit as well in the network or wasn't as
profitable and so it's okay to see that go away, but you're starting to see some of that come back now.

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

We are, coming back at our price.

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Got you. Okay. That makes sense.

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Coming back at our price. We obviously lost it to a lower price, but that doesn't mean the customer got a
greater value. And it came back because of the value we provide.

Todd Clark Fowler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Understood. Okay. And then just for my follow-up, Adam, do you have any color or anything you can share
on the increase in the weight per shipment, the up 5% and kind of the level that you're at right now?
Is that something that you think is sustainable? Do you see that as a shift in the business that you're
handling? Or is that indication of improvement in underlying economic activity?

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Sure. The weight per shipment has certainly been a wild swing since the trend that we had back in
January and February right when things started changing. Our weight per shipment increased above 1,600
pounds in March. It reached a peak of 1,677 pounds in April, and then it started working its way back to
sort of more of an average that we've seen over the longer term of about 1,600 pounds. It was right at
1,600 pounds in June. Much of that was in the early stages of some of these stay-at-home orders. We
had more national account business that remained open. National account business typically has a higher
weight per shipment than our smaller mom-and-pop type of accounts. And so now some of those smaller
accounts are starting to come back online, but we're still getting, I would say, more business from our
national accounts. They continue to be strong. And when you think about some of the companies that are
performing well in this environment and that have increased demand, it's a lot of those bigger on the retail
side, some of those bigger retailers, and their weight per shipment just continues to be much heavier.
So it's a little bit different mix, but we're happy to see it kind of coming back to the 1,600-pound range.
And I would expect that as more of the smaller accounts come back online, it could drift down a little bit
lower, but that 1,600-pound range has continued into July at this point. And so if we can see that stay
around that sort of level for the time being, that would be a good trend and contributor, too, to the overall
revenue per shipment that we're seeing.

Operator

Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Maybe, Adam, I can hit back on pricing a little bit. Can you give us maybe a little bit more specific sort of
commentary where contracts are kind of being reset as you get through the quarter? I don't know how
much activity was actually happening in 2Q, but can you give us just sort of a rough sense? It sounds like
it's been consistent with what you've seen, but kind of curious if there's incremental color you can add.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Yes. We kind of stopped talking about the -- our average contract renewals. And some of that, we hear
others kind of give the same commentary, and be it average increases in contracts or general rate
increases, never seem to fully reconcile to even factoring in changes in weight per shipment to what some
of the others might report as their revenue per hundredweight. And so I would just say that looking at
revenue per shipment and how that's trended, that's more in line with what we've been able to achieve
with increases kind of on average. And typically, that's been between 4% to 5%, and that somewhat falls
in alignment as well. We have a general rate increase that went into effect earlier this year. That was at
4.9%, and that's generally the target that we have for our contracts as well. So in -- that ballpark is really
what our long-term trend has been. It's what we continue to target, and it's what we've been able to

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

achieve this year. So it's been a good thing. Obviously, the long-term success of that program, managing
our cost, where there is a positive delta between our revenue per shipment and our cost per shipment,
managing those 2 factors has really been a key contributor to our long-term operating ratio improvement.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe when you think about volume opportunities
and just sort of how you want to manage your network in the context of a potentially sort of tightening
truckload cycle, when we've seen these in the past, there's been spillover into the LTL market. You guys
have always been disciplined about what kind of business you want to take on in those kinds of tight
markets because maybe not all of it is what you really do want in the network. But I don't know if it's
too early to see any indications of that or maybe talk a bit about how you're thinking about handling
that as you move forward, but just kind of curious what your expectations are potentially around that
truckload opportunity as things kind of move in. So maybe it would be kind of larger LTL, smaller LTL type
of opportunities going forward.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Yes. I mean, certainly, that creates some opportunities for us. And it really just gets back to our sales
team, their discussions and ongoing conversations with our customers, what their customer needs are and
if they've got freight that needs to be moved and we can help out. Obviously, volumes are off for us. Even
though they're getting better, they're still down on a year-over-year basis. So we've got capacity and are
ready to help our customers when we can. If that's a heavier-weighted shipment that might have moved
by truckload, there's no such thing as bad freight, there's just poorly priced freight. So if we understand
all the shipment characteristics and have got good pricing practices in place, which I believe we do, then
certainly, we're willing to handle about any shipment that a customer would want us to. The best thing
that we would see, the changing trends in the truckload world would be that if the truckload rates continue
to increase, typically, that has the effect of increasing many of our competitors' cost structure. Many of
our competitors use outsourced truckload for purchase transportation. So if our competitors now have
got some unexpected cost inflation, that's going to put more rate pressure for themselves to go back and
increase their rates. Typically, that has the effect, too, of moving normal LTL business our way. So multiple
opportunities, I think, both from a direct and indirect basis for the truckload world improving.

Operator

Our next question will be from Allison Landry with Crédit Suisse.

Allison M. Landry
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I was just wondering, Adam, could you give us a sense of how much the lower group health and dental
expenses were in Q2? I know that you said some of that may come back in Q3 and in Q4. So just
wondering if there's any color you could provide there to help us with modeling.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Yes. I mean, certainly, that was a benefit. Our overall fringe rate, though, in the second quarter was
33.6%, and we typically target about 34%. I think that at the beginning of the year, that was something
that we talked about. And so just the change in -- we were at 34% in the second quarter of last year.
So those numbers are pretty comparable from period to period, but probably resulted, I would just say,
fringes overall in a couple of million dollars, $1 million to $2 million of savings comparing what we had
this quarter versus the -- what the fringe rate was in 2Q of '19. So a little savings there. There's always
sort of puts and takes in that fringe type of number. Certainly, we were fortunate, I guess, if you will, to
see that group health and dental was down and some of the others were up. And on a sequential basis,
simply having more income in the second quarter than the first, that drives things like our 401(k) match
that we give to our employees, and it's things like that, continuously improving our benefits overall and

giving more paid time off and doing some of these things that continue to motivate our employees and we
think helps drive the bottom line success as well. They understand the success they drive for the company
they get rewarded for. So we think that's been a very motivational tool over the years for our employees
and helping our culture.

Allison M. Landry
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then I'm sorry if I missed this earlier in the remarks, but could you give us the
productivity metrics in the quarter? I think you said sort of they improved across the board, but some
of the specific KPIs? And then if you could give us a sense of where you are with furloughs and just your
overall view on how to think about head count levels in the second half.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Sure. Yes. We didn't give the specifics on the productivity, but we saw really strong performance. Our
platform shipments per hour for the quarter improved 7.1%. Our P&D shipments per hour improved 4.2%.
Even our line-haul laden load average did improve 0.8%, and we talked about before that not all costs
are variable. And running this line-haul network that we have, serving 238 service centers, there's a fixed
element of running that cost. But I was really pleased with all the level of productivity that we had. And
as such, when you look at our productive labor cost on a per shipment basis -- so again, getting things
back to how they are per shipment. Overall, they were right at about 3% cost inflation, and that's pretty
much in line with the wage increase that we gave last year. So we had an improvement. We don't give this
level of detail, but our P&D and our dock cost per shipment were essentially both flat, and then we had
a little inflation overall in line-haul. But that would be expected based on that trend. And I would say, an
update on the head count, overall in June, we were down -- the full-time employees were down 10.5%
just comparing June of this year to June of last year. So we brought many people back from the furlough
program. If you look and compare April to June, we've -- the head count is up about 4.5% overall. But if
you compare kind of where we are today to where we were in March, we're down about 1,400 positions
overall, which is about 7%. And based on where we are, our shipments per day should be higher in July
than they were back in March. So that was kind of what we talked about in the prepared remarks that,
unfortunately, when we go through an environment like this, we've made adjustments like we have, but
you find areas of productivity when each department leader is going through evaluating their cost. And
costs don't save themselves. It takes action and a plan. We've gone through and we figured out ways
to be able to do more with less, and I think that's what we're seeing now. But if our accelerating trends
continue, we certainly will have to continue to bring back some more employees. We fully expect and we
like that because it'd go hand-in-hand with the increase in volumes. But I think overall, when you look
at sort of the level of head count with the volumes, those should come back in alignment and eventually
show some improvement there.

Our next question will come from Jason Seidl with Cowen.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to talk a little bit about the residential deliveries. One of your competitors basically said they saw
an uptick, almost a doubling in the percentage. It still ticked down a little bit for them, but definitely above
the prior year. Can you talk a little bit about your experience with the residential market and how you see
the margins there for OD?

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Jason, we do not measure the number of residential deliveries that we had, and I didn't anecdotally hear
a whole lot of commentary about additional residentials. I know we had a few more in one segment of our
business, but I don't think we saw a significant uptick in residentials at all.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And would you say that the margins on your residential deliveries are equal to or better than the
regular margins?

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

We -- Jason, all of our accounts, we price them based on the cost that those accounts require, and we
price them accordingly. We price in the residential stop. There is a fee for that, as you know. We price
them accordingly based on the cost. So I think that's an account-by-account basis, but they are not
necessarily better or worse than the other business.

Jason H. Seidl
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That makes sense. And my follow-up is going to be on any potential acquisitions, any outlook. I know in
the past, you've mentioned your desire to potentially add some, I guess, business lines that would be
complementary to your LTL operations. We've also been hearing in the marketplace that the appetite for
acquisitions has picked back up a little bit from sort of the start of COVID. Wondering what your thoughts
on that going forward are.

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

At this point in time, Jason, no. We -- maybe we have somewhat of an appetite for an acquisition. I just --
I don't know who that is or exactly what that is. At this point, we're not looking at anything currently. Well,
we always have opportunities cross the desk, and we evaluate those as they come along. But currently, at
this time, we're not looking at anything in particular.

We'll now take a question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Adam, just on the 3% drop in rev per day in July, I missed it if you said so. But directionally, can you
talk about sort of the tonnage weight and yield trends within that, just directionally?

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Yes. A lot of that is -- it's mainly on the tonnage. And so you've got some of the yield, if you will,
sequentially that's moving up a little bit. But yes, we're continuing to see acceleration essentially on
the shipments and the times, and our yields continue to perform as well. But overall, it's good to see.
Obviously, that coming back closer to kind of where we were last year after going through the second
quarter and revenue being down double digits certainly feels a lot easier to manage and should produce
a lot more opportunities once we can get back to revenue being flat and eventually get back to a growth
environment, which is what we're more used to.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. So you're seeing the biggest revenue drop
in a decade, and you put up record margins. And by the way, it's not just you. We've seen this from some
of the other trucking companies this quarter. I'm just trying to understand how this is happening. You
mentioned a little bit of that health care cost. Do you think there's anything else unusual from a cost
standpoint, either fuel or lack of congestion or something else? I guess, ultimately, what I'm trying to
figure out is, next year, we're going to have good volume and revenue growth, hopefully. So should we

12

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

be thinking about strong incremental margins next year and getting to a mid-70s operating ratio? Or is
next year a year we get the revenue but maybe we don't get the incremental margin because there was
something that was just unusual helping in this environment? I guess that's the question.

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me say this. There were certainly some things that worked in our favor, not just ours but probably
the entire industry. Obviously, the traffic congestion was a lot less than it has been in the past. We did
save some money on the group health and had less spend on customer entertainment, some marketing
areas. In marketing, we're down from what we normally see. So there were some things that did save
some short-term type cost. But I'll say this, when this thing first started, we sat down as a management
team and we made a plan, and the one thing that I made very clear was we had to execute on that plan.
We didn't dilly-dally. We executed, and I think everybody took it very serious what they had to do. Our big
concern was continue to give the type of service that our customers are used to. We didn't cut anything
from that standpoint. We were very pointed and determined in our efforts to continue those -- all the
different service measures that we have and to continue to improve on those. We did it, and I think you
saw it in reduced claims. And our on-time percentage was still above 99%. So we did not slack off in any
way, shape or form from that standpoint. I think our customers accepted it. While we may have saw some
business walk for price early in the quarter, they started to come back later in the quarter as they realized
they weren't getting what they were used to with OD. So yes, there were some areas where we did
save some money, but we did a lot of the things that we had to do to help ourselves from a productivity
standpoint. So yes, some good. Certainly, we made a lot of things happen that we're very proud of at this
point in time.

As far as next year, certainly, we think that there is an opportunity to continue to have the same type of
productivity levels of improvement that we had in the second quarter. You can measure it from there. We
certainly expect our revenue growth to come back. Not exactly sure where that's going at this point in
time, who knows where the economy is going to go. We're facing a lot of things later this year and on into
next year with the election year and all that. We got a lot of challenges ahead, but we do definitely think
if we have some growth, that we can drive the OR lower. I don't think there's any doubt about it. And as
we've said before, we think we can manage through the good times and the bad. I think we've proven that
in the past, and I don't think there's any doubt, we will continue to prove that into the future.

We'll take our next question from David Ross with Stifel.

David Griffith Ross
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Just to follow up on that a little bit specifically as it relates to fuel. It seemed to be a tailwind for a lot of
carriers in the quarter. What was the impact, Adam, of the sharp drop that we saw from March to April in
fuel? Was it a good guy in the quarter? Significant?

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Dave, we've tried to structure our fuel tables to really where they don't really impact us on the bottom
line too much one way or the other. We got hurt a little bit a few years ago back in '16 and really didn't
have the lower end of our table where it needed to be. But we addressed that throughout the year and
then fully addressed it when the next GRI came about. So net-net, we tried to do some back of the
envelope type of calculations and believe it was fairly minimal. On a net basis, maybe overall, slightly
good. But the hard thing to try to negotiate and do these back of the envelope type of calculations is the
simple fact that fuel is just another element that's -- of pricing that's negotiated with our customers. So
if you got somebody that wants to make -- in this environment, look like their base rates were better,
that they didn't take an increase but we got an overall improvement in our fuel contribution or some
other type of element that really gives us the same level of revenue, then that just becomes a tool to
negotiate with. So it's really hard to try to make that comparison, but I'll say that the change on the cost

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

side -- I mean, obviously, it hit us hard on the top line. And then on the cost side, you see the change
and the improvement in the operating supplies and expenses. A big driver of that, not all of it, but a big
driver of that was the decrease in fuel. Typically, when fuel changes so significantly like that in a period,
you'd see the corresponding increase in your labor cost. And I think that hit kind of masked the overall
improvement, if you will, to keep our labor cost essentially flat like we did in this environment, with the
surcharge revenue being down so much. It was really impressive to me. I thought -- and that was the
biggest driver in our ability to improve the operating ratio, was what we were able to accomplish with all
of those labor cost as a percent of revenue.

David Griffith Ross
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And then another thing impressive has been the insurance and claims line item. It's been remarkably low
and steady in a tough insurance market for a long time. Can you talk a little bit more, either Adam or
Greg, about what really makes it a nonissue for you guys and not something that investors had to worry
about on the expense surprise side?

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

So for -- there's 2 elements that go into that insurance and claims line. That's our auto accidents. We
call it BIPD, bodily injury and property damage, in the cargo claims. And fortunately for us, our cargo
claims has consistently improved and almost nonexistent at a record 0.1% for this most recent quarter. So
that element has come a long way. You go back to the recession when I felt like we really differentiated
ourselves -- the great recession of '09, when we really differentiated ourselves from our competition. We
were above 1%. And we believe that that's where the industry average is likely, still north of 1% from the
data that we get and feedback from customers. So that's a good thing, that we've consistently driven that
claims ratio down.

I mean on the auto side, certainly this year, and it's in the second quarter, like most of the other carriers,
we're facing significant inflation with our insurance rates. But we've been very fortunate in the fact that
all the investment in new equipment and safety systems and training and so forth that we've made over
the years, those all have accident mitigation type of tools with them in our tractors now, and then just
continuous training on the dock and other places that we've done. And so there's an element that goes
into this line. There's an element in our salaries, wages and benefits that goes hand-in-hand with those
safety programs. And we've continued to see workers' comp, which is in the benefit line, improvement
there. And so I think it's just a -- it's been a focus of our company to have safety programs in place and
to always be trying to continuously improve those, and I think we've seen a big benefit. The insurance line
is one, but there's a hidden one that's in the fringe benefit line on the workers' comp that goes hand-in-
hand. So if we can just keep our accident frequency ratios low, those continue to improve and try to keep
severity low as well, and some of that is mitigated by the investment in technology on the tractors, then
hopefully we can keep that line item consistent like it has been in that 1% to 1.2% type of range.

Our next question will come from Ari Rosa with Bank of America.

Ariel Luis Rosa
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So Greg, you mentioned in your opening remarks some lasting changes to supply chains as a result of
the pandemic, which you think could benefit LTL carriers. I was just hoping you could elaborate on that
a little bit and get into some details, and then maybe, in the process, touch on what kind of e-commerce
volumes you're seeing. And if you've seen a big uptick in demand on that front and how it might impact
your business.

Greg C. Gantt

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

We did see increases on those e-commerce type accounts. We did see some big revenue jumps with those
particular accounts on the inbound side for us, particularly. I think you know we don't participate in a lot
of home deliveries and that kind of thing, but there's another end of that. So we did see some upticks on
those accounts, which is a good thing, and that was really what those comments were pointed towards.
I think we'll continue to see those type customers business bases grow. So I think that's a good thing for
us, generally speaking.

Ariel Luis Rosa
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And does -- do the characteristics of that business from either a pricing or kind of weight standpoint vary
in terms of how it impacts your costs? I mean I imagine you're still going to be pricing appropriately, as
you've kind of hammered home for years, but how does that business vary in terms of its characteristics?

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Those accounts here, they have practically everything. They have a very, very wide variety of products. So
yes, each account that goes into those is vastly different, but they're all priced accordingly. I don't think
there's anything different, generally speaking, than with a lot of our other accounts, but we will price them
accordingly regardless of the product.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

I'll just add to that. We've seen -- I was just going to add that we've seen growth over the last couple of
years in our retail-related business. It's close to 30% of our overall revenue so we're still closely aligned
with the industrial sector. But nevertheless, that business has been growing. So this has been a trend
that's been evolving but certainly accelerating in this environment. And things aren't going to completely
change overnight in terms of supply chains and whatnot. But certainly, we feel like that more fulfillment
centers, things of that nature as they continue to be built around the landscape, and much of the freight
that will be inbound to those fulfillment centers will be more conducive to LTL type quantity shipments.
And so we certainly believe that we've already been winning business in that area and can continue
because to be able to maintain and manage inventory quantities and the number of SKUs that they want
to have in those facilities, you've got to have tight inventory controls, and that requires confidence in
your carrier to deliver on time and without damage. And certainly, I think we've proven that we do that
better than anyone. And I think that we'll be able to continue to participate, and that element of business
continuing to give us a little bit market share.

Ariel Luis Rosa
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. That's really helpful color. And then I just wanted to touch, for my last question, on the operating
ratio. And I know this is -- obviously, you guys have addressed this a bit. But really impressive on the cost
front. Is it appropriate for us to be thinking about a sub-80% operating ratio as kind of the new plateau?
And would it be a surprise to see that tick back up if congestion turns to highways and that sort of thing?
And then in the past, you've occasionally provided a view on where you expect incremental margins to be.
I think you've kind of talked about something in the 25% range. Should we be looking for kind of a step-
up based on this quarter and just the impressive performance you're able to deliver?

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

I mean, certainly, there will be some costs that will come back into the business and we'll be prepared for
those, but there should be other cost savings opportunities. Keep in mind, with the big drop in revenue
that we saw, typically, when you look long term, it's the density. The revenue per service center factors,
as that has increased, the operating ratio has improved. And when we look at individual service centers
and regions around the country, we know that we've got ongoing opportunity to improve our operating
ratio. And it really is driven down to the service center level when you look and think about all the dollars

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

that we've invested over the years in expanding our door capacity and then the individual opportunity to
improve the service centers ratio, all those 238 service centers roll up into the company average. And you
might have some that we just expanded and maybe hurt the operating ratio, but you've got a much larger
group that were leveraging all the fixed costs there because we own most of our facilities. And so it gives
us confidence that we can continue to drive this operating ratio lower once the density factors come back.
But it's -- the density and the yield, and both of those generally require a positive economic backdrop to
support each, those are the 2 key factors really to drive long-term operating ratio improvement. And we're
going to continue to focus on those. It's a matter of managing revenue quality and cost, and we've got to
consistently do both. We've got to continue to look for ways that we can keep our cost inflation low while
continuing to also give the service to our customers that provides value and allows us to get the consistent
rate increases that we need as well. And so this just continues to build on itself and also allows us to do
the most important thing, and that's taking care of our employees and keeping them motivated, keeping
them engaged to continue to give service, to be productive. That employee and our family culture that we
have is really what's been driving our long-term success, and we want to make sure that we don't miss
out on that element as well.

Our next question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

All the good questions have been answered -- asked to answer so I guess I'll have to ask a couple of
bad ones, so forgive me. I'm just trying to think about the sequential -- I mean, I know OR is kind of
an output of various moving parts. And as I think about the sequential movement from 2Q to 3Q, I
just wonder why the output won't actually be more challenged, especially given what's happening on
the weight per shipment side. Because correct me if I'm wrong, Adam. You mentioned that weight per
shipment kind of was volatile, but then maybe went down towards the end of the quarter. So as shipments
are going up, weight per shipment is coming down. You're adding resources to serve the shipments.
Wouldn't that represent -- I mean, it's maybe overly simplistic. But doesn't that represent maybe an
incremental headwind on the OR as we think about kind of the moving parts? If you can talk about that.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Yes. I mean, certainly, there are a lot of moving parts right now as we work our way through this
environment. And so yes, sequentially, the weight per shipment is coming down, but it's up on a year-
over-year basis. Our weight per shipment was pretty low last year in the third quarter. But I think that
we'll continue to keep our focus on maintaining our revenue quality. And if we can keep that revenue per
shipment high, which will -- we have no intent to change anything related to our pricing philosophies.
A little bit lower weight per shipment then certainly can -- if you've got the same cost per shipment to
handle, then that can put a little compression on that individual shipment's margin. But again, getting the
leverage from the revenue growth like we talked through earlier, that's -- if you just sort of run out for
the quarter kind of this trend that we're seeing in July, you'll have significant improvement sequentially
in revenue. And so the leverage that can come from that is significant and should offset any other type
of challenge that we have. Typically, our overhead cost average 20% to 25% of our revenue. And in
the second quarter, they were about 24%. It's a period with revenue weakness. And even though the
aggregate cost -- absolute costs were lower on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter and they
were lower in the second quarter than the first, some of the actions that we took, we obviously saw a lot
of the increase in those cost as a percent of revenue due to the revenue weakness. But sequentially, if
we can show that improvement then -- and not increase those overhead costs, you're going to get a lot
of leverage there. And we'd expect to be able to work that 24% back down closer to the lower end of the
range. Certainly, it would be the idea. And then we just got to keep the focus, and I can assure you we
will, on maintaining all of our labor to revenue statistics, all of our productivity across all the areas of the
operations. That's the biggest cost element that we have. But again, when density comes back into the
network, as we were talking about our line-haul cost earlier, that should improve that line-haul cost that's

16

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

more semi-variable. So the density coming back and the revenue, certainly, that should give us much
more opportunity than any other pressures related to a little bit lower weight per shipment should present.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. Okay. And then I don't know if I missed it, did you talk about year-on-year tonnage in July? I wasn't
sure if you had mentioned that or not.

Adam N. Satterfield
Senior VP of Finance, CFO & Assistant Secretary

Well, I just generally said -- because July is not done and we got out of the habit of giving the number in
the middle and -- even though we got 2 days left, but given an intra-month exact number and then the
comparison that, that created and sometimes panic or sometimes exuberance that maybe neither was
warranted of the change between the day of call and then what the actual number was. So I kind of talked
around it, I guess, but we're down -- the revenue is down about 3% sort of plus or minus at this point.
We'll see where we end up with these next 2 days of revenue. And the weight somewhat in that -- the
weight per day is somewhat in that same ballpark. So that's continued to show improvement from where
we were in June.

July has been a really strong month. Typically, July is a month that the revenue falls off a couple of
points from June. And to see the revenue continue to accelerate, and we've actually got revenue per day
that's higher in July, certainly, that's a big benefit and provides us with a lot of encouragement as we go
through the third quarter to see that these trends continue because, usually, July is the weakest month
of the third quarter. So we'll continue to see how these trends play out, but it certainly gives us a lot of
encouragement to see our customers continue to reopen their business, to increase the levels of business
they're giving us and some of the new wins that we've been able to create, while our sales team hasn't
even really been able -- be able to be out on the street making sales calls. So it's been a coordinated
effort. And our sales team, got to give them a lot of credit for having to change the way they operate,
how they communicate about the coordination between our sales, cost and pricing team and continue to
stay engaged and strengthening relationships with our customers. I think that's a big piece of not only our
long-term numbers, but the improvement that we're starting to see as we go into the third quarter.

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Let me add to that. We saw our revenue trends start to improve in June. And so far, through the month of
July, they've continued to be very consistent, and they look good down the line. If you look at revenue per
shipment, weight per shipment per hundred and all those different things that we measure from a revenue
standpoint, they're all consistent and look very good so far. So we hope that trend will continue. But we're
encouraged, but not concerned at all. We're very encouraged at this point.

Our next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.

Jordan Robert Alliger
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just a big picture question. Your service standards have always been a tremendous part of your
competitive advantage in the LTL space. I'm just wondering, the industry itself, the competition -- or is the
competition catching up or doing things in the right direction? Does that impact the gap between you and
the competition? Or is it still head and tails above everyone else if the competitive advantage generally
remains?

OLD DOMINION FREIGHT LINE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Yes. Jordan, let me say, first off, everybody has service standards. And while in a lot of cases, they're very
similar carrier to carrier, ours are, I think, in line with most of our competitors or better. But service runs a
lot wider gamut than just A to B on time. And there's a lot that goes into service, and I think that's where
OD excels compared to our competitors. And if you look at all of the things that we've done over the years
-- and we talk about the low claims ratio, but that's a big part of it. A to B and on time is a big part of it.

Our employees are engaged. They know what their role is as it relates to service, and they execute on
that role every day, whether it's a dock worker or the person that answers the phone in the office and
talks to our customers. How they deal with our customers, making timely pickups, making appointment
times, all those things, there's just an awful lot of elements that go into service. And I think we measure
up far better than our competitors on a day-to-day basis. And that's why I think -- and we sometimes
lose business over price, but it comes back because of service. And at the end of the day, we're getting
it back, and we're getting it back at our price. So there's an awful lot that goes into that. We put a lot of
work into that over the years, and it's paying off. So we will continue to focus in that area and continue
our commitment to our customers. So it does make a difference. I hope that answers your question.

Operator

And our next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.

Christyne McGarvey
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Christyne on for Ravi. Maybe circling back to some of the commentary around e-commerce and sort of a
tangential theme to that. Are you guys seeing any -- or do you expect to see any sort of blurring of lines
between the LTL and TL operations kind of moving forward over the next couple of quarters and years as
length of pull seems to be shortening on the TL side? And on the LTL side, it seems like the shipments are
getting a little bit heavier. Are you guys seeing any, again, more blurring there?

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Not that we can tell, to be honest with you. No. Yes. Certainly, yes. I think as suppliers try to get closer
to their customers, the TL length of haul would get shorter, but we haven't seen that trend at all in our
business. Our length of haul has been very consistent over the last several years. And to be honest with
you, if anything, we've seen a little bit of an increase of late. So if there's blurring of the lines, we can't
see it. There's still a pretty big distinction there.

Christyne McGarvey
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one follow-up, sort of bigger picture. Has the strategy
evolved at all in the last couple of months around electric vehicles, whether that's in P&D or maybe some
shorter haul -- other shorter haul operations for you guys with some of the developments that we've seen
from the OEMs in the last couple of months here?

Greg C. Gantt
President, CEO & Director

Well, let me say this, I don't think that technology has evolved to the point that it's all that useful for us
yet. There's still a lot of issues with it. I know you -- we all hear, see and read things that sound good, but
I'm not sure the practicality in our particular company. It's just not -- the technology is not there yet. We
can't make it work as it currently stands today. So I think it'll continue to evolve and I think there will be
an application down the road and maybe sooner than later, but we'll just have to wait and see. There's still
a lot of issues with it at this point. And hopefully, it'll get there, but it's just not there yet.
