HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Halliburton Second Quarter 2020
Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.

I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead,
sir.

Abu Zeya
Senior Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2020 conference call. As a
reminder, today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days.

Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO.

Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views
about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to
materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2019; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020; recent current
reports on Form 8-K; and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation
to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.

Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments
and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measures are included in our second quarter press release and can also be found in the quarterly results
and presentation section of our website. [Operator Instructions]

Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Well, thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone.

The second quarter of 2020 is now behind us. It was a tough one for many industries, including the oil and
gas sector. A global pandemic and the resulting collapse in demand have upended many businesses. And
as economies around the world emerge from lockdowns, the path forward remains uneven and uncertain.

I am grateful for our employees' focus, dedication and perseverance during these difficult times. Employee
safety is our top priority, and we continue our efforts to take the appropriate measures to provide a safe
working environment for everyone.

COVID-19 is altering our everyday lives and business operations, and it is important that we do not let our
guard down. Despite this distraction, our safety performance is the best it has ever been, with our total
recordable incident rate improving more than 20% since the end of last year.

There are 3 key areas I will address on the call today. First, our solid second quarter performance,
demonstrating a significant reset that improves the earnings power of our business, despite the severity
of the activity collapse. Second, the market and business outlook for the second half and full year of 2020.
And finally, what we are doing today to make sure that Halliburton powers into and wins the eventual
recovery.

The global activity collapse in the second quarter was swift and severe, much worse than anticipated. U.S.
average rig count for the quarter declined 50% sequentially, while international rigs dropped 22%, with
absolute global rig count sinking to the lowest level in recent history. Halliburton's response to the market

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

disruption was equally swift and aggressive. As I'll discuss in a few minutes, our organization responded
with a tremendous sense of urgency.

Let me cover a few headlines related to our financial performance. Total company revenue was $3.2 billion
and adjusted operating income was $236 million. Our completion and production division revenue of $1.7
billion was impacted by a drop in market activity in the low teens in international markets and about 70%
in U.S. land completions. Despite these headwinds, C&P delivered a solid operating margin of 9.5% in the
second quarter.

Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue of $1.5 billion was down, largely in line with lower rig count
activity globally, delivering operating margin of 8.3% in the second quarter. The speed and effectiveness
of the cost actions that we have executed helped minimize the sequential decremental margins to 14% in
C&P and 16% in D&E.

Revenue for North America declined 57% sequentially, with our C&P and D&E divisions outperforming the
completions and drilling activity declines, respectively. International revenue was down 17% sequentially,
outperforming the rig count decline. And finally, we generated over $450 million in positive free cash flow
in the second quarter.

As reflected in these results, our aggressive cost actions are an important part of our earnings power
reset. As you recall, we removed $300 million in costs over the prior 2 quarters. In April, we announced
an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions. I'm pleased to report today that these actions, which
are largely permanent changes to our business, are 75% done. I expect the remaining cost reductions,
which are mostly aimed at our international business and real estate rationalization, to be completed by
the end of the third quarter.

Let's now discuss our expectations for the second half of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate drilling
activity to continue to decline modestly, while completions stay resilient into year-end. The activity
changes have not been and will not be uniform across all international markets. On a full year basis, we
expect activity in the OPEC countries in the Middle East and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea to be
more resilient, while Latin America and Africa decline sharply. Some customers are deferring new projects,
most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the deeper and longer pullback in Latin America,
we now anticipate a mid-teens decline in international customer activity and spend for the full year.

In North America land, some green shoots of completion activity are emerging, but I would not
characterize this as the start of a meaningful recovery. After customers bring back shut-in production,
and as WTI remains range bound around $40, we expect to see a modest uptick in completions activity
during the third quarter, followed by the usual seasonal deceleration at the end of the year. Drilling activity
declines have slowed, and we believe the rig count should find a bottom sometime in the third quarter,
but a meaningful inflection point in drilling seems further out. Our full year customer spend outlook for
North America remains unchanged at approximately 50% down compared to 2019, with gassier basins
outperforming the oilier ones.

Further demand weakness from a slower economic recovery or multiple waves of COVID-19 related
activity shutdowns present downside risks to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Though we believe
positioning our company to ride out those events should they occur, it is not possible to predict the impact
that they may have. Regardless, as demonstrated this quarter, I expect Halliburton to outperform the
market under any conditions.

As we look into the future, I believe the international and North America markets will present opportunities
for Halliburton. Although the timing of commodity price recovery remains uncertain, we are taking the
necessary actions to thrive in the current market and to prepare Halliburton to win the eventual recovery.

International producers have the opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining U.S.
production. This should translate into healthy activity levels internationally as oil demand recovers.
International shorter-cycle barrels will likely fill a higher proportion of future incremental demand
requirements. As economic growth returns, we expect the key producing regions to maintain productive

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

spare capacity, so they can quickly meet demand. Offshore, longer-cycle barrels and new exploration
activity will likely be the farthest out in terms of incremental contribution to the supply stack.

Today, we have an excellent international business, both in terms of geographic footprint and technology
portfolio. Pre-coronavirus, our international business grew revenue every quarter for almost 3 years,
outperforming our largest competitor and was on the road to meaningful margin improvement.
International regions contributed nearly half of our revenue in 2019. They are also historically more
resilient on margins, demonstrating the strength of our diverse business.

Here's how we are preparing to win the recovery internationally. We're driving adoption and expansion of
our latest technologies in the international markets. Our EarthStar Logging-While-Drilling tool has seen a
2.5x increase in its adoption over the last year, even though it is one of our premium offerings.

Our Cerebro in-bit sensor package provides a high-speed look at data captured directly from the bit. Its
international adoption has doubled this year compared to the first half of 2019.

We've successfully completed customer qualifications and are currently deploying the latest wireline
tractors and ESP pumps in the Middle East. We are growing and monetizing our digital offerings. The
improved performance and efficiency can allow us to introduce new commercial models where all parties
share in the benefits of our digital technologies. The Aker BP project in Norway is a demonstration of
a customer successfully adopting digital technology to achieve best-in-class performance. We have
collaborated with our alliance partners to deploy digitally enabled new technologies and innovative
ways of working. Our contract structure for all alliance partners benefit from these successes, fosters a
collaborative culture and drives further performance improvement.

We increased rate of penetration by 88% over the course of the well campaign, and 1/3 of the wells we
drilled on a specific prospect were in the top decile of the industry benchmark for drilling speed. We made
great strides in the digital transformation of the well planning cycle, rapidly working towards the goal of
planning a well in a day. We applied digital 3D inversion, helping the customer improve their reservoir
understanding. This led to replanning of a whole reservoir section and potential incremental reserves for
the customer.

We are also advancing alliances with key industry players, both within and outside of the oil and gas
sector. We recently announced Halliburton and TechnipFMC collaborated to create Odassea, the world's
first distributed acoustic sensing solution for subsea wells. This collaboration strengthens our digital
capabilities and subsea reservoir monitoring and production optimization.

We recently signed a 5-year strategic agreement with Microsoft and Accenture to advance Halliburton's
digital capabilities in Microsoft Azure. This is an important step in our adoption of new technology and
applications to enhance our digital capabilities and customer offerings, drive additional business agility and
reduce capital expenditures.

We're also taking actions not only to thrive in the current market, but to best position our business in
the future. Streamlining our cost structure is part of a continuing effort to reduce our fixed costs and
improving components of our working capital through a strong focus on managing collections, deploying
digital inventory planning solutions and extending vendor payment terms.

As oil demand recovers, I expect the international business will continue to be a more meaningful
contributor to our revenue going forward. I believe that the actions we are taking provide the basis for
margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion internationally in the next up cycle.

Turning to North America. We believe that North America production is likely to remain structurally lower
in the foreseeable future and has slower growth going forward. The shrinking demand for shale oil and
limited access to capital markets, the inevitable rationalization will continue, and we expect to see a
more disciplined market with stronger operators and service companies. The activity declines and intra-
year cyclicality over the last 2 years led us to change our approach to this market, but what has not
changed is our commitment to the single largest oilfield services market and to our leadership position in
it. While the North American market will be structurally smaller, we believe that it will be more profitable
for us. Our service delivery improvement strategy lowers our fixed and services costs and will drive

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

higher contribution margin with the goal to make Halliburton the most competitive from a cost structure
perspective. This strategy has resulted in sustainable changes to how we organize and execute every day
in the business and positions us to deliver higher profitability and free cash flow in North America.

Our playbook is clear. Returns in cash generation matter more than ever, and growth for the sake of
market share is a thing of the past. We believe that our size and scale, combined with our ability to quickly
respond to changing market conditions, are strong advantages for us, helping to drive the unit cost down
and enabling us to capture work across multiple basins and resource types.

The $1.3 billion in cost cuts, a combination of the $300 million in prior cuts and the $1 billion in further
reductions, are largely aimed at North America. Let me remind you what we have done to reset the
earnings power in this key market. We are changing the fundamentals of how we deliver our services,
and I expect this will drive a higher contribution margin and lower our fixed costs. We reduced our
maintenance cost per horsepower hour by over 1/3 compared to the 2019 run rate by redesigning our
maintenance and value engineering processes. This has been scaled tested as a permanent change in how
we execute our operations and is independent of the market activity levels.

We've also made permanent reductions to our workforce. We have flattened our North America
organization, removing layers of management. We are using digital and remote operations to reduce the
number of frac engineers required to monitor jobs by establishing real-time operation centers and using
cloud-based solutions to modernize data flow between the rig site and the back office.

We are reducing our real estate footprint by over 100 facilities, which not only removes costs, but fits with
our digital and remote operations strategy.

In addition to these strategic changes, we will continue to take advantage of our unique competitive
strengths. We offer a full suite of oilfield services through 13 product service lines in North America,
and we will continue to emphasize our non-frac revenue streams, resulting in a more balanced business
portfolio. We continue to deliver differentiated technologies across our product lines, many of them using
advances in automation and digitalization. These technologies either lower our costs or improve production
results for our customers.

Finally and critically, none of the improvements internationally and in North America happen without our
fantastic, competitive and committed team focused on achieving all of these objectives and protecting the
gains we make over time.

Turning to capital spending. 2020 will be the second year in a row that we have significantly reduced
our CapEx, which will largely be directed towards our international business. Because we size our capital
budget based on a committed project pipeline and anticipated returns, we believe that this year, just
like in 2019, this CapEx reduction will not hamper our ability to outperform the market. We will continue
to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returning opportunities. The capital intensity of our
business has come down. And as we think about the future, we project that CapEx spend as a percentage
of revenue will be closer to 5% to 6% versus the historical norms of 10% to 11%.

There are several reasons why we are able to drive this change and positively impact our free cash flow
going forward. We now build our equipment cheaper, and it lasts longer. Advances in sensing technologies
and material sciences are lowering the total cost of ownership for our tools. Design improvements, such
as component modularity, make asset velocity better than ever. This means we need to build fewer tools
to support the same level of business. For example, the iCruise drilling system has modular components
and standardized electronic inserts for all tool sizes, allowing for 20% better asset velocity. Digitalization
reduces our capital footprint. We're removing equipment from location and replacing costly hardware with
software solutions. We do not anticipate large technology recapitalization programs similar to the build-out
of our leading Q10 pumps and the iCruise drilling systems. And finally, the North America business now
has structurally lower capital requirements. It is a mature market, and frac job intensity is plateauing.

The Halliburton I have just described to you is charting a fundamentally different course. The growth in
digital technologies, the position of strength in the international markets, the sharper approach to North
America and a lower CapEx profile, all of that comes from the hard work that we've been doing over the

last few years. We are not waiting for an up cycle to drive significant free cash flow and returns for our
shareholders. We believe that the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings
power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery.

Now I'll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jeff, and good morning.

Let's start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2020. Total
company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, and adjusted operating income was $236 million,
representing decreases of 37% and 53%, respectively.

In the second quarter, we recognized $2.1 billion of pretax impairments and other charges to further
adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of noncash asset
impairments, mainly associated with pressure pumping equipment and real estate as well as inventory
write-offs, severance and other costs. As a result of this charge, we realized a $49 million reduction in
depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter. This impact is reflected in our division
results, with approximately 2/3 associated with our C&P division and the remainder related to our D&E
division. We expect our third quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225
million, reflecting one month of additional impact.

As Jeff mentioned, by the end of the second quarter, we also accomplished approximately 75% of the
annualized $1 billion in cost reductions, and we intend to complete most of the remaining actions by the
end of the third quarter. The cash cost associated with the various cost actions in the second quarter was
approximately $180 million. We anticipate that we will incur an additional cash cost of approximately $60
million in the third quarter as we continue to make further structural adjustments.

Moving to our division results. Our Completion and Production revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of
44%, while operating income was $159 million, a decrease of 54%. These declines were largely a result of
a decrease in pressure pumping activity globally, primarily driven by U.S. land and Latin America, coupled
with lower artificial lift activity in U.S. land. These were partially offset by improved completion tool sales
internationally.

Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 27%, while operating income was $127
million, a decrease of 41%. These declines were primarily due to a global reduction in drilling-related
services and lower software sales internationally.

In North America, revenue was $1 billion, a 57% decrease. This decline was driven by reduced activity in
U.S. land, primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction, artificial lift and wireline activity,
coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico.

Latin America revenue was $346 million, a 33% decrease, resulting primarily from decreased activity
across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, and lower software sales in Mexico.

Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS. Revenue was $691 million, a 17% decrease, resulting primarily from
reduced well construction and pressure pumping activity and lower software sales across the region.
This was partially offset by increased fluids activity and completion tool sales in Norway, and improved
cementing activity and completion tool sales in Russia.

In the Middle East Asia region, revenue was $1.1 billion, a 10% decrease, largely resulting from reduced
activity across the majority of product service lines in the Middle East, Malaysia and India, partially offset
by improved drilling activity and completion tool sales in China and Kuwait.

In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million, and this amount should serve
as the new quarterly run rate for the rest of the year.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

Our interest expense for the quarter was $124 million. For the third quarter, we expect it will be closer
to $130 million. Other expense for the quarter was $48 million primarily driven by our foreign exchange
exposure and currency weakness in Argentina. Looking ahead, we expect it will be approximately $30
million for the third quarter.

Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25% driven by certain discrete
tax items and a lower earnings base. For the third quarter and full year, we expect our effective tax rate to
be approximately 24% and 20%, respectively.

Capital expenditures for the quarter were $142 million, and our full year 2020 CapEx estimate of $800
million remains unchanged.

Turning to cash flow. We generated $598 million of cash from operations during the second quarter.
As anticipated, working capital was a source of cash. As activity declines globally, working capital has
historically been a strong source of cash, and we expect to see continued benefits from working capital for
the rest of this year.

Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $456 million. Our year-to-date and expected earnings
performance for the remainder of the year, combined with working capital benefits and lower CapEx,
should result in full year free cash flow of over $1 billion.

Finally, while we remain cautious about the forecasted pace of economic recovery and the potential for
additional COVID-related shutdowns, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third
quarter playing out based on our outlook.

Sequentially, we expect overall company revenue to decline low single digits in the third quarter. Lower
average rig activity across most regions will impact our D&E division, while modest completions activity
improvement should drive C&P division revenue to be flat to slightly up. The full quarter benefit and
continued execution of our cost reductions should offset the impact of lower activity on our profitability. As
a result, we expect to deliver higher sequential operating income and modestly higher margin.

Let me now turn the call back over to Jeff.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Thanks, Lance. To sum up our discussion today, our second quarter performance in a tough market
demonstrates our organization's ability to execute swiftly and aggressively, and we expect to complete our
remaining cost actions in the third quarter. We have an excellent international business, and it is ready to
deliver margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion in the next up cycle. The actions we have
taken in North America, including our service delivery improvement strategy, we believe, will enable us to
have higher profitability and free cash flow, even in a structurally lower environment. We are moving full
steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies for our customers and internally.

And finally, Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions we are
taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into
and win the eventual recovery.
And now let's open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.

James Carlyle West
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Jeff, you talked about this, you're charting a fundamentally different course, and I think it's definitely
appropriate. We have a vision of the oil field that, I think, aligns with your vision for the future of the
oilfield. Of course, digital, lower capital intensity, higher returns are all kind of part of that strategy. Could
you maybe talk about kind of where you are in the various parts of that journey, both the digital side? The
-- obviously, the cost reductions in North America, you're pretty far along on that. You talked about that.
Maybe the international and the technology delivery.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Well, thanks, James. And again, when I look through the noise of the COVID disruption and industry
consolidation and rationalization, but clearly, we do focus on what is that new course, and I -- we are
working on those things right now. I talked about a number of them in my commentary. But we are
focused on doubling down on the technology that's important, drilling, iCruise, EarthStar, Cerebro, digital,
growing our lift and chemicals businesses, which I described in the commentary, and then feeding that
technology into our fantastic international business. Finally, delivering on North America service delivery
improvement strategy, while at the same time, demonstrating structurally lower CapEx on -- built on
capital efficiency and an organization that executes under any conditions. So yes, we are charting a
different course.

Progress along digital, I've -- we've talked about each quarter different things that we're doing. We're
making terrific project -- progress around Halliburton 4.0. Feel very good about the kinds of contracts
we're signing today and the work that's being done behind the scenes to continue to advance that. And
obviously, you saw some of our announcements with partners this quarter.

James Carlyle West
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. So you feel good about the path you're charting here. What about on the customer side? I mean,
it seems to me there needs to be a fundamentally different mindset from the customers as well. What's
their approach or their adoption of these new technologies, particularly on the digital side? And how is that
progressing? Is there -- are they impediments to change now? Or are they really aligning with kind of your
view and others' views?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Look, I've always said that digital has to evolve, right? It's something that's built out over time, and
it's done often with partners. And so we've talked about our partners. But yes, there's appetite for it.
Absolutely. And I think that when I -- let me -- when I think about it in terms of reservoir, drilling and
production, those are the bites that can be digested today. And so that's why when we talk about progress
and the things that we're doing, we're doing them in those sort of silos, not because we view them long
term as silos, but because that's the way they can be digested right now.

Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs.

Really impressive quarter. It's almost unbelievable, the numbers are so good. So kudos to you guys.

International markets, as you touched on, Jeff, really important for growth, and you highlighted some
of the initiatives there. But can you talk a little bit about cost cutting opportunities and the opportunity
to further improve margins? Obviously, D&E margins had a nice move in Q1. But can you talk about
additional efforts there on the cost cutting side. And then I know there's a focus on generating more free
cash flow out of the international market. So maybe -- and it is over 50% of your revenues. Maybe talk
about -- further about international.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Angie. Look, I think we are positioned in the right markets, the strong markets. We've got
the technology uptake that's so important in those markets, and then what we're doing around lowering
capital efficiency or improving capital efficiency plays straight into that. And so I expect that we will
continue to see progress in those markets, and they will be stronger over time.

Angeline Marie Sedita
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the evolution here in your CapEx profile, and I think
that's really shown through here in '19 and '20, and become a lower capital-intensive company and really
rethinking the U.S. land market. So maybe can you talk a little further about that CapEx profile, how
you're looking at the market differently, particularly in the U.S. and the long-term ability to generate more
cash flow -- free cash flow?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thank you. The -- when I think about the type of equipment we're building and actually using
equipment more efficiently, lowering the cost of that equipment, those are all the kinds of things that we
look at. Obviously, we're focused on improving returns, using our digital capabilities to eliminate cost. I
mean, we've removed roughly 100 facilities, but we only removed 100 facilities by changing the way we
work dramatically, so that it just takes less capital. And that plays into everything from maintenance to
where people work, et cetera. So that's sort of a North America view.

Now those same skills and capabilities are applicable everywhere in the world. And so I expect us to
continue to drive cost out of our business. I mean, that's really our -- so when I talk about charting a
different course, digital, international strength and then a leaner organization that drives technology and
efficiency, and I think the leaner and efficiency and the technology applications will be driving cost out all
of the time, including internationally.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons.

William Andrew Herbert

Lance, a couple of questions for you on cash flow. First of all, do you expect the working capital harvest in
the second half, [ do you feel will be ] as successful as it was in Q2? And then also difficult to be precise
[indiscernible]

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Bill, you're breaking up. I'm sorry, I didn't get all of your questions.

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

Sorry. Can you hear me now?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

A little muffled.

William Andrew Herbert
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

The question was, one, working capital as a source of cash. Is it as substantial in the second half of the
year as it was in the second quarter?

And then with regard to your cash cost saves, difficult to answer, but in the event of a change in regime in
November, how do you think about with regard to your cash cost? Do you have enough tax shield to offset
a rise in the corporate tax rate?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So let me address the first part of your question, which is, I think, the working capital unwind and
the momentum in the second half of the year. Clearly, we had a strong cash flow associated with the
unwind in working capital in Q2. I suspect that, that momentum continues into Q3 and Q4, may not be
as strong just because we had such with the revenue declines just in the course of 2Q and the unwind
around receivables and then offset by payables. It was good to see. The organization continues to be
really efficient on how we continue to ring out the cash flow generated for working capital, but may not be
as strong as the third quarter. But I still expect momentum to -- excuse me, the second quarter -- but I
still expect momentum from the unwind to continue to incur -- to occur in Q3 and Q4.

And can you repeat the second question? I think you were talking about administrative expenses. But
again, Bill, it's kind of hard to pick you up.

William Andrew Herbert
Simmons & Company International, Research Division

Yes. Sorry about this. Your cost cash saves in the event that we have a change in regime in the -- in early
November. I guess, what Biden is talking about is a 28% corporate tax rate. I'm just curious as to whether
your tax shield, net operating losses, losses, et cetera, do you expect to be a [indiscernible] line?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

No, we don't, Bill. I mean we've got -- certainly, we do have the NOLs associated -- I mean, look, there's
always other ways that Halliburton continues to pay cash taxes. But at the federal tax level, we expect
that we'll have the tax shields from the NOLs.

Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.

Sean Christopher Meakim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So the decrementals were very impressive, huge difference compared to what we saw in 2015 and 2016.
And I was hoping we could just get a better sense of the run rate for C&P going forward. So impairments
helped us lower D&A. I appreciate you quantifying that for 3Q. It looks like a 400 basis point assistance
from 1Q to 3Q. Were there margin benefits from the inventory write downs? I'm just curious if completions
activity gets a little better in 3Q, does the margin follow at the EBITDA line? So looking past EBIT to the
EBITDA line?

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

Yes. Look, I think the changes that we've described and based on the guidance we've given, I think this
has been a -- the margins that we've reset today clearly have been helped by some of the accounting
changes and the impairments that we've taken over the first part of the year. But look, it's not to say that
we haven't done a significant amount of work around the cost cuts, which we believe are permanent. It
goes across everything that we're doing, whether it's drilling, digital, production, frac in North America,
as Jeff has described. And so, look, I think in terms of our margin progression, we're going to continue to
work that as hard as we can. We still got some room to continue to improve on that cost cutting journey,
as we described in our remarks. And look, I think it sets us up ultimately that when activity moves up, all
of this is done with the expectation that we ultimately have stronger incrementals with these permanent
cost cuts and changes.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Let me just follow that up with -- I mean the way to look at things is -- in my view, is what does that
new course look like? And that new course looks like substantially lower cost, like a reset around cost.
Where are we directing our energies? Towards digital being much sharper in North America around how we
invest, what we do and how we manage that cost structure. Internationally, continuing to protect and pour
technology into that market. And then the structurally lower CapEx. And that all comes from changing
things that we're doing. And so we are changing many business processes, and this is the way we view
things, which ultimately drives substantially lower cost and resets margins and cash flow higher.

Sean Christopher Meakim
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. Got it. I appreciate that. And so then just as a follow-up, if we think that EBIT will be higher
quarter-over-quarter, modestly higher margins as a percentage, does that follow the same for EBITDA? Do
you think EBITDA can grow quarter-over-quarter?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I mean, I think the implications, with everything that we've described, Sean, on our prepared
remarks, would tell you that EBITDA is relatively flat, even though the top line is coming down.

Operator

Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.

John David Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So obviously, international is a bigger part of your business now going forward. Just wondering, in your
outlook, as you think about international markets, how they're trending, how you've thought about
pricing in that outlook, and in particular, the second half of the year. Hearing some reports about pricing
concessions being asked for the NOCs, particularly in the Middle East. So I was just wondering if you could
just kind of talk about that and whether you think that's a concern or risk for the industry. I mean, I know
you have a lot of other contracts, LSTK contracts and whatnot, so maybe you can just kind of talk about
both sets, if you won't mind, please?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, look, I think the fact is pricing never recovered internationally. And at this point, we haven't seen
many tenders, so we don't have much of a view of that. But bottom line is there's much less capital
internationally. I mean, the excess capital just isn't there, maybe the way that it is in the U.S., but that's
probably getting sorted out in the U.S. as well. And so most of the dialogue has been more around
working on efficiencies, how to drive more efficient operations, both for our customers and for us, and
less so around pricing. It doesn't mean that they don't get asked about, but at the same time, the

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

only effective path forward is to drive better efficiency, utilization of technology and that sort of thing
internationally. And I'd say that applies to NOCs and IOCs.

John David Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So you're not being asked to cut -- I didn't mean on new tenders. I meant on kind of existing work. You're
not being asked to cut pricing on existing work.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, I understand. And I would say that, certainly, the first response is, let's look for ways to drive better
efficiency, not address pricing because most of these tenders -- most of these contracts that are in place
today were let arguably at the bottom of the international cycle, which was in 2016.

John David Anderson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Fair point, fair point. You mentioned digital quite a bit today on today's call. I'm just curious about
something as you're looking forward. In terms of where you want to be, let's just think like 2, 3 years
down the road here, do you think you can pull all the technology out internally? In other words, can you
create all this organically? Or do you need to look outside? I guess if I look back in the past, look in the
back, like in the mid-90s, those technology acquisitions were critical, obviously, to you and some of your
biggest competitors, think about Landmark, of course. How are you thinking about that going forward? I
mean, is that something you're going to have to look outside of Halliburton? Is it a combination? Just kind
of broader views on that, please.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I mean, broadly, I treat that the same as we do most of our M&A in the sense that we see -- when
we see opportunities to accelerate R&D or we see things that are important as we make them, and we've
continued to do smaller transactions around our digital offerings, though we're very thoughtful around
the build versus buy approach, and that's a lot of the valuation. We feel like we can, through partners
and others, get into all of the things we need to do and deliver platform solutions. But I -- and so there's
not like a big transformational thing that's in our minds. More importantly, in my view, is continuing to
advance the R&D around digital.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.

Chase Mulvehill
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I guess, what is the kind of stick on this kind of digital and remote operations that you guys have been
talking about through the quarter -- going through the past couple of quarters? I guess, first, how should
we think about the structural margin improvement from these cost savings initiatives on the remote
operations and automation side? And how much of a benefit did you see kind of in 2Q? And then the
second part of the question is, really, how easily can competitors replicate this strategy over time?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Chase. The -- Q2, I mean, the digital technology and the digital approach that we're taking
is what enables the cost reductions that we're -- a large part of the cost reductions that we're seeing in
Q2. I wouldn't describe it as enough activity to actually drive the kind of incremental. I mean, we didn't
-- it will drive terrific incrementals as we see any activity growth. But the ability -- I'm going to stick with
real estate rationalization just as a proxy for the kind of things that can be removed when we use the

HALLIBURTON COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2020

digital solutions that we have internally. For our customers, I think I described in my remarks, at least one
example around how digital solutions are driving much better performance, both for our customers and for
ourselves. And so I think that we will continue to see that play a role.

Replicating digital at scale is very difficult. I mean, I think that will prove to be -- I know what's involved
in it for us, and I know that we're working with some of the very best partners in the industry. And it's not
-- it takes a lot of work on our part and a lot of discipline around platform outcomes that are scalable and
reliable sort of all the time. And so I think that I'm quite confident about where we're going.

Chase Mulvehill
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Great. Appreciate the color. One quick follow-up on the CapEx side. You mentioned 5% to 6% of
revenues being spent on CapEx. Can you confirm that, that's a long-term CapEx number? And maybe how
much of that is maintenance versus growth and then if this implies that maybe on the international side
that the market share gain strategy is less of a focus over the medium to longer term?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I think that the 5% to 6% versus the 10% to 11% is a longer-term outlook that's based on capital
efficiency. Just to how we build things and how we take them to market, how fast we move them
around, all of the things that drive lower capital requirements. And so I believe those changes are largely
permanent also. When I think about how that plays out internationally, I think that same efficiency, a lot
of the technology and tools that I've described, particularly around capital efficiency, whether it's iCruise
or Cerebro or some of those technologies, are inherently lower capital requirements when they're being
used. Obviously, we went through a period of building that out over the last year. But operationally, they
operate probably 20% less, more efficient, better velocity. I think we have that to reap internationally over
time.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So the big question for you and peers has been how to make a profit in a smaller U.S. market. And you
guys obviously took a great stride here in 2Q to proving that's very possible. And Lance, you mentioned
strong incrementals during the recovery here. And I realize we're just starting to poke our head out of
the bunker from one of the worst downturns we've ever seen. But if we do get back to 500 or 600 rigs
operating in the U.S., which is more or less consensus, I think, what's a reasonable range to think about
where C&P margins could rise to?

Lance Loeffler
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Scott, I'll talk to that. Look, I think as you look to -- into the future and what the recovery may
look like in North America in the -- in this picture that you painted around activity, I think this is going
to continue to be a good business that delivers mid-teens margins and produce a heck of a lot of free
cash flow given the things that we've talked about on this call today operationally and the way that we're
becoming sharper in North America with our service delivery improvement initiatives, on top of just
structurally lower CapEx requirements to achieve that business, drives a really nice free cash flow profile,
we believe.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, I think so. Go ahead. Sorry. Let me add one thing to that because as we look at North America, if we
just sort of assume a flat level of production in '21 and then we move that forward into '22, we see all of

the attrition and sort of tightening that is happening. I think we were well on this path sort of at the end of
last year coming into this year, and we saw solid performance in Q1. We expect we get back to a market
that's probably sized and shaped, at least from a supply and demand of equipment standpoint, something
that looks like Q1 of 2020 sometime further out. And the approach that we're taking, I think, will work
very well for us.

Scott Andrew Gruber
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just given your technology investments on the D&E side and given the cost reset on
that side of the business as well and kind of just where you stand in terms of the market share gains
internationally, do you think we're at mid-cycle in the next cycle? Is the gap between C&P margin and D&E
margins much smaller than what we've seen in the last few cycles?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes, I would expect so. I mean, again, we have expectations that, that business continues to improve also.
And we were well on the way to doing that really up until we got into the pandemic situation and where
we are today. But none of the fundamentals have changed around what we're doing other than, I think, a
sharper cost structure around these things.

Operator

Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask first on kind of the third quarter outlook for completions -- I think you mentioned up for
your North America C&P business. Do you see that outperforming the market? In other words, do you
think that the market could be flat to down, but Halliburton is up? Or do you also see the market up in the
third quarter?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

For completions, look, I think we're off the bottom in May. And I think you'll see a little bit of an uptick in
Q3 as DUCs get completed. Drilling, we think, will be down a little bit. And I think that will be -- many of
our customers managing decline rates into the end of the year. But our view of the market is it stays with
making returns and then taking on the work that we believe we can execute well. So I think that's what
the overall market will do, and I think we'll be in and around that.

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Great, great. And then you guys have mentioned in the press release and then a few times on this call
about winning the recovery. Maybe if you could offer for us a little bit more color on what that means.
What are the metrics we should be looking for from you guys in terms of claiming victory on that front?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Well, I think that's returns and cash flows. I mean, we spend a lot of time talking about free cash flow and
returns, and that's what we're setting up for today. And I think we get well through whatever this period
of time is until we see commodity prices tighten, I think, we do well through this near term. But then
when we start to see tightening, we're going to have the right cost structure that scales very efficiently
with strong incrementals, and it delivers a lot of free cash flow and very, very good returns. That's what
winning the recovery looks like to me.

Is there a threshold? Is there a target that we should be looking for? Percentage of revenue in terms of
free cash flow…

I think we ought to get closer to that point before we start setting targets around that. But what my
expectations are is that it's a very strong performance by Halliburton, but it's out there always.

Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just kind of curious when you provided the outlook here for the second half of 2020, you indicated an
uptick in completion activity in the third quarter and then a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. And I'm
just curious on that just given how rapid the decline in that overall activity was and how sharp the decline
in overall spending has been for 2020. So I guess you're picking up that dynamic from your discussions
with customers, so they're going to get a little more active in the third quarter and just pull back again in
the fourth. Just seems a little bit counterintuitive just given how sharply spend and activity has already
been cut.

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Look, I think it's going to rest more around kind of DUC activity as we go into the second half of the
year. So on a relative basis, more pronounced Q3, less pronounced Q4 would be my impression, though
I think every customer is working their own strategy around what do they need to do as they go into
2021, which will be obviously a time where some stability needs to return to productive capacity and those
sorts of things. So is it more modest sort of in Q4? It may be. But my overall outlook is it will be relatively
biased, even if you just take into account holidays and all the sorts of things that happen in Q4, along with
weather. And this isn't the kind of market where you power through terrible weather in an effort to try to
get to some point, I don't think, in Q4.

Kurt Kevin Hallead
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's good color. And just maybe one quick follow-up here. It looks like the run rate on CapEx will
be a little bit higher in the second half than it was in the first half. You indicated that your CapEx is project
pipeline driven. So is it safe to assume here that you're starting to see an increase in potential project
activity going out into 2021?

Jeffrey Allen Miller
President, CEO & Chairman

Look, no, I mean, I think what we see are some long lead time items that we do. I mean, we talked about
projects being deferred, but not necessarily canceled, so we have to manage all of that together. And so
precisely where those things fall in the calendar is where they fall. I think what's most important to think
about around capital really is the overall efficiency that we've driven into both the tools, the process, the
asset velocity, which will structurally help us keep that at a much lower point than it has been in the past.

President, CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Liz. Before we wrap up today's call, I'd like to leave you with a few closing comments.

Our second quarter performance demonstrates Halliburton's ability to execute swiftly and aggressively.
The actions we have taken in North America, we believe, will enable higher profitability and free cash flow
even in a structurally lower environment. We have an excellent international business and are moving full
steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies, both for our customers and internally.

Most importantly, Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions
we are taking today will meaningfully reset our earnings power and free cash flow ability as we power into
and win the eventual recovery.

I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call.
