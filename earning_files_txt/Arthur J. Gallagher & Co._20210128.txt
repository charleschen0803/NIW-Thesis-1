Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call.
On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating
divisions.

Before we get started, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the tumultuous year that was 2020.
It was a year that tested everything from our physical health to our mental state of mind, to how we see
one another. It has impacted our colleagues, our families, our communities around the world. It brought
personal hardship and loss, stresses and challenges that none of us would have predicted a year ago.

I believe we've learned a lot about ourselves and our society over the past year. And while 2020 is behind
us, many issues and difficulties remain. But let's not forget 2020 also showed us that the world can work
together towards a common goal, to develop vaccines in order to solve a global problem. And for that, I'm
both thankful and I remain optimistic about our future.

Now on to the discussion of the quarter and the year. We delivered an excellent fourth quarter in the
midst of the pandemic. We grew organically. We picked up momentum and grew through acquisitions.
We improved our productivity and raised our quality. We continue to invest in our bedrock culture. I'm
extremely proud of how the team performed during the quarter and the full year.

In our Brokerage segment for the fourth quarter, reported revenue growth was a positive 3.6%. Most of
that, or 3.1%, was organic revenue growth. We executed on our cost containment playbook and further
utilized our centers of excellence, saving about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings
margin higher by 281 basis points and expanding our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 579 basis points.
And net earnings were up 33% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 30%, another fantastic quarter for the
brokerage team.

Let me walk you around the world and give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units,
starting with our PC operations. In U.S. retail, organic growth was strong at about 4.5%. New business
and client retention was similar to last year's fourth quarter. And midterm policy modifications, including
full policy cancellations, were slightly better than prior year levels.

In our U.S. wholesale operations, Risk Placement Services, organic was about 5%. Open brokerage
organic was more than 20% due to strong renewals, fueled by double-digit rate increases. Our MGA
programs binding businesses were up about 2%. Retention was better sequentially, but as expected, new
business wins are still lagging given the economy.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

Moving to the U.K. Around 4.5% organic for the quarter. In both our retail and specialty operations,
new and lost business was consistent with prior year. And special mention to our aviation team. They
performed well in their largest quarter of the year, helping clients navigate exposures that were down
significantly, call it, 30% to 40%, and rate increases that pushed premiums close to pre-COVID levels.

Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of about 1%. The spread between new and lost
business was similar to last year, but we are not getting as much lift from rate and exposure as we had in
previous years.

And finally, our Canadian retail operations posted organic of 13%, another terrific new business quarter
combined with a nice tick-up in client retention and strong rate environment. So overall, our global PC
operations posted 4.5% organic, which is a bit better than the 4% we discussed at our December Investor
Day.

Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Fourth quarter organic was around
minus 2%, which is at the favorable end of what we thought during our December IR Day. Similar to the
previous couple of quarters, fees from consulting arrangements and special project work were down.
However, revenue from our traditional health and welfare business continues to hold up with slightly
positive fourth quarter organic, which is an encouraging sign. So when I bring PC and benefits together,
total Brokerage segment organic of 3.1%, a really strong quarter in this environment and even better
when you consider the tough compare against the fourth quarter 2019 of over 6%.

Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market, starting with the rate environment. Global PC
rates continue to march higher during the fourth quarter and overall. Rate was up around 8% across our
footprint. Rates in Canada led the way, up more than 12%. The U.S. was up more than 8% with wholesale
stronger than retail, including rate increases of 15% within our wholesale open brokerage operations,
followed by the U.K., including London Specialty, at about 5% and Australia and New Zealand combined in
the low single digits.

By line of business, property and professional liability are up 12%. Other casualty lines are up mid- to
high single digits. And workers' comp was flat to modestly positive. Not only are PC rates continuing to
rise, terms and conditions are tightening, and capacity is becoming increasingly constrained for some
coverages. Nearly every area and line of business is firm or firming, and there are even a few lines that
are very hard like umbrella, cyber and public company D&O.

So needless to say, it is a difficult PC environment. This is where our teams excel: helping businesses,
many of which are still struggling, navigate the market through creative program design, shopping
coverages and altering programs with increasing deductibles or reduced limits to help their risk
management programs fit their budgets.

Looking forward, I see a similar PC market conditions continuing in 2021. And while economic growth is
coming, the pace of the recovery remains uncertain. So we remain laser-focused on what we can control,
delivering the very best insurance and risk management advice, now successfully doing this virtually more
than ever before, constantly improving our high-quality customer service, engaging with new prospects
and growing our new business pipeline.

Thus far in January, full policy cancellations and other midterm policy adjustments are trending similar
to January 2020. While it's still early, we are seeing year-over-year renewal premium increases at levels
comparable to fourth quarter 2020. On the benefit side, the annual enrollment season is behind us. And
for many of our clients, we saw covered lives stabilized from last year's declines, while retention and
new business were similar to pre-COVID levels. In addition, a few of our benefits consulting practices are
seeing increased activity and engagements early on in the year. So while there's a lot of the year left,
these early January indications give me further conviction that full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic
will be even better than the 3.2% we delivered in 2020.

Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. Following an active December, we finished the fourth quarter with
10 completed brokerage mergers representing about $100 million of estimated annualized revenues. And
we've announced a handful more so far in January, representing an additional $85 million of estimated

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

annualized revenues. This includes the Bollington merger in the U.K., which we think will close in early
February after receiving regulatory approval this week. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining
us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.

As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have 30 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing
around $300 million of annualized revenues. We believe we are the platform of choice for successful
entrepreneurs looking to take their business to the next level by leveraging our niche expertise, our tools
and data, in addition to being a great place for their employees to advance their careers. We expect to
have a very active 2021, particularly in the U.S. due to concerns related to possible tax changes.

So to wrap up the Brokerage segment. For the full year, we delivered 5.4% growth in revenue, 3.2% all in
organic growth; adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 418 basis points, fueled by cost savings of about
$180 million. And we completed 27 mergers, representing about $250 million of estimated annualized
revenue. A fantastic year for the brokerage team.

Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic
edged back into positive territory, nicely surpassing our December expectations of being down as much
as 2%. We had some positive lift due to increasing COVID-related workers' compensation claims and
saw strong retention and new business. So we ended 2020 with full year organic of minus 2.7%. In this
environment, to close a year in which core claim counts were down double digits for more than 10 months
of the year and after posting a 10% organic decline in the second quarter alone is a just terrific recovery
story.

Going back to April and the beginning of the pandemic, we set our sights on delivering full year 2020
adjusted EBITDAC similar to 2019, even with full year revenues forecasted to be down $30 million or
more. And boy, did the team deliver. The team proactively managed its workforce, carefully rebalanced
claim loads across adjusters and implemented expense controls, ultimately driving 2020 adjusted
EBITDAC of nearly $150 million, $4 million better than 2019. Being able to grow full year EBITDAC despite
organic revenues that were backwards is just fantastic work by the Risk Management team.

As we look forward, January claim counts are trending very similar to the fourth quarter with many clients
operating still at partial capacity. With new business sold in 2020 incepting over the next few quarters and
still room for substantial job recovery, we believe full year 2021 organic will be closer to pre-COVID levels,
in the mid-single-digit range.

Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique and resilient Gallagher culture. Culture guides
our organization, our people in both good times and even more so in demanding times. And I believe
culture is the source of our perseverance, our determination and our constant push for excellence. I'm
extremely proud of our collective successes during 2020, but more importantly, how we came together
to work as a team even while physically apart. Our culture has never been better, and I believe we are
ending 2021 even stronger.

Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll echo Pat's comments. A great quarter and an excellent
year. I, too, would like to extend my appreciation to the team.

Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cost savings, provide some -- a few observations from our
CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Then I'll do a vignette on our clean energy
investments and finish with some thoughts on M&A, cash and liquidity.

All right. Let's turn to the earnings release, Page 6, to the Brokerage EBITDAC table. You'll see that we
grew adjusted EBITDAC by about $85 million over last year's fourth quarter, resulting in about 580 basis
points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $60 million of cost savings relative to
fourth quarter '19 adjusted for [ mergers ]. So underlying margin expansion was about 115 basis points
on 3.1% all-in organic, which on its own is impressive.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

When you move to Page 8, the Risk Management segment. We grew EBITDAC a bit more than $4 million
on slightly positive organic, resulting in about 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that,
we realized about $5 million of cost savings relative to Q4 '19, which was moderated just a little by new
client ramp-up costs. So underlying margins were up just a bit. That, too, is excellent given the flattish
organic this quarter.

Categories of fourth quarter savings for the combined Brokerage and Risk Management segment were
consistent with second and third quarter: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, about $25
million; reduced consulting and professional fees, $14 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce
savings, $16 million; office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs, about $10 million. So that totals
around $65 million, which is consistent with what we said at our December IR Day.

Now looking forward, the pace of recovery isn't clear. We came into the year with another virus surge,
now maybe some positive cases coming down. Some areas are imposing more lockdowns, yet others are
loosening up. There's been some successes but mostly delays in the vaccine rollout. And now it's looking
like more and more that the stimulus might be caught in gridlock here in the U.S.

Regardless of whether you're looking at half full or half empty glass, very few outlooks are expecting the
business environment to be much different by the end of the first quarter. So for us, when it comes to
first quarter '21, we're seeing organic in the 3% to 4% range, and we're seeing expense savings similar to
fourth quarter '20, call it another $600 million -- excuse me, $60 million. If that happens, we could again
show margin expansion of about 500 basis points.

Then looking towards second, third and fourth quarters of '21, it gets a little more tricky when you do your
models because the slope of the recovery is still uncertain. And we're already realizing substantial COVID-
induced expense savings beginning early in April of '20. But if the recovery steps up in those quarters and
we get back to organic of, say, high 4% or 5%, it does give us a path towards holding full year margins,
especially if travel and entertainment remains limited.

Now all of this needs to be taken into context. In 2017, '18 and '19, we were expanding margins 50 to
75 basis points a year on organic in that 4% to 5% range. Then the COVID hit. We executed on our cost
containment playbook and still managed to grow organic 3%. That pops margins over 400 basis points in
the face of this global pandemic. So now what I'm saying is that we have a fighting chance to hold or even
improve full year margins here in '21 on the prospect of getting closer to pre-pandemic organic growth
later in the year. To me, that's still about a bullish story as you can write.

Now if we move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. On Page 2, the blue
fourth quarter column. You'll see most of the items are consistent with what we provided during our
December IR Day, and that's in the gray column. FX came in $0.01 better and severance and integration
costs also $0.01 better when you compare that to the prior quarters.

Also on Page 2 in the reddish column, we're now providing our quarterly look at 2021. A few comments.
First, foreign exchange. With the U.S. dollar weakening and if it stays that way throughout the year, 2021
revenue could see a $100 million tailwind in Brokerage and $14 million in Risk Management. Wouldn't be
much EPS impact within Risk Management but could translate into $0.05 or so for our Brokerage segment.
And that would even be better on reported EBITDAC.

Second, amortization expense. We're currently forecasting a little over $100 million a quarter in
Brokerage, which includes the all-announced mergers to date. You can see the roll in revenues associated
with all-announced mergers to date on Page 5. And then also, don't forget to adjust your amortization
expense in the second and later quarters to reflect any future M&A you might be including in your model.

Third, when you look at M&A multiples shown on Page 2 on the last line in the table, like Pat said, we had
an active December, closing 10, 3 of which were on the larger end of our typical tuck-in size. That pushed
the multiple up a turn or so this year but still creating a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple. More
importantly, it brings some really terrific merger partners to the team, letting us grow better together over
the long haul.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

When you move to Page 3 of the CFO commentary in the Corporate table. When you compare our
December IR Day estimates in the gray column with our fourth quarter results in the blue column, we
posted favorable interest expense due to strong cash flows. We had better clean energy earnings, in line
M&A expense and a slightly more favorable corporate line.

Also on Page 3, we're now providing a first look at '21 ranges for the Corporate segment, and that's in the
reddish column. Nothing surprising, and there's no change on our outlook for clean energy, still in that $60
million to $75 million of annual after-tax earnings we provided during our IR Day.

So this brings me to my vignette on clean energy. You'll read on Page 4, Note 5 of the CFO commentary
document that these investments are winding down at the end of '21, unless there's an extension. That
means in 2022, we will have 0 GAAP earnings. But remember, that will be more than replaced with
substantial cash flow benefits. In other words, '21 and prior years were the credit generation years when
we report the GAAP benefit in our P&L, but '22 starts the cash harvest years where we'll get considerably
larger cash benefits in our operating cash flows.

Here's the shortcut way to think about how to compute those cash benefits. First, if you go to Page 14
of the earnings release, about the seventh line down in our balance sheet, you'll read that we have a
deferred tax asset of over $1 billion, mostly consisting of clean energy credit carryforwards. With 1 more
year of credit generation, that asset should grow by another $100 million. So call it $1.1 billion of credit
carryovers by the end of '21. Then assume in '22 we will begin using more credits than we've been using
thus far.

How -- third, then how fast we'll be using those credits will depend on how fast we grow our U.S. taxable
income. But for this illustration, and if you assume a 7-year period, it might mean we would be harvesting
about $125 million to $150 million in '22, with that ramping up to, say, about $175 million to $200 million
in 2028. It's a little odd that GAAP earnings go to 0, and then the cash benefits become dramatically
better, but that's just how it works. This is and has been a really important part of our story over the last
decade, so I think it was worth some extra time today.

All right. Let me go on to some comments on cash and M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand was
nearly $700 million. We have a significant untapped capacity on our revolving credit facility, and we have
another year ahead of us of really strong cash flows. That might mean that we would have perhaps up to
$2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in '21. That's a terrific position as we come into a year that we see as
perhaps the most active year ever in the brokerage M&A space.

Okay. That wraps up '20 and we're positioned really well for '21. Organic looks better. Bolt-on M&A looks
better. We have a decent chance of keeping a largest chunk of our cost savings, [ assuming we're going
to have a ] year of harvesting cash flows from our clean energy initiatives. And most important, I can feel
our team's excitement about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. My thanks to them
for another fantastic year.

Back to you, Pat.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO
Thanks, Doug. Operator, let's go to questions and answers, if we can.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question, Doug, I appreciate the color you guys continue to provide on the expense savings. So
as we continue to think about, I guess, coming out of COVID, it's -- I know last quarter, I believe you guys
had said, right, kind of when things settled, that half of the save could persist and maybe think about
kind of some level between half and the $60 million, I guess, I'm just talking about Brokerage, in kind of
the middle 2 quarters of 2021. Do those figures -- I would assume that they still seem about right given
where we sit today.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think your recollection is right. I did say that there was a silver lining coming out of something so
terrible, and that's that we've learned a lot about ourselves. I think that ultimately, we think there's $125
million to $150 million of annual cost savings that we might -- that we're pulling forward earlier into our
continued march on margin improvement. As it emerges for the quarters this year, it really is kind of a
sensitive interplay between organic and then just really what happens with the economy.

We'll follow our customers' expectations. We are learning that they are much more receptive now to
virtual interactions, allowing us to get our niche expertise at the point of sale easier than jumping on an
airplane and spending days traveling. So we are learning a lot and -- but we will follow our customers'
expectations. How that exactly plays out in the second and third and fourth quarters really depends on
how fast the organic moves from that 3% to 4% range up into maybe the 5% or 6% range.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then on the M&A environment, so you guys mentioned, right, you closed a
couple of larger deals to end December, right, that drove up the multiples. On the $300 million of revenue
within those 30 term sheets that you guys mentioned, can you just give us a sense like kind of the skew?
Are there any larger ones in there? Or is it more just kind of the typical smaller bolt-on deals that you
guys focused on of late as well?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I would say that just clarifying that we had some larger tuck-in ones at the end of December, call
it, revenues in that $20 million, $25 million range. The deal sheets that we're looking at right now, $300
million of revenue spread across 30, 35 term sheets, they're in the smaller range, nice, nice local family-
owned entrepreneurial businesses. And the range is lower than where we are right now full year. So I
would see us back kind of more where we were in the second, third -- the first, second and third quarters.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then can you give us an update on Capsicum, your reinsurance business, I guess, where that
sits at the end of the year, how that's been trending from both a growth and margin perspective?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

Yes. It's doing really well. We couldn't be more pleased with the team. Pat can talk about some of the
cultural excitement that we have on that. But financially, they're growing in double digits still. Their
margins are north of 30%. And we see terrific opportunities for that business.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. As you know, Elyse, this is my second go around. This one's a lot better.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then one last question, Doug. Is there a chance that there is any kind of extender bill that would
extend your ability? I know you gave us a lot of helpful color, assuming that you can't generate any credit
beyond the end of this year. Is there a chance that there could be any extender bill or, I guess, most likely
not at this point?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Well, sure. I always think there's a chance. And I think that when Congress said about this, about helping
us get better in burning some fossil fuel, they wanted to help in making it better. So as long as we're going
to be using it, let's make it better.

So I think they see that, and I think they see the opportunity for this to continue to help innovate. So we
hope that there's some -- there are some proposed legislative changes that would -- that possibly could
make the extension happen. So we're hopeful for that. And we certainly are trying to get that message on
everybody's desk that we can.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. In thinking about the sales pipeline, I'm trying to contemplate, I guess, in my mind, clients would
have hunkered down early on in COVID and been less likely to change brokers or to really contemplate a
move like that. Does it feel like people are just getting more comfortable with the world we live in today
and that's opening up? Or when we think about the path from 3% to 4% organic growth, the 5% to
6% organic growth, are we just waiting for the economy to improve and the shots to get in the arms so
everyone can get back out there and living?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Phil, this is Pat. There's a lot of answers to your question, so let me back up a little bit. First of all,
did the clients hunker down? You start with March of last year, and the answer to that is yes. Having said
that, they have a lot of needs and a lot of requests. So we were running webinars around COVID, return to
work, all kinds of different -- cyber, what have you. Blew my mind. Thousands of people signed up. And it
was not unusual for us to run a webinar with 5,000 attendees. I mean I never heard of such a thing.

So there's a huge thirst for information, which helped our people, of course, know exactly some of the
hot buttons that they should be talking to potential clients. And to get out -- and I was amazed. I really
would have told you that I thought maybe new business would have hunkered down. I didn't think our lost
business would increase because of that.

In fact, it's amazing to me the kind of new business that we did generate. So I think that it gives us a lot
of confidence to sell the kind of business we sold last year. And you'd get some fall-over from '19 into the
first quarter, maybe a little in the second quarter. But everything from May on was really generated after
the first of the year. So really an incredible new business year.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

Secondly, are we seeing the advent potentially of people beginning to come back into the businesses?
I think, yes. I think we're seeing that there is going to -- and whether stimulus happens or not, I think
businesses have learned how to do this. Take just a look at your local restaurants. About a year ago, they
weren't -- or March, they might -- they're not going to survive. Takeout is not making them robust but
they're surviving and they're ready. I mean in the Chicago land area now, we can go to restaurants again.
They have very limited occupancy. But they are ready. They're welcoming. They want people back and
people are excited about it. So I think the pent-up demand for people to be able to go do things is also
going to be helpful.

Then lastly, let's not forget something. I told you guys this 1,000 times. I don't like hard markets. And I
get it, they all look good on paper, what have you. But they tick every customer off, and they're suffering
through this right now because they don't only have a choice, but they are going to shop. And we are
there for them to understand that both our data capabilities as well as our professional niche capabilities
and our ability to work them through the process of taking more risk, becoming more -- becoming more
self-insured, that's our bread and butter. We're better at that than anybody. So I think that, that is -- it's
all of those combined that leads me to believe that we see a very robust new business year ahead in '21
and '22.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And switching gears a bit. I feel like the dividend is something that we don't really talk about, but I
was a bit surprised by the extent of the raise in the past week or so. Is there a long-term growth rate that
you target, a payout ratio? Maybe you could just refresh our understanding on how you think about the
dividend.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I mean we did pop it up a little bit more yesterday. We did raise. I think it's an indication that our
cash flows are very strong. We typically raise it a few cents and then maybe a little bit more and sit there
for a year or so. But I think there was a vote of confidence by the Board that said that let's take the
dividend up just a little bit more this week.

So we did that. And so we'll look at that every year. But we were -- we agreed with the observation that
cash is strong so let's increase the dividend.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I guess a first question on expenses. I know we've talked about this a lot, but it's just -- it's been
phenomenal. And so I'm trying to understand. Do you feel that a lot of these expenses that will persist are
kind of more Gallagher specific and it'll give you a leg up on your competitors? Or do you feel like a lot of
these things are things that just -- your competitors are going to catch up to you eventually, you're just
kind of first mover? I know that's maybe a complicated question, but just trying to get a sense of whether
this kind of gives you an advantage that will persist versus peers or others just are going to kind of follow
you guys but just it will take them time.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

All right. So let's break this into a couple of things. Let me talk about who are our competitors. 90% of
the time, we're competing with somebody that's smaller than us, right? So when you look at the -- where
we're really getting leverage, I think that we're getting leverage because of our scale, especially relative to
that, to that level of competitor, the smaller ones that we compete with day in and day out.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

I think we have opportunities to continue to use our lower-cost labor locations and our centers of
excellence. I think our ability in order to rationalize our real estate footprint, I think that we can buy goods
and services cheaper, I think our ability to automate many of the interactions with the clients and with our
own employees, all of those things, I would say that Gallagher is positioned. We have a common agency
management system in most of our countries, in most of our businesses. Those are things that we believe
that will continue to bring scale advantages versus our smaller competitors.

How do I feel about it comparing to, let's say, the other top 10 brokers? First of all, you got to pick the
ones that have the culture that want to work together and make it happen. And then you've got to pick
the ones that haven't already gone down this journey to see whether or not they're there yet or not.
But we think that we're in a really terrific place to continue to leverage our technologies and our scale
compared to most of our competition. So I don't know if they're catching up or if they're already there or
they just don't have the culture to pull it off.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. That is helpful, Doug. Did you -- more straightforward question, free cash flow for 2021. Did you
cite kind of an estimate for what we should expect?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

I didn't, but I said that we probably could do about up to $2.5 billion in M&A for this year. So if you break
that apart, we've got $700 million on hand. And if you look at our operating cash flows being somewhere
in the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range, something like that, I think -- and then you borrow a little bit
more, so that's how you get to the $2.5 billion.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And just lastly, curious, a broker that reported earnings earlier today kind of actually talked about
stepping on the gas on hiring and taking advantage of some of the M&A that's taking place in the industry.
Just curious, are you seeing any increased opportunities on the hiring side?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Definitely seeing opportunities from 2 areas. Doug mentioned that 90% of the time we compete, we
compete with smaller brokers. And the smaller brokers have the problem of just simply not having the
capabilities that clients are starting to ask for. And these can be simple questions, like how do I know?
How do I know you just gave me the best deal? When I was out selling 30 years ago on a daily basis, that
would be answered by saying, "I went to 3 carriers, that's the best price." That does not float today. They
want to know what you're doing with clients, what carriers are doing it, where the ranges are, what their
loss ratio looks like compared to others. They want detail. They want data.

Smaller people can't do that. So what you've got is folks that are losing accounts to the likes of ourselves,
and we're out telling them, "Why wouldn't you come to a place that's happy to pay you for what you hunt
and kill, and at the same time, you have all the support and the capabilities in the world." We can write
any account of any size, no matter where it's located in the world. And that's very attractive. And then,
of course, there's always opportunities with larger competitors. We clearly believe we offer a cultural
difference.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

Just a follow-up on Mike's question. I don't know if I missed it in the prepared remarks. The free cash flow
for 2020 was what?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

For 2020, our free cash flow and our operating -- our free operating cash flow will be about $1.4 billion
this year in the cash flow statement. When we file our 10-K in a week, you'll see it's around $1.4 billion.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And so you said the guidance for '21 is $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Was there some onetime benefits that
flowed through in '20 that you're not going to realize in '21? Otherwise, I would normally expect the free
cash flow to grow. After growing your -- your top line and bottom line, I expect free cash flow to grow.
What am I missing?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

I don't think it will appreciably change significantly in '20 versus '21. We'll grow at -- if we hold margins in
there, we're going to grow based -- I'm not including acquisitions in that number. So the cash flows off the
acquisitions, we'll also use that, too.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So then just to close loop on your previous comments, when you said in '22 that you'll drive -- was it $125
million cash benefit from the pull-down of the tax credit...

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

In '22, yes.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I can use -- yes. I can assume whatever free cash flow growth I have off of '21, on an operating basis,
and then just add on an additional $125 million. Is that a fair way to think about it?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. If you factor in mergers, yes, that's a fair way.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. The second question I had. Listen, I know you've commented on this before, and you were sort of
dancing around it in the prepared remarks and the Q&A. But you talked about an 8% rate increase across
your entire footprint. And you talked about terms and conditions being changed -- changing. I'm just
curious about your customers and how they're dialing up retentions or reducing limits to offset the price.
And I guess what I'm really trying to gauge is how does it look here at year-end '20 versus how it was
looking at year-end '19.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think it's continuing to get stronger, Greg. This is Pat. I think -- look, if we're telling you that
basically, we're seeing rate increases of around 8% and organic is about 3.5%, you see a 5% difference,
where did it go? Well, it went to modification of what the purchaser is buying. And that's our job.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

I mean we sit down with these guys and say -- men and women, and say, "Look, here are your options.
You had $250 million of limits last year. We could show you the stats that, that would be a very unusual
claim to break the 150 barrier. Do you need that extra $100 million?" And we help them work through
that.

Retentions are a very big part of it. And a big part of it is, and this is where our history comes from,
clients that enter self-insurance for the first time. I don't understand this. What's the deal? Well, why don't
you take $150,000 retention. And you'll basically save X on the transaction, but you'll only have to pay if
you do have the claims.

Now let's really focus on loss control. So I don't need to get too detailed with you. But that's really --
that's what we do for a living.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Right. Well, I guess what I was -- I had assumed that the difference between the 8 and the 3 was a
combination of retentions, reduced limits and reduced economic activity. But maybe I was overthinking it.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

That's fair. Yes, I look at the economic activity. That's fair.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. The final -- I guess the final thing, and I know you've been talking about M&A. But listen, the dirty
little, not so big of a secret is the 2 -- #2 and #3 are out there in the merger dance. And it feels like that
is an opportunity for dislocation, for customers being unhappy, for you to make new hires, et cetera. And
so I guess from the time that they announced this thing back in March of last year to now, have you seen
anything in the marketplace that's disruptive that you see as an opportunity? Or is the disruption, if there
is any, going to come later in this process?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

So Greg, let me -- obviously, I'm not going to talk about our competitors. And I -- but I've said to you
many times, change is good for us. And when we move to further consolidation of 3 players at the
top end of the spectrum and our name happens to be one of them, there's lots and lots and lots of
opportunities along the lines of everything you're talking about. There's clients that have never really
talked to Gallagher that we're going to have a shot at.

I mean if you go back in time, and I went to the RIMS Conference 100 years ago, nobody came by our
booth. We've got 5,000 people that show up to our RIMS Conference virtually. I mean there's interest. And
so really, it's -- we're in a very, very good position.

Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.

Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I guess my first question, just trying to tie the organic growth to margins next year. So I would think there
are different ways to get to 4% to 5% organic growth, and each of those potentially has a very different
impact on margins, namely, if you're getting more of that organic growth through rate versus exposure
unit growth. So maybe you can talk about that a little bit.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

And then on the flip side, I think in the past, you used to talk about needing to get at least 3% organic
in order to keep margins stable. How should we think about, let's say, 3% organic growth for -- if you
achieve that in '21? What does that mean for margins?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Right. The workload -- the difference in workload on a customer that is adding exposure units, i.e., adding
vehicles or changing miles, isn't significant, whether they're adding a couple of values. So the workload
associated with a rate increase that comes from exposure units, not that much more. If it comes from
additional rate, that means we want to go out and shop it more, we'll take a little bit more effort. But
because of our efficiencies, we can do that at a pretty low-cost month.

So just the number of policies or the exposure units or a modest rate increase or decrease doesn't change
our workload that much. So I wouldn't say that, that would have a significant impact on margin if you're
kind of in that 2% to 4% range on rates and exposures.

When you're asking the next part of the question about where do we see the kind of the old, tried and true
line, if you grow organically, 3% is our margin lift in it, yes, I think there is. Is it in this year, in '21, since
we are up 400 basis points in margin this year alone? I think that would be pretty tough to get at 3%.

Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. So beyond '21, though, if you do achieve 3% organic growth, even though the bar is so much
higher today, you can still achieve margin improvement even with that?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. We've moved that to 3% to 4% over the number of years. As our margins are getting over 30%,
there's just not as much there to harvest as our technologies get rolled out. As our scale grows, we'll be
able to have margin improvement on those tuck-in acquisitions that can come on to our chassis, can use
our technologies. It's really more about selling more than it is necessarily about making more margins.
But there would be upward tick.

Do I see that at 3% organic growth in '22? I don't know if we'd have that much more margin expansion.
Do it for 5 years in a row, sure, there could be some.

Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then with this step-up in Gallagher's margins, with a good portion of that being retained, how
do you think about acquisitions and potential targets? I would think that the bar to clear there could be
significantly higher just given that your margins are higher today.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

If they're running good margins for the business that they're in and they show a prospect for growth,
we'll buy them regardless of whether it's dilutive to our margin that they come in. They are what they
are. And if we can improve their margins, terrific. If they're already at the upper end of the scale, then
terrific. But they just happen to be in a space that requires a significant amount of service that maybe,
let's say, that their margins are 22% but they have a good growth. We'll still buy them and we'll let you
know. We've done that in the past where we've said a rolling impact of acquisitions had X, Y or Z impact
on our margins.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a question on P&C exposure units. In the press release, it sounded like we're continuing to see an
increase in exposure versus April and May 2020, which -- not a big surprise. But I guess I'm wondering
how exposure units were trending thus far this year relative to 4Q. Obviously, a tough comp year-over-
year, but are we continuing to see an improvement in exposure units in 4Q? Or has it sort of flattened out
thus far in January?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

They're flat in January.

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think that, Dave, we've kind of bounced off the bottom. We're not seeing significant daily step-up.
We are seeing -- we look at our global positive endorsements that go through on our policies on every
day. And we can see that, that's still showing a nice upward trend similar to pre-pandemic. But we weren't
seeing massive exposure unit growth a year ago, in the fourth quarter '19, early into '20, you weren't
seeing it there. But there is a steady increase. There's been a bounce off the bottom. And we would expect
throughout '21 and '22, as the economy recovers, that those exposure units would go back up also. But
not much difference today than, let's say, in December.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then I'm just -- I guess I'm wondering after we've gotten through
some of the renewals here in January. I guess are you seeing any movement on the commission rates?
And I guess just conversations around contingents and supplementals, maybe an update on how those are
looking?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think that commission rates and the like are solid. We're not having pressure from our
carrier partners to try to diminish their payment to their distributors. And as far as contingents and
supplementals, we think we'll have a solid year, some growth this year.

J. Patrick Gallagher

Yes. Well, I think, Doug, if you want it granular to the percent, I can't do that. But it's -- you hit right on,
Mark. I mean we've got claims in recovery. We mentioned in our prepared remarks that COVID claims, in
particular, have helped out. Economic activity, people are adding more folks. And those are the factors that
produce claims. So as we get people driving, as we get people going back to work, they will come back to
more normal levels. And we don't hope to get more COVID claims, but they are filling a hole in the bucket
right now.

we spent a couple of million -- or 1 million or so on some new client ramp-up costs as we transition. And
then we've got a solid outlook for this year being back in mid-single digits, maybe this year. So that team
has done a terrific job of new business wins, too. Didn't hit a ton this year, but it will next year.

Mark Douglas Hughes

How are you thinking about the open brokerage? It sounds like that was particularly strong in the fourth
quarter. Has that continued into Q1?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it's continued. It's very strong, Mark. I mean you understand wholesaling is a business that has an
awful lot of market leverage up and down. So we're in a very firm property market, in particular, in our
team. And this is -- what's exciting about this is, you know this, brokers do not want to go to wholesalers.
It's not a friendly business in the sense that we're looking to give you 1/3 of our commission.

So they're providing an unbelievable service to the brokerage community with whom we trade about
15,000 in the United States alone. And those people need help and we're giving them help. And that's
why, along with rate, so we're getting it both in item count and rate just by being ready to be very, very
helpful.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Managing Director (sic) [ Piper Sandler ].

Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I wanted to ask, turn a little bit more about your comment about the lack of shopping by the customers.
I mean I think if a hard market is one with increased shopping. But your comments seem to square with
every company I cover where the retention level seem to be really unchanged through the last couple of
years. Why do you think we haven't seen the increase in shopping? Why do you think the customers seem
to be just kind of taking the rate and moving on?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Paul, again, my comment was predicated on 2 things. To start with in the pandemic, I didn't think
customers would be having people knocking on their door as much as they do right now and as much as
they did in 2019. And I think that as they started to ferret their way through what's going to go on in this
pandemic themselves, they were willing to very much hunker down and say, I've got a good insurance
program. This is where it is. I don't have -- I've got to be considering my own survival tactics. And I
surmise there'd be less shopping of our existing business.

I was right a little bit. It certainly didn't stop shopping. It wasn't like everything came to a grounding
halt. But if you're a good broker, and we've got really good competition in this market, in a hard market
you early on explain to your client that if you are unhappy with a hard market and you want to be really
unhappier, shop the hell out of it because you're going to get slaughtered. And in fact, in a hard market,
shopping does decrease. Pardon me.

Unfortunately, as things ease up a bit, people are unhappy and intends to increase shopping. So right now,
we're in a very firm and firming market, and people understand that they need our expertise. And it also
does scare some of those little competitors that we compete with 90% of the time out of being so bold as
to say they can do better than we do. Pretty tough to prove it.

Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I think there was a flight to quality. I think that when you sit down and look at what you get from
Gallagher, you get more. And how do you -- you get more from us. You get price. You get service. You get
access. You get creativity. You get innovation. It's pretty hard to leave that if you don't have competition
knocking on the door that can offer that. So I think it's a different era from when you and I were cutting
our teeth, Paul, that basically small brokers competing with small brokers offering kind of the same thing.
You get so much more from Gallagher today than you ever got before.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

And another thing piling in on that, once you show someone how to get through these days and primarily
by doing what we do so well, which is help people deal with assuming risk, bringing Gallagher Bassett in
to help pay the claims, mitigating those claims and showing them that in the long term, they've really
garnered a lot more control of their destiny, you never lose those clients. A client that moves from the
traditional first dollar purchase into any form of self-insurance, pooling with other public entities, moving
into a group captive, doing their own single parent captive, taking a large retention on their workers' comp
in a very heavy employee state, once you do that for them, it shifts the game completely.

Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Makes sense. Switching to a different topic. Obviously, with the change in the tax rates potentially going
away, we're probably looking at a change in how we value your company, perhaps on earnings more or
something else like free cash flow. I guess my question is, is free cash flow the right number? Is operating
cash flow the right number? Just curious as I know that there are customer monies that get intertwined
with yours in the measurements. And what's your theory on how we should measure cash flow, if we had
a proper way to do it?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

All right. Great. I think that's a terrific question. And -- all right. First, I still believe that EBITDAC is a
good proxy for how to value a broker. Then you just have to back off the cash taxes paid and interest
expense, of course, and the cash taxes paid and interest yield on that. But if you basically start with
EBITDAC, you're going to get pretty close to the way, and that's been a traditional way.

So what does that mean for Gallagher is that we've said this for years, we still pay taxes. People
sometimes think that we're not paying our fair share. That's not the case at all. We still pay taxes. It runs
about -- I've said this, if you go back to when tax changed, that we are -- we think that we're going to pay
in that 5% to 6% to 7% of EBITDA range just as a proxy. We're probably at that same range even if tax
rates go up to 28% from 21%. It would be a book rate differential. It wouldn't really be a cash difference.
If the Biden tax measures were put in place, it might cost us $10 million a year in taxes more, Paul. But it
wouldn't be a huge number.

The value of tax credits become more valuable if tax rates go up. So really, for Gallagher, it's to take our
EBITDA, back off our CapEx, back off our interest expense and put in 7% or 8% for cash taxes paid, and
you get pretty close to the cash flow amount for Gallagher. I might have missed something in there, but I
think I got most of the pieces in that. But I would start with EBITDA still.

One small question and one big one. Are the claims that you're seeing recover in Gallagher basket --
sorry, Gallagher Bassett, are any of those like just late reported claims that occurred earlier? Or is that
just now you're seeing more claims because of COVID or because of rising economic activity?

J. Patrick Gallagher

More claims rising out of better economic activity and the addition of COVID claims, which was a category
that didn't exist a year ago.

Meyer Shields

Okay. Perfect. And then bigger picture, Pat, you talked about Gallagher's ability to write any client. To
actually win those clients, do you need to have a more extensive set of consulting services comparable to
the brokers that are bigger than you?

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we do. Yes, when you have our niche -- when you -- I'm sorry, Meyer, what?

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

No. When you said we do, is that, that Gallagher has those services or need them in the same before...

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

No, no, we do. We've got them. I mean Doug was going to go down the line of it. If you take a look at our
verticals, our niche capabilities, I mean we don't stand second to anybody. And I can go through the list
of those. We provide it to you every time we get a chance. But you take a public sector client anywhere
in the world, you take a college or university, we had some great college and university wins in the last
month, names that if I threw them out, which I won't today, you'd go, wow, okay. And I'm talking on a
global basis, where we're probably the largest provider of college and university risk management advice
in Australia.

So you're not going to be winning those types of accounts. We're very -- we've gotten much stronger in
terms of our benefits capabilities. When you take a look at what we do on the consulting work for health
and welfare alone but also all the other human resource needs, I mean, we're clearly a top 3 consultant
in that regard. So no, I mean look, we know that over 90% of our business falls in clearly defined niches,
which we have expertise that we think is frankly better than our large competitors.

Our final question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I was just hoping, is there any way you can help frame for us what the ceiling on the Brokerage organic
growth -- Brokerage organic -- Brokerage margin might be?

Douglas K. Howell
Corporate VP & Chief Financial Officer

Phil, that's a tough question. I'd rather not, but I think that the answer is it's just such an interplay
between organic service expectation by our clients and then underlying inflation, too, that we face every
day in certain of that. Right now, we're in a low wage inflation environment. We've kind of been in a low
wage inflation environment since really 2007, 2008.

ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

We're getting more efficient with scale. Technology costs are coming down. On the other hand, there are
costs that -- more specific technical expertise cost more. Just getting smarter people on your payroll that
can handle some of the really, really technical aspects of what's going on. Systems, there's cost inflation in
systems right now.

So it's a tough, tough answer. But you're seeing the Brokerage business somehow is running around 30
points, plus or minus 2 points right now. That's the way it's running. You look across us and the other
large publics and you look at the PE-owned firms, there's a number around 30%, plus or minus a couple of
points there.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Phil. I think that's all our questions, yes?

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen -- yes, I would like to turn it back over to you, Mr. Gallagher for closing remarks.

J. Patrick Gallagher
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We mentioned this in our prepared
remarks, but we delivered an excellent quarter and full year. And we all know how difficult the economic
environment was. So I would like to thank all of our Gallagher professionals around the globe for being
flexible, working hard and never losing focus on our job at hand. I'm confident that we can deliver another
great year of financial performance in 2021 and truly believe that as an enterprise, we are just getting
started. So thanks for being with us, folks. We appreciate it.
