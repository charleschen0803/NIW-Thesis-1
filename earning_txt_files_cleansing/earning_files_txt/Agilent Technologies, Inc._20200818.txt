Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions]

And now I'd like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Robert, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year
2020. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy.

On the webcast today are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's
Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining for the Q&A after Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President
of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and
Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of Agilent CrossLab Group.

You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on
our website at investor.agilent.com.

Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most
directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all
references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and revenue growth will be
referred to on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and
divestitures completed within the past 12 months.

We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no
obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of
our risks and other factors.

And now I would like to turn the call over to Mike.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. The Agilent team delivered excellent
results in the third quarter in the midst of a historic global pandemic. Against this backdrop, Agilent's
performance once again highlights the strength and resiliency of our team and our business.

Agilent's Q3 revenues are $1.26 billion. Our revenues are down just 1% on a reported basis despite
COVID-19 headwinds in what we expect to be the year's most challenging quarter. On a core basis,
revenues are down 3%. These results demonstrate the strong resilience we have built into our business
over the past several years. EPS is $0.78 per share. This is a 3% year-over-year increase. Operating
margin improved 90 basis points over last year to 23.7%. Our Q3 results are further evidence of the
success of our profitable build-and-buy growth strategy. We continue to build a more resilient growth-
oriented business.

Last quarter, I talked to you about the 4 key priorities we're focused on during the COVID-19 pandemic:
protecting our people, being open for business for our customers, taking decisive action to observe our
P&L and balance sheet and unwavering commitment to growth. Staying focused on these priorities has
helped us navigate through the COVID-19 effects on our team, customers and business.

Our customers continue to respond very favorably to our team's engagement and our enhanced digital
capabilities. In fact, Q3 customer satisfaction rankings are at all-time highs. In all regions, we're seeing

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

improvements in lab access for our customers and increased non-COVID-19 testing volumes. There are,
however, regional and end market differences in the pacing of improvement. Lab access improved through
the quarter, although still not at pre-COVID-19 levels. Globally, lab access remains limited in academia,
non-COVID-19 research and testing labs. We're also seeing continued limited access to some private
sector research labs in Europe and the United States. Similarly, non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing volumes
improved throughout the quarter but remained down from prior year levels. Hospital access in Europe and
in the U.S. is improving, although disrupted at times by virus flare-ups.

While there are indications of improvement in economic growth at varying degrees across the globe,
caution remains at customer capital expenditure decisions. Consistent with our thinking coming into the
quarter, the pace of recovery varied by region. As expected, China led the way for us and exceeded our
expectations with revenues up 11%. China's growth in the quarter is broad-based across all end markets
and for all business groups. While improving, the rate of recovery in Europe and the Americas lags China
given the timing when these regions first felt the brunt of the pandemic, European revenues were down
5%. Americas market conditions trailed both China and Europe with revenues declining 10%. However, as
we exited the quarter, we are seeing signs of improvement in service activity, consumables and diagnostic
testing volumes. On a total company basis, we exited July with modest growth across all major markets.

Now let's talk about our performance by business groups. Our Life Science and Applied Markets Group
grew 2% on a reported basis and declined 4%. Our team is focused and determined to gain market
share despite a constrained capital environment. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with an energized
and stable sales team, is paying dividends. I'm also very proud of the contribution to our cell analysis
technologies are making in COVID-19 virus research. Our M&A strategy is working and making a
difference in the pandemic fight.

Our CrossLab Group revenues grew 1%. Increase in customer activity led to increased sales of
consumables and an uptick of on-demand services. The CrossLab team continues to win large, multiyear
contracts for enterprise laboratory management that will benefit us moving forward. We are continually
increasing our competitiveness in this space.

Our Diagnostic and Genomics Group revenues declined 8%. While our overall pathology and genomics
businesses are down for the quarter, we did see gradual improvement in diagnostic testing volumes and
non-COVID-19 lab openings. Partially offsetting this, our Nucleic Acid Solutions business delivered another
strong quarter, growing almost 25%.

We are very excited about the future of our NASD business. As we announced earlier today, we plan to
more than double oligo manufacturing capacity at our new Frederick, Colorado site. This expansion helps
us meet significantly increasing customer demand. We are growing double digit and expect to continue
this rate of growth in the coming years.

We continue to invest in our portfolio across all our businesses. Highlights during the quarter included
LSAG launching 2 new LC/MS products, the Agilent 6470B Triple Quad and the Agilent RapidFire 400
systems. Both products are aimed at high-throughput labs, driving productivity and superior resolution.

We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which is a new subscription service using instrument
center technologies to provide data-driven usage in sites. This helps drive improved customer economics
and lab productivity. While early, we are seeing strong interest from customers in this service.

During the quarter, our PD-L1 assay was approved by the FDA for expanded use in non-small cell lung
cancer, helping guide physicians in selecting treatments using specific immunotherapies.

Our team is very proud of the role their company is planning in the global COVID-19 fight. We are
supporting COVID-19 research, testing and therapeutic vaccine development. Our efforts in the global
fight against the virus delivered 2 percentage points of reported growth. We are accelerating efforts to
make a difference in the battle against COVID-19 and have mobilized across Agilent team to maximize
customer support.

Let me close with a few comments on our outlook in the coming quarter. While there's still a significant
uncertainty regarding the continued pace of recovery, we expect the July trend of gradual improvement in

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

our business to continue into Q4. By region, China will continue to be a positive story for us and lead the
return to growth. Europe is starting to trend upward. Americas are also expected to improve but at a lower
rate than China and Europe.

Globally, improved lab access, increasing non-COVID-19 testing and a slowly recovering global economy
are all positive signs. I remain absolutely convinced Agilent will emerge from this pandemic with a
stronger position in the marketplace. Our continued focus action is our 4 priorities: protect the team,
support our customers, preserve our P&L and balance sheet and our unwavering investment in growth are
delivering.

Entering Q4, we are operating from a position of strength and with momentum. Yes, this pandemic
remains unpredictable. However, I am cautiously optimistic about our continued gradual recovery and
return to growth.

Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'd like to pause and share my hope that you and your loved ones are
staying safe and healthy. Thank you for being on the call. I look forward to taking your questions after
Bob's remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue,
walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then I'll finish
up with a framework for thinking about Q4.

As with last quarter, there are still too many unknowns so we're not going to provide formal forward-
looking guidance today. However, we will provide a framework for how we see things potentially playing
out in Q4. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.

As Mike mentioned, our revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, down 1% on a reported basis. On a
core basis, revenue declined 3.1% in the quarter. Currency negatively affected revenue by 1.3 percentage
points, while acquisitions added 3.4 percentage points to growth.

As Mike talked about the regional performance, I'll speak to the end market performance. In terms of
our end markets, pharma grew 2% in Q3 against a very strong comparison of 13% from last year. Both
small and large molecule applications grew, and biopharma improved throughout the quarter as drug
development labs increased production and access. We experienced softness in diagnostics and clinical as
anticipated.

Revenues declined 10%, primarily due to conditions in the U.S. driven by COVID-19-related disruptions
to patient visits and diagnostic labs opportunities. Encouragingly, we did see an improvement in routine
testing throughout the quarter, especially in China and Europe, while the U.S. lagged. Chemical and
energy was down 10%, consistent with our thinking. Revenues were generally flat sequentially with
conditions largely similar to what we saw in Q2. As we've talked about previously, we expect this segment
to ramp more slowly than others.

The food segment was a bright spot, up 8%. We are seeing ongoing signals that the market in China has
stabilized with the transition of more testing by commercial labs. The food market was just one of several
bright spots that contributed to double-digit growth in China, including growth in the low teens for our
pharma business. Our Environmental and Forensics Business declined mid-single digits against a double-
digit compare, and the Academic and Government segment declined mid-single digits while improving on
a sequential basis in Q3. Strength in cell analysis and liquid handling for viral research partially offset the
widespread impact of the ongoing academic lab closures.

Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. I'm extremely proud of how the Agilent team has responded to
the challenging environment. During the quarter, we continued our focus on managing expenses while
ensuring we continue to invest in our key growth opportunities. These expense management actions we
initiated last quarter were on full display in Q3. In addition, our customer engagement model using digital
tools continue to gain traction while also delivering savings in SG&A. As a result, operating margins of

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

23.7% improved 90 basis points over last year on declining revenue. Gross margin at 55.1% was down
130 basis points versus the prior year, largely due to mix and higher logistics costs. However, strong cost
management and operating expenses more than offset the decline in gross margin. This combination of
factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.78 per share, up nearly 3% from the
number we posted a year ago.

Now from a balance sheet perspective, we generated $290 million in operating cash flow during the
quarter, which is $48 million improvement over last year. In terms of capital spending, we spent $25
million, lower than last year and in line with our revised look in Q2. We ended the quarter in a strong
position with $2.3 billion in available liquidity, including $1.36 billion in cash. Also during the quarter, we
took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced $0.5 billion in short-term debt with a 10-year bond
and a 2.1% coupon, the lowest coupon in our portfolio.

As you know, we paused share buybacks in Q2 pending improvement in business conditions. In Q3, our
visibility into business trends and cash flow improved, and we resumed anti-dilutive share repurchases
late in the quarter. In the quarter, in total, we repurchased 360,000 shares for $33 million. Going forward,
we intend to resume our normal pattern of regular anti-dilutive repurchases, along with additional
opportunistic buying. Our overall capital deployment approach remains balanced with the primary focus on
growth M&A opportunities while also returning the cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.

As we look to Q4, business and trends have gradually improved, but significant uncertainty remains
around the evolution of this pandemic. However, let me provide a framework for how we see a range of
possible revenue growth scenarios in the coming quarter. We generally expect the trajectory of gradual
improvement in business results to continue across all regions. Areas where we see a broader range of
scenarios include research spending, both in academia and other markets; non-COVID diagnostic testing,
especially in the U.S.; and the general CapEx environment. The combination of these factors could result
in scenarios where our revenue performance could range from a 4% decline to 1% core growth.

Also, as a reminder, the BioTek acquisition closed midway through Q4 of last year, so the M&A impact
in Q4 will be smaller than in previous quarters, roughly 1 point of growth, and currency is forecasted to
be positive in the quarter. The low end of this range envisions COVID-19 flare-ups occurring in the fall
in various geographies limiting and in some cases reversing the recovery gains we've seen in a period
of time. In this scenario, one might expect to see slower or stalled improvements in research, academia
and other markets as continued tight cash management leading to lower CapEx spending in the U.S. and
Europe. We hope this bottom end of the range is overly conservative, but we wanted to let you know, we
have plans in place in case this happens.

The higher end of the range assumes continued recovery by region, building on what we have seen in July,
with the biggest impact coming from the U.S. This would include a continual increase in elective medical
procedures such as cancer screenings as well as continued lab openings. This view would also include
continued China momentum, along with the continued improvement in Europe and other areas in the
Americas. Again, this is not guidance but should provide a sense for some of the variables we see for Q4.

Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market
share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy continues its path to recovery.

And with that, I'll turn over things to Ankur to direct the Q&A. Ankur?

Ankur Dhingra
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Bob. Robert, if you can provide the instructions for the Q&A, please.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.

Doug Schenkel
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Nice work in a tough environment. Can we just maybe start with a cleanup question right off the bat,
which is just about prepared remarks? I don't think you quantified COVID-19 tailwinds in the quarter.
Again, I mean I may have missed that, but it would be helpful to get that so we could try to normalize
there.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure, Doug. I touched on it briefly in my comments, but it was 2 points of reported growth in Q3.

Doug Schenkel
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's great. And then on China, just a couple. I'm just curious if you would share the exit rate.
And as we look ahead, I know you're not guiding, I'm just wondering if you think -- based on what you're
seeing, if you think that double-digit growth can be sustained from here, at least near term. And then
specific on food, it's great to see this return to solid quarter first time [indiscernible] we're seeing some
stabilization last quarter. Can the high single-digit growth rate you saw this quarter be sustained moving
forward given favorable multiyear comparisons?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Doug, thanks for both questions. So just to make sure it came through the audience, the question was
about our view on the growth rate of China for the rest of the year as well as can that high single-digit
growth rate on food be sustained.

We think the answer is yes on both. We're really pleased with our performance in China. It was broad-
based. I tried to really accentuate that in my comments. We saw basically double-digit growth across all
end markets in China, and we think that a double-digit growth rate is within the realm of possibility for Q4
in China. And I have to say, Doug, it's wonderful to be talking about China food from a different vector.
We've been talking about it probably the last 18 to 24 months of when that would return to growth. We
saw some early indications in Q2. We saw a strong Q3, and we think that a roll of number is probably
sustainable for the rest of this year. Wouldn't you say so, Bob?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I would just say, Doug, to add, I mean, one of the things that was very positive about China was it
was pretty consistent across the quarter and, in fact, exited slightly higher than that overall 11%, but we
saw solid growth all 3 months.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

Mike or Bob, just maybe on the guidance here. If I step back, the third quarter guidance were down mid-
singles to down mid-teens. This down low singles was -- seems well of our expectations, I would say.
Perhaps not surprising on cures, but nonetheless, solid execution.

Maybe Q4 down 4 to plus 1 implies declines. What would cause the declines just given -- in light of simple
performance? Is that the minus 4 at the low end? Is that assuming that July trends just sustain and
there's new improvement of new space and how you're thinking Q4?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. I'll take that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we hope that, that is
overly conservative. What that would imply is actually a retrenchment and when COVID -- COVID-19 flare
ups here in the U.S. as we go back -- as we move into the fall and you start seeing some elements of
shutdown. So we certainly would hope that we would do better than that. But we wanted to provide, hey,
that's within the realm of kind of how we're thinking about our spending and so forth. Our July results or
our exit rate of the quarter was much higher than that. And so we're aiming to do better, but there's still
uncertainty in the world with the pandemic, people going back to school and so forth. So...

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And Bob, I think it's probably fair to say the wildcard is the United States, right?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, absolutely.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And we were encouraged by the movement in PMIs. You probably noticed that, but let's see how that
translates into business in the upcoming quarter. And again, we have to keep in mind ourselves, as
pleased as we are with the result we just delivered, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there because the
virus is unpredictable at times.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. That's right, Mike. I mean if you looked at each one of the major markets, each one of the major
markets got better in Q3 versus Q2 with the exception of the U.S., which we expected given kind of the
state of the -- state of affairs with the pandemic.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's a helpful perspective. So the minus 4 implies, I think, get worse. Was July flattish or positive? And
I'm curious, Mike, you mentioned NASD doubling up oligo. I know -- if you turn back the page, we were
doubling capacity. So is this now versus 6 months of a quadrupling capacity versus where we were last
year? Is that the right way to think about revenues going from 100, 200 to perhaps 400? Is that the math
here?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

No, it's slightly different math. I think we've been consistent with our view of needing to double our
capacity. What we end up doing is actually triggering the decision to initiate the expansion earlier than we
had thought just given the robust nature of the end market and as well as we have worked our way to be
able to -- in the same space, we challenged ourselves to find ways to drive as much revenue in the same
physical space. So we are investing a little bit more in capital than we initially had thought, but we're also

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

building something slightly different than our first train, which is going to give us actually more volume
than our current train A. So it's a really -- we thought it was really a positive signal, and that's why we
sent out the press release this morning because we're super excited about our prospects here.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Vijay, let me kind of frame in the kind of the numbers. What we were talking about is the
Frederick site has the potential of roughly $100 million worth of revenue. And we added capacity that
more than doubles that $100 million, to give you a frame of the numbers. So it's not 100, 200, 400. It's
100, 200 and more than 300, to kind of give you a sense. And in terms of July, we actually came in with
growth across all 3 groups in exiting July.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'll start with a COVID commentary. I guess if I go back to last quarter, there was some talk about
launching the serology test. You guys obviously have an installed base of real-time PCR instruments.
We've gotten questions of why you have to launch a PCR test. So can you just talk a little bit about how
you think about those tailwinds going forward and how you think about your capabilities on the diagnostic
side?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Tycho. I'll make some initial comments, and then the group president has been kind of quiet today,
so I'll pull Sam in here as well to provide his perspective. But we think that there's still tailwinds in front of
us. And now 2 points of growth, and we think we can sustain that at a minimum. That's why I try to put
fairly bullish comments about our stepped-up efforts across the company. Some of these things are going
to take a little bit longer. We think there's still room for our own test of quality tests with some different
features. But I think maybe a few comments there, Sam, from your perspective.

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

Yes, sure, Mike. Tycho, as you -- I think you've seen a good pickup in terms of our qPCR instruments,
which are RF systems as well as our bioreagents related to qPCR, both reverse transcriptase and master
mixes. On the antibody side, we've definitely also seen an increase in IgA, IgG and those antibodies. In
terms of our own tests, we are very actively exploring the possibilities of developing those. So more to
share in due course.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And Tycho, I guess what I disclose off here is the broad-based nature of our portfolio is allowing us to play
in multiple aspects of this COVID-19. Some of these things may take a little bit longer to actually turn into
revenue, right? So if you're working with, say, a pharma partner on something in the therapeutic area, it
may take a while for that to come to market. So we think these tailwinds are here to stay for some time,
and we're stepping up our efforts here because it plays right into the broad nature of our portfolio.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And I guess that's a good segue on the NASD expansion. Can you maybe talk to what degree that's tied to
the COVID vaccine? And any update from your end on capabilities on APIs for mRNA or siRNA vaccines?

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

CEO, President & Director

You want to take that one, Sam?

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

Yes, sure. Sure, no problem. Tycho, I'd start by reiterating a little bit of what Mike and Bob were talking
about. It's interesting that it was just last June that we did the ribbon-cutting and starting of the new
Frederick, Colorado facility. And quite frankly, we've seen demand that's exceeded our expectation just
12 months ago. So they really -- sorry, the new manufacturing line that we're building, you can consider
it, as we call it, train A on steroids [indiscernible]. But it is very differentiated both in throughput and
the molecules that it can do, which is a segue to your -- a little bit of your question that we're able to do
multiple iterations or types of siRNA or RNA. We're also actively looking at other different versions and
molecules that are oligo-based. Though I can't reveal the details, we have had a lot of interest related to
COVID-19, all of those used for either COVID-19-related therapeutics or even for vaccines. So I can say
that we have started the work on some of those programs now.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And maybe, Sam, to add, that being said, the capacity expansion isn't tied to COVID-19. We have
plenty of demand outside of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines, and so this is a broad-based capacity
expansion.

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

Thank you, Bob.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just last one, I know we don't have official guidance, but there's a framework for the
quarter -- for the fourth quarter. As we think about C&E and then also pharma biotech, should we expect
any kind of material change in either of those end markets for the coming quarter? I know you talked
about reshoring activities for C&E. I wasn't sure if that would maybe cause an improvement in trajectory
there.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Probably -- C&E is probably the one that's -- I would expect it to be pretty stable in that down 10-
ish percent, 8% to 10% in the range. We do expect pharma to continue to improve. So that 2%, certainly,
even in the low scenario, would stay there and then on the high scenario would accelerate.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, which is consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the quarter of Q3, yes. And Tycho, the
supply chain consideration and discussion still happen. I think it's at the level of stability, albeit down
into this space. And again, as you look ahead for the future, as this is an area where eventually it'll come
back. And again, too early to call. And -- but I'd say we're pretty confident about the improvement rate in
pharma.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The way to think about those reshoring is those are opportunities and discussions that could happen
through the order book and then will happen actually in '21 and beyond in terms of as the investments are
being made. So this is -- that's more future-looking.

Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Mike, Bob. So first question is on just the United States, obviously, strong in the quarter. But that would
imply Dako and clinical business. Obviously, you pointed that out. It was down in the quarter, but that's a
significant decline. Maybe just could you parse that out for us? What is -- it's a COVID impact for sure. But
is there anything beyond that in terms of the way market is fundamentally potentially shifting here to NGS
maybe? And if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit on that and clarify.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Happy to do so. So it's all market. It's all access to labs and patients going for their diagnostic test.
So it's really all market. I think we're seeing different pace of -- pacing throughout the quarter. All of our
geographies in the diagnostic testing front ended up with positive growth in July, but it was down sharply
in May and June, particularly in the U.S. And keep in mind also, we thought we -- part of our business in
our genomics front is to -- is sort of select into an NGS-based diagnostic labs. And for genetic disorders,
for example, those tests aren't getting done either. So it's really all market.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I was going to say, Puneet, actually, if you bifurcate those 2 and look at our performance, actually,
pathology performed better than NGS testing for volumes given what Mike was just talking about as well
as some of the academic institutions.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, that's a good point, Bob. Thanks.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

And if you could -- I know you quantified last quarter Bravo contribution. I'm wondering if you can provide
that for Bravo/Magnis liquid handling systems, sort of how much of that contribution happened in the
quarter.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

That's part of the story for our COVID-19 tailwinds. And I think probably the biggest contribution this
quarter actually came from BioTek, Bob, if I remember correctly.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Between BioTek and liquid handler in Bravo.

Bravo. So it's kind of now we have like a one-, two-punch kind of going there on the core instrumentation.
And then off your mind, with the Bravo platform comes an ongoing revenue stream associated with the
tips that go with those liquid handlers.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Okay. And last one on just ACG. I mean could you just elaborate on -- in these times, you mentioned
there are some larger contracts that -- service contracts and lights that you're getting into. Sort of
what's -- are those sort of COVID-driven? What's behind those? And maybe if you can elaborate on the
geography there.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Puneet, happy to have Padraig jump in on here and provide his perspective on that. So, Padraig, in
the call script, I talked a bit about the large enterprise deals you guys won. So why don't you talk about
that in a little more detail?

Padraig McDonnell
Senior Vice President

Yes. So thanks, Mike. We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which has seen a big uptick,
and what we're seeing from customers is a large demand for sourcing from one vendor. And because
of our capabilities in terms of the asset monitoring capability, relocation services and our core delivery
services, which are extremely in strong demand, we're seeing a big uptick from large customers in that.
We expect that to continue as we go through the quarter -- next quarter.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Now I was going to say that in the geography, Puneet, is largely in the U.S., but there are some
global opportunities as well. It's really non-COVID-19-related. I mean this is part of the core growth
strategy for Padraig's business to continue to expand our market share on the enterprise service front, and
we're really delighted winning some big pharma deals.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So a couple of questions. Very impressive margin expansion in the third quarter. How should we think
about the operating margin into Q4? And then I guess how much of these costs are permanent removals
versus what has to come back in '21?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Let me take that, Derik. It's great questions. And certainly are very pleased with how the team has
responded, as I mentioned before. As we've talked about, a large amount of the cost, we have not done
things like furloughs. We stabilized the team. We have not reduced base pay and things like that. So
these are discretionary expenses that a lot of them, we think, have the opportunity to stay away. It would
be travel and things like that, which our digital tools have enabled us to really continue to support our
customers. And so there aren't any kind of onetime things that happened in the quarter.

In terms of going forward to Q4, we are looking at probably less of a margin -- incremental margin
improvement because we are looking for ways to continue to invest to drive growth as the economy
recovers. We also have some start-up costs in the NASD new facility as well. So it's probably less than
what we've historically had, which is, call it, 30% to 40% incrementals, but it's really to drive growth.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Bob, I could just maybe add a comment on your -- on the first remark. So this is really, Derik, all about
a new way of working in Agilent. So I'm preparing for a managers call later this week, and what we're
talking to our team about is more digital, less travel. And we're really going to make sure that when we
get on the other side of this COVID-19 pandemic that we don't revert to our old ways of traveling. And we
know from our customer satisfaction scores, they love the responses that we have now with our digital
platforms.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And 2 questions on LASG (sic) [ LSAG ]. I guess the first question is, if you look at your numbers
in China versus some of your major peers in that area, I mean, you really just outshone in China. Can you
just talk about just share dynamics there that are going on? I mean, as I said, there was a pretty stark
comparison between you and your main LC competitor there.

And I guess also along those lines, can you talk about potentially any sign of a budget flush and just sort
of thinking about 4Q trends? What are you hearing in terms of people with budgets? And are they going to
be allowed to roll things over and to -- or are they going to have to use it or lose it? Just some dynamics
in terms of growth on the fourth quarter and just sort of your general thoughts on where customer
spending habits are.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Derik. I'm going to have Jacob handle the first question. Then Jacob, you can pass it back
to Bob and I for the second question. And I know Jacob would be just delighted to talk about the share
dynamics in China, which we think are very positive for Agilent.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes, absolutely. Thanks for that. And the numbers speak for itself. It's clear that both in China, but I think
actually globally, that we are in right now will be taking share. And this doesn't come by coincidence. I
think we have been executing our strategy between deals and over the past years, and the customers are
really buying into our value proposition. We are playing again where we are leveraging our whole portfolio,
not going up to one product line versus each other, and the customer really likes to be outcome-based. So
that's what is happening right now. And we see here in the crisis that not only are they excited about what
the investments we have done into our portfolio over the past years but also, as Mike talked about, in
the digital world, into the modern world, we have been very -- our team has just been super responsive.
They have taken off the digital. We take talent very, very good, and the customers responded very, very
positive to it. They know that when they work with Agilent that we are there for them in this crisis. So
thank you, Mike.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So -- and then on the other question, Derik, what we're hearing from our customers, particularly in
the public sector, and we're seeing it in our order book, and Bob, offer my perspective here and feel free
to build on my comments here, but there's a real sense of making sure they commit to their budgets. So
we're seeing it both in our order book as well as order activity, where there's a lot of uncertainty, what's
going to happen post elections as we go into 2021. So they want to commit those funds. And it's actually
quite amazing amount of deal activity that can occur without visiting a customer face-to-face. So Bob, I
don't know what you're hearing from the...

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

The only thing I would add is just to reiterate what Jacob was saying because it's not just China. I think
when you look at our LSAG portfolio, I think what people don't fully appreciate is how we've actually
changed the portfolio to technology platforms. They're probably the best -- in the best shape they have
been in probably 5 years in terms of new products and so forth. And I think you're seeing that across the
globe. And when we think about where we ended up in Q3, LSAG was certainly the standout relative to
where we thought they were going to be in a capital constrained environment, only down 4% on a core
basis, really speaks to our, I think, our responsiveness to customers.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Bob, on the gross margin line, you mentioned higher logistics cost in the third quarter. Is that a new
trend? And then can you help us just think through some of the puts and takes whether it's logistics cost
or mix, and how those puts and takes might evolve in the fourth quarter?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, sure. We're hoping it's not a trend that's going to be around for a while, but it certainly was
exacerbated in the Q3. That being said, I would say 3/4 of that was probably mix when you look at the
various businesses across each one of the groups. But where we saw logistics challenges are just lower
capacity in freight -- in air capacity, but we would expect that, and we actually saw that through the
quarter to kind of relax. And I think as you're starting to see more intercontinental travel both from a
passenger standpoint as well as freight standpoint, we would expect that to kind of relax over time.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then Bob or Mike, you're not quite giving formal forward-looking guidance yet, but you do
feel comfortable enough to restart the buyback program. Just what are your latest thoughts just around
comfort as far as capital deployment goes and maybe your appetite for M&A right now and what the funnel
might look like there?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Sure, Brandon. And I'll start off here and, Bob, feel free to jump in. But we felt quite comfortable
resuming our share repurchase program on the non-dilutive perspective, and we'll be looking at
opportunistic as well. Cash flow remains strong. We felt for some time that the third quarter of this year
would be the toughest quarter for us for the year. We're through that knot now. And the third quarter
actually was significantly better than we had thought, and we saw positive growth across all of our
businesses in July.

So we think, okay, this -- barring some kind of major flare-up, we should be able to continue to see this
gradual improvement of growth into the fourth quarter, is sort of our message. So we have the comp.
We also narrowed the framework that we provided. It's more narrow than it was in Q3. But again, I think
we need to keep in mind ourselves that we still -- there's still a lot of uncertainty associated with the
pandemic.

I think our capital deployment approach remains unchanged, which is we've said we wanted a balanced
approach to capital deployment across dividends, cash share repos and with the prioritization of investing
in the business. We just made a significant commitment in capital with our new NASD expansion. And
we're still on the hunt for deals that look -- that makes sense for Agilent. So our approach to capital
deployment really fundamentally remains unchanged. We paused a bit in the second quarter just because
on the share repo, because of the -- and in the early part of the third quarter, given what was going on

in the environment outside of Agilent. But we feel pretty good about where we are right now and have a
reasonable level of confidence that there's decent level of stability about the business. Bob, anything?

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So maybe just to circle back. Mike, so maybe this is a question for Bob to talk again about the Q4
framework. So if your business grew in July and the world improves month-to-month through October,
wouldn't that imply then the high end should be above that 1% organic growth number?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

It could be.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

I'll just leave it at that. There's still a lot of uncertainty and so forth. And -- but certainly, we wouldn't
complain if it was better than that.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then my follow-up, whoever wants to take it. On the NASD business, can you elaborate on
what's the lead time for that announced expansion? Is it something that would take a year or multiple
years to put in the new line? Or is it a quicker turn? And can you comment on your willingness to commit
capital inorganically in that business in addition to your organic commitments?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

I'll take the first one, just real quick, and then Mike, if you want to add something on the second one.
We announced that we would make that $150 million investment and then we would expect it to go live
towards the end of 2022. So it's taking a little longer than just a regular train. Sam mentioned train A on
steroids, so it's bigger and probably taking a little more capital. And obviously, with COVID-19, there's
some activities there in terms of a little long lead time. But we feel like we have the capacity to be able to
manage us through that time, and then that will come online at the end of 2020.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think it's our preference, end of '22. And don't specifically always talk about specific targets or areas
of focus necessarily, but it's not out of realm of reason that I would say why would we want to further
expand this business both inorganically as well. So that's -- it's not out of the realm. I'm not signaling
anything near term happening, but we think we're operating from a position of strength here in this
business. We had our first -- new factory up and running and build for that. So we now think we have a --
if you will, a beachhead to build from both organically and inorganically.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

Catherine Walden Ramsey Schulte
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I guess, first, despite the relatively good LSAG results in the quarter, it sounds like the outlook on the
capital equipment side is still a bit uncertain. Can you just talk to how the services and consumables side
of the business trended in July and what your expectations are for instrumentation trends in the coming
quarter?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think, Catherine, this is Bob. All 3 of our businesses actually performed better in July than they did
in May and June, which was very positive. The ACG business actually led the charge in terms of that, as
you would expect, given the resumption of activities. There is some catch-up there in terms of -- we saw
that kind of phenomenon actually in China in April. But ultimately, ACG was there. I think LSAG capital is
going to continue to be constrained, but I think what we've seen in our business is we've talked about this
in the past, kind of this flight to quality. And with our instrumentation and the reputation that we have, I
think, in a capital constrained environment, those dollars are precious, and we think our positioning is very
good vis-à-vis the market.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I tried to hit that in my remarks, which is really sales. And we know we're picking up share in a tight
market. And I think you saw that on C&E, right, which is if a C&E capital purchase is going down, it's
coming out on its way. So -- and that's why the overall market is still cautious, but you see PMI starting to
creep up a bit. So...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Catherine, just one last thing to give you maybe a little more color. If we looked across the
groups, we would expect LSAG to still be negative in Q4. I mean it's probably going to lag given the big
picture [indiscernible].

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We had a big fourth quarter last year.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Attractive as well.

Catherine Walden Ramsey Schulte
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Very helpful. And then, Mike, you mentioned seeing growth in all regions for the non-COVID
diagnostics business exiting the quarter. Can you just give us a sense of where those activity levels are in
the U.S. versus China and where they bottomed out across the different regions?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Sure. So I think I'd say China is in the lead position in terms of, if you will, almost full recovery.
Europe, Europe is second, and the U.S. is trailing. So for the first -- throughout the quarter, if I look at
Sam's business in the U.S., for example, the first 2 months were negative, and diagnostic testing values in
pathology. But we saw actually an improvement to growth in July, so I think it's sort of almost the pattern
of how the pandemic has flowed around the world. China is back. Europe is on its way. And I'd say the
U.S. is still in the early stages of recovery.

about 80% of pre-COVID levels from a diagnostics perspective but improving where it was below that at
the beginning of the quarter. So that sound right, Sam?

It does. Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.

Stephen Barr Willoughby
Cleveland Research Company

Mike. Just one question for you. A lot of my other questions have already been answered. 90 days ago,
you made a brief comment about the potential onshoring back to the U.S. Just was wondering if there's
any update on that at all.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Steve. Happy to comment on that. I think that's still going to happen. And these things take time,
but there's active discussion. And by the way, I wouldn't say it's just confined in the United States. I mean
many geographies are now looking at the security of the supply chain both in the pharma side as well as
in the chemical marketplace where they're providing precursors into the APIs for the pharma chain. So
nothing significant to announce relative to impact on business, but there does seem to be an overall trend
in this regards. And I can say also from an Agilent perspective, we're working hard to make sure that our
supply chain is secure as well. So I think that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a real wake-up call to
really some vulnerabilities in some aspects of the supply chain. So we're kind of working both sides of it,
which are to ensure our own ability to deliver product under multiple scenarios as well as we do see some
market trends underway. Bob, I know you've taken a look at this pretty...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I was going to say, just to build on that, we talked a little bit about earlier in the call. We would
expect that to see some of that opportunity show in our order book, and that's probably more a '21 time
frame for revenue. I wouldn't expect any of that to happen in Q4 just given the kind of timing, but you're
seeing it in multiple end markets and multiple regions. We think that is a trend that will continue.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS.

Daniel Gregory Brennan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe first question just on chemical and energy. Obviously, you've already highlighted a few comments
throughout the call. But just wondering if you can kind of walk through a little more color, separate
trends within that segment by customer, chemical. I don't know if it's worth seeing if there's been a big
divergence all between chemical and A&P and R&M.

And then secondarily, maybe just remind us of how much of that business is tied towards like QA/QC
versus R&D. And kind of what are we looking for to determine whether or not this down 10% begins to
improve more ratably or if it's going to save the slow steady progress that you've ever been?

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2020

CEO, President & Director

Bob, why don't I make some initial comments, and then we can check our notes to see if I missed
anything. But I think unlike the last quarter, the mix here -- I think both the chemical and the energy later
side had about the same dynamics, where both were down about the same, primarily on the instrument
side. And on one hand, the chemical side of the business is really benefiting -- continued to benefit from
lower oil prices. But some of their end markets are weak, whether it be automotive or some of the other
markets that they service are weak. Some of them are getting a little bit of help on the COVID-19-related
products. But overall, I'd say both the chemical side as well as the energy side of that are down about the
same but stable.

And I have to say that Bob and I had talked to some length about this in our last call, and our prediction
at the time was we thought we were going to be in a kind of a stable situation relative to this. That wasn't
to get any worse. That was sort of the question we were getting last call. So I think we were really pleased
to see that, that came through this quarter. And we expect that eventually, this thing will start to move
back to growth, I think. I think it's probably a 70-30 mix, where most of it's in QA/QC, and that's why
these facilities are running, albeit maybe not at full volume. So QA/QC equipment will be needed as well
as the consumer service that go with it. So they can only hold off the depots on that side for so long.
There is an element of research, but I think in the chemical and energy space, the biggest driver for that
is the QA/QC side of the business.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And I think the only thing I would add, Dan, is we would expect this, as you said, kind of steady slope
progress going forward.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

Daniel Gregory Brennan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe one different follow-up. I know a couple of questions on China. But maybe could
you just go a little bit more in detail on what you saw in food and generics? Obviously, COVID is impacting
the globe and the recovery, but you've got some pretty unique issues with food and generics that are
maybe a little different. So dependent upon the improvement or lack thereof, that could drive notable
changes in China. So what did you see there? And what's the outlook as we look forward for those 2
segments?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

You want to take that one?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, I was going to say, Dan, one of the things we were incredibly proud of in China was all 3 of the
business groups grew, and all of our end markets grew, really led by food, which was up over 20%. And
it's been a while since we've been able to say that. And so we think that -- we've talked about kind of the
move away from the government labs or the central labs into the commercial labs. And we think that,
that's stabilized. And team has really been able to garner share, our view of capacity in that space.

And then in pharma, it continues to perform very well. Actually, pharma was up roughly 10% in China, and
that's a combination of both large and small molecule. And I think our thesis around that continues to play
out, which is that the winners of the 4 + 7 or the tendering process are our customers that where we are
over-indexed, and we continue to see that positive momentum, we actually saw acceleration from Q2 to

Q3 in both food and pharma. And the rest of the businesses were positive as well. So I think it's broad-
based.

Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citigroup.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Mike, maybe just one for you on -- I know there's been a few questions in July, obviously. But with all the
businesses returning to growth, I guess is it safe to assume you guys didn't see too much of a pullback
around the second wave here in the U.S., even the first few weeks of August. It sounds like you're a little
more cautious on Americas versus other geographies. But just wondering, any surprises on an end market
basis in the U.S. as you went through July and even early August given kind of the reoccurrence of virus.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

No. I'll jump in on this. But from our perspective, no real surprises. I mean we're all -- like all of us, we
were watching what was happening in the pandemic as it worked its way across -- throughout the U.S.
and we saw the case numbers go up. And lab access was down for the early -- pretty sharply April, May,
June, and we started seeing some recovery. So I think no real surprises versus what we thought.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, the -- I would agree. I mean, Patrick, this is Bob. The Americas, as Mike said earlier, is, in fact, the
biggest variable because it's further along in its recovery than both Europe and China. And I think the
thing that we're watching is those COVID flare-ups and the potential impact on elective procedures, which
would impact our diagnostics business. That's probably got the biggest variability going into Q4 relative to
LSAG and ACG. But to Mike's point, we did not see any a significant change with these flare-ups in August
-- or excuse me, in July and early August.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. No, that's helpful. And a bunch of good commentary on the chemical and energy and industrial
side. I just want to, I guess, clarify, I mean, it certainly seems like the industrial sentiment feels like it
might have bottomed. It seems like your tone is a little bit better from 3 months ago, even though, again,
chemical and energy is probably going to be down similar this quarter and then again, next quarter. But
I guess what are you hearing from customers there on spend plans? Again, it sounds like you're a little
more optimistic. I'm talking a little more bullishly about '21. So I'm just wondering, I guess, as we enter
into the end of this fiscal year into '21, are you seeing things improve a little bit? Obviously, it'll come up
against very easy comps, but it does seem like the tone is a little more positive. So are you hearing from
customers that things are trending a little bit better into '21?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I think that's a fair assessment of what I was trying to communicate today. First of all, the fact that
we do think it's bottomed, and that was our thesis when the things started going down -- directionally
down when the pandemic hit. So we do see that. Again, I don't want to get too far ahead of it and
describe some big dramatic increase in growth in this space. But customers are working on their plans.
Chevron actually is making some big investments in Iraq. So capital -- these are ongoing concerns, and

they can hold back their capital for a while, but they're going to want to maintain their operations at the
highest capability. So we're hopeful that the budget environment will be a little bit different in '21. And
I think once we get a little bit more clarity, once our customers feeling -- get more clarity on their view
of where the economy is going, then they can make their decisions with a lot more confidence. So the
PMIs are a good view of how sentiment may be changing. So again, don't over-interpret this for a fourth
quarter, but it doesn't point to '21 being in perhaps a better environment.

And your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

So I wanted to go back to the NASD business and just get a little bit more color. Are you working on any
of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine? I guess curious because these trials are doing so quickly. I was
curious to get your take, if 1 versus 3 and into commercial within the next 6 months, how would you
manage the business, just deliver on the capacity that a customer might need for that?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Sam, I'm going to pass that to you.

Samraat S. Raha
Senior Vice President

Yes. No problem, Mike. So I can't comment specifically on the molecule or the molecular projects that
we're doing related to COVID-19, but 2 things I will point out. As Bob indicated earlier, this is business --
a separate core or different than the business we're already doing or it's not taking the place of business,
if you will. And we believe we have the capacity in that if the demand is there related to certain things
playing out related to COVID-19 and the molecules that we happen to be working on, we believe we will
be in a position to be able to supply that material as the volume requires.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Great. And then one more follow-up on LSAG. I'm just curious, as you're looking at the research labs
around the globe, kind of this conversation around deferral versus cancellation. What are customers telling
you? Is it still mostly deferrals versus cancellations? And on the deferral side, when do you expect these
-- how far out is it getting pushed, something that you think it hits before the end of the year or probably
more likely in calendar '21?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Jack, happy to answer this question. This is something we've been monitoring pretty closely, deferrals
versus cancellations. And we've really been pleased. Our cancellations are actually lower than last year,
and our thesis is -- they're being pushed and that the funds will be deployed this calendar year.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, that's what we actually -- we saw that, Jack. Some of that actually happened in Q3. And as people
are going back into the labs physically there, then they can install the instrumentation. But to Mike's
point, we've seen no cancellation or lower cancellations than what we would have last year. There's always
some level of it. I would say that we've been extraordinarily pleased, and I would expect it to happen this
calendar year.
