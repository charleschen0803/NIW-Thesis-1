ONEOK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 ONEOK Earnings Call. Today's conference is being
recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir.

Andrew J. Ziola
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Affairs

Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, and welcome to ONEOK's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. We
issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are
on our website. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions.

A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions
should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the
Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-
looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our
SEC filings.

Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your
continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer
and Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior
Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.

Higher third quarter results were driven primarily by curtailed volume returning to our system and
increased ethane recovery. The majority of volume across our operations has now exceeded pre-pandemic
levels and better represents our volume expectations prior to the widespread production curtailments
during last quarter. We're in a much improved position today than we were on our second quarter call.

Back in July, we discussed the expectation for curtailed volume to return in the third quarter. Now just 3
months later, not only has essentially all of the curtailed volume on our system returned but had returned
at a faster rate than expected. This momentum, especially from September, is expected to continue with
the fourth quarter being just as good, if not better, than the third quarter, which also sets a good baseline
into 2021.

Additionally, we've successfully captured more previously flared natural gas in the Williston Basin, needing
the effort to reduce flaring even as production has returned in the region. In August, we captured a higher
percentage of gas than the statewide average of 92%, an opportunity we've discussed for numerous
quarters. Infrastructure put in place earlier this year and the hard work of our employees allowed us to
help producers in the region decrease flaring, allowing both our customers and ONEOK to benefit from
previously uncaptured earnings. This is just one example of our continued focus on customer service,
safety and environmental responsibility, despite the challenges of operating and conducting business
during the global pandemic.

Operating conditions have greatly improved from second quarter lows, but there are still uncertainties
around the pandemic and the economic recovery. Despite that uncertainty, we remain focused on
continuing to meet the needs of our customers. Our conversations with producers are increasingly
positive as commodity prices have shown some stability and demand has shown positive signs. These
conversations have now shifted more towards 2021, indicating the potential for an improving pace of
drilling and completion activity next year.

ONEOK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

As curtailed volumes have recovered, so have our earnings. We now expect 2020 earnings to approach the
midpoint of our previously provided outlook ranges, which Walt will discuss shortly.

On our last call, I shared our outlook for 2021, and today, the backdrop is even stronger. Volumes in
the Bakken ramped throughout the third quarter setting us up for a strong fourth quarter and 2021. We
expect to achieve double-digit earnings growth in 2021 compared with our new and updated 2020 outlook.

As it relates to our dividend, distributable cash flow this quarter exceeded the dividend by $125 million.
With earnings strength expected in the fourth quarter and into 2021, we expect distributable cash flow to
cover both the dividend and our 2021 capital expenditures as we continue on our path to de-leveraging.
As always has been the case, the dividend remains a potential lever we could pull if our de-leveraging
expectations are not being met. This quarter demonstrated the reliability of our assets, the unwavering
dedication of our employees and the resiliency of our extensive and integrated businesses.

While the second quarter was challenging, our employees remained focused on serving customer needs
and preparing our assets for the eventual return of curtailed volumes. The key infrastructure projects
we completed prior to the pandemic create substantial capacity for future growth as markets continue to
improve.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt.

Walter S. Hulse
CFO, Treasurer and Executive VP of Strategic Planning & Corporate Affairs

Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter 2020 net income totaled $312 million or $0.70 per share. Third
quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $747 million, a 15% increase year-over-year and a 40% increase
compared with the second quarter of 2020. Distributable cash flow was more than $540 million in the
third quarter, a 12% increase year-over-year with a healthy dividend coverage of 1.3x. We also generated
more than $125 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter, an 11%
increase compared with the same period last year.

Our September 30 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.6x as we saw a significant
step-up in EBITDA in the third quarter from the return of curtailed volume across our system. We continue
to manage our leverage towards 4x or less and maintain 3.5x as our long-term aspirational goal. We
ended the third quarter with no borrowings on our $2.5 billion credit facility and nearly $450 million in
cash.

Last week, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized
basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. We took proactive steps earlier this year to provide ample
liquidity and protect our investment-grade ratings. We've demonstrated our ability to access the capital
markets even during challenging market conditions and have been able to use our balance sheet flexibility
to help guide financial decisions throughout this period of uncertainty.

We proactively paid off upcoming debt maturities and have been opportunistic in repurchasing more than
$200 million of debt through open market repurchases in the first 9 months of the year. From an upcoming
debt maturity standpoint, we have no maturities due before 2022.

As Terry mentioned, with yesterday's earnings we announced, that we now expect 2020 net income and
adjusted EBITDA results to be higher, approaching the midpoint of our previously provided outlook ranges.
Our improved outlook is supported by the volume strength we're seeing across our assets, the pace the
curtailed volumes returned and our ability to capture previously flared gas, resulting in an earnings run
rate more in line with our original 2020 expectations and providing a clear path to our continued de-
leveraging.

Yesterday, we also announced the early completion of our 2 remaining active projects: the Bakken NGL
pipeline extension and Arbuckle II pipeline extension, which were originally scheduled for completion in
the fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2021, respectively.

ONEOK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Third quarter CapEx included dollars pulled forward from the fourth quarter and 2021 for these projects
and retained growth capital primarily for well connects and maintenance activities. We have now
substantially completed all of our active capital growth projects. We continue to expect a run rate of total
annual capital expenditures, including maintenance and growth of $300 million to $400 million. This base
level of annual capital will be maintained until producer activity levels provide visibility to volume growth
warranting expanded capacity, but as always, we remain flexible with the ability to restart projects quickly
as customer needs change.

Recent conversations with producers, particularly those who have substantial positions in the Dunn County
area of the Williston Basin are indicating that more rigs will return in 2021, resulting in a potential need to
restart Bear Creek 2 construction if this activity materializes.

Even in this scenario, our 2021 capital expenditures would likely be in the $500 million range. We now
expect our cost saving measures to total approximately $130 million this year compared with our 2020
plan. Both September -- through September, we've recognized approximately $100 million in savings and
continue to look for additional efficiencies.

From a financial perspective, we remain well-positioned with ample liquidity and balance sheet strength
to withstand additional market uncertainty should it arise and to be opportunistic in the event of a faster-
paced recovery.

I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations.

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Thank you, Walt. With nearly all curtailed production back online by the end of the third quarter, we saw a
large step-up in NGL and natural gas volumes across our system compared with the second quarter. NGL
volumes across all of our operating areas exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. And natural
gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region had reached more than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day
in October.

I'll start with the natural gas liquids segment. Third quarter NGL raw feed throughput volumes across our
system increased 7% year-over-year and 15% compared with the second quarter.

In the Rocky Mountain region, which is our highest margin business, volumes are averaging approximately
245,000 barrels per day in October, a 14% increase over our third quarter 2020 average and a more than
50% increase from the second quarter 2020. The return of curtailed production, completion of DUCs and
increased flared gas capture have contributed to higher volumes.

As the primary NGL takeaway provider from the region, our natural gas liquids segment not only benefits
from the gas captured on ONEOK's dedicated acreage but also for many third-party plants across the
basin. With more than 130,000 barrels per day of available capacity out of the region and the ability to
expand capacity with minimal capital if needed, there's a long runway to grow with our customers. We
expect NGL earnings in the region to see additional benefit from 2 other areas as we move into 2021.

First, the early completion of our Bakken NGL pipeline extension in August. This lateral extension connects
our system with an area of Williams County, which has historically had limited NGL transportation options.
In addition to the original contract, with an expanding third-party plant in the area, we've also contracted
2 additional third-party plants near the pipeline. Volume has already started flowing on the extension, and
we expect a continued ramp into next year. As a reminder, this project is also supported by a minimum
volume commitment.

Second, we expect to transport all of our Williston and Powder River Basin volumes exclusively on our Elk
Creek and Bakken pipelines beginning very early next year once we complete a low-cost pump expansion
on Elk Creek, which will reduce our transportation costs paid to Overland Pass pipeline.

In the Mid-Continent region, we completed the Arbuckle II pipeline extension in August, earlier than our
target date of the first quarter 2021. This extension includes connectivity from our Elk Creek pipeline to

the Arbuckle II pipeline, allowing increasing Rocky Mountain volumes the optionality to be transported to
the Mont Belvieu market hub.

Increasing petrochemical demand and favorable ethane economics resulted in significant ethane recovery
across the Mid-Continent region through a good portion of the third quarter. Our raw feed throughput
volumes in the region increased 9% compared with the second quarter 2020, largely due to ethane
recovery. Ethane volumes in the Mid-Continent averaged more than 245,000 barrels per day in the third
quarter 2020 compared with the second quarter 2020 average of 210,000 barrels per day, a more than
17% increase driven by nearly all of our Mid-Continent plant connections recovering ethane in July and
August.

In September, we saw a reversal back to ethane rejection as pricing and volumes were impacted
by decreased petrochemical demand due to Hurricane Laura. We had seen some plants in the Mid-
Continent return to recovery this month, but expect the ethane volumes on our system to fluctuate for the
remainder of 2020 and into 2021.

In the Permian Gulf Coast region, third quarter NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 16%
compared with the second quarter 2020, benefiting from returning volumes and approximately 30,000
barrels per day of short-term fractionation-only volumes. Even without the addition of short-term volume,
raw feed throughput in the region still increased more than 6% compared with the second quarter. As
we've mentioned previously, we continue to offload 25,000 barrels per day on third-party NGL pipes. This
firm contract will expire at the end of the year, which will eliminate this expense as we move these barrels
to our integrated system.

Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Total natural gas volumes processed
increased 13% compared with the second quarter 2020 and processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain
region have reached more than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in October, a more than 16% increase from
our third quarter average. The return of curtailed volumes to our system in the Williston Basin drove
the third quarter average fee rate to $0.94 per MMBtu compared with $0.71 in the second quarter. As
a number of high fee percentage, large producers brought production back online, some sooner than
expected. Going forward, we expect the average fee rate to remain around this level.

There are 13 rigs currently operating in the Williston Basin with 8 on our dedicated acreage, which is an
increase from the past few months. Drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin totaled more than 850 with
approximately 400 on our dedicated acreage. We've said previously that it takes 15 to 20 well completions
per month to maintain our processing volumes around 1.1 to 1.2 Bcf per day. This is a relatively small
number of well completions, considering we have averaged 28 completions per month through the first 9
months of 2020. When we factor in our current volume levels, a significant DUC inventory that is profitable
to complete in this price environment, the rigs currently on the system and some additional flared gas
opportunities, we've had ample inventory to support current volume levels through 2021, assuming no
increase in producer activity during that time frame. Of course, any additional producer activity in the
basin would present upside, resulting in more wells drilled and/or completed, driving higher volumes, and
ultimately, earnings for ONEOK.

Slide 7 in our earnings presentation has been updated to illustrate the ability to maintain current natural
gas processing levels with minimal well completions. This slide is meant to be a representation, not
guidance or an indication of our expected future volumes. For reference, there are 4 to 5 frac crews in the
region today, each with the capability to complete 5 to 6 wells per month. In addition to the substantial
inventory of wells on our system, other volume tailwinds in the basin include rising gas-to-oil ratios and
additional gas capture opportunities. GORs have continued to increase and remain well over 2:1, the result
of activity concentrated in Dakota basin and maturing wells. This level of gas production suggests that
even in a flat or slightly declining crude oil production environment, we could still see stable to increasing
gas volumes in the region. The latest North Dakota data, which is for the month of August, showed 215
million cubic feet per day still flaring in the basin, with approximately 80 million cubic feet per day of that
on ONEOK's dedicated acreage.

Statewide flaring in August decreased to 8% compared with nearly 20% at the same time last year.
As Terry mentioned, flaring on ONEOK's acreage was below the statewide average, a reflection of the

infrastructure that our employees have worked hard to construct and operate in the region over the last
decade, and specifically, over the last couple of years. With 1.5 Bcf of processing capacity, we will continue
to push to capture even more of the gas produced as we move through 2021.

In the natural gas pipeline segment, we reported another strong quarter of stable fee-based earnings, with
firm capacity remaining nearly 95% contracted. The segment continues to be a stable fee-based earnings
driver for the company, providing essential natural gas to end-use customers.

Terry, that concludes my remarks.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Kevin. That was a great overview of a strong quarter, headlined by the expected return of
volumes and a solid demonstration of the resiliency of our businesses. This quarter was not only marked
with volume-related milestones and accomplishments, in August, we issued our 12th annual sustainability
and ESG report. And just recently, we received notable ESG-related recognitions, including being
recognized by JUST Capital for the second year in a row as the industry leader in the energy equipment
and services sector and receiving an award for environmental excellence from the Environmental
Federation of Oklahoma. We're always evaluating ways to improve our ESG-related performance and
enhance our long-term business sustainability. This includes planning and preparing on for potential
changes to our industry, customer needs or the broader demand for energy.

There has been much discussion about the future state of the energy industry, and we get asked
frequently what our role could be in the low-carbon world. The answer is simple. ONEOK has always
promoted a business culture, prioritizing safety, environmental responsibility and profitability in all that we
do. And as we always have, we will do our homeworks to gain knowledge and prepare diligently for the
future and as our industry continues to meet the world's energy needs in an environmentally responsible
way. Whether it's actively evaluating the use of renewable energy at our facilities, developing carbon
capturing projects or assessing the feasibility of using our extensive assets for hydrogen transportation
and storage, our commitment to environmental stewardship remains steadfast.

Our assets, their location and our midstream skill set is compatible with many of these types of projects,
but they still need to make strategic sense for our business. In many cases, technology or large-scale
application may be further into the future, but we'll continue to evaluate opportunities that fit within
our businesses because we absolutely believe that our large and extensive infrastructure has a vital role
to play in the long-term energy transition. And while we evaluate new and future opportunities, I want
to thank our employees for doing what they do best, operating our assets safely and responsibly and
transporting the essential NGLs and natural gas that are used to heat your home, generate electricity and
create the many end-use products that help us live healthier, safer and more productive lives.
With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

James M. Kirby
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

James on for Jeremy. I just wanted to start with the '21 guidance here for double-digit growth. Just given
where the strip is today, what are the price assumptions built into that guidance? And then just looking at
Slide 7 with the well completion guide, is [ 300 well ] kind of the ballpark for well completions needed to
kind of maintain that volumes there within Bakken?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Well, Jerry, it was real hard to understand you, but let me take the first question about growth into '21.
When we talk to producers in this price environment, they -- clearly, the DUCs are profitable to complete.
I mean I think that's the focus, especially as we look as you move through the rest of this year and the
early parts of '21. You've got that substantial DUC inventory in the Bakken, and you've seen some rigs
come back.

So as we've said before, in a $35 to $40 environment, the DUCs work well as far as the economics. You
get north of $45. That's when we saw rigs coming back in a material way in '15 and '16. And I think our
conversations with customers today, that would still hold. So as we think about '21, we're absolutely not
thinking about it in the context of a $55 environment. It's more in line with what the strip would look like
today. Chuck, do you want to add there?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

No, I would agree with those prices. And as far as what you referenced with producers, we've had
discussions with our Bakken producers and looking at their 2021 forecast and drill schedules and what
they've provided, they expect the pace of completions in the first half of the year to be DUC driven, as
Kevin mentioned. However, they anticipate adding rigs in the spring. So I think as you look at the strip in
'21, that pretty much supports that statement.

James M. Kirby
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. So if I'm -- if I just understand, do you -- my next question here, I mean, just looking at seeing
kind of $50 million in the G&P segment that was kind of captured here from improved commodity prices.
I guess at a higher level, can you talk about how much of that is the element of an improved volume and
kind of versus the fee component there? Just any color you can provide there. I appreciate the color on
the G&P fees going forward, assuming the kind of $0.94. Any color you could provide there.

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Jeremy, we're struggling. Did you -- was your question about the fee rate in the G&P business?

James M. Kirby
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, sorry. Just basically, what is the kind of breakdown of color you could provider there in terms of the --
how much of that is attributable to improved volumes versus kind of the improved commodity prices?

ONEOK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Jeremy, this transmission is really bad. There must be a bad connection. So we're having real difficulty
understanding and just hearing your question. So what we could do is try to get to you offline. But I think,
Chuck, if you've got any commentary around the fee rate that might be helpful for Jeremy?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Sure. Yes, we can talk about pretty much what drove our increase in the fee rate quarter-over-quarter.
If you think about it, it's really a combination of 2 things: basin mix and contract mix. So as we saw, our
Williston Basin curtailed volumes returning to our system, particularly from our large producers, these
producers have contracts that are fee-only or high -- have a high fee with a lower percentage of proceeds
component.

And as these curtailed volumes came back on, then what happened was the mix of the basin contribution
to that average fee changed. In Q2, it was more toward a 50-50 mix between Mid-Continent and
Bakken, with, of course, Mid-Continent being the lower fee margin business. So here in Q3, we saw our
Rockies volumes contribute upwards of approximately 60% of that calculation. So a combination of large
producers, higher fee, lower POP components, all Williston volume-related and roughly 60% of that basin
mix and the average of the basin weighting and the average drove that fee rate to $0.94.

Operator

We'll go ahead and take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Hopefully, my connection is okay. Just to clarify before I ask my questions, you're basically saying that mix
shift of where the volumes came from is part of the reason why the rate went up. Is that fair to maybe
characterize your last response?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Yes. That one -- I mean, again, it's a shift in both the volumes of -- from the Mid-Con kind of decline in
the higher percentage of Williston volume and then also the mix of contracts. So we had a lot of our larger,
higher fee-based customers brought gas back online in a sizable way in the third quarter.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Perfect. Okay. Just moving on to my questions here. First of all, thank you for providing all the incremental
data on well connections and that Slide 7 where I kind of feel like I can choose my own adventure. So
when I think about Slide 7, I just want to understand how to utilize it correctly here. It suggests 15
average well completions a month, sort of keeps you flatter. I guess that's about 180 completions for the
year -- for '21. And to grow, you got the 25, 35, 45 scenarios. And then as you mentioned in the call, you
got 400 DUCs that are in the mining right now, but maybe they're not all in the right areas.

So when I sort of piece that together, if I see, let's say, how should DUCs get completed? And you
mentioned that you have 8 rigs running on your acreage, which gives you what, 2 wells per rig per
month. It sort of seems like you can be materially above the 28 average well completion that you sort of
highlighted in -- that you saw in September. So when I think about that, all else equal, that you can have
a material increase in production year-on-year. Am I being too simplistic in my analysis here? Or is that
the way to be thinking about that?

Kevin L. Burdick

10

ONEOK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

No. Shneur, this is Kevin. I think that's exactly how we're looking at it. I mean that DUC inventory, that
provides you a substantial runway for growth. And when we add the rigs on top of that and we do expect
to capture a little more gas and that gives you that volume strength that we foresee.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

In the prepared remarks, I believe, Terry mentioned that double-digit growth for '21 versus '20, which one
of those scenarios are you assuming? Is it 25, 35, just trying to understand that?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

We haven't -- again, we haven't necessarily provided the specific link there. But again, I'd go back to the
previous comments from Jeremy -- that I made with Jeremy that we're not -- we're thinking about this in
the context of a $40 to $45 type environment as we look at '21.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up question, one of your peers yesterday sort of was talking about the
Williston, in general, that the producers are becoming significantly more efficient, more stages per frac,
longer laterals and so forth and sort of intimated that GORs are going to continue to go up and maybe
even faster than they had previously. Is that something that you're hearing from your customers as well,
too? Is that something that you're seeing as well also?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Yes, this is Chuck. We are. We're seeing it from our producers. I think we mentioned on last call, lateral
lengths, we're seeing -- pushing out to the 3-mile level. We're also seeing increased frac stages. So we're
seeing -- so you're seeing greater production efficiencies. And of course, the GORs continue to rise in the
basin. So when you look at those 3 components, it's all painting a pretty good picture for these new wells
coming online.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

It's just that -- the bottom line of that is the breakeven costs continue to come down significantly.

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

That's correct.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. That's super helpful. And maybe one final question, if I may, for Walt. When I sort of think about
the results for the third quarter, if I annualize and then look at your leverage compared to that, you start
to get down to the 4.6 zone and so forth. As we move into next year, what's the leverage ratio on an
annualized basis that you would like to get to before you would consider buybacks?

Walter S. Hulse
CFO, Treasurer and Executive VP of Strategic Planning & Corporate Affairs

Well, Shneur, I would answer that question in a couple of ways. I think that we will continue to see that
leverage ratio trend in the right direction. We had -- when we originally gave 2020 guidance, we gave
some expectations of where we thought leverage would get to at the end of '20, early 2021. And that
kind of got moved out 12 to 15 months based on the pandemic. So I think we're still trending that range

in the right direction.

We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.

Christine Cho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I'm going to apologize in advance, but I also want to discuss Slide 7. When you talked about the 15 to 20
wells a month in the Bakken to hold volumes flat at the 1.1 or 1.2 Bcf a day level. When I combine that
with your comments that you'd expect to be at least $3 billion in EBITDA next year, that would to me at
least imply Bakken volumes will have to hold at least from current levels. Is your CapEx of $300 million to
$400 million next year indicate that level of well connects of 15 to 20 per month in the Bakken? And how
should we think about that?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Christine, this is Kevin. Yes, I think we would expect to be able to do that. Again, we've got available
processing capacity. So all we're talking about in that, that we would need would be well connect capital.
To go connect wells, we might need to add a compressor or the station or something like that. And that
would be within that $300 million to $400 million type range, given the environment that we're looking at
today.

Christine Cho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then if I could actually move over to Overland Pass, and I appreciate the comments that
you made in prepared remarks about taking your Powder River Basin over to Arbuckle. But overall cash
earnings were down in 2Q and that level continued into 3Q. Did you guys move volumes from the Bakken
NGL and Overland Pass to Elk Creek? Or did a large customer get off the system? And I thought that pipe
was previously full. So should we think that there's available capacity on that system going forward?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

Christine, this is Sheridan. We did move some volume off of OPPL onto the Elk Creek, Bakken system in
both the second and third quarter. And part of the run rate you're at today is what you'll see through the
fourth quarter. And then once we get into 2021, we will -- our plan right now is to remove all the volume
off that system. Once we get into 2021, by moving that volume off the system and moving on our own
system, we think due to cost savings that we will see, we should see approximately a $40 million or $50
million uplift in earnings.

Christine Cho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Could you -- are you going to have to expand Elk Creek?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

As Kevin said in the earnings, well, we have a low-cost expansion that we will complete by the end of the
year and that will allow us to move all the volume off of OPPL onto Elk Creek.

Christine Cho
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And sorry, one follow-up. Would you have to pay anything to take your volumes off of Overland
Pass for the last quarter, this quarter and next quarter?

We'll take our next question from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities.

Tristan James Richardson
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Really appreciate all the comments on '21, particularly clarifying some of the assumptions, especially
on certain environment. I mean you guys noted that customer conversations are encouraging and rigs
could potentially return in the spring, which would presumably accelerate that completion activity. So to
the extent a return of the rigs occurs, as you noted, any of that return would be upside to the general
assumptions driving the $3 billion-plus 2021 expectation?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

I mean I think there's clearly the potential for that. I mean that's what we talked in our opening remarks
that, that would be the upside. I think that it just will boil down to how the producers and our customers
determine to deploy that capital as far as completing DUCs and rigs coming back. The other thing that rigs
coming back, if you think about the lag of those rigs coming back, that also then would start supporting
growth into '22 as well.

Tristan James Richardson
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Very helpful. And then I guess just -- conversely, can you see outside of a reduction in completion -- or
pace of completion activity. Are there headwinds out there that would prevent you to that sort of $3 billion
number in 2021?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

I mean that's the -- again, just other than you said the activity levels, and we all know the risk that would
come with -- that might drive that, but other than that, the thing I think we just keep coming back to is
we've got plenty of processing capacity. We've put a lot of compression and field infrastructure in place to
get the gas to the plant. We've got an NGL system that's got available capacity. So we're sitting in a good
spot to be able to grow with our customers with very little capital.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Right. Kevin, I think the other thing I would add to your comment is as we talk to the producers, certainly,
they're making their decisions based upon a longer-term view of commodity prices. Now certainly, you
could have -- you've got OPEC risk out there. You've got COVID-19 risk out there in the universe, that
certainly could impact these numbers as we think about 2021. But the fact of the matter is that industry
has done some things, not only the way they operate but also in the way they manage their markets. And
we've got new pricing indices in the Gulf Coast that could mitigate and ensure that the phenomenon we
saw in the springtime in terms of negative crude prices does not happen again.

So we're pretty certain we're not going to see that type of scenario materialize, but certainly, we'll see
month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter volatility in commodity prices like we always do, but we don't
anticipate, even if we see some of these other phenomenon -- other things happen like OPEC or the
COVID. We don't think we're going to get back in a scenario like we saw in the springtime, which was a
huge impact to what transpired in the second quarter, seeing those negative crude prices.

We'll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.

Michael Jacob Blum
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Wanted to ask about ethane for next year, really. Do you -- I guess, what ethane price do you think
you need to see recoveries in the Bakken and would you consider, are you considering a lower tariff to
incentivize some of those ethane recoveries next year? And then I apologize for the multipart question
here, but is any of that -- is any ethane recovery assumed in your forecast or expectation for double-digit
growth in '21?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

Michael, this is Sheridan. What I would say on your first question, the ethane price that we would need in
the Bakken, obviously depends on what the gas price is in the Bakken, but it'd be fair to say that we would
need to be in the $0.40 per gallon range at current fee structure that we have today. We always have the
ability to flex our fees or change our fees to incent ethane to come out if we think that's the best thing to
do, but a lot of it depends on, obviously, we have to get -- still have the price with fees to be higher than
the gas price in the area.

As we look into 2021, we are not assuming any ethane recovery out of the Bakken in our double-digit
growth. We are only assuming a partial ethane recovery through the year in the Mid-Continent for the
double-digit growth as well, which is where we could see some upside as we go into next year based on
the volume happens. But I think that represents kind of a call option that we have that if volume doesn't
show up, that would force people to go into different areas to extract that thing where if volume does
not show like we think it is next year, you could see ethane be economic coming out of the Bakken which
would support our growth rate for next year.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

And Sheridan, we do see some additional petchem demand coming as well, right?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

That's right. There's one cracker that's -- to be completed here in the fourth quarter of 2020. And then
we also have an export dock that is to complete -- that has been completed and will start exporting full
capacity into next year. So we see good demand coming on for next year. And that's why we think we
could see some ethane recovery for a portion of the year in 2021.

We'll take our next question from Spiro Dounis with Crédit Suisse.

Spiro Michael Dounis
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

First question for Walt. Just with respect to leverage and getting to that 3.5x aspirational target. I think I
heard in your response to Shneur, that the strategy at this point is maybe steady deleveraging, with cash
flow over time, which sounds like, obviously, that's been pushed out a little bit. Just curious beyond some
of the repurchases you guys have done in the open market where maybe there's a lot of opportunity there
going forward, any appetite to get more proactive here? And specifically, what I'm thinking about is just
on the M&A side and using M&A as a tool to maybe both delever as well as do something strategic. I'm not
sure if anything is screening for you on that front?

ONEOK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Well, we think we're going to naturally delever. And I think we're -- we shouldn't be 4x first, 3.5
aspirational over time. But I think getting to that 4x goal is the near-term target. We obviously are going
to look at opportunities that come along the way. And if something was attractive from a delevering
standpoint, that would be a positive, but I don't think that would be a driver for us to do a transaction for
sure.

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Spiro, this is Terry. So while we're -- while we always think about acquisitions and opportunities to
add assets or businesses to our business, that's just an ongoing process. It's really not our top priority
right now. And managing the core business, managing the balance sheet is our priority. And we're just
going to stay focused on that. We'll stay focused on our operations. We're going to stay focused on serving
our customer needs. And optimizing our business where we can. The fact of the matter is, as I've said
before, M&A opportunities are kind of few and far between, and particularly, those that are actionable. So
we don't spend a whole lot of time worrying about that. So right now, in this environment, stay focused on
core business.

We'll take our next question from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein.

Jean Ann Salisbury
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

What drives the flaring that is still happening on your acreage and on the Bakken more broad-based? And
what would need to happen next year to get it even lower? Or is this just kind of a good indication?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Okay. Jean, this is Kevin. I think you look at the flaring that's left. We'll still have some isolated pockets of
wells and/or pads that haven't been connected and/or we have some maybe pressure limitations. We're
working to continue to put in some infrastructure. Obviously, we've taken out a lot of that flared gas as
productions come back online.

As we've said before, you're always going to have some level of flaring, especially when you look at IP
rates and if a producer brings on a very large pad and we're not building for the peak 30 days or things
like that. So those are the types that you've got operational disruptions that could cause some flaring from
time to time. So we'll continue to work to obviously look for ways to capture all the gas that's out there,
connect a few of these and continue to watch the pressures on our system.

Jean Ann Salisbury
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. So maybe a little bit lower, but not -- I shouldn't put on like a tiny number. Okay. And then I just
wanted to follow up on a question that was asked previously. Ethane price would not have to get all the
way to $0.40 for you to start sort of recovering and getting some benefit from the Bakken? I think what
you're saying that for your -- some of the portion that you market yourself, you could do it at a lower price
and make money.

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

Yes. We could always -- this is Sheridan. We could always lower our fees to make it economical to recover
ethane. We always have that option. And that's not only with our own volume coming off of our plant, but
that would also be with a lot of third-party volumes. And this is something that times we've done in the
Mid-Continent when we think ethane may be coming into rejections. To get them come in earlier, we've
reduced our fees at times to 4 months to allow them to come in. So we have that option. And if we see

We'll take our next question from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho.

Gabriel Philip Moreen
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

If I could ask maybe a little bit about what you're seeing with the poor curve for gas here being north of
$3. Assuming some of your legacy areas like the Mid-Con, you're seeing maybe some refracs or producer
interest and some stuff like that. I'm just curious if any discussions are happening?

Charles M. Kelley
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas

Gabe, this is Chuck. What was the last question regarding Mid-Continent, producer discussions? I didn't
quite hear it.

Gabriel Philip Moreen
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

The gas price is kind of $3, just wondering if producers are looking at refracs or more of just where it is
right now?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that's a good question. We have seen some refracs here this year, particularly last quarter, and I
understand there's a couple of schedules here in our Q4. Other than that, Mid-Continent producers we've
spoken with have shared their preliminary plans for 2021. And they're indicating a restart in activity in
both the stack and the scoop. We're seeing 2 to 3 rigs. We're talking about next year for us right now in
our acreage, there might be a fourth. And what they're citing is strengthening Mid-Continent gas prices for
some of the gas refracs, particularly in the stack. I hope that gives you a little bit of color of what we're
hearing in the Mid-Con.

Gabriel Philip Moreen
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

That was helpful. And then 2 quick clarification housekeeping questions for me. One is kind of what the
expectations now are for total second half 2020 CapEx, given 2Q spending, I think, some of that pull
forward. And then the other is just the guidance on double-digit growth for '21. I think last quarter, you
sort of sensitized with DAPL being on or off. Are there any sensitivities with DAPL being on or off?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Gabe, this is Kevin. I'll start and then Walt can chime in. As we think about CapEx, yes, clearly, with what
we've spent in the third quarter with the acceleration of some of these projects and the activity levels we
saw, we are at the high end and the capital usually tapers off in the fourth quarter, especially with weather
and other things. But we'll definitely trend towards the upper, if not slightly above the top end of the range
there, just given what we've spent year-to-date.

But I think going forward about capital, the notion that we can continue to stay in the kind of a run rate to
continue to grow with the customers in that $300 million to $400 million range would be solid. Absolutely,
we're thinking about DAPL and continue to think about it. Our outlook remains consistent with what we
said before that if you would experience or the industry would experience a DAPL shutdown, we still
believe it would be a mid- single-digit type growth for DAPL, even in that scenario. Our customers, as we
talk to them, they definitely have been exploring alternatives. Some of them have been securing some

rail, some of them have been moving some volumes to other pipes and getting allocation there. So we do
feel we could -- we'd be able to support volume growth even in the DAPL shutdown scenario.

Gabriel Philip Moreen
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And Sheridan, do you have anything to say in the event a DAPL shutdown could happen, you have the
potential to be accrued transporter out of here with some pipe you currently operate?

Sheridan C. Swords
Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids

Yes. We still continue to look at whether or not we would take the Bakken, the 12-inch pipeline into crude
service. As Kevin said, the producers out there have really looked at alternatives, and there's a lot of
alternatives beyond ours as well. Rail being one of them. Obviously the other pipes that may be in a better
position to start up quicker than our Bakken pipe could be the convert. But we still continue to investigate
that to make sure it's ready to move if we need to do that based on the DAPL shutdown.

We'll take our next question from Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets.

Elvira Scotto
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So recently, we've seen an acceleration of upstream M&A. What are your thoughts on this trend? I mean,
clearly, having larger, better capitalized shippers on your system would be a positive. Just -- but do you
see any potential impact to contracting? And do you think that the larger, more integrated midstream
companies like the ONEOK that can offer services across the value chain benefit here?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Elvira, this is Kevin. I don't know that we see -- I don't think -- we definitely don't see that as a negative.
We've got a lot of very large customers. And I don't see it as a contract issue at all. We've got -- the vast
majority of our contracts are long term, they're locked in. And we like those contract structures. The
companies typically -- the larger companies we deal with, many of them have a long-term view of display,
especially as we think about the Bakken, and they're looking at the reservoir over the next 10 to 20 years,
not over the next 3 to 4. So that can help from a standpoint of just good, strong ratable growth over time.
But I don't know that we'd see it as a significant pro or con either way.

Elvira Scotto
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then as a quick follow-up to that M&A question, I appreciate the comments that you made
on ONEOK and M&A, but I'm interested in your thoughts on overall trend that you think we can see in
midstream M&A potential?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

We're -- so Elvira, certainly, there is some potential in the midstream space for consolidation in gathering
and processing. And I've been saying for a better part of 15 years that there's going to be significant
consolidation this year and I've been wrong every time. But we do see some potential for private equity to
potentially look at placing assets into the market. The fact of the matter is that most of those assets don't
really make a whole lot of sense for us, don't fit with the bigger picture.

We've done a lot of work in trying to manage our risk as it relates to wellhead risk. And so we've done a
real good job there contractually as well as how we operate our businesses. So really to the extent we do
see some things in the midstream space, specifically in gathering processing, most of those, as I see the
landscape today, don't really shift that well, and certainly, carry with it some risks that we don't like.

But broadly speaking, on a large scale for midstream, there's some -- you see some assets that have
been spun out from other companies and utility companies, and some of those assets are assets that
look pretty good, that could make some sense. But certainly, we're going to look at the landscape and be
diligent and disciplined in the way we consider acquisitions, just as we always have.

had any recent discussions with the rating agencies? And how does that figure in terms of your capital

We have regular conversations with the rating agencies. We have throughout this -- throughout the
pandemic. We had regular conversations even before the pandemic. I think they've been supportive. You
can talk to them directly. We have been pretty clear about our view on the dividend, but it's part of the
capital allocation process that our Board thinks about every quarter. And -- but we really see the strength
of the business and the dividend coverage that we saw in this quarter and what we think about moving
forward. It's a part of the delevering that we're seeing and the rating agencies have been looking at as
well. So I can't speak for them, but we have a very regular dialogue with them.

We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. Real quick, we've had lots of M&A questions, and they've all been asset
acquisition or company acquisition-driven. I want to take it on the other side. Is there anything within the
ONEOK portfolio that might not necessarily be core to ONEOK. You have a pretty integrated system, but
just curious how you're thinking about that as a potential path to accelerating the deleveraging process?

Terry K. Spencer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Michael, we always think about that. We're constantly thinking about asset rationalization. The fact
of the matter is that we really don't materially have any assets that we don't consider to be core to our
business, but we may have assets that certainly don't generate quite as higher rate of return as others.
So we'll always think about those and we look at the landscape and the market opportunity and -- to
determine if ownership of the hold value for somebody else is greater. So we're always thinking about
those kinds of things, but as we sit today, our asset collection all fits together pretty well.

as an exit run rate relative to what it was at the beginning in the quarter?

We will take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.

Craig Kenneth Shere
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

Congratulations on a terrific quarter. First, based on conversations with producers, any color around the
magnitude of potential in Williston recoveries that you could see on your dedicated acreage from the
spring? And kind of dovetailing with Terry's comments about breakeven costs falling, are you getting body
language that the $40 to the new $35, like what we saw in 2015, 2016 as far as spring material rig count
recoveries?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Craig, it's Kevin. Yes, the conversations with producers is going great. They continue to get better and
better. Chuck referenced lateral lengths and the frac, the completion technologies, et cetera. In addition
to that, they have figured out spacing, and they know exactly what they're going to get. I think one of
the charts we provide, not in our quarterly materials but I think in our investor deck shows year-over-
year how the type curves have improved every year. And as we talk to producers, they don't expect that
to change as they continue to get better. So does that take the $45 to the new $40 or vice versa? I don't
know, but all I can tell you is in this price environment, all the conversations we're having with customers
right now are about increasing activity, not about shutting activity down.

Craig Kenneth Shere
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

Great. And last question. Kevin, I just want to dig deeper into your clean tech and environmental
comments. I mean some things we kind of maybe heard of is lithium extracted from oilfield brine,
hydrogen perhaps cheaper to derive from the old oilfields and on field liquefaction perhaps assisting with
flaring in certain basins. Acknowledging there's a lot of uncertainty over the next 5 to 10 years, are there
any areas of transition that will stand out more for you or you could potentially participate?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

Well, let me just -- hopefully, this will answer your question. I think when we think about our participation
in a low-carbon environment, it comes in basically 3 buckets. First is reducing the impacts on the --
from our existing assets and reducing our emissions. We've got opportunities to do that in terms of
enhanced pipeline integrity and leak protection or leak prevention. We also have the opportunity with
electrification of existing natural gas-fired equipment, and in particular, compressors. And so we've got --
we've done some of that work. We've got a lot of electric drive machines in service, and that's growing.
And we're looking at continuing to do that as we go out over a 10-year time frame that can and will have
a significant impact in lowering our emissions. It also gives us the opportunity to consume solar and wind-
derived electricity, which obviously is a good thing to do.

ONEOK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

The other bucket is the transportation and storage and logistics for hydrogen. As you mentioned, CO2
carbon capture. We've got some projects that we're looking at. This is a pretty low-hanging fruit to
reduce the amount of CO2 emissions. And then we're thinking about renewable fuels and other inert
types of commodities or substances so that fit very well with our existing capability and assets. And then
we're thinking about other low-carbon projects that just make strategic sense for our business. And that
could be investing in some new technologies, potentially hydrogen fuel cell technologies. We could have
investments in those types of projects, direct investments in some of those.

So the thing -- so profitability, business strategy, all of these things have to make sense with that broader
objective to be a profitable company and to make us better and to reduce our impact on the environment.
So that's kind of how we think about it. We're probably not going to invest in projects that absolutely
don't have a fit or don't connect in some form or fashion strategically with our core business and our core
capability as a midstream company. So that's, I think, a long-winded answer to your -- thanks for your
question. Hopefully, that helped.

We'll take our next question from Derek Walker with Bank of America.

Derek Bryant Walker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I know we're over the hour, and I appreciate you squeezing me in here. Maybe I'll just ask one and ask
the other questions offline. But if I heard you right during the formal remarks, I believe you said you
captured $100 million of cost reductions this year up to this point. And I know there's some commentary
around cost savings with shifting volumes around, it was kind of $40 million to $50 million. Does that
$40 million to $50 million, is that incremental to that $100 million? Or have you achieved some of that
already? And I guess is there a general sort of cost reduction target that you have going into next year.
I think you had $120 million last year, but I just wanted to make sure that's incremental to what you've
already talked about?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

This is Kevin. The $40 million to $50 million, I believe, you're talking about that Sheridan referenced.
That's related to kind of margin in our NGL business. And so that would not be included in the $130 million
we expect to save from our cost savings. So that -- those are 2 separate things.

We'll take our next question from Ganesh Jois with Goldman Sachs.

Ganesh V. Jois
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.

Just following up on Derek's question on the costs, we saw a meaningful step down in the OpEx in the G&P
segment. Just wanted to understand if there was something unique happening in this particular quarter?
Or if this is a decent run rate to think of from a total OpEx perspective going forward?

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

The step down you're referring to is that compared to the second quarter or you compared to last year?

Ganesh V. Jois
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.

Both actually because, I guess, you have many more plants that are online this year than last year, and
yet, your numbers were meaningfully lower. So just curious if there's something happening unique to this
quarter? Or if this is the new normal in terms of cost structure?

ONEOK, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Kevin L. Burdick
Executive VP & COO

No. I don't know that I'd say it's a new normal. But clearly, when we have worked really hard over the
last several months, really since the beginning of the pandemic to cut costs wherever possible. So we
are doing things like there's -- we have compressor stations that we can reroute gas and shut down
compressor stations, and there's a couple of plants in the Mid-Continent we have temporarily idled, that
pulls cost out. You don't need as much materials and services and probably the biggest driver is our
contract labor. We are doing most everything ourselves at this point with our employees as volumes have
left. So with some process improvements and other things we found, we expect that some of that will be
sustainable. But you would also expect that as our volumes pick back up, the costs will go up a little bit
just from that additional volume.

That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Ziola, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference
over back to you.

Andrew J. Ziola

All right. Thank you, Sarah. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in
January and extends until we release earnings in late February. We'll provide details for the conference call
at a later day. Thank you for joining us, and have a good week. Thank you, everybody.

Thanks, Andrew.
