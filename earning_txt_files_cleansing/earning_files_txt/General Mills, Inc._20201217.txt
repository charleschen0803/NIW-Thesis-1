Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the General Mills Quarter 2 Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, December 17, 2020.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon. Please go ahead.

Jeff Siemon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for our question-and-
answer session on our second quarter results. I hope everyone had time to review our press release, listen
to the prepared remarks and view our presentation materials, which were made available this morning on
our Investor Relations website.

It's important to note that in our Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are based
on management's current views and assumptions, including facts and assumptions related to the potential
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results in fiscal '21. Please refer to this morning's press release
for factors that could impact forward-looking statements and for reconciliations of non-GAAP information,
which may be discussed on today's call.

I'm here virtually with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; Kofi Bruce, our CFO; and Jon Nudi, Group
President of our North America Retail segment. We are in different locations, so we will make sure that
technology works well for us and everything goes smoothly.
And with that, let's go ahead and get to the first question. Frank, you can get us started.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Two for me, if I can. First, quickly, the trade load of pet food, was this to catch up from undershipments in
prior quarters? Or was this in advance of what could be maybe an undershipment next quarter or maybe
just heightened demand? I'm just trying to get a sense of what this means for your third quarter since you
didn't call it out as a headwind.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

So thanks, Ken. So first, I'd start with saying, we had a tremendous quarter in pet food in general and a
really good first half of the year. And I think we've proven that despite the fact that we've lapped our food,
drug and mass expansion that we can continue to grow this brand.

As it relates to the topic of how we ship relative to demand, I would say, in the first quarter of this
year, we shipped behind demand. Recall our growth -- our reported growth was 6%, even though our
movement was probably in high single digits. They're a little bit of the reverse in the second quarter,
where our reported net sales growth was 18%, but our movement was probably in the double-digit range.

How I think about it for the first half of the year then, our reported net sales are up about 13%. Our
movement is probably up about 10%, I would say, maybe 11% but probably about 10% or 11%. So we
have shipped a little bit ahead of movement as it pertains to this year.

I would still expect us to have a strong quarter in the third quarter. Our movements remain strong.
We'll see what the reported net sales impact is. But I would expect our shipments to be strong and our
movement to continue to be strong. Because what we're seeing in the category right now is mid-single-
digit growth, really led by premiumization. And because Blue Buffalo is the best brand in that and the
biggest brand in that segment, we're performing well.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then my follow-up, you're guiding to a flat EBIT margin year-on-year in the third quarter. But in 3Q
'20, you did have a pretty big hit from COVID in China. I think you said at the time that just Häagen-Dazs
China alone was 150 basis point headwind to your total operating profit margin in the quarter. Correct me
if I'm wrong on that. And you had organic sales growth that quarter of 0%, which was pretty low for you
guys. So there was no fixed cost leverage.

You turn around a year later, China is doing great. You have all this fixed cost leverage from another 7%
organic growth quarter coming. Why shouldn't we be modeling an EBIT margin maybe a little bit higher
than that 16.2-ish percent number you did a year ago at this time?

Kofi A. Bruce
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Ken...

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Ken, your -- yes. Go ahead, Kofi.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

Chief Financial Officer

Go ahead. Sorry. Sorry. Ken, Kofi here. Thanks for the question. As we mentioned in the prepared
remarks, one of the things we're flagging is an expectation that we will see some of the external supply
chain costs shift into Q3, which will be an offset to some of the expected leverage benefit we would expect
to see with the volume that we're guiding to for the quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you called out -- and I think you did last quarter, too, but you called out
some interesting results in China where traffic in the company's retail shops is coming back towards
normal levels. But sales of at-home consumption items, like Wanchai Ferry, still remain quite elevated. So
of course, every market is not like-for-like.

But do you see the dynamic in markets like China and others, maybe Australia, that are well ahead of
where we are in sort of getting the virus under control as reasonable indicators or corollaries for some
of what perhaps gives you a little more comfort on why there's conviction in some of the at-home items
staying elevated even as things kind of normalize here in the U.S.? I'm trying to get a sense of what
takeaways you can conclude from some of those markets as it relates to the U.S.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Andrew, it is a very good question and also a good memory from what we talked about in Q1. I mean
we -- I put these in my prepared remarks because there's a lot of speculation among us as CPG people on
food as well as investors and analysts about what's going to happen post pandemic. And we're all looking
forward to that day.

But there are very few data points on what is actually happening when governments aren't locking down
restaurants and bars and things like that. And so one of the things we can -- there are a couple of data
points we can point to that don't guarantee what's going to happen afterwards, but at least there are data
points of what's actually happened rather than speculation on what might happen. And one of those places
is China, where restrictions have been lifted 5 or 6 months ago, and we're still seeing slight declines in
our foodservice business while our Wanchai Ferry dumplings business, which is a frozen business at home,
remains up double digits.

And while it's not up as high as it was at the beginning of the pandemic, it's still up double digits and
significantly above where it was pre-pandemic. And we think that's important because, at the very
minimum, what it points to is the consumer eating habits, while they may change from where they are
now, once we have a vaccine and once we're post pandemic, doesn't necessarily mean they're going to go
all the way back to where they were before or at a minimum, aren't going to go back as fast.

We're seeing a little bit of the same thing in Australia, where our current movement in Australia is not
what it was at the beginning of the pandemic when they were on a lockdown. But we have seen growth in
our business in Australia, even in the last few months as the restrictions have been eased.

And so we point these things out and I point these things out because, while there's a lot of speculation
about what might happen, there are at least a couple of places where we're watching what is happening.
And that would point to continued levels of pretty high demand even once where we have a vaccine and
once the lockdown and restrictions have been lifted.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

Got it. Right. And then just quickly, you discussed not yet having had the opportunity to kind of fully
replenish retail inventories in a lot of areas as consumptions remain pretty elevated. Would you anticipate
more of that retail inventory refill to be able to happen in fiscal second half, such that sales maybe
broadly, call it, in North America Retail, could be ahead of in-market consumption? Or are we still at a
place where significant refill of inventories at retail is just tough given where consumption levels remain?

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Andrew, let me start by -- let me start with this question. I'm going to pass it to Jon Nudi for specifics
on North America Retail. I would say, in general, for this quarter, as I look at our whole enterprise, we
really haven't built inventories in the second quarter. But it really does depend on the segment.

So for example, we talked a little bit about Pet, where we did ship ahead of demand and rebuilt pipeline.
In the consumer convenience and foodservice, it's the opposite, where because of school closings and all
the rest, we -- certain distributors aren't carrying as much inventory. And we probably are a little bit -- our
RNS is behind demand for the quarter.

And in North America Retail, because our movement was about 9%, and our shipments were about 9%,
we saw very little movement. But maybe it'd be helpful for Jon Nudi to kind of weigh in on maybe what we
saw in Q4 last year and Q1 and 2 and then kind of what the implications are for the rest of the year.

Jonathon J. Nudi
Group President of North America Retail

Yes. Thanks, Jeff. In terms of North America Retail, we did ship in Q4 of fiscal '20 about 9 points --
shipments lagged consumption by about 9 points. As we move through the first half of fiscal '21, we were
able to replenish about 4 points of that gap. So there's still about 5 points to make up. And we do believe
by the end of the fiscal year, we'll get there.

The majority of our categories were actually in pretty good shape from a capacity standpoint and a service
standpoint. But we have a few that were still -- had some significant issues with, things like soup and
dessert mixes, Old El Paso taco shells. We do believe we'll get better through Q3. And by the end of Q4, I
think we'll be back to where we want to be from an inventory standpoint.

Operator

Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.

Laurent Daniel Grandet
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I do have some questions on pet food. So wet pet food was plus 25% in the quarter; treats, up plus
40%. With the addition of Tasteful and wet cat food, I mean, what to expect for wet pet food this coming
calendar year? And also, I think you said in the past that you would be launching new treats at the
beginning of the calendar year. Could you please update us on this initiative, please?

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

So Laurent, as I think about our pet food business, I mean, one of the things I'm most pleased with is that
we're growing across our different segments. So if you look at it by product types, if you look at dog food,
whether it's wet dog food or dry dog food or dog treats, we're growing in all those segments. If you look
at cat food, whether it's dry or wet or treats, we're growing in all those segments.

Then if we look across channels, we're actually growing across all the channels we participate in. We're
growing in the food, drug and mass channel. We're growing in -- we actually returned to slight growth
in specialty. And we're actually growing quite a bit in e-commerce. And so I think that speaks to the
underlying health of our pet food business when we can grow in all the different segments, whether it's
consumer segments or whether it's in the channels we compete in.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

When it comes to how we're going to grow forward, I mean, certainly, the premiumization of pet food and
the humanization of pet food is a trend we see coming. We're really excited about this Tastefuls' launch.
And it's a -- pet -- cat wet food is a $5 billion segment. And we probably have about a 2 or 2.5 share of
that segment, whereas our dog dry is 10 shares. So we have a lot of ground to make up. And what we're
introducing in the marketplace is going to taste great. And we know that pet parents of cats, they want
to feed their cats something in wholesome and natural, but they also need to taste good because, frankly,
cats are picky eaters and certainly, they can be. And so we're excited about that.

When it comes to treats, we are -- we do have some treat launches lined up here for the third quarter. So
we're launching those as well. We also have some more innovation in our pipeline, both on treats and in
the cat food area. And so we're pretty bullish about our ability to continue to compete effectively given
what we see in our innovation pipeline and, frankly, the continued premiumization and humanization in the
pet food category.

Laurent Daniel Grandet
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And if I may, I've got a second question on Europe. Sales are improving in Europe. And you mentioned in
your prepared remarks, I mean, Old El Paso and Häagen-Dazs being a major element of that recovery. So
now, actually, we saw also trends improving in yogurts. Could you please, I mean, provide us some more
business update about that significant piece of your European business?

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I'm really pleased with our European results. I mean we grew share broadly in France. We grew
share in Australia, and we held share in the U.K. So our European business is doing well. The things that
led to growth, as you say, are our Häagen-Dazs business and our Old El Paso business, which have good
margins, which is why you see our profitability up in the quarter, outpacing our sales growth.

But our yogurt business, particularly in France, continues to grow. I'm really pleased with the performance
of our French yogurt business. We're growing share, but we're also growing in the absolute. We're just not
growing as fast as we are in Häagen-Dazs and in Old El Paso. But we are growing our yogurt business,
particularly in France. In fact, our yogurt business throughout the world, with the exception of the U.K.,
where we discontinued a subline in adult yogurt. Outside of the U.K., whether it's Canada, whether it's the
U.S., whether it's France, our biggest markets, we're actually growing our market share in yogurt. And so
we feel good about our performance there.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Can you hear me okay?

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Kofi A. Bruce
Chief Financial Officer

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

So sticking with the European theme. I can't help but notice that in the U.S. retail segment, you've
obviously got very robust takeaway and would expect, given this pandemic, things are going very strongly
there. Europe looks kind of more normal. The sales growth is more [ subdued ]. I'm just wondering
structurally, what the differences are between the 2 markets. And why we would be seeing things panning
out through the pandemic so differently between the 2 regions?

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's a very fair question, Alexia. Let me try to unpack it for you because -- and it's a fair question.
When you look at our retail sales in Europe during the quarter, they're up 11%. When you look at our
retail sales in the U.S., they're up 9%. So actually, if you look at retail sales of branded products, what
we're seeing in Europe is very similar to what we're seeing in the U.S.

Now we have some product portfolio differences like a big yogurt business in Europe, and it's smaller
in the U.S. But we're seeing our retail growth about the same. Remember, though, that as you look at
our results for Europe, our European business also contains a reasonable-sized foodservice business. So
think about Häagen-Dazs shops and our foodservice dough business, which are not contained in our North
America Retail businesses.

Also, we have some other businesses that we bought with yogurt and with dough and other things and
corn, some private label businesses, which are not also growing not as fast, which obviously we don't have
in the U.S. So if you look at strictly retail to retail, I would say Europe and the U.S. are behaving quite
similarly. But we have some other businesses in Europe that would overlap into the foodservice area and a
little bit in private label that drags down the overall sales result but with still good profitability in Europe.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, promotional activity, obviously, that was called back from the
early part of the pandemic. Just curious about how the promotional activity, particularly [indiscernible] is
coming back. Are the retailers expecting you to spend back a little bit more than you normally would do
because they want some of that money back that wasn't spent earlier in the year? Maybe talk about those
dynamics, and then I'll pass it on.

Jeff Siemon
Vice President of Investor Relations

So Alexia, this is Jeff Siemon. I think I heard promotional activity in our retailers looking for us to spend
back or spend more incrementally. I think -- it was a bit choppy, but I think that was the question.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Jon Nudi, do you want to pick up on that?

Jonathon J. Nudi
Group President of North America Retail

Yes, absolutely. So for the U.S., in particular, and Canada as well, we're seeing less promotional activity,
really through the first half of our year. It's primarily driven by a decrease in depth of promotion. So
frequency looks pretty similar across the majority of our categories. But again, promo frequency is down
in capacity-constrained categories, though. So again, it's really a category-by-category dynamic that's
going on. Things like soup, we chose to pull a significant amount of merchandising, really through our first
half to make sure that we had product available as we get into key season. Desserts would be the same
thing as well.

So as we move to the back half, we think in the majority of our categories, you're going to see promotion
levels normalize versus what we've seen prior to the pandemic. I think we'll still see lower levels of depth
of discount in some of the categories that are capacity-constrained.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

And I'll tell you, again, it's a balancing act. Obviously, we want to be competitive. Our retailers want to
be competitive. But I think everyone wants to do it profitably as well. So it's a dynamic discussion that's
going on with our retail partners and something we'll continue to assess as we move through the back half
of the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Crédit Suisse.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I had a couple of questions. Jeff, the first one was on e-commerce. I've seen some predictions that e-
commerce could be as much as 20% to 25% of the grocery industry over time. And I think that's based
on the investment that the retailers are making and the expectation that consumers enjoy getting the
convenience during the pandemic.

Can you talk a little broadly about how your business model might change if that becomes that big of
a penetration? Or there's not much you have to change. You just have kind of keep up with retailers'
demand.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

So Rob, let me -- I'll provide a little back-to-start perspective, and then we can talk about what happens in
the future. I mean 18 months ago, about 5% of our business globally was through e-commerce. And in 18
months, it's now jumped to 10%. So it's doubled over that period of time. So a pretty significant change in
a short period of time.

And that is certainly true of our U.S. business, but it's also true of what we're seeing in China and Korea
and Europe as well. So it's a fairly global phenomenon.

As far as where it goes, I mean, I guess the other historical perspective I would also provide is at this
point in time, even though 10% of our business is through e-commerce channels, at least here in the --
particularly here in the U.S., our biggest business, about 85% of those sales actually go through stores
still. And that's important because up until this point in time, we certainly haven't had to change our
model very much because most of our e-commerce sales still go through stores and grocery stores here in
the U.S. or Häagen-Dazs shops in China. And so our model hasn't changed much.

I don't think over the coming couple of years, our model is going to be -- is going to change very much
because the click-and-collect model, where consumers pick things up themselves, is so much more
profitable for our retail partners. That model, I think, is going to be a -- still be a predominant one in the
near future.

How it looks 5 years from now? I mean we'll see. I do think that e-commerce will continue to grow. I think
it will continue to evolve. But I would tell you, at least in the near term, I think we're very well positioned.
We over-indexed in our categories because we've got great brands and we've got really good capabilities.
And the business model for us is not very different than what we've seen before.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Great. And a follow-up for you, different subject. A lot of us are trying to figure out the cost profile
of the industry getting into fiscal '22. And I would imagine some costs that you had related to COVID
mitigation at the plants would come down. Is there any way to broadly think about your cost profile, like
a year from now? And what costs might come out? And maybe even comment on other efficiencies that
you're looking at.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

Kofi, do you want to tackle that one?

Kofi A. Bruce
Chief Financial Officer

Absolutely. And I'll try to steer clear of getting too deep into fiscal '22, given a humble respect for the
uncertainty of the environment we've got right in front of us. But I think you have the general structure
right. There are certainly costs that we have been bearing as we deal with some of the health and safety
protocols to support safe operation in this environment. Some of those could potentially go away.

But I think the other and more important is, as you think about the operational costs that we're incurring
to service higher levels of demand, the way that we have pursued supplementing our capacity allows us to
scale down to the extent that demand comes off its peak, even if it remains elevated. So I think we've left
ourselves with agility to not build a lot of these costs into our structure. So I think that's the posture we've
taken as we've looked at how to service demand in this environment.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

My question is if we're -- go into a scenario where demand remains elevated for the next few years, if we
look at North American Retail and the mix of business now, like meals and baking has really driven a lot
of the growth -- or the extra growth, I should say. Would you expect the mix to change? So if we kind
of transition to kind of like a newer normal where there's more flexibility, people working at home, and
we're kind of past the pandemic. I'm just trying to understand whether or not you think the mix of what's
driving the growth in North America Retail would change going forward. Or do you think that things like
meals and baking would continue to stay at elevated level?

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

That's a -- Bryan, that's a good question, and an important one and one that, to be honest, we're trying
to figure out the next quarter and what our mix is going to look like. I will tell you, though, that what I do
see is that there are certainly a lot more people have been introduced to baking. We know that household
penetration has especially increased among young families and especially among Hispanic families.

And so we know that people have baked more, and they're going to be more confident baking, which
would point to perhaps baking remaining elevated. To the extent that people work from home, that would
speak to the breakfast occasion or lunch occasion as occasions that will have the opportunity to benefit
longer term. And so it is possible that our mix changes. We'll have to see when we get there.

What I would like is that our meals and baking businesses here in the U.S. are -- the margins are really
good on those as they are in cereal. And so to the extent the mix changes, I think we'll -- we would still
have an opportunity to grow profitably.

And so clearly, we're all interested to see what's going to happen in F '22 and beyond. It's a little bit early
to call, but I am confident that should we see a change in mix that we can navigate in a way that we can
produce -- hopefully produce some growth but also maintain profitability as we do it.

Operator

Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I wanted to talk about reinvestment in growth. I know it's a broad topic. It could be advertising, it could
be other capabilities. But how are you thinking about that? Obviously, you have opportunity to do that this

year, even stretching back to fiscal 4Q of last year. But how -- what is the level of that reinvestment in '20
-- in fiscal '21? And what is that supporting? And any color would be helpful. And I have a quick follow-up.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Kofi, you want to take that one.

Kofi A. Bruce
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Just let me frame out -- as you look at, in particular, some of the brand-building activity that you
would look at through media, we're up roughly double digits through the first half in terms of support
behind key platforms and key ideas.

We do continue to watch with a hawkish eye the return on investment on those brand-building activities.
And I think the capabilities, as you think about those, in particular, data and analytics, those are coming
through in our admin line. I would expect those to be investments that have a payoff profile probably over
the intermediate term.

So this is really about setting up sustainability of some of the growth trends and being able to ensure that
we have a good shot at holding on to some of the penetration gains that we're seeing in this environment.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I think there is a -- almost a cynicism or a skepticism out there for people watching the food space. They
see the food companies -- and Mills was part of this. They cut back on advertising spending during much
of the 2010s, and there's going to be this reinvestment now. But I think the concern or the expectation
is that maybe advertising doesn't work for these categories or it didn't -- doesn't work like it used to.
Are you doing things differently in the way that you're reinvesting now that you feel like the ROIs will be
better? And any color there would be helpful.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes. David, yes, I read your report. And I don't agree with all of it, but I respect the fact that you put out
there what you think. We've measured ROI for a long time, and we think we're pretty good at it.

And if you're asking whether advertising has changed over time, the answer is, of course, it has. Because
there are no longer 3 channels in the TV set, and you can advertise in a variety of formats, whether it's
through gaming or Instagram or Hulu or what have you. And so of course, advertising has changed in
terms of how people consume media.

What hasn't changed, though, is what drives ROI. What drives ROI is marketing behind big brands on
really good ideas that people care about, like heart health on Cheerios, like Jennifer Lopez marketing
Yoplait and calcium on yogurt in places where people are going to watch it. So we advertise Totino's
through gaming because that's where people are -- that's where their eyes are, and that's where they're
going on Totino's. Advertising, I don't know, Cheerios heart health on gaming probably wouldn't be the
best idea. And so those are the things that I mentioned, big brands, great ideas that people care about
and where you put it, that's actually remained the same. What's changed is that where people go for
information. And so we're following that just as everybody else is.

What I think is different and probably underappreciated about what we have is that we have a lot of first-
party data through bettycrocker.com and pillsbury.com and Box Tops. And when we combine what we can
do with that through data and analytics, along with great brands and really good ideas, we're confident
that we can generate good ROIs.

Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

Faiza Alwy
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

So a couple of questions around topics that have already been discussed a little bit. The first one is just,
Kofi, around margins. I was hoping that you could help quantify sort of some of the puts and takes on the
gross margin line. And I think in 4Q, you had said that you had incurred around $100 million of COVID-
related costs. And you talked about those extending into fiscal '21. So I was wondering if you could
quantify how much of those have extended and how much of these might stay sort of post pandemic.

And maybe there has been some benefit from internal operating leverage. I know we've talked about
lower promotions. Maybe there's some positive mix because some of your higher-margin categories
have been growing faster. And raw materials seem to have -- raw material pricing, there's been some
favorability there. But I was hoping you could just unpack some of these factors and what you've seen in
the first half. And again, how we should think about those factors in a more normalized environment?

Kofi A. Bruce
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. Sure. Let me just give you a sense here that the kind of -- in order of magnitude, the way to think
about the cost structure on gross margin, we are expecting about 3% input cost inflation and continue to
track to roughly that. Our higher operational costs to service demand in this environment, which is one of
the categories that we would have flagged as being linked to the pandemic, would follow that. And then
brand capabilities and investments and then the health and safety costs also were linked to the pandemic.

I think, candidly, it is getting harder to separate the COVID-related costs. So we have not been doing so
this year, in part because COVID is -- it impacts and permeates so many areas of our business, and there
probably is a level of visibility that is hard to get much more granular than we have been.

I think you're right in the call about mix of business, certainly leverage. Those things certainly help the
margin profile as we're seeing a lot of growth in our highest-margin businesses in Pet and North America
Retail driving a lot of the company's growth and that accreting to gross margin mix.

Faiza Alwy
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then just a follow-up. I think, Jeff, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you
have sort of incremental flexibility around bolt-on M&A and share repurchases at the right time. And I was
hoping you could expand on that.

So are you waiting for the pandemic to essentially go away before you take some actions around -- on
the M&A front? Are you more active in the M&A market than you were maybe a year ago? I know you'd
previously talked about some type of portfolio optimization or some divestments. And are there any
particular categories where you would maybe like to expand in? So just more color around those topics.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Let me answer it kind of top line. And then, Kofi, if you want to come in and answer anything in
more detail, please feel free to jump in. I would say, as we think about capital allocation, obviously, the
first call is to the business. And we've increased our capital spending this year behind some nice growth
projects, especially in cereal and fruit snacks and Mexican food.

The second thing we said we would do is, once we get our leverage down was to increase our dividend,
and we've increased our dividend rate by 4% so far this year. So we've done that. And so then it begs the
question, what is going to happen going forward? The first thing I would tell you is that we would hope to
get to a more what we would consider to be more normal capital allocation process now that our net debt-
to-EBITDA ratio is in about the 2.9 range. And so it gives us a lot of flexibility, a lot of different ways that
we can create value for shareholders.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

If we see some -- we'll continue to reshape our portfolio, and that's both on the acquisition front and the
divestiture front. And so to the extent we see bolt-on acquisitions that we think will be accretive to our
growth and good for shareholders, we now have the flexibility to do that.

If on the other hand, there's nothing that we see on the horizon on the M&A front, we now have the
flexibility to buy back shares if we need to do that. We don't need to necessarily wait for the end of the
pandemic before we do either M&A or share buybacks. But now we have the flexibility on our balance
sheet to resume those kind of activities and to create value for shareholders in a variety of ways, which
we feel great about. And I think we've proven through our M&A and Blue Buffalo that we can add value
through M&A. And clearly, share buybacks are something that can add value as well. So that would be the
top line.

Kofi, anything you want to add to that?

Kofi A. Bruce
Chief Financial Officer

No. I think we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making on debt deleverage. And so
I think as we look at that as the gate that probably most matters, we are very quickly getting back to a
place where our capital structure is in the right long-term target zone.

And then I would just also add that we do have an existing share repurchase plan with a fair amount of
authorization remaining up and standing. So there really isn't any additional gates should we decide that
share repurchases make sense.

Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats to another strong quarter.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Thank you.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I guess I want to come back to the gross margin question. And I apologize, I got a little bit distracted by
my son in the middle of your answer. So you may have actually commented on this. But I think I heard
you in response to -- maybe to Ken Goldman's question, on terms of margins going to flat next quarter,
mention external costs shifting into next quarter. So I guess how the external costs shift? I would think
that they're just kind of there, if you're using external providers. And are you effectively then signaling
that it's going to be gross margins that stall out the margin progression as we go into next quarter?

Kofi A. Bruce
Chief Financial Officer

Jason, I totally get the interruption from your son. I've had them even on investor calls, so I totally get
it. And thanks for your question. Yes, so as you think about next quarter, the way to think about external
supply chain cost shifting is that we were able to service more of our demand through internal capacity in
Q2. We didn't need to rely as much on it.

But as we go into Q3, we -- with an expectation of demand remaining elevated and recognizing and linking
to the fact that we didn't see as much inventory replenishment in North America Retail, we would expect
to have to lean more heavily on external supply chain in Q3 as we expect to make some progress against
that inventory rebuild.

be potentially some additional costs that come through at the admin line as we advance some of the
investment in capability.

Jason M. English

That's helpful. And one more quick question on pet food. First, congrats on the strong results in Pet. They
certainly surprised me. More robust than I was expecting. Can you give me a performance by channel?

channels?

Jeffrey L. Harmening

Kofi, do you want to take a crack at that answer?

Kofi A. Bruce
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Yes, sorry. Just want to make sure, am I -- I'm still on. So question was kind of by channel. As we
look at our Q2, we saw Pet Specialty probably lagging the other 2 channels. e-commerce, up double digits
as we look at the shape of our business. That's about 1/3 of our sales in Pet, and FDM at almost 40% as
we look at the measured.

Jason M. English

Got it. It's 40% FDM. Got it. I appreciate it. Let me pass it on and hopefully we get Jeff back soon.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

All right. Great. And glad you guys are back. So wanted to ask a little bit more about pet food. Jeff, when
you bought the business, there was guidance from the old team at double-digit top line growth. When
it became part of General Mills, you stuck with that double-digit guidance. But there was just enormous
skepticism on the ability of that business as part of General Mills to keep going.

I think in your answer to one of the first questions, you said underlying demand is running 10%, 11%. Are
we -- are you able to say that Blue has some runway here to continue to see that double-digit growth?
And then can you just give us -- you've mentioned a bunch of things so far in the script, but can you just
kind of hone in on some of the pieces here that would give us that double-digit growth for some time into
the future?

And what I like about this particular question is, I hope this is not a pandemic-related question and that
you guys do have some very clear thoughts about it. Because it says -- I think you guys have said it
yourself, the pets don't eat at restaurants. Hopefully, that makes sense. And then I've got a follow-up,
please.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I -- first, let me go with what I know, and then we can talk about what we think. What I know is that
the growth in Blue Buffalo really isn't pandemic-related. And an even though, anecdotally, adoptions are
up for pets and certainly among millennials. That actually was not driving the growth of the category, and
it's not driving the growth of Blue Buffalo. The category is being driven by the premiumization of pet food.
And we know that because the dollar growth is up mid-single digits in the category, and the pounds are
only up low single digits. So that delta continues to be important as pet parents switch from whatever
they're feeding their pets before into more premium pet food. And so that's what we know. And we know
that Blue Buffalo is a great brand.

We also thought when we bought Blue Buffalo that we'd be able to execute well with our rollout at the
food, drug and mass channel because we've done it with Annie's. And we got a lot right. We got a few
things wrong, but we learned a lot through Annie's. And so we're going to apply that to Blue Buffalo. And
so now we've got a really good all-channels business. And one of the things we learned with Annie's was
that great brands travel across channels, and that just because you have something in a grocery store, it
doesn't mean that every consumer knows that it's there yet. It takes a long time to gain awareness. There
are some places that we've looked, we probably only have 20% awareness in some accounts that the Blue
Buffalo actually exists at that supermarket chain.

And so that has given us confidence, not only that we could execute a food, drug and mass rollout, but
that Blue Buffalo would be good across channels. And that we continue to grow, even once we gain full
distribution because we've seen this movie before on Annie's. And that's what's playing out.

As to how we grow into the future, I can't promise that we're going to grow double digits in the future.
We had a very good quarter this quarter. I think we'll have a good quarter coming up. But what I can tell
you is that I am confident we have the best premium brand in the pet category. I'm confident that the
premiumization of pet food will continue so that we're very well positioned.

We have a robust pipeline of renovation and new products and that we continue to grow in food, drug and
mass. And so all those things lead me to believe that not only it has been -- Blue Buffalo been a good
acquisition for General Mills, but that it'll continue to perform well. And whether that's high single digits
or double digits will remain to be seen. But I think that we're all -- we were all confident when we bought
Blue Buffalo, that we could do a lot of good things with this business. And we're at least as confident now
as we were the day that we bought it 3 years ago.

David Christopher Driscoll
DD Research LLC

Well, you certainly get big congratulations from me on the performance there. We've seen other
businesses at other companies struggle. So good job on that one.

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

My follow-up question is on, staying with Pet, is on the marketing model. Blue used to have a really
sizable investment in in-store promoters, the so-called pet detectives. And on top of this, the brand had
industry-leading levels of advertising. How has that changed with the pandemic and the pressures that
we've seen on Pet Specialty stores? Is -- fundamentally, have you shifted monies from those in-store
promoters to the advertising side? Is the total budget down? I just have lost sight of that a little bit and
like to understand how you're going to keep kind of your foot on the gas pedal on this business going
forward.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So the pandemic's changed a lot of things, including the ability of consumers to get into stores. The
-- what I will say is that what hasn't changed for Blue Buffalo and what will not change going forward is
our commitment to keep educating pet parents on the value of Blue Buffalo. And as you say, there has
been a huge in-store model to that historically. And we wouldn't see getting -- necessarily getting away
from an in-store model, but we've begun to supplement that, not only with TV advertising but also digital
advertising and digital marketing.

And so what I think you'll see -- what you'll see is our dedication to growing the brand and growing our
marketing will continue. How that marketing -- that marketing mix will change over time. And we think
that an omnichannel approach to marketing, where you have some in-store presence, but you can also
meet pet parents where they are one-on-one online, is going to be an increasingly important part of our
business.

And we've done a really good job with North America Retail in that regard. And we're applying some of
what we learned into Pet and plowing some new ground. We'll probably talk about that even more, maybe
a quarter from now. But I'd say it's a really good question. What I can tell you is that the marketing model
will continue to evolve as our ways of reaching pet's parents evolve. But our dedication to building the
brand will remain unchanged.

Operator

Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Jeff, maybe just kind of a broader question just around the strength of brands, right, and I guess, more
specifically, your brands and the market share you've been able to hold or take within the U.S. really over
the past 9 months kind of vis-à-vis private label, right? There's been a lot of discussion in why private
label has maybe lagged some of these stronger brands or master brands. Upfront, it seems like it may
have been supply chain issue. It would seem like the supply chain issue maybe has kind of drifted a little
bit. It speaks more broadly or positively to brands overall.

But then at the same time, we hear companies saying, okay. Well, if we go into a recession, consumers
will continue to look to consume food at home because it's a less costly option. But it also sounds like
you're suggesting they still won't go to private label. So I'm just trying to kind of rightsize how we should
be thinking about brands overall with respect to kind of the economic backdrop and then kind of compared
to private label. Sorry. There's a lot there.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

There's a lot there because there's a lot there. What I would say is that -- let me go back to the last Great
Recession because I was actually marketing during that. The first thing I would just say is that any time
you see economic turmoil, the first shift that consumers have toward value is actually not to private label.
The first shift really is from away-from-home eating to at-home eating because the economics eating at
home are a lot more favorable for consumers than the economics of eating away from home. So that's the
first big shift that takes place. So you see the categories grow.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

GENERAL MILLS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 17, 2020

Then within that, what we saw within our categories during the last Great Recession, we actually held
share through the Great Recession. Private label actually grew as well. Private label actually grew share.
And where we saw the share of losses was from middling brands. And so that is -- that's one of the things
we saw during the last Great Recession.

What we've seen now is that in the categories in which we compete, not only here in the U.S. but in
Europe and Brazil as well, is that we continue to gain market share because we've got good brand
strength as well as good supply chains. Our retail customers see that we're driving growth in the majority
of our categories, and they want to see that growth continue.

And at least so far, we've seen private label shares decline, whether it's in pet food or human food or
-- even in Europe. And so what we -- then the question is, what comes forward? And we don't see any
reason why consumers won't continue to buy big brands. They may -- consumers may decide to shift
to more of the private label. But if what happens during the last Great Recession happens again in our
categories, we'll at least hold share during that period of time.

So that's -- I mean I like to try to get back to what has happened because everyone likes to speculate
about what will happen. And I do, too. But I think it's instructive always to go back and look to see what
has happened.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then just kind of a follow-up question that's related. Obviously, really over the
past 5 years, right, there's been an incremental push into ongoing SKU optimization. Not just trying to --
that's kind of the nature of the beast always. Seems like there's been maybe a little bit of an acceleration
or kind of pull-forward of that just given everything that's been kind of at hand over the past 9 months,
let's call it. Do you kind of feel that -- when you speak with the retailers, that they're really increasingly
focused on those high-velocity, kind of more scale, more profitable items, such that kind of those larger
brands still kind of have the advantage relative to some smaller brands trying to kind of eke in, right?
While, obviously, there are a lot more moving parts now than there may normally be. And that's it.

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman & CEO

Jon, do you want to take this one?

Jonathon J. Nudi
Group President of North America Retail

Yes, sure. Rob, a couple of things. I mean I think the variety of SKUs really needs to be looked at category
by category. So as you know, we -- or we put on hold a significant number of soup SKUs as we went
into the pandemic. And what we learned was some of those we can do without, but some of them are
important because variety matters to consumers. So you have to start with the consumer and really
understand what they're looking for.

The broader trend that we're seeing, though, particularly with retailers -- and Jeff mentioned that 85% of
e-commerce is click and collect. So those orders are being fulfilled from the shelf. And for the retailers to
really be efficient and run the shelf well, both for the customers coming in as well as the customers driving
through, they are moving to fewer SKUs on the shelf with higher velocity. And for us, we think that plays
well for our brands.

Our brands tend to be #1 or #2 in the category. We've been focused on building our brands. And this
is the third or fourth consecutive year in a row in North America Retail where we've grown share in the
majority of our categories. So we think we're set up well for the dynamic that's going to play out in the
shelf in the future.
