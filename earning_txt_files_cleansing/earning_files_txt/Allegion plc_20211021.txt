Please note this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Vice President of Investor Relations and
Treasurer. Please go ahead.

Tom Martineau
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Allegion's Third Quarter 2021
Earnings Call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and
Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.

Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to
in today's call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived
on our website.

Please go to Slides 2 and 3. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered
forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities
law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual
results to differ materially from our projections.

The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation
and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial
tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will now discuss our third quarter 2021

limit themselves to one question and one short follow-up. We would like to give everyone an opportunity
given the time allotted. Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we go into our third quarter
results, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge and congratulate my fellow Allegion team members
for their ongoing dedication to the environment, society and governance. I'm humbled and honored to
share that just last week, Allegion was recognized for ESG leadership through 2 different awards. The
Robert W. Campbell Award and the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion Award. The
Campbell Award is an annual recognition by the National Safety Council. America's leading nonprofit safety
advocate.

It is the premier award for excellence in integrated environmental, health and safety management into
business operating systems. Winners have strong processes and show measurable achievement over
a 5-year period in EH&S performance that leads to productivity and profitability and are expected to
demonstrate a long-term track record of not just EH&S compliance, but also critical improvements.

The prestigious award is also known for its rigorous application process with a systematic review and audit
attached to it. Submissions are reviewed by management, labor, academic and government experts from
around the world, followed by a meticulous audit format at 3 or more of a company's global sites.

With this in mind, Campbell Award winners are an elite group of organizations. Past winners include
Boeing, Cummins, Dow Chemical, DuPont, Honeywell Aerospace and Johnson & Johnson. Allegion is proud
to have our name added to this best-in-class list.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

We are also excited to have been named the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Champion by
the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. This is a statewide honor that recognizes an organization making
significant strides in the workplace. The just noted that a lesion was chosen as its first-ever winner of this
award because of our company's proactive and intentional diversity, equity and inclusion efforts around
the globe.

We have strong momentum on our diversity efforts, and we know there's more work to be done. We're not
asking the people of Allegion to agree on everything, but we need to be a place where racism and bias are
rejected, where inclusion is a way of life and where all employees feel they belong and contribute to our
business success.

Importantly, I've shared before that Allegion's ESG commitments are vital to how our company achieved
results and the way we do business. ESG excellence will give us better long-term outcomes across the
board, better employee safety, better employee engagement, better productivity, better creativity, better
innovation and stronger financial performance.

We see this firsthand and external data points to it as well. Please go to Slide 5. During the quarter, we
experienced continued strength in demand, particularly in the Americas nonresidential market. This trend
began in Q2 and accelerated through Q3. Leading indicators like ABI and Dodge New Construction indices
remain positive.

Increased demand is for both discretionary projects and new construction and is across all verticals
and product categories. The recovery has been faster than we originally anticipated and is expected to
continue in the foreseeable future. Residential end market demand is also favorable across both retail
point-of-sale and new home construction.

The strength in demand continues to constrain the global supply chain's ability to fully meet demand
requirements. Similar to last quarter, this was especially prevalent in electronic components in Q3. As I'm
sure you're aware, this is a global issue and not isolated to Allegion or to any single industry. We have
redirected resources and are taking actions such as reconfiguring and redesigning products as well as
developing alternative sources of supply to help alleviate the pressures we are experiencing in procuring
electronic components.

Additionally, material and freight input costs continued to accelerate during Q3. We now anticipate
material and freight inflation to be approximately $60 million higher compared to last year. In addition to
the supply chain pressures we are seeing for electronics, there are also widespread industry shortages of
labor and other components.

Once again, these issues are not Allegion specific and we expect the global constraints driving these
shortages to continue beyond 2021. These challenges led to margin deterioration in the quarter. We will
leverage the strength of our supply chain management capabilities as well as price to help mitigate these
impacts going forward.

During the quarter, the continued robust demand, coupled with the supply chain pressures resulted in
record backlogs, approximately 4x normal levels. We estimate that widespread shortages have delayed
approximately $80 million to $100 million of 2021 revenue. We believe this impact is evenly distributed
across the third and fourth quarter. We do not believe this is lost revenue, but expect it will be recovered
as supply chain constraints ease.

Now let's turn to the third quarter performance for more details. Please go to Slide 6. Revenue for the
third quarter was $717 million, a decrease of 1.6% on both a reported and organic basis. The organic
revenue decrease was driven by lower volume in the Americas region related to the aforementioned
electronics, components and labor shortages. Currency tailwind and acquisitions offset the impact of
divestitures. Patrick will share more details on the regions in a moment.

Adjusted operating margins decreased by 330 basis points in the third quarter. Higher input costs,
productivity challenges and volume deleverage drove the majority of the decrease. Incremental
investments important to our future growth caused 90 basis points of the decline. Adjusted earnings per

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

share of $1.56 decreased to $0.11 or 6.6% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by reduced
operating income offset by a favorable tax rate and share count.

Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $327.7 million, an increase of $71.6 million or 28% versus
the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher year-to-date net earnings, along with
improvement in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Patrick will now take you through
the financial results, and I'll be back later to discuss our 2021 outlook and wrap up.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #7.
This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of
2020, reported earnings per share was $1.58, adjusting $0.09 for charges related to restructuring and
impairment, the 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $1.67.

Favorable tax rate drove a $0.13 increase in earnings per share. The negative tax rate for the third
quarter reflects favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions, a benefit of mix of income as well as the
nonrecurring unfavorable tax impact in 2020 related to certain valuation allowances.

Reduced share count drove another favorable $0.04 per share. Acquisitions and divestitures had a positive
$0.02 per share impact. Operational results decreased earnings per share by $0.21, driven by higher
material and freight costs, productivity challenges and volume deleverage, which more than offset the
favorable impacts of price and currency.

Investment spend increased during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.06. As a reminder,
the incremental investment spend is predominantly related to R&D, technology and market investments
to accelerate future growth. The combination of interest and other income drove another $0.03 per share
reduction. This results in adjusted third quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.56, a decrease of $0.11 or
6.6% compared to the prior year.

Lastly, we have a $0.03 per share increase driven by a gain on the sale of an equity method investment,
offset slightly by the combination of restructuring charges and acquisition and integration expenses. After
giving effect to these items, you arrive at the third quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.59.

Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the third quarter.
I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we
experienced an organic revenue decline of 1.6% in the third quarter. The electronics components and labor
shortages, primarily in the Americas region, had an impact on our ability to meet the continued strong
demand.

Still, we realized good price performance, which offset some of the volume decline. Currency continued
to be a tailwind to total growth and offset the combined impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In total,
reported revenue reduced by 1.6%.

Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $524.4 million,
down 2.7% on a reported basis and 3% organically. As previously stated, the supply chain pressures we
are experiencing drove the revenue decline. We are still seeing strong market demand, which has resulted
in record backlogs, particularly in the nonresidential part of the business. The region continued to deliver
good price realization. Our latest price increase went into effect at the beginning of October, so we expect
the price realization to accelerate in the future.

On volume, Americas nonresidential was down low single digits, driven by the electronics components and
labor shortages. Americas residential was down high single digits. This was uniquely driven by the prior
year being inflated by channel refill coming out of the pandemic shutdowns experienced in Q2 of 2020.
The shortage of electronic components also had a negative impact on residential performance primarily in
the DIY space of big-box retail and e-commerce.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Electronics revenue was down high single digits, driven by shortages of electronic components in both
the nonresidential and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions remain a long-term
growth driver and is an integral to our investment and innovation efforts. Americas adjusted operating
income of $133.7 million decreased 19.7% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin
for the quarter was down 540 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher material and freight costs,
productivity challenges related to inconsistent supply and volume deleverage.

Incremental investments had a 100 basis points dilutive impact on adjusted margins. Please go to
Slide #10. The Allegion International segment delivered another solid quarter. Third quarter revenues
were $192.6 million, up 1.7% and up 2.5% on an organic basis. We continue to see strength in our
SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security businesses, which, along with good price realization,
drove the organic revenue growth. Favorable currency and acquisition impacts also contributed to total
revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestitures.

International adjusted operating income of $21.3 million increased 4.9% versus the prior year period.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 40 basis points. The margin increase was
driven primarily by volume leverage, along with favorable impacts from divestitures and currency. The
combination of price, productivity inflation were an 80 basis point headwind to margins. Incremental
investments reduced margins by 40 basis points.

Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2021 came in at $327.7
million, which is an increase of $71.6 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is attributed
to higher year-to-date earnings, improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures.
Our cash flow generation continues to be an asset to the company.

Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percentage of revenues decreased based
on a 4-point quarter average. The business continues to manage working capital efficiently and generates
strong cash flow. I will now hand it back over to Dave for some comments on our full year 2021 outlook.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #12. On October 1, we issued a prerelease to our earnings and
updated our 2021 full year outlook for revenue, earnings per share and available cash flow. We are
reaffirming those updated outlooks. We have talked at length about the demand strength in the Americas
business as well as supply chain pressures that are having an impact on our ability to meet that demand
which will delay an estimated $80 million to $100 million of revenue.

The outlook for total revenue in the Americas is now projected to be at 1% to 1.5%, with organic
revenue growth at 0.5% to 1%. In the Allegion International segment, we have not seen as large of an
impact from component and labor shortages and our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security
businesses continued to perform well.

For that region, we expect total revenue growth to be between 12% and 13%, with organic growth of 9%
to 10%. All in for total Allegion, total revenue is projected to be up 4% to 4.5% and organic revenue is
expected to increase 3% to 3.5%. We are expecting reported EPS to come in, in the range of $4.95 to
$5.05 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.10.

Our outlook for available cash flow is projected to be $460 million to $480 million. The outlook assumes
investment spend of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate
is expected to be approximately 9%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares is approximately 90.5
million.

Please go to Slide #13. As we close the presentation and move on to Q&A, I want to take some time
to stress Allegion's strong long-term fundamentals. First, even with the disruption caused by the global
pandemic, our strategy around seamless access and electronic transformation remains strong. We expect
electronic and seamless access solutions to be the future of access control, and we are using multiple
innovation engines to lead the industry.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

You've seen proactive work from Allegion through Allegion Ventures, our recent acquisitions, like you
know me, and in our Interflex business, accelerating our software and tech capabilities. We're making
investments and expanding partnerships with mega-techs and leading access control platforms. We are
making significant progress on our ESG journey. This is evident with the 2 awards that we received earlier
this month, the Campbell Award given by the National Safety Council is a very prestigious honor, and we
joined an elite group of previous winners. I'm also proud of the Jackson Lewis Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Champion Award which we received from the Indiana Chamber, which recognizes our proactive leadership
in diversity, equity and inclusion. Congratulations to the Allegion team.

All markets in America remain robust. We continue to see positive trends from leading indicators like
ABI and the Dodge New Construction Index and expect these trends to continue into 2022. With the
International segment, the strength in our SimonsVoss, Interflex and Global Portable Security business
persists. We have aligned and adjusted resources to navigate and adapt the supply chain pressures
that the world is experiencing. Actions taken, including the redesign of products, the development of
alternative supply sources and we continue to leverage our pricing power.

Allegion's supply chain will continue to differentiate us and the strength in our backlog would indicate
that our channel partners believe we will navigate through the global pressures [indiscernible]. Demand
remains strong. We have implemented pricing actions that will carry forward into next year and the
substantial backlog to work down. With that backdrop and assuming supply chain pressures related to
inflation and component shortages begin to ease, we expect solid revenue growth with year-over-year
margin improvement and continued strong cash flow generation into 2022.
The future of Allegion remains bright. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.

Joseph John O'Dea
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

First question is just related to any visibility you have around the timing of relief from supply chain
constraints. You've talked about this extending into 2022. But -- are you seeing anything out there and
based on conversations with your suppliers that gives you confidence and when you start to see some
relief?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So my first observation, your past record, sometimes it's a predictor. Allegion performed extremely well
through the first phases of this pandemic. Number two is, some of the strength of our supply chain
adaptability was evident. If we had not adapted, [ may ] design changes, over the last couple of quarters,
our backlog would even be larger.

So I feel very good about the performance and the adaptability flexibility. It's clear the electronics is
going to be a problem that all companies, including Allegion will have to adapt to through 2022. I think
an important element of the rest, and it's the complexity of the Allegion supply chain is the return of
labor pressures to our partner suppliers. This -- we'll have to continue to monitor. This is everything from
castings to power supplies, to wire harnesses. There's a labor scarcity across the globe. And again, I
believe, our adaptive -- our ability to adapt and our philosophy to produce in region, will help Allegion.

Joseph John O'Dea
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then related to backlog and catch-up and you made the comment about backlog being 4x higher than
normal. How do you think about managing that? So when you do start to get some relief in the supply
chain? Do you think about kind of ramping up to deliver to customers as fast as possible, which could
then create some inefficiencies in a strain production system? Or do you think about managing that? And
maybe it takes longer to deliver over time, but not straining the production system in that process?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

No. We've got a lot of experience in production systems, including demand that runs the company need
41 years. I think I like the backlog. I think if components supplies, as that regains health, we will actually
pick up efficiencies. There's been growth inefficiencies through COVID, the supply chains. An important
element is our ability to bring on and flex our own labor and I've got high confidence in our ability to do
that.

Operator

The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

If you guys talked about clearly lots of challenges in the marketplace today. I know that as you kind
of think about the Americas margins being down 500 to 600 basis points year-over-year, you had
investments of about 100 basis points impacting the margin. Can you maybe parse that out a little bit
more for us? Like do we know how much of it is coming from higher material and freight costs? How much

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

of it is more kind of like the productivity issues? Just any other additional color around that would be
helpful.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes, Joe. So the significant portion of the margin degradation year-over-year is predominantly inflation
and freight cost. And then we've got productivity challenges associated with some of the component
shortages and those type of things, creating inefficiencies at our facilities.

So if you think about it relative to -- normally, we've done a good job in terms of managing the price
inflation dynamic. We're underwater today as we kind of look at that, price being lower than the
incremental material and freight costs. That will get better as we kind of progress here, we're putting in
more price increases to make up for the Delta.

One of the challenges is kind of given the high backlog and the fact that a lot of the backlog today is kind
of price protected. You don't see the benefit of the price increases coming through and offsetting the
incremental inflation until going into 2022.

So we're still going to be under pressure for the balance of the year, but inflation really accelerated,
particularly when you look year-over-year on steel components and those type of things. So it's -- it's just
-- it's one of these short-term phenomenas. If you assume that inflation has kind of peaked today, going
into 2022, things will kind of continue to get better than we would expect to be in the positive end of the
equation as we progress throughout 2022.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And maybe just kind of following on there. As you think about then -- so it
sounds like you're going to be underwater again in the fourth quarter. As you think about like your -- the
pricing that you're putting through, do you typically include a fuel surcharge? Or is this kind of like stickier
pricing that you expect to get in the 2022 time frame?

And then we've also gotten some questions from investors today around the fact that pricing stepped
down on a year-over-year basis, if you took a look at the second quarter versus 3Q. So curious like any
comments around why pricing was a little bit weaker in 3Q versus 2Q?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So on your first question, so we manage pricing broadly and it's really dependent upon product category.
Some of them are products that are more steel-related i.e., steel doors those type of things, which carry
surcharges associated with that. But mostly across the product portfolio is through list price increases, is
kind of how we manage it. So it's more permanent in nature. The year-over-year Delta, you kind of have
to look at it again by product category, a little pressure in some of the discounts, residential, for example,
a little bit harder to kind of pass through the price increases. So that's really what you're seeing there. If
you kind of look at the bulk of our business, commercial year-over-year price increase.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

I'd add to this our hollow metal business, list price increases and surcharges. On the general hardware
business, 2 price increases in the year and will adapt to the pressures as we go into '22. And certainly
going hard at the residential products as well.

And my message here would be in the addition to freight surcharges, we're pulling all levers on price
realization. And I think as we get past this momentary surge that occurred in Q2 and Q3 on inflation will
continue our discipline around price performance as we move into '22.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just to follow up on Joe's question on pricing. I'm just a little bit surprised by the pricing myself. We did
some channel checks with electrical distributors in the market. Dave, you would know very well, one of
the largest players in North America has pricing effect, I think, sort of policy at this point in order to sort
of [indiscernible] out of the backlog. I think HVAC guys that selling a lot of similar channels, I think, have
had like 4 price increases this year.

I mean the industry structure seems to be quite favorable. Why is it so hard to get a price increase
through? Or are you -- who is being aggressive, particularly you seem to highlight residential is one player
being aggressive, people out of Asia being aggressive, which is surprising because I would have expected
they would have difficulties getting stuff on the boat. Just maybe a little bit more color there.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I'd give a completely different perspective, Andrew. I know the electrical quite well. Think about the
amount of electrical pipe, wire and distribution gear that goes in, in the first 6 months of a construction
project. We submit our quotes, get orders at the same time. And that -- those products are delivered at
the end of that cycle. When we put a quote, that's carried for a period of time, but we honor that order.
And -- so we eat that inflationary pressure. The cycle for the electrical industry is much faster than ours.

We've been aggressive on the price increases as well as surcharges and it's not apples-to-apples. We're
both in new construction on new quotes and bids. We're really raising the levels every day. And I hope
that color maybe helps you understand leading products, the electrical versus lagging products on the
hardware side.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

And I'll just add, Andrew, it's not a question of realization. In other words, we'll get the price increase.
It's more of a timing issue. So you will begin to see sequential improvement beginning Q4 relative to the
price increases we put in the market, and that will continue to accelerate into 2022 year-over-year and
sequentially.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

In '22, you'll get some of the benefit of these '21 price increases, you'll get it, but later?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got you. And just a follow-up question. Just a difference in performance between North America and I
guess, International, which I sort of think mostly Europe, as I think about your brands, Interflex, I guess it
is mostly software, but it does have electronic components.

If I think about, I guess, [ CISA ] is the one that's purely mechanical, but on SimonsVoss, which you
highlighted also has large electronic component. Why are you able to avoid the kind of disruption related
to electronic components and labor in Europe that you experienced in the U.S. because I would imagine
the electronic components in Europe are also getting sourced in Asia.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Chairman, CEO & President

So electronic components tight in all sectors of the world. The differences between SimonsVoss,
[indiscernible] and Interflex and the core business in the Americas is pure suppliers. We had designed
around the Americas, Texas Instruments, NXP, Texas -- both have had their supply chain issues. The
European products more around a different set of suppliers, and it's those differences. And the adaptability
important here, many of the newest Allegion products that drive battery efficiency, Wi-Fi connectivity that
makes us the leading products in the world are closer to the supply chain challenges in the Americas than
they are in Europe.

The next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur with Imperial Capital.

My first question, I'm sorry to keep asking about price increases, but I'm going to ask one on that and one
on -- a follow-up on a different subject. But the first is on price increases. Can you say specifically how
much you've increased prices, [ ASSA ] has gone up about 15% in multiple in total this year. NAPCO's said
that 3%, they've increased. What have you increased so far this year? And what do you plan to increase
on the year?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would say, again, you have to look at the different product sets. So it varies. If you're looking at all
price increases, i.e., what we talked about, there's list price, there's surcharges. There's things related
to freight. Those that have heavier steel-related, i.e., steel doors, those type of things, we carry a much
higher price increase realization than your traditional products, locks and exits, closures, those type of
things. So list prices for the year would be with both price increases north of 6% with more to come in the
future.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

I think you also got a include the surcharges on top of that -- and this is a [indiscernible] in our quote
activities, we apply discount schemes that give us the ability to raise price based on the project. So again,
I feel very good on our pricing analytics. There's that gap in the backlog that we may have quoted over a
year ago, we honor those firm orders and they're delivered sometimes over the periods of years. And -- as
we move into '22, we'll reassess this again and be early and aggressive to make sure that price continues
to cover our input cost as we've done since the creation of the company.

Brian William Ruttenbur
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just as my follow-up real quick -- on a, of a, just real quick, maybe you make a comment
about their move with HHI from Spectrum and how you anticipate competing on that? I know we've
spoken offline on that, but I wanted to just hear what you think? How that's going to impact Allegion
moving forward?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

So you never want to see your #1 competitor and market leader get bigger. Rest assured that we also
looked hard at the Kwikset HHI assets over the years. And I think if you really step back and study the
dimensions of Kwikset and how they performed under HHI, I believe also will actually bring a level of
discipline to the market. It's certainly our great Schlage brand, the Kwikset brand, there's plenty of room
to compete. And we've met this challenge, I think, incredibly over the last several decades, Schlage in
terms of its electronic leadership. If you look at consumer reports, electronics that I think was published

in April of this year, 3 of the top 8 locks are ours. We're the #1 replacement lock and it's going to be
continued competition against 2 world leaders.

The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just a first question perhaps on the demand outlook, which hasn't really been touched on yet. I
remember in that up cycle in U.S. nonres in sort of '06, '07 and '08, that up cycle in terms of projects
did suffer some headwinds because of cost inflation and labor-led developers to delaying projects and so
forth. And so you had these kind of rolling pushouts and delays. Just wondered what your perspectives
are on the risks of that type of phenomenon recurring in the current environment when you're talking to
developers looking at your quote activity and so forth?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'd say each bust and boom cycle sets its own history. We're still living this aspect of it. But as I review the
macro demand factors, our backlogs and then recent travel, I would think I was in 5 states last week. The
sentiment that I feel, see and living here every day at Allegion is, I'm extremely positive.

I think we've got 3 solid years ahead of us, as I think about the strategic planning period, working through
the supply chain issues. I think there's key infrastructure needs, and we have a housing economy that's
significantly under inventory for single-family homes, which also as a generator for commercial and
institutional development.

So I pack that all together and barring another disruption. I like to go ahead in terms of the business
conditions for construction and for Allegion.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I see. So you have not seen major projects being deferred or postponed.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

We track cancellations. And I'd say it's at a normal level.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, trying to wrap together your comments on pricing. If
you look at your sort of your operating income bridge, that line for inflation in excess of pricing and
productivity. Obviously, it's been negative for a couple of quarters now. When you look at the margins in
the backlog and the pace of completion, should we assume that, that line can go back to sort of breakeven
sort of third quarter of next year? Is that the rough time line?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I would -- that Q3 next year, sort of positive is what I would anticipate basis of constant inflation
relative to what we're seeing today in terms of no further increase year-over-year. But the Delta, i.e.,
the gap between price inflation improving up until that point. So the rate of change will get better as we
progress.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Julian, I'd also add, as we -- as you and I think about that backlog, it's some of the highest margin
products that we produce, electronic locks and exit devices are elements, heavy elements of that backlog.
The exit devices, heavy complexity, which we -- the supply chain pressures create some challenges in
that. But those supply chain pressures will improve. The mix of that will roll through in addition to the
price increases, I like our opportunities going forward.

Operator

The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Maybe just to follow on Julian's last question there. If you look in your bridge, I know it's called the
volume and mix, but it was a headwind year-over-year, but you actually had nonresidential declining less
than residential in the Americas. So maybe it has to do with the mix within nonres, and you talked about
some of your higher-margin products now growing backlog, but would just love to unpack that a little bit
why the mix was negative despite the nonres growing better than residential, at least on a relative basis.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So you hit on it. It's really within the product portfolio of nonresidential products. As Dave indicated
high-margin products being impacted more, and that's kind of what we're seeing in the backlog due to
shortages of components. And so it's really within the nonresidential business that you're seeing a mix
element given that nonresi was higher than resi for the quarter.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then I'm going to take a stab at this. I think earlier in the year, you kind of pointed
international margins up low double digits. Obviously, you've seen really good progress there through the
year. You've given us the midpoint of your guide, a lot of other information. It does seem like that implies
the Q4 Americas margin kind of steps down more than seasonality would assume in Q4? And also just
thinking about the decremental still being pretty challenge there. Any color you can help us on how to
think about that from the model perspective? Or I'll just leave it there, however you'd like to help us out
with that sequential decline implied.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. So kind of we touched on it a little bit earlier. It's predominantly given the price inflation dynamic
still under pressure. Some of the inefficiencies from a productivity standpoint will continue given the
component challenges supply base. That's really the -- you're going to see some decrements sequentially.
But then as we kind of continue to move into 2022, we wouldn't see obviously that big of a change in the
first part of the year then improving certainly in the back half.

Operator

The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Patrick, you've made reference a couple of times now to the expectation that maybe inflation has peaked
and I guess I'm just interested in what gives you confidence that, that would be the case. Have you
provisions in place through some of your procurement agreements that lock pricing now or hedges that
are in place to give you the confidence to say that. But -- if you just elaborate on that, so I appreciate it.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

So that's kind of -- the commentary was more around kind of our assumptions right now. I mean if there's
continued pressure in the marketplace to some of the component challenges, then that would certainly
put pressure on our assumptions as we look forward to 2022. But if you kind of look at some of the
forecasting information relative to steel and those type of things, the expectation is, is that as we go into
next year, it's to alleviate itself and maybe trend down and that would be positive to what we're thinking
today.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Can you just remind us what -- how much of your business is locked up with annual contracts or supply
agreements versus spot purchases? Anything you can elaborate on...

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

A small portion, it's mostly on raw steel. We kind of look forward and we've got some arrangements with
some of our supply base that has fixed rate agreements those then kind of fluctuate basis on changes in
the market on a forward basis. And so it's small. A lot of our supply base is indexed to steel, if you will.
And so it's really just on the purchase of raw steel, which is a small component relative to our overall
purchase.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk about installation labor and the extent to which that may
be sort of frustration at this point? Or how you see that developing as a potential bottleneck or element in
'22?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Some broad comments on labor, and it's from general labor through the trades to professionals, labor is
tight, professional help on a worldwide basis. Second, when you look particularly at construction labor, the
gap has grown. Skilled trades were a problem going into the pandemic. The problem has widened slightly.
And in my mind, extends cycle times for construction projects and snowplows, what I think are strong
business conditions well into the future.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Would you consider it all investing in the development of that labor for the market as a means of just
alleviating that constraint?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

We are investors. I will get off the phone here today and its manufacturing month in the United States,
Allegion plays a very active role in promoting our industry-leading culture, diversity opportunities, tuition
reimbursement programs, healthy lifestyle to attract people and have done it since the creation of the
company, number one. Number two, I think manufacturing, I'm extremely proud of -- is a great place to
develop talent, and we will make investments in our wage structures to continue to keep Allegion as the
best employer with wages and benefits in the communities we operate in around the world.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Maybe just dovetailing off of David's question there. Could you just -- when you think about the new
nonres cycle and how investors should kind of think about it. The leading indicators have obviously been
really robust over the last 7 or 8 months. How would you think about converting those cycle -- those kind
of leading interiors into revenue for you guys? I mean, are those new construction projects that could
contribute to you in the second half of '22? Or do you think at this point, it's probably more prudent to
think '23?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I think you've got to take the strong cycle. And as I look at the macro indicators that you did positive,
you've got to lay on that backlog, which will take the better part of 6, 7 months for us to eat through.
And I think extremely robust [indiscernible] health care, I think you've also -- I've always been concerned
about commercial, extremely positive in terms of the macro, there's lots of money on the sidelines to go
reinvent this commercial real estate.

And the new office of the future. So as I look at education, health care, commercial, even multifamily
is honing longer. And I think investment is going to come in needed infrastructure. We could get an
infrastructure bill. So as I look at that, Tim, I like it for the next 3 to 5 years.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then maybe more of just a modeling question. So you guys outlined that the split on the
deferred sales, I think, was kind of even between Q3 and Q4. But I think if you just kind of roll that into
the model, I mean, there's a bigger -- I think you're down double digits or that's the implication in the
fourth quarter versus down maybe low single digits in Americas in Q3. So any -- any perspective there you
can kind of add as to why that is? Is it just seasonality and comps?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Seasonality comps, the component shortages plus -- last year, you may recall with the rebound in our
residential business is coming out of COVID. There was channel refill in the business, right, restocking the
shelves on retail and e-commerce. And so that certainly had a fairly significant impact on last year. So
you're getting into a difficult comp as it relates to our residential business.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Got you. And then $80 million to $100 million of deferred revenue, I mean, how does that
kind of come back next year? I mean is it -- Is there some sort of burst that kind of happens and you kind
of convert that in '22? Or is it just kind of result in a little bit of a longer cycle?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

No. I think you need to think about it depending on the flow of components and labor, it's a tailwind as we
roll through the year and in a manufacturing environment, you can step up about 20%, just by working
Saturdays. You need to kind of think about it. If I go to Sundays, I get 40%. People don't work 7 days
a week for 6 months. You got to think about it will step up. It's a tailwind. Barring if you get -- if we get
improvement in components both electronic and general components, we're going to see that as a tailwind
as we roll through the first half of next year. And -- if it -- if the component situation and labor improves,
[ work about ] and gain more share.

The next question comes from [ John ] (sic) [ Josh ] Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And Dave, so electronics are 20-ish percent of the business, probably a little more than that now. The
$80 million to $100 million that you talked about does sound pretty biased to 4Q. And I guess what
precipitates out to that is pretty high percentage of electronics. Like is that virtually electronics going to
0? Or how should we think about the split of that headwind between the electrified product versus the
mechanical product?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'd say, 40% electronics, 60% on mechanical. I'd also -- I think you've been in our factories here
in Indianapolis complexity when things are common right is our friend. We'll make 2,200 variations
of the Von Duprin exit device today. And any one of those components and shortage, whether it's a
[indiscernible] a power supply and electronic board, puts pressure on that supply chain, and that's what
we're living today and confident in our teams to work through it.

Remember, too, it's not necessarily my ability to put labor in the seat. It's also my supply chain. We
pulled hard on redesign, shifting over 100 engineers to redesign predominantly boards but other
components. And the second thing I'd say is our flexibility -- we've offered to put our people insights to
help strengthen our supply chain vendors. And I share that example just because the labor thing goes
across transportation, supply chain, getting it through the ports and a level of complexity that I've maybe
never seen in my 41 years.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And I'm just thinking about the kind of the unwind of this current tightness, I think an earlier question
asked about trade labor. Is that the biggest governor of how much the business can grow next year?
Because it seems like you have the ingredients, the demand is there, maybe a bit more backlog than
usual? Is it just how quick can we get installers, both on new construction and retrofit? Is that sort of the
KPI that we should be focused on?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I think I would describe it, Josh, is there's pacing constraints and labor from the design phase, we just
saw a record ABI through the installation phase. And I think projects will have longer lead times in an
environment that's extremely positive in terms of the willingness to invest.

Operator

The next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So my first question is on the deferred $80 million to $100 million of revenue. It seems like the majority
of this is coming from the Americas. In your previous commentary, I think, said that it could take 6 to
7 months to work through this elevated backlog and I think the ability to ramp manufacturing 20% by
working Saturdays, I think kind of suggests that this could be realized this $80 million to $100 million
in 2022. And obviously, I know there's some uncertainty around the ability to source components. But I
guess is that reasonable to think that this could be realized next year because it's a pretty substantial kind
of mid-single-digit tailwind to the Americas segment?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

As you think about '22, the backlog will be a tailwind. Constrained by availability of electronics, that
tightness will run into '23. and then the overall labor. We see -- I don't know if you ever -- it's an industrial

game we call the [indiscernible] bottlenecks move. There's bottlenecks at the ports, there's bottlenecks in
labor. These things are going to be moving throughout the year. But my fundamental belief is Allegion has
a superior ability to navigate the nation and the world will navigate it, and we'll see these things ease as
we go through, and it's a tailwind to push that backlog through.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I appreciate that. And then second question on resi. It sounded like from the prepared remarks that
there maybe was some demand softening in the quarter. I think you guys called out do-it-yourself or DIY
slowdown. So I guess my question is, was this maybe the resi softness part of the second half revenue
cut? And I guess is there any reason to think that this gets better in '22 as it seems like that could be
more demand-related than supply chain related?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So again, I want you to think about the demand game. The supply chains on res for all supplier was
heavily disrupted in '20. We were shut down for 15, 16 days. You had a demand surge, and this is very
evident from the big-box, Home Depot, Lowe's reports in terms of increased investments and do-it-
yourself projects. And then you had also housing picking up pretty rapidly that created a demand surge
as we started coming out of the lockdowns, record backlog in residential, which we have worked through.
So I look at overall demand for resi as we move into '22 is net positive based on continued starts of new
construction, solid repair and replacement and good multifamily. So that [ WIP ] is going on the supply
chain, make sure you think of that in your models because I think a year ago, I'm sitting here talking
through record backlogs in residential, we work through that. And I would suggest if you look at our
performance versus our competitors that we gained share throughout the last 8 quarters.

Operator

And the last questioner will be Ryan Merkel with William Blair.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

So I wanted to follow up on the timing of supply chain getting better. Is it fair to say that margins are
bottoming in the second half of '21, such that as we get into next year, you could see margins increase
year-over-year? Or is that maybe more of a second half '22 event?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Probably more back-end loaded but feel very confident. If you kind of look at the moves we're making
on price, again, assuming inflation has peaked. I mean, that's still a question mark, right? But I feel very
confident relative to pushing through the backlog, getting some efficiencies in our factory productivity,
these type of things. We will have margin incremental improvement in '22 compared to '21, no doubt in
my mind.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

All right. That's helpful. And then just stepping back, maybe this is a question for David, but -- can you
discuss the adoption curve for electronic [ is faster ] now? And also, how are your customers rethinking
access control in this new environment?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Electronic access, electronic locks, the power of your edge device and its ability to interact with secured
access is a powerful trend that will positively influence this industry for the coming decades. The electronic

adoption is what I would describe as high single digits. In normal times, or pre-pandemic, we've been
able to deliver on that growth at mid or excuse me, low single-digit -- low double-digit growth. So market
growing high single digits. We're in a normalized time low double digits. So a clear trend, you can see it
in your everyday life. The overall market still -- there's 40 billion openings in the world. Less than 10% of
those integrated, so bright for our industry and bright for Allegion.
