Thank you, Bobby
Due to our portfolio strength and digital momentum, we far exceeded our plans in 2016. We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectations for the holiday quarter
In driving our record-setting year, and as we look ahead, we remain focused on our three strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment
Let's start with audience reach, which was 447 million monthly active users this quarter
Blizzard had record Q4 MAUs of 41 million
And for the year, Blizzard had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 37% from 2015, and up 87% since 2014. This is a remarkable achievement, demonstrating the strength of the Blizzard portfolio and capabilities
Overwatch, released in May, set the record for the strongest launch year financial performance of any game in Blizzard's 26-year history
The game is critically acclaimed, receiving 55 game of the year awards and reached 25 million registered players faster than any franchise in Blizzard history, beating Diablo III's launch year unit sales record set in 2012, which for a new IP is an extraordinary accomplishment
In Q4, MAUs rose to a new franchise high, as existing players stayed engaged and new players joined the fun
Showcasing its continued global appeal, Overwatch has players all over the world, including great success in Korea and China
It's always difficult for Western companies to succeed there, and Overwatch's popularity is testament to Blizzard's unique ability to create globally appealing games
World of Warcraft's Legion expansion, which launched in late August, continues to reenergize the community
For the year, MAUs were up 10%, and for the quarter, MAUs were up over 20% versus year ago
Hearthstone players enjoyed a tremendous amount of new content in 2016, with one adventure and two expansions including Mean Streets of Gadgetzan in the fourth quarter
For the year, Hearthstone had record MAUs, up over 20% year-over-year, and for the quarter, MAUs were also up versus year ago
Activision had Q4 MAUs of 51 million
On a full-year basis, Activision had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 3% from 2015, and up 23% since 2014. Black Ops III's digital season led to record MAUs for Call of Duty in the year, and Destiny showed steady engagement in its third year
Call of Duty was the number one franchise in North America for the eighth year in a row, and the number one console franchise globally, a mantle we've held for seven of the last eight years
Activision's November release, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a high quality, innovative game that paired with Modern Warfare Remastered offers a tremendous amount of value and gameplay variety
However, sales underperformed our expectations, and it's clear that for a portion of our audience, the space setting just didn't resonate
We had a passionate experienced studio deeply committed to this direction, and despite the risks we saw, we believe it is important to consider the passions of our game teams in deciding what content to create
While it wasn't the success we planned, it allows us to protect a core tenets of our culture that Bobby discussed, empowering our talented teams to have the chance to pursue opportunities that they are passionate about
Providing an environment that recognizes passion is a critical component of our success, and the process to learn from our mistakes is what makes our company special, and it's why the most talented people in our industry are attracted to our company
In 2017, Activision will take Call of Duty back to its roots, and traditional combat will once again take center stage
This is what our dedicated community of Call of Duty players and Sledgehammer Games, who has been developing this year's title, are the most excited about
The Call of Duty community remains strong, and Call of Duty is the most successful video game franchise of the last 20 years
Overall franchise MAUs were stable in Q4 as players engaged on multiple titles
Life to date, on current gen consoles, Call of Duty alone has three of the top ten games
This demonstrates the value of year round engagement and live operations on both new releases and our highly engaging prior releases
Activision also released Skylanders Imaginators during the fourth quarter, an innovative new game that allows players to create and play their very own Skylanders
The game has delighted kids around the world, and has grown the franchise to become the 11th biggest console franchise of all time with more than 300 million toys sold
Based on this franchise strength, our film and TV division launched its first initiative, Skylanders Academy on Netflix in October, which has been very well received
The second season will be delivered later this year, and Netflix has already ordered a third season
In 2017, rather than releasing a new console title, we will be supporting the award-winning Skylanders Imaginators with multiple adventure packs, new characters and new in-game content
We are also excited to bring Skylanders Imaginators to Nintendo Switch as a launch title next month, and we have a new Skylanders mobile game in development
Now turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement
Our compelling games, deep gameplay and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also strong engagement with over 10 billion hours of playtime in Q4. Our 43 billion hours of engagement in 2016 was on par with Netflix and 1.5 times Snapchat
And importantly, we own our content
Blizzard's Q4 playtime sets a new record, breaking the previous record set in Q3. During the fourth quarter, Overwatch had its second and third seasonal events, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland, showcasing the successful year round event-based approach to content
Each successive event drove new engagement records, including the most recent Lunar New Year event
And Overwatch has more exciting content coming
Blizzard's increased investment in World of Warcraft development resources is paying off through a more regular content cadence for players, with two patches released since Legion launched
This has resulted in higher engagement for the franchise, with an increase in total playtime for the quarter surpassing Legion's launch quarter, and all non-launch quarters in the last four years
More content is coming later this year, as the full Legion story unfolds
King's player base continues to be highly engaged with time spent of 34 minutes per daily active user, an increase over last year, and last quarter
This was due in part to our increased focus on live operation efforts
King also released a new franchise sequel at the start of this year, Bubble Witch Saga 3, which is off to a great start
Playing our games is just one way our players engage with our franchises
We recently announced our new Consumer Products division, headed by Tim Kilpin, a veteran of Mattel and Disney
Elevating our nascent consumer products business to a more strategic level is a great opportunity to provide our communities with more high-quality products and collectibles based on our own intellectual properties
Our audiences also connect with our franchises by viewing our games
In fact, Activision Blizzard accounted for five of the top ten most viewed games on Twitch in 2016. E-sports has become not only a catalyst for increased reach and engagement, but also a stand-alone opportunity
Our Major League Gaming division hit a number of milestones this year, including hosting tournaments for Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft, launching the enhanced viewing experience, integrating the MLG
tv player into Call of Duty, growing video viewers on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram by 50%, and increasing twice player engagement by over 60% year-over-year
Activision's launch of the Call of Duty World League sparked strong growth for Call of Duty e-sports
Activision doubled the 2016 prize pool to over $3.5 million across 16 hosted events
Millions of fans were drawn to the action with the 2016 season delivering 120 million video views, and more than twice the time spent viewing compared to last year's season
We look forward to plenty more action in the months to come
Last year, Blizzard held its tenth BlizzCon and celebrated its 25th anniversary
BlizzCon again sold out in minutes and drew a large global audience with over 25,000 in-person attendees, and 10 million people from around the world tuning in
Blizzard also sold a record number of DIRECTV pay-per-view tickets to fans wanting the full BlizzCon virtual experience
Blizzard announced the formation of the Overwatch League at BlizzCon
For fans, it will offer city-based teams around the world competing in annual seasons, with standardized schedules creating a consistent experience to build passion and allegiance
For team owners, guaranteed slots and clear rights will enable stability and transparency that they can invest in
For players, contracts, including benefits and a combine for player selection will open up the sort of career opportunities associated with traditional sports
The Overwatch League is being designed to bring a new era to e-sports with an epic entertainment experience for everyone involved
Blizzard feels it has the community passion in place and the required structure established to commence the process of selling teams and media rights for the Overwatch League later this year
We'll have more exciting news to share in the months ahead
In January, Blizzard kicked off its Heroes Global Championship and announced its upcoming third annual collegiate e-sports competition, Heroes of the Dorm, which will be streamed exclusively via Facebook Live, ensuring broader global accessibility to e-sports audiences
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investments
In-game purchases were yet again close to $1 billion in the quarter, and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double last year's $1.7 billion
Even without the benefit of the addition of King to our portfolio, the company's in-game purchases would have grown 33% this year
World of Warcraft content and continued strength in Overwatch seasonal events delivered Blizzard's record levels of in-game revenues in the quarter and for the full year
Activision's record in-game revenues for 2016 were driven by a record-setting Call of Duty Black Ops III in-game content season where for the first time, add-on revenues were greater than DLC and Season Pass combined even with record Season Pass participation
Over the past several years, Activision has methodically and creatively evolved the Call of Duty business model, and this performance illustrates the impact those strategies have had in a relatively short period of time
It also showcases the virtuous cycle created when engaging content leads to more player investment
And this year is the first time we have three player communities at scale concurrently in Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III, and we will be supporting each of them with new content throughout the year
Destiny continues to have a large and committed audience, which is eager for new content and adventures
Activision along with their partners at Bungie plan to answer the call with the release of a full Destiny sequel later this year, designed to thrill our existing loyal fan base and bring many new players into the fold
We plan to support the release of the sequel, with a great content plan post launch, setting the stage for growth with this year's sequel and the content season that will follow
King continues to perform from a player investment perspective despite lower MAUs
Bookings per paying user has increased six quarters in a row to its highest level ever
Importantly, we saw stability in the Candy Crush franchise throughout the year, with fourth quarter and full-year mobile gross bookings increasing year-over-year for the franchise
We have also invested in a mobile incubation pipeline with multiple games for a number of our core franchises across the company
We will rely on our own talented teams and partners, and leverage King's mobile expertise
Some of these games has reached the prototype phase and we believe could drive growth in future years
We'll have more to share on our expanding mobile efforts down the road
So in summary, despite many opportunities for improvement, 2016 was by far our best year ever from what we've accomplished and for the groundwork we laid to realize the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead
Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail
