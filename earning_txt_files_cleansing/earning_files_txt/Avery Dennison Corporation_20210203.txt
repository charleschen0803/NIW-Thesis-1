Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] Welcome to Avery Dennison's
Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year ended January 2, 2021. This call is being
recorded and will be available for replay from noon Pacific Time today through midnight Pacific Time,
February 6. To access the replay, please dial (800) 633-8284 or for international callers, +1 (402)
977-9140. The conference ID number is 21969418.

I'd now like to turn the call over to John Eble, Avery Dennison's, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

John Eble

Thank you, Maladin. Please note that throughout today's discussion, we'll be making references to non-
GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures that we use are defined, qualified and reconciled with
GAAP on schedules A-4 to A-9 of the financial statements accompanying today's release.

We remind you that we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates
about our future performance and financial results. These forward-looking statements are made subject
to the safe harbor statement included in today's earnings release. We undertake no obligation to update
these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances other than as may be required by law.

On the call today are Mitch Butier, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Lovins,
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.

Operator

Mr. Butier has disconnected. One moment, please, we'll get him.

John Eble

Yes. Let's give Mitch 1 minute to rejoin.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Thanks, John, and hello, everyone. Good day. Apologies for that quick technical glitch there, the line
dropped. So as you can see from our results, we continue to prove our resilience across business cycles as
a company. We delivered another year of strong earnings growth with adjusted EPS up 8% and record free
cash flow despite a 2% decline on the top line.

We said coming into this year that a key focus of ours in the lower growth environment would be to
protect our overall profitability. We delivered on that promise. Margins again expanded significantly,
reflecting the successful execution of our long-term strategies as well as the team's fast response in
implementing temporary cost-saving actions. The result, combined with better-than-expected volumes in
the second half, essentially accelerated the margin expansion we had planned for 2021 into 2020, enabling
us to deliver EBITDA margins of over 15%.

Our strong performance reflects the remarkable preparedness and incredible agility of our teams who have
come together extraordinarily well in navigating one of the most challenging periods we have experienced
as a company. In this environment, our focus continues to be on ensuring the health and well-being of
our employees, delivering for our customers, supporting our communities and minimizing the impact of
the recession for our shareholders while continuing to invest in the long-term success of the company. I'm
pleased with the progress we are making on all fronts.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

Now despite our best efforts to protect employee health, we have identified roughly 1,100 confirmed cases
of the virus within our 30,000-plus workforce, with the majority of cases reflecting community spread
rather than a work-based source of infection. Fortunately, over 80% of the employees impacted have
already recovered. The recent surge of confirmed cases in a number of the regions in which we operate,
highlights the continued uncertainty of the current environment as well as the importance of remaining
vigilant with respect to safety and agile and meeting customer needs.

In light of the significant challenges throughout 2020, we also took additional measures in support of our
employees and communities. We provided additional compensation and benefits in the early stages of the
pandemic to reduce the financial impact on employees in some of the hardest hit regions. We provided
supplemental payments to our front-line workers to thank them for their courage and agility in serving
our customers' essential needs. And we stepped up our level of community engagement, including an
additional $10 million contribution for charitable causes.

I'm pleased with the continued progress that we are making towards the success of all of our
stakeholders, as evidenced by the fact that we are on track to deliver the vast majority of our long-term
financial and sustainability objectives.

Our consistent performance reflects the strength of our markets, our industry leading positions, the
strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented team. We are focused on the consistent
execution of our 5 key strategies: driving outsized growth in high value categories, growing profitably
in our base businesses, continuing our relentless focus on productivity, being highly disciplined capital
allocators and leading with environmentally and socially responsible practices and solutions.

In 2020, we made progress on each. High-value categories again outperformed. We protected, even
grew margins in our base businesses. We delivered $200 million of cost reduction, both structural and
temporary. We completed 2 acquisitions, Smartrac, which significantly accelerates our strategies and
capabilities to build out our intelligent label platform with RFID; and ACPO, which enhances our position in
our North American Label and Graphics Materials business.

Lastly, we continue to make solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. We have substantially
reduced the environmental impact of our operations while focusing increasingly on the development and
launch of more innovative, environmentally friendly products and solutions.

Now a quick summary of our results by business. LGM's adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis
points to just above 15% for the year on a modest decline in revenue. In Label and Packaging Materials,
underlying label demand has remained strong throughout the downturn, given the increased consumption
of consumer packaged goods and e-commerce trends, while the somewhat more cyclical Graphics and
Reflective Solutions business declined.

From the start-up of the pandemic until now, volume trends for LPM have varied more than usual
throughout the year. From March through December, overall, our North American label business has grown
mid- to high-single digits, roughly double the long-term average for the region, while Europe has grown
low to mid-single digits, comparable to the region's long-term average. And while the mature regions have
grown at or above their long-term average since March, Asia Pacific volumes were below their long-term
trend, up low single digits across the period. This lower-than-usual growth in Asia was due to declines
from March to June before rebounding to mid single-digit volume growth in the second half.

In Retail Branding and Information Solutions, revenue and margins were both down for the year. Following
a sharp decline in Q2, demand improved sequentially in the second half, with Q4 coming in at 3% organic
growth. We delivered more than a full point of margin expansion in the second half, driven by the better-
than-anticipated volume and tight cost controls.

Enterprise-wide, RFID sales grew more than 40% for the year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the
contribution of the Smartrac acquisition and organic growth of 9% for the year. Organic growth of RFID
rebounded quickly in the second half, up roughly 20%, driven primarily by apparel. Outside of apparel, we
are seeing increasing interest in new applications within food and logistics, among other categories. The

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

momentum in these applications is focused on driving labor efficiency, improving availability of products,
and the migration to e-commerce.

As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these
opportunities, with industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most
experienced team in the space. We continue to expect long-term growth of 15% to 20% as we build RFID
into a broader intelligent label platform, which is now a more than $500 million business.

And as for Industrial and Healthcare Materials, we expanded margin in this segment for the year despite
lower revenue. IHM returned to growth in Q4, and we continue to make progress towards our long-term
profitability target here.

To recap, we delivered another year of strong earnings growth and free cash flow despite challenging
market conditions. We entered this crisis from a position of financial, operational and commercial strength
and will emerge from it even stronger. We are once again proving our resilience as a company and our
ability to consistently deliver for all of our stakeholders. And we remain confident in our ability to continue
to deliver GDP-plus growth and top quartile return on capital. We look forward to sharing more about our
long-term objectives and strategies to all of you at our Investor Day next month. And I'll now turn the call
over to Greg.

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide an update today on our performance against our
long-term goals and then walk you through our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2021.
Slide 11 of our supplemental presentation materials provides an update on our progress against the 5-
year targets that we communicated in 2017. And recall that this represents our third set of long-term
goals after meeting or beating our previous 2 sets.

The consistent execution of our key strategies enables us to continue delivering against our targets, with
an overriding focus on delivering GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital over the long term.
As you can see, we are largely on track to deliver once again. Over the 4-year period, sales growth on
a constant currency basis is up nearly 4% annually, with organic growth of 2% annually. While both are
below our initial target, largely due to the late-stage recession in this cycle, we are achieving our objective
of growing above GDP over this period.

Reporting operating margin was 11.6% in 2020 or 12.4% on an adjusted basis, up significantly from
roughly 10% in 2016. Additionally, our EBITDA margin was above 15% in 2020. And as always, our focus
will continue to be the optimal balance of growth, margins and capital efficiency to drive incremental EVA
over the long term.

Our adjusted earnings per share is up over 15% annually, largely driven by the solid top line growth and
strong margin expansion. And our return on total capital came in at 18% for 2020, above our 17% target,
reflecting top quartile performance relative to our capital market peers. And our balance sheet remains
strong with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below the low end of our target range, giving us ample capacity
to continue executing our strategies.

Our consistent progress towards achieving these long-term goals reflects the diversity of our end markets,
the strength of our position in those markets and our resilience and agility as an organization to adjust
course when needed.

At the same time that we communicated our financial goals through 2021, we also laid out a 5-year plan
for capital allocation, which you can see on Slide 12. We're tracking well against this plan, starting with
strong cash flow generation. And we've deployed a total of $3.4 billion over the last 4 years, allocating
it in line with our long-term plan. And clearly, our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to
continue investing organically as well as through strategic acquisitions, while continuing to return cash to
shareholders in a disciplined way.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

Now let me turn to the fourth quarter. Overall, financial results were strong, with adjusted earnings
per share of $2.27, up 31% versus prior year, reflecting better-than-expected top and bottom line
performance in each of our segments. We grew sales by 12.3% or 3.2% on an organic basis. And currency
translation increased reported sales growth by 2.3 points, and the extra week in the fourth quarter
increased reported sales by 4.9%.

Adjusted operating margin increased by 160 basis points to 13.5%, reflecting significant margin expansion
in each operating segment. Our tight near-term cost controls in this environment, combined with the flow-
through benefit from a volume surge late in the quarter as well as our ongoing structural productivity
actions and a benefit from the 53rd week, drove strong margin expansion in Q4. And we realized $18
million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter, due in part to the long-term actions
that we accelerated into 2020, particularly in RBIS.

And for the year, we generated $548 million of free cash flow, up 7% compared to 2019. Total capital and
IT spending came in at $219 million, higher than recent expectations as we accelerated investment in our
high value categories, particularly in RFID. And as mentioned previously, our balance sheet remains strong
with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at year-end of 1.7. And as we've proven our ability to manage
through the compounding global crises we face this year, we've been putting that leverage capacity to
work. For the year, we deployed $350 million for strategic acquisitions as well as returned $301 million to
shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and a growing dividend.

Now let me turn to segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 3.6%
on an organic basis, driven by the net effect of volume and mix and sales improved sequentially across all
regions. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits organically, benefiting from a late
quarter pandemic-related surge in demand. And Specialty and Durable Label categories grew high single
digits with low to mid single-digit growth in the base business. Graphics and Reflective sales were down
mid-single digits, reflecting modest sequential improvement after rebounding significantly in Q3, following
the sharp decline in Q2 as a result of the government-mandated lockdowns then.

Looking at the segment sales trends by region in Q4, in North America, LGM sales were up mid-single
digits organically for the quarter, with LPM up high single digits, while Graphics declined modestly. In
Europe, LGM sales for the quarter were roughly flat on an organic basis, reflecting strong sequential
improvement. LPM was up low single digits, while graphics declined by high single digits. And in Asia, LGM
was up low single digits for the quarter on an organic basis, with relatively consistent growth across the
countries.

LGM's adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 15.4% as the benefits of productivity,
favorable volume and mix and raw material deflation net of pricing more than offset higher employee-
related costs.

Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 11.6% ex-currency, and
up 3.1% on an organic basis, reflecting continued improvement in both the high-value categories and the
base business as retailers geared up for the holiday season early on in the quarter.

High-value categories were up nearly 20% organically, with enterprise-wide RFID sales up 55% ex-
currency and up 21% on an organic basis. And the base business was down low to mid-single digits.

Looking at the total apparel business, the value channel outperformed all the other channels and was
up 40% organically for the quarter. And adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 210
basis points to 15.7%. The significant margin expansion was driven by productivity initiatives, including
accelerated structural actions and temporary cost controls, along with the better-than-anticipated
volumes. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related costs.

Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased by 0.7% on an organic basis
as a high single-digit increase for industrial categories. Reflecting continued sequential improvement in
transfer automotive applications, in particular, was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in health
care categories. Adjusted operating margin increased by 210 basis points to 12.3% as the benefits from
higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

So turning now to our outlook for 2021. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range
of $7.65 to $8.05. We've outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 18 of
our supplemental presentation materials. We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately
3% to 7%, with the midpoint of that range, reflecting continued recovery in our end markets across the
segments.

The extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be a headwind of a little more than 1 point to reported
sales growth and a roughly $0.15 headwind to EPS for the full year. We anticipate Q1 will benefit by
roughly $0.10 based on the shift in the calendar, more than offset by roughly $0.25 to headwind then in
Q4.

Based on recent rates, currency translation is a roughly 2-point tailwind to reported sales growth, with
an estimated $25 million benefit to operating income. And we estimate incremental pretax savings from
restructuring, net of transition costs, of roughly $70 million in 2021. Given we previously accelerated some
2021 actions into the second half of 2020, the vast majority of the savings represent the carryover impact
from actions that we initiated last year. And we also expect the majority of the approximately $135 million
in temporary cost savings we delivered in 2020 to be a headwind as markets recover.

Moving to our outlook on the tax rate. Based on current regulations, we expect both the GAAP and
adjusted tax rates will be in the mid-20s for the full year. And we expect free cash flow to be more than
$600 million in 2021. And finally, we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of 83 million
to 84 million.

In summary, despite the challenging environment, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress
we made against our long-term goals in 2020. And we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver
exceptional value through our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation.
And now we'll open up the call for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. I guess, first question, just on the LGM strength in the fourth quarter, 37% incremental margins year-
over-year. I know you mentioned that there was a late quarter surge, but G&R also got weaker, which
is higher margin, I think, for that segment. So just curious if you can give us a little bit more color on
the margin strength? And then on the strength in LPM from a volume standpoint in both November and
December, was that just a function of expanded lockdowns in Europe and the U.S. or just a much better e-
commerce season or whatever details you can provide there would be helpful also?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Ghansham. This is Greg. So on the last part of your question, certainly, as you said, you can
see in the backup slide with the monthly numbers that we saw a pickup in the LPM side of the business in
November and December. Yes, we think that's a function similar to earlier in the year, as there are more
lockdowns, particularly in Europe and in parts of the U.S., we saw more consumption of packaged goods
late in the fourth quarter. So that was part of what lifted the volume growth in Q4. And that also then
helped drive part of the Q4 margins for LGM. As we've talked about in the past, we've been driving the
temporary cost savings with volumes coming in better than expected in the quarter that helped deliver
stronger margins overall. At the same time, we did have the extra week in Q4, that actual week turned
out to be a pretty strong week, and we did see that also have about a 30 basis point margin impact in
LGM as well as the total company level.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then for my second question, on the 3% to 7% core sales growth for '21, how does that
disaggregate between volumes and price, the way you see it at current in context of pulp prices going up
and petrochemicals and so on? And where in that range is 1Q tracking thus far on a consolidated basis?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think high level, Ghansham, when we think about the range that we have for 2021, so the 3% to
7%, there's a couple overall big drivers. One is we talked about intelligent labels. We still expect to grow
in that 15% to 20% pace, as we've talked about over the years and as we demonstrated, certainly in the
back half of 2020. That by itself, given the size of the IL business now would add about 1 point to 1.5
points of overall growth for the company. At the same time, when we look versus 2020, and we see the
quarters that were hit the hardest Q2 and then a little bit of Q3, if we fully recovered that, we think that
would be somewhere in 3 to 4 points of growth for the year on a full year basis. We've built in about 2 to
3 points of growth on recovering some of that volume decline that we saw in those most hit quarters in
2020. So those are a couple of big drivers of the growth that we see year-over-year. At the same time, we
would expect in the businesses that were hit the hardest in 2020 to have the biggest growth rates as we
see that recovery come through in those segments.

Operator

Our next question is from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

Congrats on a really good end of the year. Greg, just one on your margin expectations for the year. It
seems like you're expecting roughly flattish margins. I assume you would expect notable expansion in IHM
and RBIS and perhaps some degradation in LGM margins, given how good a year you had in '20 in LGM.
Can you just talk about your margin expectations, either consolidated or by segment?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So I think in total, when we look at the year, as we're headed into 2021, just as we -- when we are
headed into 2020, we targeted and we talked about a year ago in a lower growth environment, we were
targeting to hold margins, and that would still be our expectation this year if we're in a lower growth
environment, continue to target holding margins.

When you think just like you said, across the company, the range of our guidance assumptions includes
a number of different factors, depending on the environment and the macro. We would start -- expect to
see, certainly, when you look at the second quarter, when we had the trough in some of the businesses
that had a margin impact there. We would expect to see a larger recovery, particularly in Q2.

When we look more broadly, as you know, when we've talked about in the past, our overall focus over
time is balancing our top line growth with strong margins and strong capital efficiency in order to drive
long-term growth in EVA. And that's how we'll continue to think about it. So margins continues to be a big
factor, of course, in continuing to drive margins, but we're looking at the balance of those 3 things that
drive long-term EVA growth over time.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just one more on the margin issue. So if I look at from 2015 onward, all of the company's margin
expansion has come from the SG&A line. I think SG&A as a percentage of sales has gone from almost
19% to down to 15%, whereas gross margins have been basically flat over that period. This coming year
and thereafter, do you think more of your margin expansion is likely to come from the gross margin line or
the SG&A line? And perhaps why?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think when you look over that long of a period of time, certainly, we were -- had a number of
initiatives, and we've talked about few years ago in RBIS, the acceleration and turnaround there and that
included some reductions in SG&A and other areas. So there was some focus on that. I think when we
look at even 2020, we start to see our gross margins improve quite a bit from the inflationary cycle that
we had a couple of years before that. So we expect to continue driving strong productivity and SG&A over
time, but we would also expect to continue to see gross profits improve over time as well.

Operator

And our next question is from Neel Kumar, Morgan Stanley Investments.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Can you just discuss how your LGM volumes in the fourth quarter compared to the industry? And were
there any specific regions you would call out where you gained or lost some market share?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So Neel, overall, if you look at our -- if you're asking a share question for our LPM business, so label
specifically, we don't have all the market data in for the 2 regions where we get it. But generally, for
the full year, share positions are pretty comparable for 2020 versus 2019. If you look at where we are,
specifically in the fourth quarter, in Europe, we are our share positions where we want it to be. In North

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

America, we're a little bit behind where we want to be. So that's overall for the year, we've been -- our
share position has been pretty constant and where we are for fourth quarter.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just for RFID, you talked in the past about the addressable market in apparel
being 30% or so penetrated. Where do you think that penetration rate can go over the next several years?
And then more generally, in terms of your 15% to 20% long-term RFID growth guidance, do you think
there's upside to that range given the potential acceleration in adoption rates or the RFID base business
already pretty large such that it will get incrementally harder to see that?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So overall, 2 questions there. As far as the apparel adoption rate. So apparel continue -- I mean the
pandemic has really -- what we've seen is a second inflection point, if you will, an acceleration of activity,
not just Tier 1, but a lot of Tier 2 retailers and brands in addition to Tier 1. So a significant amount of our
pipeline is also apparel growth. We had traditionally said, we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. It's clearly a bit
more than that, but we also said, over time, we expect the addressable market to increase a bit over time
as well. So that's where we are in addressable market, still quite a bit of upside overall within apparel, and
we see obviously huge opportunities outside of apparel.

And so to your question of 15% to 20%, do we see upside to that? Yes, I mean, we see a huge
opportunity for us. It's really around developing market opportunities and then capturing those
opportunities, we see significant long-term potential here. The 15% to 20% we've created because there's
a certain level of just pace of adoptions that we go through. And given the size of this business being
over $500 million now, as Greg said, it's now adding 1.5 points to our overall growth. So that's a pretty
significant amount of dollar growth every year if you look at it from that perspective. So we're clearly
not limiting ourselves to what the upside can be. I think 15% to 20% is the right target, where clearly
aspirations are to develop this into a much larger business than it is today, and we see it having a very
long runway ahead of it.

And in general, to your questions about addressable markets and everything else, we'll definitely be
updating all of that at our Investor call -- Investor Day next month.

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS Securities.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just within RBIS and the base ticket and label business, I mean, there's obviously been some uncertainty
on how first half of '21 would play out given some of the weakness we saw kind of early last year. I guess
you've mentioned you'd have more visibility on that kind of after the holiday season. Just curious if you
can give us an update on what customers are saying about order patterns and kind of inventories here
over the next 6 months?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So generally, holiday was a bit stronger on the average, if you will, than retailers were expecting.
So that bodes well. As far as -- it's too early to say how things are playing out post the holiday, just the
timing of the Lunar New Year. We have really easy comps this past week or so. So too tough to tell. We'll
have a better read after January and February, we comped through the Lunar New Year.

Overall, what you're seeing, though, is the North American market doing better than Europe. If you look
at just apparel import trends alone, apparel imports in the U.S. for the full year, they were down close to
20%. If you look at the last 6 months where the data is available, it was down 11 and it's up a couple of

percent, if you look at the last few months. So that does show an improving trend here in the U.S. Europe,
however, continues to be down quite significantly, down around 20% or so the last few months. So a bit of
a decoupling between U.S. and Europe is what we're seeing right now.

And generally, holiday was a bit better than people had anticipated. And we're really going to need a little
bit more time than just right after the holiday to get a good sense of where things play out. And I'd say
Europe is the bigger question for us.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

That's helpful. I guess, going back to the RFID side of things. I think there's generally a view that with
COVID, some of the impact might be some acceleration of adoption there. I guess, I was wondering if you
could give us a general view of what typically the time line looks like until a customer first engages with
you about the idea you guys work with them to develop it, and then it actually rolls out. So we actually
might see some of that kind of flow through your earnings a bit more?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Within apparel, the time line has shortened quite a bit from where it was a few years ago, just
because there's a -- technology is proven. Everybody knows that the business case is very robust. As far
as learnings, you can translate from one retailer brand to another. So that's fairly quick. There's not -- the
average isn't that great, but say, 6 to 9 months is what I would give as an estimate.

Within other categories, it can vary quite a bit. It obviously is longer than that, as far as the pipeline,
when it starts from just the business case and then moves into pilot and testing and so forth. So that
takes a bit longer. I would say the biggest area of the pipeline growth that we're seeing, we talked about
apparel, having good increases within apparel overall, but outside of that.

And if you look at food, our pipeline is up quite significantly as well as with logistics up quite significantly.
And we're seeing a number of pilots that we expect in the pilot phase, will give us $1 million of revenue or
so here in 2021, and assuming they're successful in convert, which we sure confident they will, they would
turn into $5 million programs each individual one. So that's where we are in the food. We've been working
for a while. They've accelerated a bit in the pandemic, along with logistics. We'll see a bit more revenue
here in 2021, and we expect that to be a base for more growth going into 2022.

Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup Global markets.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just a follow-up question on RFID and Smartrac. I think when you acquired Smartrac, I think you indicated
it could be sort of modestly dilutive in 2020 given integration and interest expense costs. And I think you
said margins would be sort of in line with the base business by 2022. Just wondering if that's still sort
of accurate? How the business has performed relative to expectations? And the growth rates that you
called out for RFID, is there any way that you could differentiate between RFID and the sort of the NFC
technology that you acquired with Smartrac?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, so overall, we look at it as a combined business, and it is integrated, so as far as how we go-to-
market and everything else. So the growth is basically on the combined of the two. We have talked about
specifically if you look at Smartrac, they had about 50% to apparel retail and 50% to auto, food and other
categories. So we will discuss it more about what the market trends are for those end markets, but we
won't be calling out a separate growth rate for Smartrac versus the overall RFID and Intelligent Label
platform.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

So that's -- as far as your first question, we actually -- it was not dilutive in 2020. We actually -- if you
look at our adjusted EPS, we were actually modestly accretive in 2020. So we were able to execute
quicker than expected. We do expect the margins to be comparable to the overall margins for the IL
platform, which were above the company and divisional averages for EBITDA margins.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just -- it seems like COVID has pulled forward a lot of
technology adoption and you talked how that's impacted RFID. I'm just wondering on the LGM side, has
COVID changed the adoption of pressure-sensitive versus glue-applied versus shrink? Have customers
delayed some CapEx projects or pulled them forward? I'm just wondering if you've seen -- or if you
anticipate any impact from COVID really on the LGM side?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

I think the biggest impacts are really just what we've been talking about is more around just the
resurgence of consumer packaged goods. So we're seeing strong demand in the market and for our
business in package decoration, particularly in film categories. And then also just the e-commerce. So
e-commerce growth has been quite significant, and our business linked to that is growing similarly. So
yes, we're seeing -- those are the 2 trends overall. We think the e-commerce trends, while there was
a big surge, we think that will be just a new baseline for continued accelerated growth. And packaged
goods, I think everybody is -- COVID is a good reminder, not just with stay-at-home, but the importance
of packaging, for decoration, sanitation and everything else.

Our next question is from Jeffrey Zekauskas, JPMorgan Securities.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

How much on average were your raw material costs down in 2020? And how much on average do you
expect them to be up in 2021?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Jeff, this is Greg. So overall, across 2020, we saw kind of in the low to mid single-digit range in
terms of deflation across the year. Now it was a little bit different as you move through the year, more of
that was earlier in the year as we got into Q4 and we looked sequentially from Q3 to Q4. Overall, it was
relatively stable. But we did start to see some pressure midway or towards the tail end of the quarter,
particularly on chemicals and films. So in propylene, in particular, in polypropylene, we started to see that
pressure in the U.S. late in Q4. We see that continuing here in the first quarter and then starting to also
rise in Europe at the same time here in Q1. So right now, based on what we've been seeing, we would
expect somewhere in the low single digit inflation based on what we've seen so far without predicting what
may happen as we go forward.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes Jeff, just to add to that, we are right now evaluating. Big question is how much of this inflation is
temporary versus sustaining? And so from a pricing standpoint, we are evaluating price increases and
have to surcharge in one region for propylene -- polypropylene, sorry, and evaluating another region and
so forth. That's probably one of the bigger questions around the guidance, specifically for LGM is if --
what's the volume environment? And is the volume environment linked to overall consumption? And what
did that do to the commodities markets and our pricing actions that get linked to that?

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And your industrial and health care businesses had really nice margins in the second half of 2020.
That is they were up above 12%. Is that a new level of margin for that business? And then secondly, you
donated $10 million to a charity. Was there an earnings per share impact from that extra $10 million that
you donated? And if there was, what was the EPS impact?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, Jeff. So your second question first. So yes, that is the increase that you see, the $10 million is on
the corporate expense line in Q4. That's why corporate is higher than usual. And so that is in our numbers
and so we didn't adjust that out or anything else. So that would be roughly a $0.09 impact to Q4.

And then as far as IHM, we're still targeting, our objective here for 2021 was 12.5% operating margins
or more for this business. We're not quite there yet. The team has done a great job. And I will say, under
Greg's leadership, Greg has been overseeing this group of divisions for the last couple of years. And our
objective, if you look at the high end of our range, is to be within that targeted range by next year. So
continued margin expansion is the goal.

Operator

Our next question is from George Staphos, Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Congratulations on the year. I wanted to take a step back and talk a bit more about return on capital,
Mitch and Greg. So Avery has a long successful track record, you pointed to that at the beginning of your
presentation in terms of capital allocation, return on capital, and that's all well and good. We have seen
over the last 3 to 4 years, and it's not just the result of COVID, the return on capital for the company
begin to tick lower.

If you've evaluated that and you agree with that point, what do you think is driving that? And then
relatedly, it looks like COVID has really changed the growth outlook for a lot of your businesses, whether
it's RFID or LPM. You're going to have to spend money. It sounds like you've already begun to do so on
capacity. How do you continue the return on capital trajectory that you'd been seeing longer-term as
you're now needing to spend behind this growth? Then I had a follow-on.

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, George. This is Greg. So I think when we look at our return on capital, when we set our
targets back at the beginning of 2017, we've come out of 2016 with about a 17% ROTC. And the last
couple of years, there's been some of the pension impacts when you look at those in '17 and '18, and
you can see the adjusted numbers in the appendix of our slides. But when you adjust out that, we're
roughly 19% the last couple of years, and in that 18% level here in 2020. So we feel like we have been
continuing to expand ROTC above the baseline where we started that back in 2016. And that's what this
year, of course, includes a couple of acquisitions that we're in the first year of still. So feel good about the
progress we're continuing to make on a return perspective and continuing to be in the top quartile among
our capital market peers there.

And when we think about investments going forward, we -- and Mitch talked already about RFID overall as
EBITDA margins above our average for the segments and the company. And that generates good returns
for us, and we continue to invest in areas where we think we'll have strong returns. So a lot of our CapEx
is in areas like RFID and it's also another high-value segments like specialty labels within LGM or industrial
within IHM and also looking at some of the emerging regions. So we're investing in areas that we think are
high return and where we can continue to generate strong return on capital.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, George. And just to reinforce, the overall theme here is GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns
on capital. And these levels were both. And that is our continued focus, and that's a recipe for superior
value creation over the long term. And when we had set out the 2021 objectives back in 2017, we did say
that in the capital efficiency, we'd gotten into the top decile of efficiency and that we would go through a
period of recapitalization, both organically and be looking for M&A. And when we haven't done M&A for
a while and then started doing M&A over the last 4 years, it takes a while from a returns perspective for
the returns to match the invested capital base that you have in there. And once we have a series of these
in the years going forward and so forth, and it all starts comping in and the returns are catching up on
acquisitions you've done a few years ago, you'll see that continue to flow through.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Understood on that. I guess the other question that I had, and a lot of my questions were answered
earlier. If you think about where you're applying capital going forward and trying to grow the business,
are these areas that you would expect would have higher margin, higher return on capital? Are they areas
where, in some ways, you're applying capital defensively because you don't want to see some of these
markets move towards your peers in terms of share? I know that's a broad question and hard to answer
in a sense or 2, but how would you have us think about it? Is it likely to see -- would you like to generate
higher margin, higher return on capital over the next 2 to 3 years and lead to share gain?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we're investing -- I mean, if you look at both our high-value segments in our base, we look at
EVA and returns. We don't look at just the average that we disaggregate it. And for us, it's continuing to
invest in businesses where we have good EVA potential, and that's in both the high-value segments and
the base. It would be disproportionately in high-value categories, particularly in RFID. So that's been a
significant part of our growth investments.

And as far as the base goes, what you've seen in our investments, we just go back over the last 5 years.
When we need to invest for growth, we also concurrently invest for productivity. So if you look at the
investment we did in Europe a few years ago, we did a significant expansion where we needed capacity to
one of our plants. And we subsequently were able to take offline some capacity to drive productivity. So
both enabled growth for that market, at the same time is lowering our cost base. So a good -- very good
return outcome from that perspective.

Our next question is from John McNulty, BMO Capital Market. And moving on to the next question is
Christopher Kapsch with Loop Capital Markets.

Christopher John Kapsch
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

So I had a follow-up on the RFID business. And if I look back, it looks like you closed on Smartrac early
March, so it's probably just weeks before the pandemic lockdowns ensued. And it sounds, generally,
the consensus is coalesced around this idea that the pandemic has increased your addressable market
opportunities in RFID. But I'm curious to peel that back a little bit more. If you look at the apparel and
food applications, it looks like what's happened is the behavioral changes have maybe accelerated the
adoption in those applications. But I'm curious about, in the case of logistics because you're talking about
having traction in logistics, it sounds like maybe the pandemic influenced the business case there.

So I'm just wondering if that's a good characterization? And because if I think back to early days of item
level, apparel adoption, the business case was -- is very clear, right? It was inventory accuracy, preventing
stockouts or consequential sales lift and eventually that dovetailed into this transition to omnichannel and
e-commerce. But help me understand like what's the business case in this logistics opportunity? It sounds

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 03, 2021

like it's compelling. It sounds like it's -- there's more visibility in and around your traction there. So I'd be
interested to hear your thoughts on that.

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So Chris, the business case is really around increasing productivity, becoming more touchless in your
operations. And that's some of the fundamental base case of what you had to look for apparel you have in
these other categories. And that's specifically why we targeted these other categories. We looked for end
markets that shared some similar characteristics and some challenges as what apparel is going through
albeit in a different form.

So absolutely, pandemic accelerated a lot of the activity within the pipeline. You say adoption has not yet
really had a significant mover on adoption levels because it takes some time to work through the pipeline.
I commented earlier about some of these programs more moving into pilot. The pandemic during the
height of it, in the spring or the early phases of it, I should say, we commented it actually slowed down
the amount of activity when restaurants were closed. As an example, there was a fewer opportunities for
some pilots.

Those have all re-ramped up again here in the second half. And I talked about the momentum going
into 2021. So the use case is really around just becoming more touchless as far as interactions, driving
productivity, wanting increased visibility, reducing waste. RFID is a huge opportunity to reduce waste, so
enabling companies to meet their own sustainability objectives. Those are all included within that, and
we see tremendous opportunity here. So that used case you should think about is very similar to apparel,
albeit in a different form.

Christopher John Kapsch
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just as a follow-up, the item level apparel is -- you're effectively backward integrated into
inlays. I mean -- and I guess it's comparable in some of these other applications, but I'm just wondering
if it's -- given that there are different effective technologies and, therefore, maybe turnkey systems. I'm
wondering if the margin profiles of these different applications evolve? Are they similar? Or are you going
to see more of a margin opportunity tied to the apparel and food categories?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So really, for each end market, there's going to be elements of it where we are providing, as you say,
just the base inlay and then where we're actually providing a full solution set, managing the data, printing
the data, working and supplying a solution around hardware and so forth. So in apparel, we actually sell
just a base inlay. It's a minority of our sales to -- through the Smartrac channel and the LGM channel,
through -- without managing the information and so forth to some competitors of the apparel solutions
division.

And the vast majority, though, of course, is what our apparels business sales fell through, as we say, we're
vertically integrated with managing the information. Food will be the same as an example, where we're
providing the full solution set in many areas. And I'd say the early adoption aspects will be more solution
based. And so I would expect it to evolve similar to what we've seen in apparel.

Next call is from John McNulty, BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Hopefully, you can hear me this time. So I guess 2 things: One would be on the RBIS front. If I look at
2019 and I look at 2020, it looks like there was a geographic shift with the U.S. kind of gaining about 5
points. And Asia, actually losing about 5 points, which seems a little surprising just considering how Asia

weathered COVID may be better than some of the other regions. So I guess, what's driving it? Is it just
the RFID growth and where that's stemming from? Or is there something else we should be gleaning from
this?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

It's RFID adoption. That's exactly it. And the RFID adoption is far ahead in the U.S. versus other
regions. Continued -- if you look at peer volumes, Asia, we're actually seeing, yes, continued strength in
penetration if you were to look at it just from a pure volume standpoint within RBIS.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then I guess the other question was just in terms of fourth quarter
rate on the temporary savings, did you quantify that? I don't recall you saying it on the call, but I guess, if
not, can you quantify what those savings were?

Gregory S. Lovins
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, we didn't quantify the quarter. So I think we said for the full year, we had about $135 million of the
temporary savings, a little bit lower than what we had projected for the last couple of quarters. Just given
we'd said when volumes start to come back, some of those costs would return. So a little bit lower than
we had projected before. So the fourth quarter, I think, was in the roughly $15 million range, something
like that.

Operator

Next question is from Adam Josephson, KeyBanc.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just one on the geographic situation for you, just including any observations thus far in the first quarter.
You mentioned that North America was really strong, particularly in LPM in the last, I don't know, 8
months of the year, much more so than was Europe, even though they both lockdown much of that time.
Can you just talk about what you're seeing geographically, if the trends differ much than what you saw in
the fourth quarter? And what your expectations are if you can by region, roughly speaking, as part of that
3% to 7% organic sales guidance?

Mitchell R. Butier
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Adam, as far as what we're experiencing, yes, North America is definitely having a resurgence in the
volume that we're seeing right now. And that's -- yes, it's just what I explained. And I think it's the drivers
that you look at is due to consumer packaged goods consumption as well as e-commerce. It's hard to tell
as I talked about, volumes have been a bit lumpy. If you look across the various months by region, so
there could be a little bit of inventory build within the current surge that we're seeing in North America.

And Europe is definitely -- no, it came back stronger in Q4, and I'd say all the regions came back, had
very solid growth within Q4 and North America particularly strong. But even EMENA , they finished the
year strong. And now as we look at January, which might be some of your questions, we're continuing to
see the strength in North America. EMENA is softening a bit. And Asia is just too early to tell because of
the Lunar New Year.
