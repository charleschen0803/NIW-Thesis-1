Good morning, everyone
We're pleased that you've joined us this morning
With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer, and the presidents of our U.S
and UK utility businesses
Moving to slide 2, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our first quarter 2017 earnings results, a discussion of our 2017 earnings forecast and a brief operational overview
Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary, will provide an update on our UK incentive performance
Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review, then we will take your questions
Turning to slide 3, today, we announced first quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.59 per share compared with $0.71 per share from our first quarter 2016 results
Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.62 per share compared with $0.67 per share a year ago
This reduction in earnings was driven primarily by lower foreign currency exchange rates as expected, partially offset by an April 1, 2016 price increase in the UK
An unusually mild winter in Kentucky also negatively impacted earnings
The State of Kentucky, in fact, experienced its warmest February on record
I'm pleased with our first quarter results and despite the abnormally warm winter, we are off to a strong start to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance
Let's move to slide 4, which highlights our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast
Today, we are reaffirming our 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share
Looking beyond 2017, we remain confident in our ability to deliver overall compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020. As we have highlighted on the year-end call, we expect 4% to 6% compound annual growth in our U.S
utilities from 2017 through 2020 and 6% to 8% growth in the UK
The drivers of this growth are summarized in the appendix on slide 21 and are consistent with the growth drivers discussed on the year-end call
We have significantly reduced our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates through our ongoing hedging program, as we've increased our hedge levels even further during the first quarter
While the British Government formally began its exit from the European Union, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term growth even if exchange rates were to fall well below today's current levels
However, the pound to dollar exchange rate has been very stable since the UK officially began the Brexit process on March 29. In fact, the exchange rate has actually strengthened some, with current rates around $1.29 per pound
Vince will provide you with an update to our hedge status during his remarks
But I will highlight now that with the additional hedging we did since year-end, we can achieve at least the low end of our 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth range even if the pound falls to $1.05. Delivering on our commitments really comes down to execution, and that is something that we have demonstrated over the years, which is a clear strength for PPL
As we've discussed in the past, we have a very straightforward business plan, which we believe is low risk
And as noted on the slide, we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year from 2017 through 2020, having delivered on that commitment earlier this year by increasing the annualized dividend in February from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share
Overall, we continue to maintain one of the strongest dividend yields in our sector while maintaining our investment-grade credit metrics
Now, let's move to slide 5 for an update on our utility operations
In Kentucky, our rate review before the Kentucky Public Service Commission continues to move forward as we reached settlement agreements in April with all the parties involved
The settlements are subject to approval by the Kentucky Commission
If approved, it will result in a total annual revenue increase of $122 million for our Kentucky utilities
The settlement also includes other adjustments that relate to the timing of cost recovery such as depreciation rates
The settlements provide for the ability to invest in intelligent control equipment that will enhance reliability and enable faster restoration of service
It also will give Louisville Gas and Electric the ability to improve natural gas safety and reliability by replacing the aging natural gas steel service lines with new plastic lines that run from the street to our customers' homes
As part of the proposed agreement, the companies have agreed to withdraw the current request for a full deployment of advanced meters, and we will establish a collaborative with the interested parties to address issues raised with that proposal
This will result in the removal or deferral of just over $300 million in total capital expenditures from the 2017 through 2019 capital plan
The settlement proposal includes an authorized 9.75% return on equity using our filed capital structure
The agreement gives us the ability to enhance our reliability and continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers
A public hearing on the rate review is scheduled to begin on May 9. And order in the case from the Kentucky Public Service Commission is still expected on or around June 30, with new rates going into effect on July 1 of this year
In Pennsylvania, PPL reached a new five-year labor agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1600. The agreement ratified by bargaining unit members in March will take effect May 22. It continues our long-standing practice of providing competitive wages and benefits for our employees
We believe it is also in the best interest of PPL shareowners and our customers
In the UK, as I mentioned earlier, Article 50 was invoked on March 29, which formally began the process of the UK exiting the European Union
That process is expected to take up to two years to complete
As we've discussed in the past, we expect no changes to our UK operations as a result of the exit
I will now turn the call over to Robert Symons to provide an update on WPD's performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets
Thank you, Vince
In closing, I'm confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareowners
And as I said in my opening remarks, we're very pleased with the strong start in the first quarter
As we look ahead, the state of our business is strong and our strategy for growth is clear: We will deliver industry-leading customer service and reliability, we will invest responsibly in a sustainable energy future, we will continue to execute on our infrastructure plans, we will maintain our strong financial position, and we will engage and develop our people
That's our focus each and every day as we work to provide safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers, while growing value for shareowners
Thank you for joining us on today's call
And with that, operator, let's open the call to questions, please
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning, Greg
Very good
I'll let Vince take that question
If the pound continues to strengthen or even stays at the current forward rates, we would probably be slightly above the 6%, which is the upper end of our guidance
And it really depends, Greg, on how we utilize the value that's sitting in 2018 and 2019 and whether we push that out further into the future years or we add it to kind of current years
But clearly, if we were to just maintain it in the current years and the pound stays where it is, we would be at or above the 6%
You're welcome
Sure, and I'll ask Robert to comment on that
But just as a reminder, even though we didn't hit the maximum rewards, we still came in above our projected amount, the estimated amount that we had in the business plan
So we're very pleased with the outcome, but I'll ask Robert to comment on what it would take to achieve the maximum rewards
ards
Sure
Well, as we've talked about before, we have a three-year kind of rolling-forward hedge program
And as we get into the midpoint of this year and the year-end, we would then look to layer on additional hedges for 2020. Again, we would probably look at where the pound sits at that time compared to our $1.30 planning assumption and either if the pound is above it, we'd probably be a little bit more aggressive with the hedging
If it's below and we'd see reasons for upside, we may delay a bit
But overall, I think it would be probably at the earliest, midpoint of this year, we'd start layering on anything for 2020.
Couple thoughts there
One is we are not looking at acquisition opportunities to maintain the mix or change the mix at all
I think we're happy with the organic growth opportunities we have in the U.S
, and so we're focused on growing our U.S
businesses through deployment of capital
And as you're aware right now, we're essentially spending about $3 billion a year in capital
$2 billion of the $3 billion is in the U.S
, and $1 billion in the UK
So over time, even though the UK EPS-wise is growing faster, we're deploying more rate base on the U.S
business side
Relative to other opportunities, we've obviously been very focused on making sure that we protect against the currency fluctuation
So that has been a major focus of making sure that we meet our 5% to 6% EPS growth
And as we indicated, we're very pleased with where we sit right now
Well, first off, I would say we can still hit the top end even with some delay on the capital
The $300 million that we talked about is really in the grand scheme, not that meaningful to the EPS growth story
And as Vic commented, it's possible that that could come back in, albeit maybe on a delay
Well, once we get to the point where we know the outcome of that particular capital program, we'll look at other opportunities, whether it's in Kentucky or elsewhere, where we could see some potential future growth
So we'll wait and see, but as I said, I don't think that $300 million is really that meaningful to the growth story at all
I'll let Vic comment on that
Okay
Yeah, there is an update and I'll let Greg Dudkin take care of that
Yeah
So the next steps are we are proceeding with the Article VII process
We will have to do a system reliability impact study
We've ticked that off
And then, we have to basically select an approval process whether it's a public policy project, which would have to be opened by New York ISO, or there's another separate process under CARIS, which is the economic project
So, we still feel confident with the 2021 to 2023 dates
Start construction
Okay
And I think seeing no further questions in the queue, I want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call and we will talk to you on the second quarter earnings call
Thank you
