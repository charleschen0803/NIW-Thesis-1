Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Incyte Corporation Fourth Quarter Year-End 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the
call over to Mike Booth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Michael Booth
Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Social Responsibility

Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings
Conference Call and Webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of
incyte.com.

I'm joined on the call today by Hervé, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared
remarks, and by Dash, who will join us for the Q&A session.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during our call today are
forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2021, including our
financial guidance, the commercialization of our products and our development plans for the compounds
in our pipeline as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners. These forward-looking
statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ
materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, and from
time to time in our other SEC documents.

We'll now begin the call with Hervé.

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. So 2020 was a year of strong growth for product
commercialized by Incyte and thus commercialized by our collaboration partners. Total product and royalty
revenues grew 18%, fueled by continued growth demand for Jakafi, which grew 15% year-over-year, and
revenue from other hematology and oncology product was up 46% versus the prior year, benefiting from
a strong launch of Pemazyre and good performance from Iclusig. The launch of Monjuvi is progressing well
as we continue to observe market share gains. Royalties were up 28% to nearly $400 million, with Jakavi
up 23%; Olumiant up 38% and the launch of Tabrecta now contributing to our royalty revenues. We also
received over $200 million in milestone payments during 2020, resulting in an increase of 24% in total
revenues year-over-year.

Turning to Slide 5. In 2020, we presented positive data from several pivotal trials and submitted 7
regulatory filings, and we expect to have a decision on all of this during this year. These decisions include
the potential FDA approval of Jakafi in chronic GVHD, retifanlimab in squamous cell anal carcinoma,
tafasitamab in DLBCL in Europe and pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma in Japan and Europe, where
we recently obtained a positive CHMP opinion. We are also just a few months away from the potential
approval of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis and the expected sNDA submission for vitiligo.

I will now pass the call over to Barry for additional details on product performance as well as our
commercial preparation for the launch of ruxolitinib cream.

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Thank you, Hervé, and good morning, everyone. Jakafi performance was excellent in 2020, with revenues
growing over $250 million to reach $1.94 billion.

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

The demand for Jakafi remains high with the total number of patients being treated, continuing to grow
across all 3 indications. We are also encouraged by the partial recovery of new patient starts in the
third and fourth quarter of 2020. For 2021, we expect strong Jakafi growth as we reach a normalization
of oncology visits with a broader availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The potential approval of Jakafi in
steroid-refractory chronic GVHD would represent its fourth indication and an additional important growth
driver. The range of Jakafi guidance we have provided today for 2021 of $2.125 billion to $2.2 billion
reflects the ongoing impact of COVID-19, especially in the first half of the year as well as the expected
increase in the gross to net adjustment with the largest impact coming in the first quarter.

Turning to Slide 8. The launch of Pemazyre has gone quite well as we have been able to capitalize on our
relationships and experience in oncology. Since launch, over 300 physicians have prescribed Pemazyre. As
expected, community-based oncologists are driving adoption, and testing patients for FGFR2 alterations is
going smoothly. Given the refill rate, we know that appropriate patients are being identified and are being
treated with Pemazyre, and it is very gratifying to know that we have been able to bring this much needed
therapy to a previously underserved patient population.

The launch of Monjuvi is progressing well. Sales in the fourth quarter reached $17 million versus $5 million
in Q3. We believe the strong safety and efficacy profile of Monjuvi is resonating with physicians. And as
expected, we are seeing good utilization in the community setting. Since our Q3 update, the number of
accounts purchasing Monjuvi has more than doubled to over 400. And we are also seeing good uptake
from the vast majority of our top 100 key accounts.

According to market research in BMT and in eligible diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients, the Monjuvi
LEN regimen is the most used treatment in the second line plus patient population.

Turning to Slide 10. We submitted the NDA for ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis in December last
year, and we expect a regulatory decision midyear. There are an estimated 21 million atopic dermatitis
patients aged 12 and above in the United States, of which approximately 5.5 million received prescription
therapy today. The number of prescriptions for the treatment of atopic dermatitis has grown significantly
in recent years, as new therapies are introduced. However, only approximately 20% of patients report
their atopic dermatitis is controlled with their current treatment, highlighting the significant unmet need
that currently exists.

We expect the initial uptake of ruxolitinib cream to be driven by specialists in medical dermatology and
allergy. Our team has identified approximately 11,000 high prescribers who collectively account for
approximately 80% of total prescriptions written for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the U.S. Over
the past several months, we have been able to recruit an exceptional team with significant experience in
successfully launching dermatology products in the United States. We are expected -- we expect a fully
recruited field team of 150 FTEs by mid-April, which is optimal to reach these high-volume prescribers.

I'll turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update.

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. In 2020, we made significant progress across our
development pipeline, as shown on Slide 12. Some highlights include positive results from our pivotal
trials of ruxolitinib in chronic graft-versus-host disease, ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis, retifanlimab
in squamous cell anal carcinoma and parsaclisib in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, with each study forming the
basis for regulatory submissions in their respective indications.

We also announced multiple product approvals, including Pemazyre and Monjuvi in the United States; and
Tabrecta in the United States and Japan and a new indication for Olumiant in atopic dermatitis in both
Europe and Japan. We also recently announced the positive CHMP opinion for pemigatinib, a crucial step
towards bringing the first targeted therapy to European patients with cholangiocarcinoma.

As you can see on Slide 13, we are expecting multiple regulatory actions during 2021, with 7 expected
approvals and 6 additional submissions during the year. For ruxolitinib, we expect an FDA decision for

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Jakafi in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and our partner, Novartis, is expected to submit Jakafi for
acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, in both the EU and Japan during the first half of 2021.

Within hematology and oncology, we await an EMA decision for tafasitamab in diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma and an FDA decision for retifanlimab in squamous cell anal carcinoma. We expect pemigatinib
to receive European approval in cholangiocarcinoma, following the recent positive CHMP opinion, and we
also have a submission under review in Japan. Later this year, we plan to submit an NDA for parsaclisib
monotherapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma based on the pivotal CITADEL trials.

Within dermatology, we expect an FDA decision for ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis in June, and we
look to submit an sNDA in vitiligo shortly thereafter, assuming our Phase III program in this indication is
successful. As you can see, it is shaping to be a very eventful and exciting year ahead for Incyte in terms
of clinical development and regulatory action.

Slide 14 provides a brief overview of the LIMBER clinical development program. Once-daily ruxolitinib is
the furthest along with potential FDA approval before the end of 2022. We have multiple combinations
planned and in development with PI3 kinase delta, BET or ALK2, which we believe have the potential to
significantly improve outcomes for patients living with myelofibrosis. As you can see on the right-hand
side, we expect the patent protection for many of these novel assets to extend well into the 2030s.

Moving to Slide 15. This year with our partner, MorphoSys, we intend to initiate 2 Phase III trials.
frontMIND is expected to enroll approximately 900 patients and will evaluate the combination of
tafasitamab plus lenalidomide and R-CHOP versus R-CHOP alone in first-line diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma. inMIND is expected to enroll approximately 600 patients and will assess the combination of
tafasitamab plus R square versus R square in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular or marginal
zone lymphoma. We also plan on initiating 2 proof-of-concept trials in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
investigating tafasitamab in combination with our own PI3 kinase delta inhibitor parsaclisib, and in
combination with lenalidomide and plamotamab, a CD20 x CD3 bispecific antibody.

Moving to Slide 16. We recently announced the acceptance under priority review of the BLA for
retifanlimab. The BLA was submitted based on the results from POD1UM-202, data from which was shared
at the ESMO Congress last year, and the PDUFA date has been set at July 25.

We have also been informed that the FDA expects to convene an advisory committee meeting as part of
the review process. This slide also gives me an opportunity to remind you of our development strategy
for retifanlimab. The first part of the strategy is to develop retifanlimab as monotherapy in certain niche
indications where accelerated approvals are available. And other registration-directed trials beyond
squamous cell anal carcinoma are ongoing in Merkel cell carcinoma and MSI-high endometrial cancer.
We also have an ongoing global Phase III study in lung cancer, which, of course, offers a much more
substantial potential opportunity. A key part of our development strategy is related to the utility of having
an in-house PD-1 antibody, which gives us the option to run numerous internal clinical combinations with
other assets within our immuno-oncology portfolio, including AXL/MER and adenosine 2A, 2B, where
there's potential for synergistic activity and enhanced efficacy. With that, I would like to turn the call over
to Christiana for the financial update.

Christiana Stamoulis
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to our financial results. Our fourth quarter
results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product and royalty revenues of $680 million,
representing an increase of 17% over the fourth quarter of 2019 and reflecting growth across products
commercialized by Incyte and by our partners. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are
comprised of net product revenues of $517 million for Jakafi, $29 million for Iclusig and $14 million for
Pemazyre. Royalties from Novartis of $87 million for Jakavi and $2 million for Tabrecta and royalties
from Lilly of $31 million for Olumiant. For the full year 2020, total product and royalty revenues were
$2.46 billion, an increase of 18% over 2019. Total revenues for 2020 of $2.67 billion increased 24% over
2019, reflecting the higher product and royalty revenues and an increase in milestone payments from our
collaborative partners for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones.

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $380 million for the
fourth quarter increased 23% from the prior year period due to our 55% share of the global and U.S.-
specific development costs for tafasitamab and product/supply-related costs to support the potential
launch in 2021 of ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for atopic dermatitis. Ongoing R&D expense for the
full year 2020 of $1.24 billion increased by 10% over 2019 also driven by the impact of our 55% share of
tafasitamab development cost and ruxolitinib cream product supply-related costs. If ruxolitinib cream is
approved, the product supply cost expensed in 2020 will ultimately contribute to lower cost of goods sold
for a period of time subsequent to the product launch.

As a reminder, our total R&D expense of $2.2 billion for the full year 2020 includes the upfront
consideration of $805 million for our collaborative agreement with MorphoSys and $120 million of expense
related to our purchase of an FDA priority review voucher utilized to accelerate the review of ruxolitinib
cream in atopic dermatitis. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter of $167 million increased 23% from the
prior year period due to the timing of certain expenses. For the full year 2020, SG&A expense grew 10%
compared to 2019, driven by an increase in sales and marketing spend to support the commercialization
of Pemazyre in the U.S. and to prepare for the potential launch of RUX cream in the U.S. Our collaboration
loss for the quarter was $12 million, which represents our 50% share of U.S. net commercialization loss
for Monjuvi. For the full year 2020, the total collaboration loss was $43 million and was comprised of total
net product revenues of $22 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses of
$107 million.

Finally, we ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities.

Looking at the evolution of our P&L over the past 5 years, you can see how the growth in our product and
royalty revenues has exceeded the growth in both our ongoing R&D expense and SG&A expense leading
to increased operating leverage and reflecting our commitment to prudent management of our financial
resources.

Moving on to 2021. I will now discuss the key components of our 2021 guidance on a GAAP basis. Given
the expansion of our commercial portfolio, we are providing 2021 net product revenue guidance for Jakafi
and as a total for other hematology/oncology products.

For Jakafi, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.125 billion to $2.20 billion, which
at the midpoint represents approximately 12% growth over 2020 driven by continued growth across all
indications. We expect our gross to net adjustment in 2021 to be approximately 18% with the adjustment
in the first quarter of the year being higher relative to the previous quarter and subsequent quarters.

For other hematology/oncology products, which currently include Iclusig in Europe and Pemazyre in the
U.S., we are expecting total net product revenues to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million. As in
previous years, we are not providing guidance for milestone or royalty revenues. We are also not providing
revenue guidance for any potential new product launches during 2021 or for Monjuvi in the U.S., which
was recently launched and which we are commercializing, together with our partner, MorphoSys.

Turning to operating expenses. We expect COGS to range from 6% to 7% of net product revenues. We
expect R&D expense to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.39 billion, representing mid single-digit
growth at the midpoint versus 2020, excluding the impact of the MorphoSys upfront consideration and
the PRV in 2020. Our SG&A expense guidance includes the investment related to the establishment of
the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related sales and marketing activities
to support the potential launch of ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis; the expansion of our sales and
marketing activities in Europe to support the potential launches of pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma
and tafasitamab for DLBCL; and the establishment of a commercial organization in Japan to support the
potential launch of pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma.

As a result, in 2021, we expect GAAP SG&A expense for the year to be in the range of $735 million to
$775 million. Excluding the impact of these investments, we expect our SG&A expense for 2021 to remain
flat compared to 2020.

I will now turn the call back to Hervé for further discussions of the year ahead.

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Christiana. Slide 24 provides a list of the important updates we expect in 2021. This includes
pivotal trial results for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo as well as the approvals for ruxolitinib cream in atopic
dermatitis, retifanlimab in SCAC and Jakafi in chronic GVHD. So before moving into Q&A, I want to take
a minute to let you all know that Mike Booth will be leaving Incyte at the end of the month ahead of his
planned return to the U.K. Mike's role as Head of IR Incyte will move to Christine Chiou, who joined us in
2019 and who has been working very closely with Mike as part of a planned transition. I want to take this
opportunity to thank Mike very much for all of his contribution to Incyte over the past 7 years, and we all
wish him well in his future endeavors.
With that, operator, please give your instruction and open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Vikram Purohit from Morgan Stanley.

Vikram Purohit
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I wanted to touch on the dermatology franchise. And I had 2 questions for RUX cream in advance
of the Phase III vitiligo data that we're going to be getting over the next couple of months here. So
first, could you characterize for us any key differences between the Phase II and the Phase III patient
populations that you're looking at for vitiligo? And then second, how should we think about which portion
of the vitiligo patient population that RUX cream could be most suitable for? How are you thinking about
segmenting this patient population? And where do you think RUX cream is going to be most valuable?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Vikram, it's Steven. I'll take your question. In terms of the question on the translatability of the Phase II
to the Phase III, given the magnitude of the size of the Phase II, the geography we conducted it in and
eligibility criteria, we actually expect there to be no differences in population or in outcome. We expect
the read in the Phase III to be of similar efficacy, magnitude to the Phase II and the safety to be the
same. I'll just show the one nuance on the difference is we in Phase III, limit the body surface area of
vitiligo patients with depigmentation to be up to and including 10%, whereas in the Phase II, we are a
little more liberal and allowed up to 20%. But that is the only difference. We expect no other differences
in outcome and in read-through of the population. In terms of vitiligo itself, it's probably a much more
common disease than everybody realizes.

If you look at the United States, there are several million "sufferers" with vitiligo. Not all of them view
it as a disease and not all of them want treatment. But currently, given the available therapy, about
100,000 to 150,000 people, we estimate seek different treatments including steroids, phototherapy,
which is reimbursed as well and not -- they're not very effective in terms of ameliorating the disease and
improving it and nothing to the degree we saw in the Phase II with topical RUX. There's also, as you know,
a large psychosocial component to the condition where people are often depressed from it as well. So we
expect to work in the same population as the Phase II will include the majority of sufferers with vitiligo,
particularly on the face and hands. And that's the label we'll aim for, should the Phase III be as positive as
we expect it to be. Thanks.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim.

Michael Werner Schmidt
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I had a few on the ruxolitinib cream launch coming up here as well. Maybe could you help us understand
how far are you with your launch prep in AD, especially when it comes to interactions with payers around
pricing and market access?

And my follow-up question would be in context of the recent post-marketing safety data emerging from
Celgene, so I was wondering how you think this may potentially affect utilization of oral JAK inhibitors
more broadly and across indications, and how that might position ruxolitinib cream in AD in that context?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Michael, it's Barry. I'll take the first part of your question, and I'll hand it over to Steven for the second
part of your question. But as far as the preparation goes for the launch, it's going very well. We started

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

off at Incyte with an excellent clinical development team that's very experienced in dermatology and
immunology. We built the medical affairs team in the U.S., that's outstanding and has deep experience
in dermatology and immunology. Now we're building out the sales force, and we built out an excellent
market access team, again, that has deep experience in immunology and dermatology. We have
had interactions with payers across the nation with advisory boards, and we'll begin the process of
negotiations with the payers in the very near future. So we think the launch's preparation is right on
schedule. Steven?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. Given the Celgene's non-inferiority data versus TNF therapy,
particularly in RA patients, particularly looking at venous thromboembolism, malignancy and in major
adverse cardiac events, you asked a question on the read-through to RUX itself and then, I guess,
potentially to topical RUX. We've been with RUX on the market since 2011. So we have many, many
thousand years of patient exposure, including with our partner, Novartis, as well as long-term follow-up on
our clinical trial programs.

So let me just talk a little bit about the clinical trial programs. If you look at the COMFORT data in MF, now
with 5 years of follow-up on those studies, there's been no signal for any of those events that are worrying
in that particular exposure. In polycythemia vera, the response studies, that is a prothrombotic disease,
also now have 5 years of published follow-up, and we've looked across the board at thromboembolic
events, cardiac events and malignancies there. And in fact, on the treated arms, the rates are lower in
both the primary treated arm, the crossover arm versus the best available therapy arms there. So as in
keeping as well with our market experience that we're not seeing a signal for any of those events as we
asked to on a yearly basis by regulatory authorities. And just remind you, RUX cream has no warnings
or black box for any of these. Topical RUX itself, as we have in 2 published papers now, one in AD and
one in vitiligo, shown that the bioavailability of the cream is about 4% to 7% of that applied, on average
about 5%. So -- and those are 2 published papers, one in AD, one in vitiligo. And thus, the effective oral
exposure there is very small and not at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.

So given the parent compound itself not having an issue, RUX cream having that sort of bioavailability and
our safety from those clinical programs, we don't expect any read-through there at the moment.

Operator

Our next question today is coming from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.

Cory William Kasimov
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'll stick with the same line of questioning here on RUX cream. And Barry, I wanted to follow-up with --
around your comments on the pending launch for AD. And just given everything you've said so far, what
do you see as the key impediments in this kind of market introduction? And how should we be thinking
about the heavy lifting required here versus perhaps some of that potentially low-hanging fruit you could
relatively quickly capture given the data, the mode of administration and the number of patients who just
aren't benefiting from existing meds?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Cory, well, as far as impediments go, I don't really see very many impediments. We've actually -- we think
we're really in a very good situation. We think we really can help patients with mild-to-moderate eczema,
atopic dermatitis from steroids all the way up to Dupixent, to biologics.

So we think that there is a broad range of patients who will be very happy to use a cream like RUX cream
as opposed to using systemic therapy that may in fact suppress their immune system in general. So we're
very excited about it. We know that in talking to dermatologists across the country, that when they look at
the data from TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2, they're very excited. They've never seen anything like this that

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

has targeted -- that is a targeted therapy, that's topical, that has biologic-like activity. So we think that the
safety and efficacy we demonstrated so far in TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2 is going to help the uptake and
patients throughout the United States.

Operator

The next question is coming from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist.

Srikripa Devarakonda
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Staying on RUX cream. I was wondering what sort of conversations have you had around the NDA that
you filed with the FDA following your submissions? Have you had any further conversations? And also,
can you talk about your strategy for RUX cream in pediatric populations? Can we expect it to be similar
between atopic derm and vitiligo?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Kripa, it's Steven. Thanks for your question. We don't talk in detail about any ongoing conversations with
regulatory authorities. But I will tell you, as we've said publicly, the submission went in successfully in
December. We utilized a priority review voucher that will give us a 6-month review, and we expect an
action in the middle of the year on that, given that it's now early February, it's still early days of that
submission and review, and it's going exactly as expected.

It's in 12 years and above, the TRuE-AD studies, which covers the majority of the population Barry was
talking about with atopic dermatitis. However, there is a population that is younger that does also have
atopic dermatitis. And we have a commitment to continue to study that. We have to do more safety-
enabling work in the pediatric population to enable those studies to look, for example, is there any bone
effect, et cetera, as you look at young ages. And we've got through those hurdles successfully, and we'll
determine this calendar year, given that the Phase II is successfully completed, what sort of Phase IIIs
we'll be conducting in conjunction with regulatory authorities to address the population 2 years and above
and conduct those studies. And we'll let you know soon as we have those studies in place, but it's going
well.

Our next question today is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets.

Brian Corey Abrahams
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

First off, I just want to thank Mike for all his help throughout the years and wish him well in his next
endeavors. And congratulations to Christine.

Maybe shifting gears to Monjuvi. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about how that's being used
in the real world, in particular, where it's fitting in relative to CAR-T? And what you may look towards to
further the reach in academic settings, where I would imagine cell therapy and investigational treatments
like bispecifics are more available? In addition to the community setting, how important that's going to be
to continue the current uptake momentum?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Sure, Brian. Well, the uptake of Monjuvi, like I said, is going very well in the second-line plus patient
population. Like any new therapy that launches, you end up starting in later line therapies, third and
fourth-line therapy, for example, and we continue to try to move patients -- try to move physicians up
into the second-line setting because we think that's where the patients will benefit the most. Our uptake
at launch was mostly in the academic centers, and we do follow the academic centers that actually
have CAR-T therapies available to them. And we're actually doing very well. Patients who are referred

to academic centers for CAR-T therapy sometimes get there and they're actually not eligible for CAR-T
therapy. So then they need another therapy to choose.

As we progressed with our launch, more and more of the community oncologists are taking up Monjuvi
and that's surpassing number of patients who are being treated in the academic center. But we still have
some of the largest centers in the country that are using this regimen of Monjuvi and LEN.

As far as bispecifics go, we don't know that, that's a problem necessarily yet. And in fact, we think that
the safety and efficacy profile of Monjuvi will match up very well to any of the new therapies that might be
coming next year. As far as the CAR-T therapies go, again, physicians will choose their patient population
based upon their ability to tolerate the side effects of the CAR-T therapy. So generally, it might be younger
patients who are healthy that they might select for those therapies. But again, that's a limited number
of centers around the country. So we think that Monjuvi has a long way to go with treating patients with
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

The next question is coming from Tyler Van Buren from Piper Sandler.

Tyler Martin Van Buren
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just had another one on Monjuvi. You talked about the successful launch and the uptake in the academic
community settings and market share gains. So curious to hear your latest thoughts and if you believe
Monjuvi could be $1 billion product in the existing indication? Or if you need the frontMIND and inMIND
studies to be successful? And I noticed that B-MIND wasn't mentioned in the presentation and barely
mentioned in the press release. So just curious to hear if that was like a deliberate deprioritization of
what's going on there.

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

So Tyler, I'll just take the first part of your question and hand it over to Steven about B-MIND. But what
we said several times in the past is that in the current indication, Monjuvi could reach $500 million to $750
million -- and we'll -- as we continue to develop more combinations and move up to the front-line setting,
and that's $500 million to $750 million in the U.S., by the way. So anyway, that's where we're at. And I'll
hand it over to Steven for B-MIND.

Hervé Hoppenot
Chairman, President & CEO

Just a word. If you look at the worldwide sales for Monjuvi in second-line DLBCL, assuming it's $500
million to $750 million in the U.S., it will be around $1 billion or north of that for the world.

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Tyler, it's Steven. In terms of your question on B-MIND, just that it's an ongoing study. There are no
changes to it, and there are no news updates. It's a very relevant study. It's comparing to bendamustine/
rituximab, which is a regimen used in that particular setting and studying the utility then of a CD19
antibody in tafasitamab there. We hopefully will have data on that study if the events track as expected in
2022, but just that it had nothing new to report.

I did want to ask 2 questions. One, just about your thoughts on your PI3 kinase with the approval of TG
Therapeutics yesterday. And how do you think about positioning in that market after them?

And then also, I just wanted to get kind of your perspective on the adenosine access of the CD73 PD-1
combination. Is that something that you would use in non-small cell as a potential option? Or how do you
think about like non-small cell combinations with your PD-1?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Alethia, it's Steven. Thanks for the question. I think the umbralisib approval from TG Therapeutics is good
for patients. Obviously, we are believers in the PI3 kinase delta class. We think it has somewhat of an
unfair overhang from idelalisib years ago and that many have now addressed many of the untoward side
effects. So we view that as a positive outcome. It doesn't in any way impact our plans in terms of where
we're going with the CITADEL studies and the filings this year, hopefully, in follicular, marginal and mantle
cell lymphoma.

If you look on the face of it, with many, many caveats on cross-trial comparisons, but our independently
reviewed activity in all those indications, follicular, marginal and mantle cell is higher than that reported
with drugs like umbralisib, again with lots of caveats. So we're very encouraged by the efficacy we've
seen with parsaclisib and obviously are proceeding with our plans. Tolerability is important as well. And
obviously, we looked at their label and their discontinuations versus ours, et cetera. And we, again, think
the class has been somewhat unfairly burdened by prior products.

We like our -- both our efficacy and safety profile. And we see, again, to be repetitive, no impact.

In terms of switching to earlier programs, you spoke about adenosine and the adenosine-targeted
compounds. We have one in the clinic already, a small molecule, A2A, A2B inhibitor that's open and
enrolling that we announced at JPMorgan.

We also said we'll be following very shortly with a CD73 antibody that will inhibit adenosine production
higher up in the pathway. And Hervé showed in his presentation that the 2 together, at least in a
preclinical model are synergistic. We also feel that this is potentially an area where you may require triplet
therapy, and you'll have to add checkpoint on top of a PD-1. It's too early to say where these will be going
in terms of histology. Lung would always be of interest, particularly in lung patients that don't respond to
current IO therapies. So that will remain of interest.

I'll just remind you also that both the adenosine program and the CD73 antibody are in-house programs,
and we're very, very proud of them. Thanks.

Our next question today is coming from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America.

Tazeen Ahmad
BofA Securities, Research Division

As you approach the RUX cream launch, I just wanted to get a little bit more color on how you're thinking
about how the gross margin for RUX cream, let's start with atopic derm might differ from the gross
margins that you see for Jakafi? And then I have a quick follow-up.

Christiana Stamoulis
Executive VP & CFO

So in -- Tazeen, this is Christiana. In terms of the COGS for RUX cream, the guidance that we provided on
COGS, that is 6% to 7%, it does reflect RUX cream as well. In the near term, as we indicated, we have
been billing on the supply of API for RUX cream, and that would result in COGS being lower as we use up
the supply that we have already expensed in 2020 and which was reflected under R&D.

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Okay. So would you expect that once you have a second indication that, that COGS will continue to
improve?

Christiana Stamoulis
Executive VP & CFO

So the COGS that we have -- the COGS benefit from the API that we have already expensed will take
place over a period of time, starting with the launch. And then obviously, will go back to more normalized
levels. So we will -- as we use what has already been expensed, it would be reflected in lower COGS.

Tazeen Ahmad
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then as it relates to how physicians are viewing RUX cream now just kind of based on -- you
can't officially market it, but how are you thinking they understand the difference between RUX cream and
Eucrisa? And where the benefits of RUX cream might be?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Tazeen, it's Barry. I'll try to handle that. Well, the -- I think as I said before, that the physicians we've
spoken to, and there's many across the country, all the dermatologists see the TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-
AD2 data as really something unique. They really like -- dermatologists really like using topical therapy,
and they see this as the most effective topical therapy that they've seen ever. So Eucrisa had some
disadvantages to it when it launched. Certainly, it actually burns on application and doesn't seem to be
that effective. The side effect profile is pretty good. But I think physicians -- dermatologists have turned
away from it, and they're very excited about what they see so far from RUX cream.

Tazeen Ahmad
BofA Securities, Research Division

And so Barry, if it does get approved, do you think that it would have a steep uptick? Or do you think
there still would need to be some physician education initially?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Well, there's always physician education that's necessary as well as perhaps patient education, but we
think that the uptake is going to be -- go very well.

Salveen, it's Steven. I'll start. The once-daily formulation of ruxolitinib continues to go well. The
bioavailability and bioequivalence work is being completed. We're now in stability, and we need 12 months
of stability to complete to then put the submission in. We would expect a 10-month review from that and
thus expect an approval before the end of 2022, if everything goes smoothly. We are within everything
expected in terms of the strict guidance required on BA/BE. So we're hopeful this will be a successful
submission.

Chairman, President & CEO

So Salveen, regarding BD, in fact, looking at what we did this year in 2020, last year, is a good way maybe
to see what we are -- how we are approaching the BD strategy. We had a deal like MorphoSys where it
was very complementary with our portfolio. You can see we have combinations that we are doing now
with parsaclisib. There are a lot of synergies on the commercial side, both in Europe and in the U.S. So if
there are opportunities looking like that, I think it will certainly be interesting to us to continue to grow our
revenue line and to diversify. So that will be one aspect.

We also did a technology deal with a company called Cellenkos, and that was about myelofibrosis. So you
can imagine also that we are looking at opportunities that we will be adding to our internal portfolio as
part of the LIMBER program. And in general, the way we are thinking about it is, if there are products
that could be available, that would be fitting with our hematology/oncology portfolio, that would be the
priority. And if there were opportunities that are also providing additional revenue to our dermatology
team in the U.S., it could be also something that we look, but mostly on the different time lines, as we will
be launching first atopic dermatitis this year and then vitiligo next year. So there is no urgency to add to
that in the short term.

So I would say it's -- in the short term, hematology oncology; maybe over a longer period of time, we
could be looking at immunodermatology and the type of assets we are looking at are products that we'll
be launching between 2023 and 2026.

Our next question today is coming from Mara Goldstein from Mizuho.

Mara Goldstein
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Just a follow-up perhaps on RUX cream. And just trying to understand a little bit around the dynamics
of launches, is most derm products are associated with some type of support, couponing program and
the like and so on. I'm curious as to what your thoughts are on that? And also, one of the areas that the
company hasn't touched on in a while is Jakafi in PV and some of the efforts pre COVID to enhance that
patient population. I'm wondering if you could touch on that as well.

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Sure, Mara, I'll try to answer both of those on RUX cream and then on Jakafi in PV. So we have plans in
place, just like many products that you see, particularly in dermatology, but throughout the United States
for newly launched products, where we're going to ensure that when a dermatologist, when a physician
prescribes RUX cream, that it's as easy as possible for the patient to obtain it. So that begins first with
market access, working with PBMs and payers to make sure that there's as few restrictions as possible,
as few prior approvals as possible. And then once we get to the pharmacy counter, to be able to help the
patients with their co-pays and deductibles through, as you say, a couponing program or other ways for us
to manage that.

As far as Jakafi goes, Jakafi continues to -- Jakafi in PV goes, Jakafi continues to grow in PV faster than
it does in MF. And even though MF continues to grow, the total number of patients continues to grow. I
suppose our biggest activity that we're doing in PV, well, is, first, talking about the long-term follow-up
of the response studies, which are very, very important. Over time, the data just continued to get more
impressive and looked better. But also, we had our -- we had our disease awareness campaigns around
polycythemia vera and the number of patients who are suffering because of the symptoms that they
undergo when they're getting PVs. So we're very encouraged about the future of Jakafi in polycythemia
vera as well as our other indications. But as you indicated, it's a pressing need for those patients to make
sure that they have the most effective therapy to take care of their symptoms and their hematocrit.

Let me offer my congratulations also to Mike to next step in his career.

Maybe, Barry, with vitiligo and your comments and Steven's comments, yes, there certainly are people
who do get reimbursed today for off-label use of various products. But we also hear from consultants that
a number of plans consider this to be a cosmetic indication. I guess, Barry, what's your sense as to kind
of what percent of the relevant population already has this covered and recognized by their plan as a true
medical reimbursable condition? And then kind of what efforts do you need to do between now and launch
to grow that number?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Well, I'm not sure I can tell you what number are currently covered for therapies because there aren't
very many therapies. Steven talked about phototherapy. That's one way. Other topical therapies may or
may not be reimbursed. But I think it's -- Steven talked about the millions of patients in the United States,
somewhere between 2 million and 4 million patients that have vitiligo, but maybe only 150,000 to 200,000
patients are seeking therapy. And that's because, in fact, there aren't very many effective therapies. We
do have to continue to educate both payers -- I don't think we really have to educate dermatologists
very much. Dermatologists know that this is an autoimmune disease that drastically impacts patients'
lives. So having a therapy like RUX cream for vitiligo, we think, can greatly enhance the quality of life for
those patients, and it's essential upon us to educate payers that this is not a cosmetic issue, that it is an
autoimmune disease and that the responsible thing is actually to pay for it.

Marc Alan Frahm
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Are there kind of similar launches that have happened historically that you kind of faced the same type of
dynamic?

Barry P. Flannelly
Executive VP & GM of North America

Well, that comes to mind. So I think there's lots of diseases that we come across that haven't had payers
wanting to pick it up. You might even say eczema for example, when older products were launching,
they might have thought that this is something that's not important, but in fact, it impacts patients' lives
very much where they don't want to go out of the house and where they're suffering, not just itching
and staying awake at night, but of course, even bleeding and infections. So that's one example. I'm sure
there's many other examples where education of payers and prescribers is very important. We think that
is vitiligo, but we think that we can manage -- overcome that hurdle.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I just want to quick shout out to Mike for everything over the past couple of years. You will be missed.

So I wanted to ask on the LIMBER program. While it might be early, can you characterize kind of maybe
some demand or feedback you've gotten on the QD RUX option among close physicians and patients? And
what do physicians really want to see from this QD formulation in terms of efficacy to potentially switch
patients from the current Jakafi?

INCYTE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Okay. Evan, thank you, it's Steven, I'll start. Others may want to add comments. The LIMBER program
itself is an umbrella program with numerous pillars. The formulation work was one of the pillars.
Obviously, once daily has potential compliance improvement over twice daily, although in oncology, people
tend to do very well with twice dailies, but that was one of the efforts behind it for those people who would
potentially benefit from that.

Additionally, it does give us down the line, very important optionality on fixed-dose combinations should
we develop, for example, PI3 delta or BET or ALK2 as a once daily, it could lend itself to be combined with
a once-daily ruxolitinib in one FDC. So that would be really, really important from that. After we pursue
the 505(b) route through bioavailability and bioequivalence, finish the stability file and hopefully have it
approved at the end of 2022, we could look at things that may be slight differences in the clinical profile
of the once daily. For example, just by its very nature from a pharmacokinetic point of view, it will have
a lower peak, a lower Cmax. If that is one of the causes of anemia from the drug, which we think it is,
it may tend to have a lower rate of anemia with the once daily, which would be of benefit in MF patients
because that's one of the reasons they discontinue and then allow patients to stay on drug longer and
they, as a direct result, actually enhance efficacy as well. So there are lots of aspects to the program. It's
step-wise. It's about getting approval first, which may lend itself to compliance, optionality on fixed-dose
combinations and potentially an upside on ameliorating anemia.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for 2 more questions. Our next question is coming from Ren
Benjamin from JMP Securities.

Reni John Benjamin
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on an amazing quarter, great guidance, and congrats, Mike as well.

Maybe just starting off the LIMBER program. This is probably for Steven. Can you just talk a little bit about
these 2 Phase III trials that are ongoing, maybe the timing as to when we might see readouts? And how
the optimal dosing was determined for both RUX and parsaclisib?

And maybe just as a follow-up, Hervé mentioned Cellenkos. I'm just kind of curious what was the rationale
to lead to this collaboration? Is there an unmet need that this collaboration seeks to address? Or is it more
just trying to find a best response rate in MPNs?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Yes, Ren, it's Steven. Thanks for your questions. So again, back to the LIMBER program, we just spoke
about in the prior question about the first pillar around formulation work. The second pillar is around
important combination work with combinations that either enhance efficacy or enhance safety like the
ALK2 or both because you ameliorate anemia with ALK2 and you can stay on RUX. The delta program
that you alluded to has 2 very important Phase IIIs that are open site initiations ongoing now. One is
a suboptimal setting for patients who have had at least 3 months of ruxolitinib, but have not had an
adequate response in terms of spleen or symptom control and are then randomized to RUX plus delta in
that setting PI3 delta versus RUX alone. The dosing, because you asked the question specifically, is for
RUX itself. Obviously, we know optimal dosing and how to titrate based on potential safety issues like
thrombocytopenia.

The delta dosing came from proof-of-concept work we did in prior patients who had inadequate responses
to long-term RUX. And that's how we determined that the 5-milligram was active there as well as had a
tolerable profile. And that's what we're using in both the suboptimal study and the first-line study, which
are now open and site initiations ongoing.

In terms of Cellenkos, it's a completely new mechanism of action. It's -- there's some enticing small
clinical anecdotes. It's umbilical cord derived regulatory T cells that they have a way to enrich for CXCR4,
which are then regulatory T cells that would then hone to the bone marrow. And they've shown in a small

number of patients who are heavily pretreated, some enticing data of clinical response, drop in allele
burden and maybe even some fibrosis improvement. It's very early. We like the way the deal is structured
because we go in with a small upfront, we finance the proof-of-concept work, and then we have the option
to take it up. And we really -- it's exciting, it's an off-the-shelf umbilical cord with a completely new MOA.
So that's the drivers behind that one.

Our final question today is coming from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer.

Jay Olson
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Thanks to Mike Booth for all his help over the years. Maybe just to continue on the theme of your LIMBER
program. I appreciate the progress there. And I was wondering if you could provide any details on your
BET inhibitor. And what level of incremental benefit for the combination of BET inhibitor plus RUX versus
RUX alone would be clinically meaningful on SVR35 and TSS?

Steven H. Stein
Executive VP & Chief Medical Officer

Yes, Jay, it's Steven. Thanks for the question. So just a reminder, this is not a new compound. It's a
compound we had in the clinic years ago. We dosed more than 100 patients in a very solid tumor mind
frame at the time. We were trying to drive M1c inhibition with our BET inhibitor, and we treated, as I
said, north of 100 patients. We had adequate inhibition, but we had a lot of on target toxicity in terms of
thrombocytopenia and not much efficacy in solid tumors. So we put that program on hold or on the shelf,
so to speak. And then obviously, the externally, the field evolved, CPI-0610 showed data as monotherapy
in MF patients in second-line setting and then in combination with RUX in the first-line setting that we
think has an interesting signal.

So we reinvigorated our program. It's up and open now for enrollment. And the idea is this calendar year,
in the first half, hopefully, COVID behaves, but is to get monotherapy safety, and then in the second half
of this year, get the combination safety with RUX with our own BET inhibitor and then potentially go ahead
with pivotal studies. You ask how does it differentiate? So we were able with the external data to model a
completely different dosing scheme from our prior one. We had about 1/3 to 1/4 of the dose who were in
the clinic before. We've looked at the external environment, and we think that will weave the therapeutic
ratio in terms of effect because we know it's effective in MF with our own data preclinically as well and
then not have unacceptable rates of thrombocytopenia. But it's not a different BET inhibitor in any way in
terms of targeting otherwise. And then we'll make bigger decisions once we have the safety data at the
end of this calendar year.
