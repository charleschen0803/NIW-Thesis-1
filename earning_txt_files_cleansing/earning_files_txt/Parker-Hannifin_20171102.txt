Yeah
I think just piggy backing off Tom and maybe to give you a little added commentary on the different segments, it will continue to move in the direction we expected from the last call and order entry was really broad based and all regions participated
Maybe just walking through one of the segments just because I know the question will come up, I will start with Aerospace and then I will work my way into the Industrial markets
Aerospace did fall short of our regular expectations for Q1, but we're still forecasting growth for the year
Just breaking that down, I'd say on the headwind side, it's clearly commercial OEM was negative for us
It really was impacted by a mix of different platforms being manufactured with different [varying] amounts of content for us
But we do see that to close the gap as the fiscal year goes on
We see it being slightly negative for the year but not by much
Commercial MRO was slightly negative for us for the quarter, but we really look at this primarily as timing
All the underpinnings of a strong MRO market are still in place and we expect growth in that market as we move through the fiscal year
And then the last headwind would be military OEM was soft
Again we see this really as timing, F-35 production will continue to accelerate as the year goes on and we're confident in that market
I'd say the positive was really strong military MRO growth which put some provisioning for new platforms and then just an increase in spares for some of the fleets being used today
So that's kind of a high level on Aerospace
On Industrial, as we look through our end markets and we have a heat map by region, it's really hard to find any significant market a natural positive year-over-year order entry growth during the quarter
Really just to highlight some of those markets, if you talk about natural resource end markets we continue to see growth during the quarter
This would include agriculture in some areas but mostly construction equipment, mining very strong, oil and gas land based North America continues to be strong
I'll talk more about that in a second
Micro electronics industry is really broad based and strong
And Class A truck in North America very strong
Just a little bit about oil and gas
Rigs have nearly doubled since last year, although some did come out
But really all these rigs are coming out of cold storage and they're all being refurbished which is great for our distribution base
And we also see an appreciable pick up in quotes and order entry activities
So that continues to be very good
We're also continuing [to see] rebound activity from our distributor partners around the world
They're very optimistic
I think one of the telltale signs for me when I talk to our distributor partners, when they see an increase in project activity from end customers, that's a real sign for us that capital is starting to be a lot loose in the economy and they've all seen an increase in project work
It's not just strictly MRO work
I'd say the only notable end markets we saw around the globe, was really in power generation
This really has to do with the mix of turbines being applied today and in marine
And then just real quickly on some regional commentary
I talked about North America but we're very encouraged by the increasing end market activity
I talked about the natural resource end markets and our distributor base been very positive across the country
EMEA we continue to see strong year-over-year order entry growth
And we are forecasting a second year of organic growth for EMEA which is -- we feel really good about
And then Tom mentioned on Asia, very strong
China continues to lead with strong industrial and natural resources end markets
And then really the strength of China from our opinion has been led by continued infrastructure investment and the strong housing market
So I would just say we're encouraged by what's happening with our end markets both domestically and internationally and really there is just a very strong clear positive global sentiment to growth right now
Joe this is Lee
I would say last quarter we talked about a little bit of a rebound in inventory build at the distribution level
I will characterize at the distribution level and at the OEM level right now, it feels like end market pull through for the most part
People have reacted to the rapid increase in order entry and as a general statement I would say its end market pull through
Joe, its Lee, I mean the net is no
We have seen some commodity inflations such as copper, but really where we have that is an issue where we have a lot of exposure
We have got contracts with our customers that it hits a certain level we pass that through
So that's the only really volatile one that I can think of, the others are up year-over-year but they are kind of flattened out
David its Lee
I would say on price costs going back to the guidance we gave
We're expecting a positive separation -- our selling price index, we forecast it ever year
We expect that to be mildly positive for the year and we expect a separation between that and our purchase price index
So we're not forecasting any wild acceleration in pricing in the second half of the year
Andy it's Lee
So anytime we have a ramp like this it was obviously noise
But there is nothing that I would consider to be abnormal
It's everything that we're managing through
So there is nothing I would strike out
And there is, really no components that I could strike out that are really causing us major problems right now
This has been a key --this is Lee talking
This has been a key initiative for us as a prior refresh of our new Win Strategy
And we've got some really senior dedicated people working on this around the globe
We've had great progress throughout Asia, Southeast Asia and continued progress in EMEA and really developing parts of EMEA, the Middle East and Africa and developing parts of Europe
So bottom line is we're making great progress
I think you see that reflected in our sales and in our margins
So obviously there is a lot of that activity going and this Lee
But it's not the only thing going on
So I mean just -- I think the point I try to make when I survey our partners, the really one plus for me is, there is just a lot of pick up in project work happening out there in the field, which, I flow that through to just CapEx being let go with some of these major companies out there and they are working on that, so for me that's a big plus happening
So I can tell you that the activity right now is still good, with a lot of the -- with the work going on in mining, oil and gas, but it's not the only thing that's happening
