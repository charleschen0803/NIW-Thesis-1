through the company's Investor Relations website.

Following the earnings conference call, an audio archive of the call will be available through May 11, 2021.
U.S. callers may access the audio archive toll-free by dialing 1 (877) 344-7529. International callers may
listen by dialing 1 (412) 317-0088. The access code for the replay is 10155150. The audio webcast archive
will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website at ir.amwater.com/events.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.

Edward D. Vallejo
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. And at the
end of our prepared remarks, as usual, we will open the call up for your questions.

Now during this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may
make forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or
other future events. These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations, estimates
and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they're subject to numerous
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially
different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these
risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important
information is provided in the earnings release in our May 3, 2021 Form 10-Q, each as filed with the SEC.

Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information related to O&M efficiency ratio and return on equity can
be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide deck for this call. Also, this slide deck has
been posted to our Investor Relations page of our website. All statements in this call related to earnings
and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. And for purposes of the anchor
year on long-term EPS growth guidance, the anchor is weather-adjusted 2020 EPS of $3.84.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Walter Lynch.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before we move to quarter results, let me
speak for a moment about our recent growth news. As you know, a key part of our strategy is to operate
in states where we can best serve customers, drive efficiencies and continue to grow our regulated
business.

Recall that earlier in the year, we announced the sale of our Michigan operation. And as you know, in late
2019, we announced the sale of our New York operation. This slide shows what our new regulated service
territory will look like after the announced transactions are completed.

Moving to Slide 6. We recently announced what will be the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania
American Water's history. On April 6, we signed an agreement to acquire the wastewater treatment and
collection system for the City of York, Pennsylvania. This agreement will add an equivalent customer
connection total of more than 45,000. As part of the agreement, Pennsylvania American Water will
also continue to provide contracted wholesale wastewater treatment and disposal for 7 surrounding
communities of York. We look forward to developing strong relationships that meet the needs of all
customers, including those outside the city.

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

This is yet another example of our strategy to grow where we can add value. It was also executed under
Act 12 of 2016, which allows municipalities to sell their water and wastewater systems for a price-based
on the fair market value of the facilities. York Mayor, Michael Helfrich said, "This is a new day for York, one
filled with an unwavering optimism as our residents and businesses can finally breathe the sign of relief for
the first time in decades."

Turning to Slide 7. New Jersey American Water announced an agreement during the first quarter to
acquire the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City, New Jersey. This municipally owned water
and wastewater system serves approximately 3,000 customer connections. The agreement is notable
and is the first sale being executed through New Jersey's Water Infrastructure Protection Act, or WIPA.
That law facilitates the sale or lease of municipally owned water or wastewater systems that meet certain
criteria, such as significant noncompliance. Egg Harbor City Major Lisa Jiampetti said, "This sale will mean
better infrastructure, stable water rates and millions in funds for the city."

Additionally, Virginia American Water signed an agreement to acquire the drinking water assets
at the town of Waverly. This municipally owned water system serves approximately 900 customer
connections and is our first agreement signed under the new fair market value legislation in the Virginia
commonwealth.

To date this year, we've added approximately 4,500 customer connections through closed acquisitions
and organic growth. We have under agreement more than 86,000 customer connections, including the
City of York. In total, the acquisitions closed so far this year, and all those under agreement represent
approximately $440 million in additional rate base and an estimated $115 million of follow-on additional
capital expenditures over the next 5 years. And our growth pipeline remains strong with more than 1.2
million customer connection opportunities.

Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on the sale of New York American water. In late March 2021, the New
York State Department of Public Service Special Council released the findings of their municipalization
study. As expected, the study focused primarily on the need for tax relief for customers, including
recommendations to eliminate the special franchise tax. The study also focused on the feasibility of
municipalization. These findings were not addressed in the governor's recently released budget.

Our New York subsidiary continues to work constructively with the New York State Department of Public
Service, including through ongoing settlement discussions with all parties. And we remain confident that
the sale will be completed. We're working diligently to close the transaction.

Assuming progress continues as expected, we believe that the net impact from New York results on 2021
results won't impact our 2021 guidance range. Further, we don't anticipate any impact on the expected
timing of our previously discussed future equity needs.

Let's move to Slide 8 and cover our first quarter results. Our first quarter 2021 earnings per share of
$0.73 were up 7.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We invested capital of $342 million in the
first quarter as we continue to balance that investment by focusing on operating and capital efficiencies,
constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business. As a reminder,
we've challenged ourselves with a new O&M efficiency target of 30.4% by 2025.

With this strong start to 2021 and continued execution of our strategies, we're affirming today our 2021
earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28 per share. We are also affirming our long-term EPS compound
annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range.

Turning to Slide 9. Let's go through some of the regulatory and legislative highlights in the first quarter
of 2021. In February, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved a previously
filed settlement agreement between Pennsylvania American Water and the PUC Bureau of Investigation
and Enforcement. The request was driven by $1.64 billion of investment from 2019 through 2022.
Pennsylvania American Water was authorized additional annualized revenues of $90 million over a 2-year
period, excluding an agreed to reduction in revenues for tax savings passed back to customers as a result
of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

On April 7, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved an agreement reached by the parties in
Missouri American Water request for a rate adjustment. The rate order includes approximately $620
million in water and wastewater system improvements made since the end of 2017. Rates will be effective
on May 28, 2021, and will result in additional annualized water and wastewater revenue of $22 million,
excluding the reduction in revenue for tax savings passed back to customers, also a result of TCJA.

We also have a pending rate case in Iowa, which is moving on schedule. And we filed a rate case in West
Virginia on April 30.

Additionally, as we've reported previously, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The
case covers 2021 through 2023. In January 2021, California America Water submitted to the commission
a comprehensive settlement with the public advocates office and several interveners. If the global
settlement is adopted by the commission without changes, revenues will increase by $33.5 million over
3 years, with agreed capital investments of $165 million in 2021 and 2022. And just yesterday, California
American Water filed its cost of capital application with the commission. As part of the application,
California American Water requested an authorized cost of equity of 10.75%, cost of debt of 4.35% and
overall rate of return of 8%, which is sufficient to provide California American Water with the opportunity
to earn a reasonable return on its investments. The case covers 2022 through 2024, with the revised cost
of capital to be effective January 1, 2022.

Regarding the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. As a reminder, California American Water refiled
its application to the Coastal Commission on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the Coastal
Commission sent a notice requesting additional information needed to consider the application complete.
In March 2021, California American Water provided the requested responses. And once staff deemed the
application complete, by statute, the Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process it.

Moving to state legislation on Slide 10. We continue to see states take action to help address water and
wastewater challenges. In Kentucky, the governor signed into law new acquisition adjustment legislation.
This law allows systems to be acquired above net book value when certain criteria are met. The law also
establishes a time line for a PSC decision on an acquisition, which is within 60 to 150 days of application
approval.

In Indiana, there are 2 pieces of legislation that have been signed into law that will benefit our current and
future customers. Act 1287 creates a mechanism that reduces the required upfront cost to new customers
for water and wastewater utility to extend service to underserved areas. And Act 349 establishes a tax
writer for water and wastewater utilities based upon any change in state or federal income tax law.

On the national level, we're pleased to see that water and wastewater infrastructure is included in both
the administration's build back better plan as well as introduced in state -- or federal legislation. There
continues to be a significant need to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, not just within our
system, but broadly across the United States. We think the proposed funding to state revolving funds
for drinking water and the possible expansion of a water light-heat program would directly benefit our
customers. The administration's plan also includes a tax package, and Susan will talk about that in a
moment.

Moving to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart
investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending
March 31, 2021, our O&M efficiency ratio was 34.1%, a decrease from 34.5% for the 12-month period
ended March 31, 2020.

As we note each quarter, our adjusted O&M expenses are slightly higher today than they were in 2010.
Since then, we've added approximately 327,000 customer connections, while expenses only increased at a
compound annual growth rate of 1.1%.

Before I turn the call over to Susan, let me cover a few additional items. You may have seen in our 10-Q,
a discussion around a matter related to HOS. And likely, you saw a note from a rating agency commenting
on that disclosure. As noted in the 10-Q, I want to remind you that this is a matter that relates to a
subpoena received by AWR, an American Water subsidiary that operates a portion of HOS. The subpoena

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

seeks information related only to HOS' metropolitan New York City operations. As we noted in the 10-Q,
AWR is cooperating fully with the investigation. And while it's impossible to predict the outcome at this
point, we do not believe it will result in any material impact to our overall operations or financial results.

As a final note on the business, I'd like to congratulate Mark McDonough, who was recently named
President of New Jersey American Water; and Steve Curtis, who will replace Mark as President of our
Military Services Group. These are great examples of how we build and leverage the deep bench strength
of American Water. Both Mark and Steve have had increasing roles of responsibility throughout their
careers in American Water and are models of our values.

And I'll end with a thank you to our employees for their continued response to COVID-19. We continue
to execute our preparedness plans as we look to reintegrate those employees who have been working
remotely. As always, safety is our top priority. This past March, we were very pleased that it was our
first month in our history where no OSHA recordable incidents occur throughout our entire company. Our
commitment to 0 injuries and incidents will continue because no injury is ever acceptable to us.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Susan now.

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Walter. And let's start on Slide 13 with a bit more detail on results. As Walter highlighted, first
quarter 2021 earnings were $0.73 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
Results for the regulated business segment were $0.74 per share, an increase of $0.06 per share,
primarily driven by continued growth from infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth.
Results for the market-based business were $0.09 per share, a decrease of $0.03 per share as we saw
an increase in claims in the homeowner services group due largely to weather-related events. Current
company results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in
2020.

Moving on to Slide 14. Regulated results increased $0.06 per share, as I said. We saw a $0.19 per
share increase in revenues from new rates in effect as well as earnings from acquisitions. O&M expense
increased by $0.08 per share and somewhat offsetting with an increase in depreciation of $0.05 per share
in support of growth in the business.

As previously mentioned, the market-based business results increased -- or decreased $0.03 per share in
the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of '20. The lower results were due to increased
claims expense, which was driven by extreme cold weather, primarily in Texas and Illinois and the
continuation of stay-at-home activities, as we saw throughout most of 2020 due to the pandemic.

The parent results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of
last year. The improved results were largely driven by a number of small items that increased expenses in
the first quarter of 2020, offset by higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business.

While I'm on the subject of results, I'd also like to discuss the company's lower effective income tax rate
in the quarter. This was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess accumulated deferred
income taxes from the settlement of general rate cases in New Jersey and Pennsylvania that approved
the timing and method by which the excess deferred taxes are returned to customers. The increased
amortization of excess deferred taxes lowers tax expense and is largely offset dollar-for-dollar with lower
revenue, resulting in no impact to earnings.

We will continue to see this impact and the resulting lower effective tax rate as the amortization
continues in these states and others as similar provisions are put in place. And as a reminder, the excess
accumulated deferred income taxes resulted from the federal rate being lowered from 35% to 21% as part
of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as Walter mentioned.

Moving on to Slide 15. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element
of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. To date, the regulated businesses have received
$123 million in annualized new revenues in 2021. This includes $92 million from the Pennsylvania and the

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Missouri rate cases discussed earlier, excluding the agreed reduction in revenues for tax savings passed
back to customers and $31 million from infrastructure surcharges. In addition, the Pennsylvania rate case
includes a second step increase of $20 million effective January 2022.

We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases, totaling an annualized revenue
request of $61 million. And as Walter mentioned, we are also closely following President Biden's tax
proposal and evaluating the impact that the current proposal would have on our long-term growth
strategy. While there are many proposed provisions that need further analysis, our early indications are
that there will be minimal impact to our plan.

And finally, moving on to Slide 16. On April 28, 2021, our Board of Directors increased the company's
quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.55 to $0.6025 per share. We continue to be a top leader in
dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% over the
last 5 years, significantly outpacing our peers in the Dow Jones utility average and the Philadelphia Utility
Index. We expect to continue our dividend growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range, as we know
that, that is very important to many of our shareholders.

Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. As this quarter's results
demonstrate we continue to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment, regulatory execution,
along with the results from our market-based businesses allows us to continue that performance. We
believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth
expectation provides excellent value for our shareholders as we continue to outperform our peers.

And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for a few closing remarks.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Susan. Before we move on to your questions, April, we were very proud to issue our first annual
inclusion and diversity report. This report highlights the efforts we've undertaken and the strides we've
made advancing our commitment to inclusion and diversity. ESG is a journey, and our IND report is
another way that shows how we're constantly striving, thanks to the contributions of every employee to
build an inclusive and mutually respectful workplace.

To launch this report internally, we were honored to have Mr. Earvin Magic Johnson joining us virtually for
conversation on inclusion, diversity and allyship. Additionally, we had an incredible community healing
discussion with our employees to provide a chance for even more open and honest dialogue and inclusion.
We believe that a company strength is its people, and the diversity of our workforce makes us even
stronger.
With that, we're happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just I have a couple here. First, Walter, just to clarify, the New York American sale process, I know a lot of
moving pieces, but are we still targeting this year close, is that the current plan?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's right, Durgesh. We're still working through with -- as I said in prepared remarks, still working
through with staff and others. And we're hoping to be expecting this year.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. And then just on the subpoena, can I just clarify that this is related to specifically homeowner
services within American Water Resources business and the information that you might be sharing, is that
just New York specific? Or are there other states involved in the subpoena?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's specific to our New York City metropolitan operations in HOS. That's exactly right, Durgesh.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And obviously, there's no set time line here as to how this matter gets resolved.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

No. Not at this point. Again, we continue to work and cooperate in investigation.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Understood. Just 1 big picture then, Walter, just your thoughts on the Biden sort of the America jobs
plan. They talk about several hundred billion dollars of investment on lead and then water and wastewater
assets. What are the implications to your existing business and then just your regulated acquisition growth
strategy?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Durgesh, let me start with we're really happy that the administration is focusing on water and
wastewater as part of the infrastructure plan. So we like the attention that the industry is getting. And we
think that the plan will benefit our customers, primarily by having access to low-interest financing that's
part of the plan. And so we want to -- we access it right now on the water side. We want to get access
on the wastewater side. That's a growing segment of our business, and we want our customers to benefit
like others from the low-interest loans. So overall, we're very excited about the program, and we want to
participate like the municipalities doing the wastewater side.

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Perfect. And just -- does it -- how does -- I mean does it increase your sort of footprint on the regulated
acquisition side? Or does this sort of -- since there'd be a lot of aid given to sort of systems across the
country, does it derail your regulated acquisition growth strategy? How would you sort of characterize
that?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Well, there's -- as we've said, and I've said in my remarks, there's significant needs out there in the water
and wastewater side. For us, it's not going to change our plan. Our pipeline continues to grow. We're going
to continue to provide meaningful solutions for communities, and we're committed to our plan, and we
don't see any change to our plan going forward.

Operator

And the next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe to kick things off after Durgesh's question here. Can I follow-up and ask you guys about your latest
thinking on the administration just around PFAS regulations, hazardous determinations there and just --
obviously, there's a lot of different pieces that could move here. And any at least preliminary thoughts on
where things could go and, more specifically, how that could impact your business?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Julien, thanks for the question. We think there's going to be a lot more focus on PFAS in this
administration. I know they formed a task force. I believe it was last week to look at what are the next
steps to establish an MCL. Right now, there's a health advisory limit of 70 parts per trillion, and we
think that there's going to be a lot more focus on it. So we'll have to wait and see. But the EPA is really
science driven. And they want to make sure it's based on science. And I think there's going to be a coming
together of the science and the need to establish an MCL. And we look forward to participating and
working with the administration to establish that.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And hazardous determination, that's just part of the broader context here, right?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

That's right. That's all part of this work that's going to be going on.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. All right. Excellent. And then I suppose a little bit more nuanced here. As you think about the
impacts here in the quarter on the non -- the market-based business here, you're probably still broadly
within plan on the year and have some offsets. Just can you speak to that?

Obviously, the payouts and the warranties, et cetera, obviously, elevated here. Just if you can speak to
that a little bit on the offsets, et cetera, and how you're tracking.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. With the HOS business, we're seeing higher claims on the wastewater side. People are spending more
time in their homes, and that's causing apparently additional breaks that we're having to repair. And then
on the partnership side, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in those partnerships. Yet we still have a

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

really good pipeline of opportunities. But those are the 2 areas I think that have been somewhat impacted
by the pandemic and our business going forward.

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

Julien, I might just add on that point. In addition to what Walter said, we did see a little bit higher claims
in the quarter from these weather-related events. We did see some water claims, particularly in Texas,
Illinois and a few other parts of the country really driven by the extreme weather that occurred. And we
would expect, of course, that to now sort of be over. Some of the wastewater claims that Walter is talking
about as long as we continue this a bit more to stay at home, we may see elevated claims there. But I
think the exposure to the weather related, we've isolated in this quarter.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. So how do you think about that relative to the full year? I mean, obviously, the wastewater
continues a little bit elevated, just offsets, et cetera, probably not to be material, right?

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

It's really not too material. No. I mean we saw roughly $0.01 or so of that impact related to the state-at-
home activities in this quarter. And as you can see across the country, states are starting to loosen up. So
there'll be some return. So I certainly think we'll see this start to mitigate. And in any event, we don't see
it as material for the year.

Operator

And our next question is from [ Nigel Kim ] of Goldman Sachs.

Unknown Analyst

Just a couple for me. The first one, with the recently announced Pennsylvania, New Jersey transactions.
How do you think about potential cadence and magnitude of the equity guidance that you gave at the
Analyst Day, just thinking through '21, '22, if it's going to be split up? Or are we still assuming kind of a
bulk number in 1 year?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Well, first, let me talk about the growth, and we're really excited for these 2 acquisitions in our 2 biggest
states. It's all part of what we're doing and providing solutions for communities with the City of York on
the wastewater side and then Egg Harbor City. In the first WIPA, that's really important, is the first WIPA
acquisition. And we're hopeful many other communities are going to see the benefits of that and continue
to sell their systems to New Jersey American Water and Pennsylvania American Water. But it's really about
providing meaningful solutions.

And again, as we've talked about having consolidated tariffs and the ability to spread those costs across
a big customer base, over 700,000 customer connections, really helps those communities to mitigate and
minimize customer bill impacts. So that's a competitive advantage of ours. It's part of our strategy to
make sure these communities understand the value that we can bring to them through investment. And
I wanted to spotlight the follow-on investment and how significant that is to our growth and to providing
solutions for communities. So we're really excited about these 2 acquisitions and how they're going to play
into future growth in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

And then maybe let me just comment on the equity needs because that was a follow-on part of your
question, I think. When we built our plan and laid out our financing plan over the 5 years, we anticipated

an increase in our growth from acquisition, and we reflected that at Analyst Day. Now whether or not
we've identified these specific transactions, it's a different question. But we had anticipated a step-up in
growth and built our plan accordingly. So long answer to your question, I don't see any change from these
specific acquisitions that we've now highlighted, any change to our equity financing timing or any of other
our financing plans over the course of the 5 years.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. Just from a timing perspective, is there a possibility that we could see some of that equity in the
'21 time frame? Or is it more beyond '21?

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

No. It's beyond '21. At Analyst Day, I think we indicated that it's still -- it's about $700 million of equity
in the 5 years, and it's still roughly in sort of the middle of that 5-year time frame. So no. No, I would not
anticipate anything in 2021.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. And then my second question, I guess, maybe for Walter is obviously, these 2 acquisitions in states
that have a favorable systems in place for such growth. With the pending New York sale and then the
recently announced Michigan divestiture as well, when you just look across your footprint in the different
states, you don't have to name any, but are there opportunities to potentially monetize some of the other
states to concentrate more on the jurisdictions that offer the better systems for organic and inorganic
growth?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We do a constant assessment of where we're operating, where can we provide the best value for
customers and where can we grow our systems, and we'll continue to evaluate our footprint. But we're
really happy where we are right now, and we continue to grow. If you look at our pipeline, we're growing.
We have 8 states where we have 32 agreements. So it's not just in 1 or 2 or 3 states, it's really across our
footprint. And we'll continue to provide solutions again for communities across our footprint.

Next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just a question on the -- Walter, on the disclosure of this subpoena in homeowner services. I guess
it doesn't say, I think, in your release, just if the company has done its own investigation and if they
determined anything was done wrong? Do you have any color or information on that?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Steve. And given that it's an ongoing investigation, we really can't comment any more on it other
than what we have in the disclosure.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. All right. And then Walter, on your year-end call, you had kind of hinted at a larger acquisition or
more growth coming in your tuck-in acquisitions and the like. Should I assume that was the York deal that
ended up officially getting announced? Or is that still kind of relevant for something else?

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2021

Well, let me approach you from this. We continue to build our pipeline. We continue to, again, provide
solutions for communities. And if you look over the last year, we've almost doubled our pipeline. We've
done the biggest acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history. So we're going to keep doing much
of the same, Steve.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. And then just on the New York American sale, if I understood you correctly, it sounds like
neither your forecast nor your equity timing should be impacted at all by whatever happens with the
outcome of the sale.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's correct, Steve.

[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Richard Sunderland, JPMorgan.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just maybe following up on that last point real quick. The sale timing would it impact, I guess, where you
land within the range of your '21 guidance? Or phrased differently, you have some timing assumption
associated with close presumably baked in, can you disclose what that assumption is and what a quarter
or 2 difference may do to where you lay into the range?

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

Rich, it's Susan. Probably not going to add much more detail to that. I would just echo what Walter said in
his prepared remarks and in his answered a minute ago. We just don't see having any impact on 2021.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Fair enough. And then just separately, curious, at a high level in terms of your O&M efficiency ratio, what
impacts you've seen on your efforts there over the past year under the pandemic and what that may
mean for sort of progress in efficiencies going forward as we reopen.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's been a big focus for us, as you know, Rich, and we're going to continue to focus on every area
of our business where we can drive efficiencies. We've improved it from 34.5% to 34.1%, as I said in
my remarks, and we're confident that we can hit our goal in 2025 at 30.4%. So we're going to continue
to do the things that we've been doing, focusing on technology, leveraging our supply chain and really
leveraging our culture of looking for every dollar that we can save and continue to provide the service that
our customers expect. So that's the journey we're on. We're going to continue to execute on that. And
we're confident in our goal in 2025.

Our next question comes from Verity Mitchell of HSBC.

Verity Mitchell
HSBC, Research Division

I've just got another couple of high-level questions about geography, which is something I'm always
interested in. When I look at your coverage across so many states, does the Biden proposal change the

view of your opportunities across states? I mean, you've already said that it's not going to change your
growth trajectory, but any nuance there and also, in terms of what we see in terms of major regulatory
mechanisms in states now that you would like to see?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Verity, Walter here. Yes, the administration's proposed plan does not change our outlook at all
on acquisitions. Again, we continue to build our pipeline of opportunities. We're providing meaningful
solutions. And really, when you look at the size of our business, how long we've been in business since
1886 and the expertise that we have and the ability to share costs across the customer base, we bring
tremendous value to communities. And they realize that, and that's why they're talking to us about
potentially selling their water and wastewater systems.

Verity Mitchell
HSBC, Research Division

Yes. So I just wanted to know whether the states in which you're active, the Biden proposals create new
opportunities in particular states?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

I'm not sure it would create new opportunities. The great thing is it really talks about water and
wastewater, where before, we were always left out. And I think there's a realization in this country that
there's so much fragmentation and so many improvements that need to be made that the private sector,
American Water, can play a really integral role in moving that forward. And that's what we're excited
about.

Verity Mitchell
HSBC, Research Division

Right. And so what's missing in this -- what would you like to see that's missing in terms of fair value or
infrastructure surcharges? What's missing there...

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We continue to work with states. Yes. And we continue to work with states on fair market value
legislation. As I said, Kentucky is now the 11th state within our footprint to have fair market value
legislation. It's really an affirmation of the value that we provide and the -- I think the recognition of the
legislatures and the governor is that they want us to play a role in consolidating the market and adding
our expertise to many of these small systems that don't quite have the expertise. So we do have in the
appendix an overview of fair market value by state and the specific parts of it, fair market value. So refer
to that, and you can see, again, 11 out of our 16 states have fair market value legislation. And we're going
to continue to work with states that don't have it and continue to work to tell our story about the value we
can provide.
