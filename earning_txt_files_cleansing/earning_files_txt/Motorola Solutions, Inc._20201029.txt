MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and thank you for holding. Welcome to the Motorola Solutions' Third Quarter 2020
Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at
this time.

The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions
Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 3 hours after
the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may
begin your conference.

Tim Yocum
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg
Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice
President, Products and Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Software and Services. Greg and
Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.

We posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials
include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we will reference non-
GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.

A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion
of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to
a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking
statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings
news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2019
annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any
duty to update any forward-looking statement.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about
the overall business before Jason takes us through our Q3 results and outlook.

First, I'm proud of the team, and I'm pleased with our results and execution in these challenging times.
During the quarter, we achieved both revenue and earnings per share above the guidance we provided
in August, driven by growth in video security, command center software and services. Additionally, we
generated $392 million of operating cash flow and strengthened our portfolio by closing the acquisitions of
Pelco, a leader in fixed video security solutions; and Callyo, a cloud-based SaaS mobile apps provider for
law enforcement.

Second, our Software and Services segment continues to perform well. During the quarter, the segment
grew revenue 9%, expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and generated over half of the
operating earnings for the company. We were also awarded the largest command center software order in
our history, a $120 million-plus next-generation 911 multiyear contract.

And finally, while the environment with COVID certainly remains fluid, I'm encouraged by the
improvements we saw in many areas of our business during the quarter. Orders for body-worn cameras

were up significantly year-over-year. Sales of fixed video to our government customers were strong, and
we saw improved demand from both our public safety LMR and PCR customers versus Q2.

I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some
final thoughts.

Jason J. Winkler
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Greg. Q3 results included revenue of $1.9 billion, down 6% from a year ago, including $55
million from acquisitions. GAAP operating earnings of $352 million and operating margins of 18.9% of
sales compared to 20.7% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $463 million, down
$46 million, and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.8%, down from 25.5% in the year ago quarter, due to
lower sales and gross margin contribution in the Products and SI segment, partially offset by higher sales,
higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in Software and Services.

GAAP operating earnings per share were $1.18 compared to $1.51 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP
EPS of $1.95 versus $2.04 last year, primarily due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment, partially
offset by higher sales, gross margin and improved operating leverage in Software and Services.

OpEx in Q3 was $455 million, down $49 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary
spend and incentives, partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q3 effective tax rate was 20%
compared to 23% in the year prior, a change driven primarily by higher R&D credits and a favorable U.S.
Federal return to provision adjustment recorded in the third quarter.

Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $392 million compared with $525 million in the prior
year, and free cash flow was $343 million compared with $465 million in the year prior. The decrease in
cash flow was primarily due to lower sales. Capital allocation for Q3 included $181 million for acquisitions,
$109 million in cash dividends, $105 million of share repurchases and $49 million of CapEx. Additionally,
during the quarter, we refinanced upcoming debt maturities with a new $900 million 10-year debt issuance
at a rate of 2.3%. And finally, we repaid $400 million against our revolving credit facility, of which $300
million was repaid during the quarter and $100 million subsequent to quarter end. We expect to repay the
remaining $100 million balance by year-end.

Moving to segment results. Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, down 14%,
driven by a decline in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security. Operating
earnings were $219 million or 18.9% of sales, down 330 basis points from last year, primarily due to lower
sales. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the segment include a $44 million P25 order with a
large U.S. Federal customer, a $28 million P25 order for the state of Wyoming, a $28 million P25 order
for the State of Wyoming, a $20 million P25 order for the State of North Carolina, a $19 million TETRA
order for a large international transportation customer. And we saw strong growth in fixed video sales to
government customers during the quarter.

Moving to our Software and Services segment. Revenue was $705 million, up 9% from last year, driven by
growth in both services and software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million. Operating
earnings were $244 million or 34.6% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales,
gross margin and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q3 wins in the segment include an over
$120 million next-generation 911 multiyear contract, a $19 million body-worn and in-car video multiyear
as a service contract in North America and an $18 million P25 multiyear services contract with Seminole
County, Florida. Additionally, we received strong orders for body-worn cameras, launched our PremierOne
cloud software suite and closed the acquisition of Callyo, a cloud-based SaaS mobile application provider
for law enforcement.

Looking at regional results. North America Q3 revenue was $1.3 billion, down 6% due to declines in public
safety LMR and professional and commercial radio, partially offset by growth in services, video security
and software. International Q3 revenue was $600 million, down 8%, primarily due to decline in public
-- professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR, partially offset by growth in services, video

security and software. Sales grew in Europe, while Latin America declined on continued challenges from
COVID-19.

Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.7 billion, down $361 million compared to last year, driven by
revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by growth in North America and
$81 million of favorable currency rates. Sequentially, backlog was up $174 million, driven by growth in
North America and $93 million of favorable currency rates.

Software and Services backlog was down $44 million or 1% compared to last year, due to revenue
recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by growth in North America multiyear
agreements and $74 million of favorable currency rates. Sequentially, backlog was up $138 million or 2%
due to growth in North America and $83 million of favorable currency.

Products and SI segment backlog was down $317 million or 10% compared to last year, primarily due to
large international deployments and COVID-19 delaying some sales engagements. Sequentially, backlog
was up $36 million or 1%, driven primarily by international.

Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be down between 6% and 5.5% with non-GAAP EPS
between $2.71 and $2.76 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of 175 million
shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. For the full year, we now expect sales to be down
approximately 7 -- 6.5%, up from our prior guidance of a 7% decline with non-GAAP EPS between $7.52
and $7.58, up from our prior guidance of $7.40 to $7.52. And our outlook for operating cash flow is now
approximately $1.55 billion, up $50 million from our previous guidance, driven by higher earnings and
improvements in working capital.

I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Jason. And let me just end with a few thoughts. First, I'm very pleased with the progress we're
making in our command center software business. Our command center software suite now covers the
entire mission-critical workflow, from 911 intake to case closure and management. It's a $500 million
business which has been growing consistently and improving its profitability while also transitioning
towards the SaaS model.

Just this month, we announced our PremierOne cloud suite, which includes fully functional CAD and
mobile and record solutions available on the secure Azure government cloud. So this means we now
can provide our customers the flexibility of deploying their software either on-prem or in a fully featured
cloud deployment. Currently, we have over 3,500 command center software customers, with over 500
of those using 2 or more components of the suite. In Q3, half of our new orders were from customers
further expanding into the suite, demonstrating this continued growth opportunity as customers embrace
integrated software to run their operations.

Second, the increased demand we're seeing for cloud solutions is not just in command center software.
Customers are increasingly seeing the benefits of the cloud across their entire workflow. In LMR, or
land mobile radio, we've launched our CirrusCentral cloud-based offerings for P25 networks that provide
remote management and backup core options for our radio customers. In video security, we launched
a video-as-a-service offering for body-worn cameras that includes our cloud-based digital evidence
management software as well as Avigilon cloud services, which now has over 4,000 ACC 7.X sites
connected to the cloud. All of these subscription-based offerings provide increased capabilities to our
customers and opportunities for us to grow recurring revenues.

And finally, through the global pandemic, natural disasters and civil unrest, our customers continued to
depend on and rely on our solutions as need to have, demonstrating the criticality of what we provide.
And our teams' and people's resilience in support of our customers around the world was nothing and is
nothing short of remarkable. Additionally, we were just recently recognized by The Wall Street Journal
as one of the world's most sustainably managed companies, ranking the sixth highest in the country. As

we move forward, we will continue to focus on supporting both our customers and our people while also
deploying the capital to drive growth and continued shareholder return.

And with that, Tim, I'll turn it back to you.

Tim Yocum
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse.

Ahmed Sami Badri
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congrats on the solid results in 3Q. I first wanted to ask about the $120 million 911 contract that you
guys signed. That was the highest in the company's history. And maybe 2 pieces to this. How will that
be recognized over time, is kind of like the first question. And then I know there's probably going to be
similar deals like this in the future, probably not at the same magnitude. But maybe could you give us a
little bit of an idea on how popular this type of specific large deal could potentially be in demand in the
medium to long term?

Kelly S. Mark
Executive Vice President of Software & Services

Sure. Sami, it's Kelly. So on the NGCS, I think I would say 3 things about it. First off, look, we're really
excited about that part of the business. It is the entry point for all 911 calls. And as I think I may have
referenced on a prior call, what that effectively does is it creates the ESInet multi-lane highway entry point
to 911 centers, where they can now handle video, audio, pictures, text versus the single-lane and highway
voice that they could handle before.

The second thing I'd say about this deal is when you think about it, this and other similar deals like that
will get on NGCS, there's always an installation component that's upfront, and then there's a longer tail of
as a service where we'll run the system for our customers. And that's similar to what we have here in the
multiyear contract.

The third thing I'd just remind you about around NGCS is while we have some of our own software and
componentry in it, we are also acting as a systems integrator. So we are, in effect, reselling backhaul and
other components as a offering for the entire solution, which is a bit different than what we do when -- in
our 911 call-taking software, our CAD software, where we are the entirety of the software solution. But
we're excited about this. We think that NGCS and ESInet is, I would call it, if you're looking at a 9-inning
baseball game, I think we're somewhere around maybe the second or third inning. So we're early in the
conversion of ESInet across the United States. So there's certainly other deals out there, and we'll just
continue to fight for those and update you on those as they come.

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

And Sami, this contract, $120 million plus, will be rev recognized over a multiyear long-term contract.

Ahmed Sami Badri
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And then, Greg, just one question for you. We still have the $9 billion of revenue and $10 of EPS
guidepost laid out for 2021. And obviously, COVID may have shifted this around a little bit. But I was
hoping if you could give us a little bit of an update around this guidepost or this framework and how we
should be thinking about what's to come in the medium to long term.

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, obviously, COVID was the ultimate disruptor. But what I would say is I'm pleased with the
momentum of how the business is performing. We talked about Q2 of this year, Sami, being a low point.
We would improve in Q3. We expect to improve in Q4. I think the print for this quarter reflects some of
that improvement. All I would say, look, I'm not going to guide 2021. I think that would be premature. But

MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

I would say, as we sit here today, and I don't have a crystal ball, I would expect us to grow and return to
overall revenue growth next year. And I would also expect us to grow in both segments for next year. But
again, we'll update you a quarter from now on the next earnings call.

Operator

Our next question is from George Notter of Jefferies.

George Charles Notter
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I was really interested in some of your comments, Greg, on the software business. I think you mentioned
a $500 million run rate at this point. Can you talk a little bit more about how that -- I would imagine that
run rate is getting cannibalized to some degree as you move customers from perpetual software licenses
to subscription. And can you talk about potential cannibalization on that revenue run rate or maybe talk
about the mixture of customers that are converting to subscription? Or anything you can that can give us
more insight in that transition.

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Sure, George. So the majority of the software revenue today is license revenue. Kelly and Andrew have
done a good job cloud enabling the suite. The only component left to cloud enable is records, which
will be done in the first half of 2021. So we're incrementally moving more and more customers to as a
service. But again, I think we're still going to be able to manage that transition from perpetual license
incrementally to more as a service without any major dislocation or disruption of top line revenue. Said
another way, you see that Software and Services will perform this year in the high single digits. And I
expect Software and Services in total in the segment and both subsegments, software and services, to
continue to grow in 2021 as well, even while we're transitioning those clients gradually to as a service. I
view that as a multiyear transition.

Kelly S. Mark
Executive Vice President of Software & Services

And George, the only thing I might add, it's Kelly, is the -- we're really excited about the command center
software suite we just announced, which now fully cloud enables CAD records and our mobile. But that's
in addition to already what we do in Aware. Our vast license plate recognition is as a service and also our
Kodiak part of our portfolio as well. The only part of the entirety of the -- of what we have that won't be
cloud enabled yet is our 911 call taking. That should happen in the first half of next year. And in addition
to that, we're excited about what we just did with Callyo, the acquisition we just did, which picks up a very
large customer base of folks that are using that mobile application, which is also an as a service part of
the portfolio.

George Charles Notter
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then one just quick housekeeping item. I didn't see it in the press release or the
presentation. But was there an FX impact on top line in the quarter? And can you tell us what that was?

Jason J. Winkler
Executive VP & CFO

It was pretty small.

Operator

Our next question today is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.

MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Hoping you'd shed a little bit of light on the ability to do sales this quarter. In terms of last quarter, I think
what we heard was a lot of challenges in terms of getting you to see the customers. How would -- did that
evolve over the third quarter? And is that a challenge going into the fourth quarter?

John P. Molloy
Executive Vice President of Products & Sales

Sure. Keith, it's Jack. Yes. So we saw sequential improvement in terms of our ability to engaging
customers. And just to kind of give you the geographic around the world, first of all, in North America, in
government, we've been able to engage in person with customers, and we've seen that manifest in terms
of increase in proposals and sequential increase in terms of our LMR business and, as Kelly pointed out,
command center and video.

In Europe, it's important to point out 55% of our revenue in Europe is recurring revenue. But we are
starting to see -- we saw certainly in Q3 both in the enterprise market and government the ability of our
customers to actually come and extend and meet us virtually. So that's been an improvement. Asia Pac,
same thing.

The one area of the world where we're having essentially locked down, continues to be locked down, and
we've got very much diminished expectations, is Latin America. But I would certainly say it's improved.
Been really proud of the resilience of the team in terms of use of video conferencing and really trying
to engage our customers and pull them along. We've been heavy in terms of virtual trade shows and
demonstrations. And as I said, in government, particularly in public safety, we engage with our customers
in person, masked up, et cetera.

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

And Keith, just one other anecdote I'd give you is we just completed, Kelly's team, the annual software
summit just a few days ago. We did it in person a year ago. We just completed the virtual multi-day
engagement just a few days ago, and attendance was literally double virtually. So I think Molloy's team
and Kelly's team and our customers, quite frankly, have been good in transitioning virtual engagement,
digital engagement, business continuity. It depends on the theater, as Jack referenced internationally. But
we've been able to navigate that much better than we were doing a quarter ago.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Got you. I appreciate that. And just as a follow-up there. In terms of -- changing gears, actually. In terms
of like FirstNet and Airwave, can you guys give us the latest on where LTE versus LMR kind of stands in
terms of around the world?

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

I think it -- the high-level answer is no change from the last time we spoke to you. 4G and ultimately as it
transitions here in North America to 5G, LTE or 5G is a complementary technology to mission-critical land
mobile radio. I think the awards that Winkler went through on state awards and upgrades, particularly in
state and local, reinforce and reference the criticality need-to-have dimensions of land mobile radio.

As it relates to Airwave, I think it's the same thing. We believe -- we remain in active discussions with the
customer, and we do have an expectation that, that Airwave contract will get another extension. But that
timing will be dictated largely by the customer. But again, I think LMR, LTE or if you want to substitute
that and say LMR/5G coexist. And quite frankly, we think the upgrade in faster speeds domestically and in
the U.K. are good for command center, good for our video security business and overall are a net positive.

Our next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.

MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Adam Tyler Tindle
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Greg, I just wanted to start with a question on margins. Between the 2 segments, it's been a little tale
of 2 cities. In Products and SI, that's been the drag on overall performance but probably the biggest
opportunity moving forward. So hoping you can maybe just walk through some of the moving parts to get
this segment back to the kind of 22% to 23% operating margin range from years past. Does revenue need
to get back above $5 billion? Are there things you can do from an OpEx standpoint and just the timing to
that?

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Adam, so kind of taking -- let's take a look at OpEx overall. For the full year, we'll remove about $250
million of OpEx out of this business this year, year-over-year. If you net that to include acquisitions, it's
a net $170 million reduction. So I think the team has moved quickly and done a good job on expense
structure, both structural and variable, to adapt to the COVID environment we got hit with a couple of
quarters ago. So think of OpEx for this year, all in, year-over-year being down net $170 million. About
approximately $100 million of that returns next year in the form of incentive compensation.

Operating margins for the 2 segments, we still expect Software and Services to be consistent with what
we told you last time with operating margins for the full year 2020 of being about 34%. Obviously, the
products segment declines this year given the top line volume decline. I expect the operating margins
obviously to improve with volume. And even though $100 million of OpEx returns next year, that, as we sit
here today, we'll always look to see if we can refine or further improve that cost structure. But that's kind
of a composite view.

Adam Tyler Tindle
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up. I'd imagine from a top line standpoint, one of the big drivers in that
segment is going to be the PCR business. If you could just -- maybe just update us on where that business
sits today and into 4Q so that we can kind of think about the opportunity moving forward into 2021 as it
potentially rebounds.

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think that PCR has been incrementally -- it clearly was an extreme low point in Q2. It's performed
a little bit better in Q3, and we expect it to improve a little bit better. That's informed into our overall Q4
guidance. PCR, as you know, has been hit with primarily the critical industries that's gotten slammed by
COVID the most, hospitality, entertainment, transportation, oil and gas. And quite frankly, I think that we
expect PCR to return to some form of growth in 2021, and that's, in part, what informs our expectations
for the products segment to return to growth as well.

It also might be worth noting that even in this environment, North America, which represents our largest
theater and is sold primarily through channels, the channel inventory in North America is down. So
that's a good -- that's another good indicator in terms of potential foundation for us to continue to print
improvement as time goes on.

John P. Molloy
Executive Vice President of Products & Sales

And maybe one other thing, Greg. Just historically, as we look at PCR, new product introduction, even in
challenging times, equates to growth. And we do have some product refresh on the slate for 2021 as well.

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. Two, if I could here. Greg, maybe first, just talk a little bit high level about kind of the state of your
customers, state and local budgeting, given the macro and stimulus and anything of note there, any
changes.

And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit on the video side. You mentioned that getting good traction
with the government. If you could maybe just give us a little bit more color there, how much video is
ramping there? And are you seeing kind of any level of cross-selling across that video business?

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Sure, Tim. Just to take them in reverse order, on video, specifically, let's start out with body-worn video.
We had the strongest quarter we've had, really good demand for a lot of the obvious demand driver
reasons you would suspect. But I think Molloy and John Kedzierski and the team are doing a good job
with the acquisition we made there in the form of WatchGuard. Quite frankly, also another impetus behind
the body-worn video growth is international performance, which came through an acquisition as a part of
WatchGuard called Edesix. So I like our performance there. And also, I like the increased demand.

We also did have strong growth in fixed video to government, solid double-digit growth, I think a reflection
of -- we've said the sales cycle is always longer in state and local and Fed, but very good performance on
fixed video and to the government. By the way, Pelco, being a benefit to that as well, given the fact that,
that acquisition came with a lot of contractual government clearances that allowed us to move right in to
further Fed government purchases that were beneficial.

In terms of state and local customers, Jack mentioned it. I think that our customers have found a good
way to engage during these challenging times. Many of them do meet in person. We also meet digitally
or virtually. And remember, the state and local budgets have been largely set. So that's a good thing that
moves us well into next year. We've also been the beneficiaries of CARES Act money from the Feds, and I
think that has had a favorable impact as well.

So I don't know, Jack, if you want to add anything on the state and local budgets beyond that.

John P. Molloy
Executive Vice President of Products & Sales

No. Tim, I think it's just prioritization, prioritization, prioritization. As you've heard me mention before,
we're not in the business of a nice to have. We're in the business of a need to have in terms of emergency
response. So really, we continue to see our customers drive projects through.

The other thing is, I think, that sometimes lost is there's just a multitude of different funding sources.
Greg talked about CARES Act, but there's also things like special purpose local option taxes, which are
still getting passed. And so we remain highly engaged with our customers. We see great demand across
the portfolio in government. And as we know with what's happening in the world right now, security
means a great deal to cities, to states and I think to our federal government. So more to follow, but we're
encouraged with what we've seen.

Our next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company.

Paul Jonas Silverstein
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Greg, I think I heard somebody mention that your business is 55% recurring. What is recurring revenue
for the overall company?

MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

No. I think Molloy's reference was that the majority of our European revenue is recurring largely because
of the Airwave contract. If you -- no, that's all right, Paul. But if you look at overall Software and Services,
which we view as largely a proxy for recurring, this year, in full year 2020, Software and Services will be
higher than 35% for this year, which we view as a favorable by-product of the year, I guess. So that's
good.

Paul Jonas Silverstein
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And then as a follow-up, on the government piece of video, looking out to next year, coming off of this
year, any quantification you can provide us ballpark in terms of how big that -- I know you just started
selling over a year ago. But how big can that business be next year? And how big will it be this year?

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Well, so just to kind of -- if you take all the video assets that we have, fixed, body-worn, in-car, license
plate recognition, domestically and internationally, this business, all in, for assets, hardware, software, is
likely to be about $940 million, Paul, for this year. You've heard us talk about growing at 3x the market.
That 3x the market is around the fixed video and access control piece, which we still believe we can
achieve. If you take the size of the video market, all in, worldwide, and we always zero China out given
their indigenous competitors, this is about an 18 -- $17 billion, $18 billion business, addressable market.
It's actually the largest addressable market we have. So I think there's room to run here with the assets
we've accumulated, along with the analytics that our team is developing and intelligent edge devices as
well.

Paul Jonas Silverstein
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Greg, I appreciate that. I was actually focused on the government piece of your market that you entered
back about a year ago.

John P. Molloy
Executive Vice President of Products & Sales

I think -- Paul, so I think we had mentioned probably maybe 3 calls ago, probably 9 months ago, the
question was asked, "Hey, how big is your government video business?" And really, we said approximately
$200 million at the time, and that's an aggregation of 2 things. It's the mobile video market that's come
through vis-à-vis the WatchGuard acquisition as well as Greg had mentioned the Edesix that also came as
an acquisition. The remnants of it are fixed video security sales into all governments. And I would tell you,
both of those businesses are growing strong double digits right now, both fixed video and the government.
We talked about the success we had in Q3, both in the Fed and state and local. But also, we highlighted
some of the success we've had in body-worn in terms of unit and dollar bookings substantially up in the
strong double digits there. So hopefully, that helps.

Operator

Our next question will come from Fahad Najam of MKM.

Fahad Najam
MKM Partners LLC, Research Division

Greg, I want to ask you a big picture question. In light of the view that most of your government
customers are very slow to move and they tend to be not driven by -- like usually, enterprises are driven
by profits and maximizing profits, your government customers tend to be more slower. Are you noticing
any kind of an inflection point in your government customers' decision-making when it comes to --
whether it's next-gen 911 command center solutions or video? Are you -- are we bringing on a new trend
and that's going to accelerate going forward?

MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Chairman & CEO

I would say this. I mean, in the command center software, next-gen 911 is a new opportunity for us. And
that's obviously a favorable trend. The other thing I'd say in terms of decision cycles is command center
software historically has had some of the oldest legacy technology and workflow processes literally over
several years, 10, 15 years plus. So I actually think that the inflection point is COVID-induced, in part,
that's accelerating decisions to the cloud. Traditionally, state and local customers would prefer control,
and they'd confer -- prefer on-prem. I actually think that this pandemic has been a positive accelerant to
decision-making around command center software, particularly around cloud. I think the suite that Kelly
and Andrew's team has built also can be an accelerant to decision-making because instead of trying to
decide a forklift process and an all-or-nothing, you can get an anchor tenant module in place and then
upgrade those modules for additional components along the suite.

On land mobile radio, we're -- we literally have tens of thousands of different contracts that are at
different lengths, and these systems are at different ages. The pandemic and the civil unrest has been an
accelerant to some older systems here in North America that needed to be upgraded to digital and with
state-of-the-art encryption to protect the communities and the local law enforcement better. I think as
Molloy and his team have built new devices, APX NEXT, in Tetra, the MPX600 (sic) (MXP600) that's just
announced, those 2 represent events and opportunities for our customers to make decisions to refresh as
well.

John P. Molloy
Executive Vice President of Products & Sales

Yes. Greg, you hit it really well. I think the other thing that -- we have a compelling ecosystem for our
customers. That's an overused term, but I say that under the lens of Greg nailed it. Devices that work
with command center, how do you extract, how do you disseminate information in a mobile environment?
Those are the expectations that we've seen frankly for a number of years, and the enterprise space and
government is certainly catching up to that. And I think those will be accelerants moving forward for us in
public safety.

Fahad Najam
MKM Partners LLC, Research Division

You touched upon a follow-up piece that I wanted to ask, which is -- so as your government customers
migrate their command and control infrastructure to next-gen digital platforms, is that creating a resulting
opportunity, new applications like mission-critical push-to-talk features on radio? Then if that's the case,
are you beginning to see that? And can you quantify that opportunity?

Kelly S. Mark
Executive Vice President of Software & Services

This is Kelly. I would say it's not that it's offering up those type of opportunities on the mission-critical
push-to-talk, but it offers up the opportunity to enrich the whole workflow with multimedia. And at
the edge, officers today carry a mobile device with them. They can receive now, from the command
center, video, images and data that they couldn't receive before. But the radio as part of the workflow
is instrumental in regards to the uniqueness of its communications that it provides. So it's not so much
about mission-critical push-to-talk as much as it's about enriching the entire command center workflow
with all the information that we're very used to dealing with today on our day-to-day lives. It's now
enabling that across that mission-critical operational workflow so they can manage that information from
911 call intake to record and case management at the end.

Fahad Najam
MKM Partners LLC, Research Division

If I can rephrase my question, which was a little bit more simpler. I wasn't particularly honing in on
mission-critical push-to-talk. What I was trying to get at is, are you beginning to see a refresh of your
devices business as a result of the upgrade in the new command and control software that you're now
selling?

MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We are. So we announced last October the APX NEXT device. We've built -- already built north of
$100 million in terms of funnel opportunities for that. We're very encouraged. Remember, we introduce
devices at the top end. So as we get through 2021, we'll start to broaden the reach of those devices.
We see great demand for those devices because it's not only purpose-built P25 communication, which is
truly the bedrock of how cities and states and public safety communicate, but to bring in LTE capabilities
for backup push-to-talk, for ability to do on-the-fly programming and those kind of things, it brings a
number of those different things. So excited about that. Greg talked about just this week, we announced
a collaborative device for the TETRA market in Europe. And essentially, we've already been done -- we're
booked out for the year this year. So we're really encouraged about that as well. So we see a need for
devices that can do more for our customers, as I said earlier, in terms of aggregating, disseminating and
really intelligence within their ecosystem.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citi.

Joshua Michael Kehoe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

This is Josh Kehoe on for Jim Suva. Can you provide any more color on the headwinds you're facing in the
public safety LMR business and when you expect to be through them? And is it largely due to COVID-19?
Or is there more to it?

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

I think the headwinds we talked about when COVID hit us back in March were PCR and the industries that
were affected by it and public safety LMR kind of "being pushed to the right." The push to the right, largely
around sales engagement and deployments, I don't think that's changed at all. That's still the primary
reason for the push to the right, although I will tell you, it performed -- it, public safety LMR, performed
better than our expectations in Q3, and we expect it to improve again in Q4, which informs our guide. And
I think public safety LMR and PCR, as I referenced earlier, I think, will both improve, which will primarily
drive why we expect the products segment to return to growth next year. There's a lot of still budget
sources that Molloy referenced. We've been the beneficiaries of the CARES Act as well, but that's what I
would say.

John P. Molloy
Executive Vice President of Products & Sales

Yes. The only thing I'd just piggyback on to Greg's comments there, the one issue that we've been
challenged with is actually physical deployment of systems in the Middle East and Africa and in Latin
America. So we're completely impaired to go do anything, and that's really elongated our ability to
recognize revenues in those theaters.

Joshua Michael Kehoe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And as a follow-up, as you look into 2021, how are you thinking about prioritizing M&A versus share
repurchases?

Gregory Q. Brown
Chairman & CEO

I think that our capital allocation framework is 50-30-20, 50% of the cash flow being available for either
acquisitions or share repurchase. It's a fungible amount, depending upon the opportunities that are in
front of us. 30% is dividend, and 20% is CapEx. So that framework loosely is that it's not meant to be a
prescription but it's a framework. We were active in buying back shares at these levels, as you've seen in

MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Q3. We think these are attractive levels to buy the stock in Q3, and we'll evaluate opportunities as they
come. We've done tuck-in acquisitions on the video side, on the software side.

I think that in regards to acquisitions next year, it will be, in part, a reflection of what opportunities come
our way. But that's the thinking around the deployment of capital at this point.
