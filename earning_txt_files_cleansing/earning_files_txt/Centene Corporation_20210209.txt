CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Centene Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Gilligan, Senior Vice President, Finance and
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Jennifer Lynch Gilligan
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full
year 2020 earnings results conference call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this
morning's call, which also can be accessed through our website at centene.com.

Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-
looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking
statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent
Form 10-Q filed in October and Form 10-K -- and our previously filed Form 10-K and other public SEC
filings, including the risks and uncertainties described with respect to the potential impacts of COVID-19
on our business and results of operations. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments
may cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking
statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.

The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most
directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2020 press release, which is
available on the company's website at centene.com under the Investors section.

Additionally, please mark your calendars for our upcoming first quarter 2021 earnings results call on April
27, 2021.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Personally and on behalf of
the corporation, I am very pleased with the results we delivered in 2020. Early in 2020, we stated that
the year would be choppy, and it was. We also told you that Centene would manage through the crisis we
face, care for our stakeholders and emerge stronger for it, and we did.

In 2020, we added over 10 million members, representing growth of 67%. We delivered full year revenue
of $111 billion, representing 49% growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5, up 13% over the
prior year. Importantly, we continue to invest in the foundational strength of our enterprise and create
long-term pathways for growth.

Turning now to 2021. While we continue to operate in a pandemic environment, we intend to demonstrate
the same transparency and agility we did during this past year. Last night, we filed an 8-K announcing
that the Board has authorized up to $1 billion of stock repurchase. This includes the unspent portion of the
previous authorizations.

Our capital deployment priorities include providing new subsidiaries, such as Oklahoma, with risk-based
capital, reducing debt to further enhance our bond ratings and facilitating value creation through M&A. The
repurchase will be done under a 10b5 with accretion being the key criteria.

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Our 2020 financial guidance now includes PANTHERx. One month into the first quarter, our view of 2021
remains largely consistent with what we shared at our December Investor Day. And we are reiterating our
adjusted EPS guidance of $5 to $5.30. We are not changing our EPS guidance at this time. But in the spirit
of our continued commitment to transparency, we want to provide the head and tailwinds impacting our
operational landscape.

Among the key potential headwinds, additional state rate actions due to COVID-related reductions in
utilization beyond the $400 million we've already incorporated. We will remind you that CMS has not
approved the previously submitted rate actions. However, as we have said, we have built them into our
guidance and cash flows. And CMS maintains that rate actions must be actuarially sound. The potential
for higher-than-anticipated overall COVID-related costs is the second headwind; and third, a Medicare
physician fee schedule update.

Continued membership growth -- talking about the tailwinds, continued membership growth as a result
of the extension of the Medicaid redetermination suspension. I will note that CMS has indicated they will
likely extend the public health emergency through the end of the year. Lower utilization trends in the first
half of the year beyond our current projections is another tailwind. Further, the potential for a meaningful
increase to the FMAP, which is unlikely to be in the COVID bill but will be part of subsequent reconciliation
bills. And the Marketplace special enrollment period beginning next week.

We anticipate the impact of the fee schedule to be approximately $200 million, which is expected to be
largely offset by the redetermination tailwind. The other head and tailwinds are difficult to quantify with
certainty at this point in time. But taken together, we expect they will tend or trend to the positive.

And with a new administration in place, the government's approach to additional pandemic measures may
change, and we may see a more supportive environment for expansion of care. With 1 month under our
belt, much remains in motion, and any attempt to update guidance would lack precision. We anticipate
being in a better position and that it -- we'd be in more appropriate position to update our guidance at our
first quarter earnings call.

During 2021, we intend to further leverage the foundation that we have established in recent years and
have set the stage for our next decade of growth and value creation, which will be measured by increasing
margins. We will continue to drive growth from our position as a leader in government-sponsored health
care through product and geographic expansion. We are pleased to have been selected for 2 statewide-
managed care contracts in Oklahoma, including a sole source contract in foster care, both of which the
state expects to start in October.

In addition, we expect continued growth in our Medicare as we leverage our national scale we have
established in this business over the long term and short to medium term. We expect to deliver above-
market growth with significant additional opportunities for value creation.

To meet our margin expectations and expansion objectives and ensure organizational efficiency, we are
also focusing on leveraging our size and scale to unlock the value inherent across our broader whole
health platform. To that end, we have today announced an organizational restructuring initiative. That
will include a reduction in workforce of approximately 3,000 employees and the elimination of 1,500 open
positions. Overall, this represents a workforce reduction of roughly 6%. Please note that the elimination of
the 1,500 positions was accounted for at our December Investor Day.

The reductions are primarily in areas where we have significant overlap from acquisitions and where we
have opportunities to leverage our size and scale for increased efficiency. Importantly, we remain focused
on innovation, growth and agility. And we are continuing to invest in people and systems that align with
key areas of growth for the company.

As we look out over the next decade, we will continue to lead the industry by providing the highest level
of care at the lowest cost to meet the evolving needs of our members, especially those with complex
care requirements. We are transforming our health care model and making material advancements in our
technology capabilities.

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Behavioral health is one of the most underserved areas in the population today. And through the planned
addition of Magellan, we are investing in our specialty care capabilities while also focusing on improved
integration of behavioral and physical health, resulting in better patient outcomes at lower costs.

I'm pleased to note that we are making strong progress on the regulatory process for the Magellan
acquisition and filed all the required Form As within days of announcing the deal. We have also filed
necessary papers for Hart-Scott-Rodino approval with the Department of Justice.

Another area of focus is pharmacy, which represents a large and significant market opportunity. Our
growing specialty pharmacy platform will provide enhanced insight into the specialty pharma pipeline,
clinical requirements and cost management opportunities. Importantly, it will also drive additional
opportunities for patient engagement, better adherence rates, and ultimately, improved outcomes.

We're also cementing the organizational structure of our health care enterprise platform, which is creating
an environment to foster the revolutionary change that is overdue in our health care system. For example,
Apixio and Interpreta are collaborating on a comprehensive predictive infrastructure that will serve as a
foundation for future innovation. All of this, combined with our performance in 2020, the strength and
scale of our diversified health care enterprise and our strong execution provides me and should provide
you with great confidence in our outlook and ability to deliver on the opportunities ahead.

I also want to thank our employees who continue to move this company forward, while always remaining
focused on serving our members. And we look forward to welcoming them back into our offices.

With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year
2020 results that were in line with our expectations at Investor Day, reflecting solid execution during an
extraordinary year. Fourth quarter revenues were $28.3 billion, an increase of 50% over the fourth quarter
of 2019; and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.46 compared to $0.73 last year.

I will start my comments this morning by providing a more in-depth review of the fourth quarter results,
then I will offer an update around our financial outlook for 2021. Our updated guidance now includes
PANTHERx, which closed at the end of 2020.

Now some fourth quarter details. Total revenues grew by $9.4 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019 due
to the acquisition of WellCare and growth in the Medicaid and Health Insurance Marketplace business.
This growth also includes the impact from the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the
reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2020, partially offset by the divestiture of our Illinois health plan
and retroactive state premium rate adjustments and risk-sharing mechanisms.

Total membership increased to 25.5 million in the quarter, up 67% compared to a year ago. Since the
pandemic began in March, we have added a total of 1.7 million Medicaid members, slightly higher than the
1.6 million members anticipated at our Investor Day in December.

Our HBR, or health benefits ratio, was 88.4% in the fourth quarter, consistent with last year's fourth
quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, the HBR benefited from lower medical utilization
trends due to the COVID pandemic and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee, offset by retroactive
state premium rate adjustments and risk-sharing mechanisms and higher testing and treatment costs
associated with COVID, particularly in the Marketplace business.

Within the Marketplace business, we experienced an increase in testing and treatment costs related
to COVID, specifically in regions where infection rates sharply increased during December. As a result
of the increased COVID costs, our Marketplace business performed slightly below our targeted pretax
margin range of 5% to 10% for the full year. We expect our Marketplace business to return to the targeted
margins in 2021, reflecting our continued pricing discipline.

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Through year-end 2020, we have paid approximately $3.6 billion associated with COVID claims. This
compares to the $2 billion we discussed on our third quarter call. Our full year figure applies consistent
methodology and includes all of the COVID-related claims codes consistent with CDC guidelines.

Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.7% in the fourth quarter this year
compared to 9.5% last year and 8.9% in the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase was
due to enhanced growth and profitability initiatives for our Medicare and Health Insurance Marketplace
business as we reinvested the risk corridor payment we received in the third quarter. This was partially
offset by the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues as a result of the WellCare transaction.

Cash flow provided by operations was approximately $3 billion in the fourth quarter, impacted by the
timing of certain state payments and an increase in payables related to the risk-sharing mechanisms. We
continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $1 billion of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at
quarter end. Unregulated cash included approximately $500 million of items that are expected to reverse
in early 2021.

Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $97 million of borrowings on our revolving credit
facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39%, excluding our nonrecourse debt, compared to 39.1% in the
third quarter of 2020. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 37.5% when netting our unregulated cash with our
debt at quarter end, which represents a 140 basis point decrease since March.

As Michael mentioned earlier, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, with focus on funding of
organic growth, value creation through M&A and leverage reduction. We will be opportunistic with share
repurchases with accretion being the key criteria.

Our medical claims liability totaled $12.4 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable
compared to 52 days in the third quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of state-directed
payments.

The WellCare integration continues to be on track, and we remain comfortable with our synergy capture
efforts in 2021. While it is still early, we are making excellent progress toward the closure of Magellan. As
Michael noted earlier, we have filed all the applicable regulatory approval documents, and we continue to
have constructive dialogue around integration planning.

Turning now to our 2021 expectations. As I mentioned at the beginning of my prepared remarks, we are
updating guidance to include the acquisition of PANTHERx, which closed at the end of December 2020.
This adjusted two of our guidance metrics for 2021 as follows: first, our total revenues increased at the
midpoint by $2 billion, which is consistent with what we communicated at our Investor Day. And second,
our SG&A ratio decreases by 20 basis points at the midpoint, reflecting Panther's (sic) [ PANTHERx's ] low
administrative cost ratio.

Additionally, while not part of our formal guidance metrics, the cost of service ratio is expected to increase
by approximately 200 basis points, driven by PANTHERx being included in service revenue and cost of
services. At this point, we have not included the impact of winning the 2 Oklahoma contracts into our
guidance. The 2 contracts are estimated to begin October 1, which would potentially add $250 million to
our 2021 total revenue.

For the full year, we now expect our revenue to be within a range of $116.1 billion and $118.1 billion. We
continue to expect mid-teens percentage Medicare Advantage enrollment in 2021. This strong growth
underscores the rationale for the WellCare transaction as well as the effective integration efforts that have
taken place over the last 12 months in the pandemic conditions.

Marketplace enrollment results were slightly better than our previous projection as both retention and
effectuation rates were higher than anticipated. We continue to view Marketplace as a long-term growth
opportunity for Centene, which will drive our product development and positioning with the experience we
have gained as the industry leader.

Additionally, we continue to expect typical utilization to remain below the historical baseline during the
first half of 2021. We're turning to normalized levels in the second half of the year. COVID utilization

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

is expected to be elevated during the early part of the year, particularly offsetting the impact of lower
traditional utilization. The duration and intensity of higher COVID costs will be impacted by the trajectory
of the pandemic and vaccination rates.

Finally, we have lowered our GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.14 at the midpoint. This is due to the
inclusion of the estimated intangible amortization of PANTHERx and an additional charge related to the
workforce reduction Michael previously mentioned. We intend to invest these savings into important
growth and strategic initiatives, including investment for the upcoming special enrollment period as well
as automation and technology development and incremental start-up costs associated with the Oklahoma
contract.

Taking all of these factors into account, our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance remains
unchanged at $5 to $5.30. As Michael highlighted, there are various potential headwinds and tailwinds for
2021 that we have not included in our guidance today as many of the items remain uncertain and difficult
to quantify. Utilization and COVID expenses, in particular, are highly dependent on the trajectory of the
pandemic, and we'll continue to provide investors with timely updates.

I'll close by reiterating our confidence and the strength of our business. We're pleased with the significant
growth we achieved in 2020. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we believe we have ample liquidity to
meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused on executing against our strategic plans and
are committed to delivering shareholder value.

With that, I will now turn it back to Michael.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

We're going to deviate a little bit today from the standard call, but we have Jon Dinesman available. And
last night, the Ways and Means Committee provided information on things they're thinking about relative
to strengthening the uninsured and bringing them into the market. So I'm going to ask Jon to take a
minute and just highlight the key factors as they go out. And Jon heads up our Washington office and is a
very respected government relations individual in Washington. Jon, if you would?

Jonathan Dinesman
Executive Vice President of Government Relations

Thank you, Michael. As you mentioned, yesterday, the House Ways and Means Committee released their
COVID relief package, but we are pleased to see that they included substantial increases in ACA premiums
for those in need. For 2021 and 2022, it provides for an enhanced advanced premium tax credits for those
making between 133% to 400% of the federal poverty level.

Another key provision relates to those that are unemployed. They will be eligible to receive advanced
premium tax credit and will be treated like they are at the 133% federal poverty level for the remainder of
2021.

It will be important to get greater detail as the COVID package moves forward, but we are pleased to see
them wanting to leverage the ACA for those most impacted by the pandemic.

And Michael, with that, I will kick it back to you.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO
Thank you, Jon. Operator, we can now open it up for questions.

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

So if I look at the numbers, you finished 2020 with an adjusted net margin of a little bit under 3%. And
I think you actually mentioned in your prepared comments about margin expansion in the future. So I
was wondering if you could give us sort of longer-term goals and sort of as you think about your mix of
business with the addition of Panther (sic) [ PANTHERx ] and some of the other acquisitions in the health
care services side that tends to run a little bit higher. I'm just curious where do you think that net margin
ultimately can go to? I'm not thinking about 2021, but more sort of 2, 3 years out.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We've talked about -- we said pretax, we'd like to be in the 3% to 5% range. We also said we want to
see our increases be very sustainable. So I'm not looking for big swings where we jump up to 5.5% and
then back down and prior period adjustments and all the things that occur in that environment. And so
we're looking at 3% to 5% on a very sustainable basis.

Equally important is our continued diversification of our business, which really unlike -- a lot like
individuals that invest in our company have diversified portfolios. We are in the government services area,
but as we diversify with and move more and more into the pharmaceutical and others, some margins may
be less, some greater, but on balance, Josh, 3% to 5% is the goal on a very sustainable basis. And I think
we'll see margins increasing again this year.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck with BOA.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just wanted to go back to the headwinds and tailwinds. It wasn't 100% clear to me whether these were
things that you guys explicitly included in your guidance? Or you were saying that they were kind of
[Technical Difficulty].

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

You're breaking up a little bit, Kevin. You blew a couple of it. I think I heard you say you want to
understand what the headwinds and tailwinds were? Were they included in our guidance? And what we
said is that -- what I've said is, so those -- we commented -- a couple were, but on balance, we have not
adjusted our guidance for them. It's just too early. We have 1 month of experience. And as you just heard,
the environment is changing. And to the positive, that's why I said that we see that when you take the
headwinds and the tailwinds, the tendency or the trend is to the positive.

But until we have more definition, and it's difficult to plot from one point, you can't. So we've said that
we have 1 month under our belt. These are where -- this is where it stands. Here are the headwinds, but
there's a lot of tailwinds to offset it. And there's strong tailwinds. So we're encouraged by that. We're
encouraged by what Ways and Means put out. Now that may not be the final forum, but it shows the
direction they're leading. So while they're not in the guidance, I want to be clear on that. We found it
important for transparency for people to understand these are the things we should be evaluating.

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And maybe just one clarification. On the FMAP relief, if you guys -- if states got more FMAP,
would that potentially improve your rates? Or does that just give you better visibility into rates being
actuarially sound?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think both. In other words, with the FMAP, the -- what the states can do on and they're looking
at expansion, as you just heard, and other things of that nature. It will give the states some relief, and
I think it will minimize the need to try and pull back rates. But -- so on balance, it's a good thing for us.
But I want to emphasize that when we hear the states are adjusting risk corridors or they're trying to pull
money back, it's because they see the utilizations down. And so they see that as a reason to do it and to
offset it. So there's a balance there. FMAP will just give them more comfort and then -- and help them
cover the additional employees. Brand, is there anything you'd add to that?

Brandy Lynn Burkhalter
Executive VP & COO

No.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

No. Okay. Thank you.

Operator

And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Crédit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just to maybe go to -- talk a little bit about the Marketplace and some of the developments there. First of
all, to make sure I understand, I think Jeff's saying that you ended up a little below your target margin
range of 5% to 10% in 2020 and attributed most of that to the COVID situation. Did you see materially
different utilization patterns, COVID, non-COVID in the Marketplace versus your traditional Medicaid
population and the Medicare population?

And then maybe just to ask you to comment a little bit about the open enrollment dynamic that the Biden
Administration is putting in place. Do we see that as garnering significant incremental enrollment. Is there
any risk of adverse selection because they're reopening it? Just your thoughts on how that's going to play
out? It sounds like you're generally positive about it.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I'll take the second part of the question, and then let Jeff pick up on the differences in the utilization. We
see it as a positive. I mean there's 9 million people that they estimate that are uninsured. And we want to
remind you that it's not all Marketplace. A lot of these individuals will qualify for Medicaid. And as we saw
last year, that was a positive. The FMAP gives the states the funding they need to cover those employees,
which is an additional positive as well as adding additional SSI and other coverages that we've seen states
doing. So we see that as essentially a potentially significant positive for us.

As it relates to the Marketplace, we'll see some -- we see increases in people coming in there. I'm not
going to -- I don't have any basis to say we'll see adverse selection on it. I think we have programs
in place to attract a balance, but we're not trying to just acquire -- to attract just the well and the
young, which -- we're in the business to attract a good mix, a combination, which states and the federal
government recognizes us for.

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

So I think on balance, it's going to be a very good thing for us. But Jeff, do you want to talk about the
difference in utilization?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, sure. Thanks, A.J. On the first part of the question, yes, it was more acute in the Marketplace
business, specifically in the inpatient side with the COVID authorizations, and it was a little bit different. I
think some of that's driven by the demographics. You have to remember in the Marketplace business, over
90% of that population are adults, whereas in the Medicaid side, it's -- there's a lot of kids in there. So it
was more acute in the Marketplace, and it pulled us down right below our 5% to 10% range at the end of
the year.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Maybe just kind of ask on the comment that was made about the package they're passing, COVID
relief. Is that going to cover people in the coverage gap in the non-expansion states? Is that part of what
they're going after? I know that's a couple of million people? Or is it too early to tell whether they will
address that in this relief package?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I think they -- we know that the administration wants to bring uninsured in, okay? And they're very
committed to it. But I asked Jon to speak only on something -- just he's fresh off the press. And we
haven't had a chance to study it to the depths we'd like to. So I guess, A.J., we're going to wait and give
you more definition as it unfolds, but the essence of it is positive.

Operator

And our next question today comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Wanted to ask about fourth quarter utilization, and I know it's early into January, but anything you could
share with us on utilization and how those retro rates and rebates kind of looked in the fourth quarter
versus what you expected? It looked like your MLR was a little higher. And then specifically, was there
something in New York -- one of your peers had mentioned the New York retro cut that happened very late
in the fourth quarter. Anything you could tell us on that one that might have affected Q4 would be helpful
as well.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I'll start out and just -- and then I'll let Jeff pick up on the others. But I think what's really important,
and you give -- and thanks for giving me the chance to say this. So when you look at the kind of the year
it's been with the COVID and the peaks and how strong the peaks are and the geographic diversity of it
where we're strong, I think it's very difficult to evaluate very minute changes in MLR, product by product,
business by business. And so I just -- I want to encourage everyone, including yourself, to look at the
most broad things that they know, they came in within a more than acceptable range for the environment
in which we're in. I consider it really well done, but I'll let Jeff speak to your specifics.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Real quick on that, Justin. So it's really been the same phenomenon for the year that we've seen. So
in the fourth quarter, I would say total utilization is below the historical trend line. So obviously, higher
COVID costs, but lower traditional utilization. And in the fourth quarter, you remember at our Investor

Day, we estimated the full year state risk-sharing mechanisms would be $790 million. We ended the year
roughly at $1 billion, and effectively, that was offset by lower utilization during the quarter.

Now I'll just give you some details on that $1 billion. A piece of that was New York. We had an estimate
in for New York, but we didn't have any details on it. We got those details in January. And then there
were some other smaller states, but half of the difference, we went from $790 million to $1 billion, half of
that difference is really related to, I would say, true-up of estimates and normal performance of existing
corridor programs that were already in place.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Does that educate us at all into -- the -- versus the $400 million?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Say that again?

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Against expected. Does that educate us at all into that $400 million, given that it was another $200 million
higher than you thought for the end of the year?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Again, I think the -- what Michael had said earlier, the risk corridor, the $400 million is going to change
anyway just based on utilization. I guess that's what I would point to. And we haven't even finished
closing the books for January. So at this point, what we've done is effectively take December's guidance,
the December 18 guide, and adjusted for PANTHERx, and we'll provide more information at the end of our
first quarter call on a lot of the headwinds and tailwinds that Michael mentioned.

Our next question today comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Maybe if you could talk about the -- your guidance relative to redeterminations and Oklahoma. I guess
what I'm getting at is, am I correct that your guidance was based on the earlier sort of late spring date for
redeterminations to resume, now it's pushed out to the end of the year. I wanted to understand if that was
something that was -- is potentially upside for your guidance or not? And then Oklahoma, the same story?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Matt, the state has set October 1 for both plans. And I've never put my hand on starting dates that states
give you. And so I think -- if it did so, I'd have said, Jeff in his remarks, there's about $250 million in
revenue, don't look for a lot of margin. We'll have start-up costs and other things in there. We'll give more
definition on our Q1 call on that. So I think that's part of it.

In terms of redetermination, we -- right now, they've issued a letter saying that they expect to continue
it until the end of the year, extend the emergency. But I want to confirm before I start building into the
guidance and giving you the numbers. And that's why I said 1 month does not a year make. And so kind
of bear with us, recognize that, that's a strong upside for us, if it happens, and we've seen it historically.
But until they duly confirm it, that's why we've said it makes sense to give you all this information as best
we can on our Q1 call. I just -- but I did want to be transparent and say, these are the tailwinds. These
are the headwinds. And you can see that on balance, there are very strong tailwinds.

And our next question today comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Michael, you talked in your prepared remarks about growing the unregulated business as part of -- one of
the drivers for margin expansion. Can you talk a little bit about sort of how you're thinking of building the
pharmacy offering, whether it's through additional M&A or organic growth?

And then you're still outsourcing part of your pharmacy or PBM business. Can you maybe update us on
kind of like the timing there and the opportunities associated with that?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I'm glad to. I think PANTHERx, while we've said will be breakeven this year and has the $1 billion
of revenue, it's important that it adds to the specialty pharma, which we have a leadership position and
growing. It adds the orphan drugs, which are a critical part, and we get help in. We're committed to the
pricing, keeping it affordable for everybody to the extent we can. But we don't control that. That's -- we
get -- we're a distributor of it, but it gives us great insights into it. So what -- that's the specialty side, and
that's why we did that to add to it.

As it relates to the total platform, we're going to be adding significant assets through the Magellan
acquisition. We have various platforms out there. And I've asked Drew Asher, who, I think, we'd all
recognize as a very competent executive and working on the pharmacy side, to put together his full
recommendations for us on how best to approach it, which is the final platform we should use on, but it
would be premature to give a whole lot of guidance until we have approval on the Magellan acquisition.

But it's -- we see it as very positive. We have -- I know we're purchasing prior to this over $30 billion
a year in pharmaceuticals, working with various platforms and pull it all together. So it's a long-winded
answer, but it's -- to give you as much transparency, and it's a great opportunity. And Drew is working
through and will determine how best to capitalize on. And based on his prior experience, I think people
can have confidence it will be well done.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then one follow-up. I mean, yesterday, you announced an increase in your share repurchase program
to an incremental $1 billion. What is your assumption for share repo in 2021 guidance? And as we think
about sort of what the cadence should we factor into our models?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I have not given any guidance on that. We gave you the order of priority. I mean, obviously, with
Oklahoma and other plans as they grow, the RBC has to be increased, and that's the first one. We do want
to retire debt. Our bonds -- our credit ratings continue to improve, and we want to continue that pressure,
we're approaching an investment grade. We have 1 rating there now. And so that's the second one.

We do have some smaller acquisitions we are looking at, and so we would use some capital for that. But
we want investors to understand that as -- based on what the stock price is and the accretion, and I have
a pocket piece that says with an x price, here's the anticipated accretion, we will be back in the market
by -- on a 10b5. And let me just take 30 seconds on that, that because we are a company that does a
lot of acquisitions and we have inside knowledge, we have to file, no different than we have to personally
when there's an open window, file a 10b5, that says, here's the criteria for buying the stock, if it's a
disaccreditation by exits, and there'll be a bank that has those instructions, it has the authority to do it on
that basis. So it's a combination of those kinds of things. And it's -- so if the stock continues to move up,

there will be less repurchase, but it's there. And obviously, people want us to repurchase when it makes
accretive sense.

And our next question today comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Could you just amplify a little bit on the restructuring program with the 3,000 employees? And in
particular, could you put that in the context of your long-term targets? So I was just interested to kind of
get a refresh on what you think long-term revenue guidance would be? And then with margins long term,
how much of that is going to be driven by improvements in operating expenses as opposed to anything
else?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Sure. Well, the revenue, we tend to give you that 1 year at a time, and we say we're going to be --
we are a growth company. And I don't want to get too far ahead of myself on that. But when you look at
the year we came off of, before, I think, it was 59% or some significant number, I don't think I'll have --
we'll see that next year, but who knows? And I say that tongue in cheek.

But the restructuring, it's been a hobby horse of ours for some time. And we've done these acquisitions.
And they're very effective, and they're accretive. But I don't believe we've really leveraged our scale
and size, and it's something we've been talking to our senior staff about. We've been making material
investments in systems that really help improve the efficiency. So this -- and right now, the very candidate
is the demand for health care employees and workers.

So in -- considering the -- taking this action, we're doing it at a time when we believe individuals will
be able to find, and they're getting lots of support. There's $69 million of severance we built in there for
everybody. So we're going to be very supportive of that. But this is just the case of, say, at a time now.
Every time, we brought some, people would come in and say, we just added this, I need 5, 10, 15 more
employees. And we've cut back.

As we looked at it in legal and other areas, we have found that as we've gotten into our scale and size
and we've hired more confident people, we've been able to reduce the numbers. So this is something
we've wanted to do for some time. And it reflects, in combination with canceled positions, about 6% of
our workforce, which we think is material. And a lot of it is going to be improved technology that could be
going to give us -- I gave an example. I know I'm getting long-winded, but I want to give you an example.

We talked about how we just tested in Florida that when something is preauthorized and then the claim
comes in, the nurses have to look at it and make sure it was justified. Well, we now have artificial
intelligence. What used to take them 18 minutes to look at a claim, can now be done in 3.5 seconds. Now
if it's a -- no, it's not qualified, then we want -- we still want an individual to review it. You don't say no
just primarily -- as we get experience with the AI. But that's the kind of thing that improves the efficiency
and service and that the claim gets paid faster, et cetera. That's where we're headed, and that's why the
reduction in force. Long-winded answer, I hope it answers it for you.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes, that's helpful. And does that have any impact on 2021 guidance? Is there a positive impact from the
restructuring in '21? Or is that beyond that?

Michael Frederic Neidorff

And our next question today comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.

Robert Patrick Jones
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. I guess, Michael, not to go back to this, but just I wanted to really understand what is
contemplated in the unchanged range? And it obviously sounds like we're going to get a more detailed
update with 1Q, when you give the 1Q results. But if I think about those headwinds and tailwinds that you
highlighted, I guess, what, if any, as we think about the state rate actions or the redeterminations, like
what is today contemplated in the range?

And then I know at the Analyst Day, you talked about thinking about this year earnings weighting being
kind of 65% in the first half. Any updated thoughts on cadence? I know not a lot of time has passed. But
just curious as we think about how the year could play out from an EPS weighting standpoint? I wanted to
get your latest thoughts there.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think, right now, as I said, with 1 month experience, we're not changing, though. And it's difficult to
trend from one point. You can't trend from one point. And so we've said, look, rather than put something
out there that we then have to change on Q1, let's give you the factors so that you understand why we
see it as a positive trend. I mean the redeterminations, depending -- right now, they're talking about
spending it quarter-by-quarter, but if they go to the year-end, that becomes a significant improvement,
okay?

Some of the rate adjustments I highlighted haven't been approved yet by CMS, and their actuaries
are looking at actuarial soundness on it. So there's so many variables in it that I just don't want to put
something out there that we don't have confidence reflects the facts that has some sense of precision to it
at this point in time. And I'm not trying to be based about it. And that's why we gave you the headwinds
and tailwinds, saying, this is all out there. And you can see how in the environment in which we're
operating, it's difficult.

I mean I was listening to the late news last night, and they were talking about the new virus and the
intensity of it and the wave. I mean there are variables out there that are changing things. We're living in
an area where things are choppy. So bear with us in saying, hey, they're being transparent. They're telling
us the things that could change it to give us reasons to understand why we're believing what we do.

But to try and quantify it, I mean, it's like before -- it's a -- I always use the analogy, before they were
able to tell you ahead of time whether you're having a boy or girl, the obstetrician once said, well, if I say
it's a girl and it turns out to be a girl, you're going to think I'm brilliant. If it turns out to be a boy, you're
going to say, God, you don't know anything. So there's a lot here of unknowns with the inability to predict
it. And so let's evaluate it. Sorry about that. I wish I could be more precise, but it doesn't lend itself to
that with 1 month experience.

Michael, I think, obviously, you talked about the potential for the redeterminations extending out further. I
think your guidance assumes sequester relief through March 31. Any thoughts on if this is also likely to be
extended? And how would you think about the impact maybe to your guidance, if that were the case?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. It's -- we see redeterminations extended, and we see it as a positive to the guidance. But I'm not
going to do it month by month, quarter by quarter when we know -- when we believe we'll have more
clarity by the time we go into the fourth quarter -- or the first quarter -- by the fourth quarter, for sure,

First question just had -- wanted to follow back up on the Marketplace. And just 2 specific questions. One,
just, Jeff, I think you had previously discussed how you expected enrollment to be down around 350,000
from peak to peak membership from '20 to '21. It sounded like you guys are doing a bit better in terms
of sort of net enrollments so far. So interested if you could update us on that number? And then also
maybe how that influences the prior view you had given for the $800 million reduction in the risk-adjusted
payable for 2021?

Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean I think it's positive, and we gave you that number. But Jeff can talk a little bit more.

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Yes. Yes. Thanks, Scott. Appreciate it. Yes, you're right, 350,000. We're coming in more like 280,000.
There was a shift to Bronze, though, more shift to Bronze, which we kind of highlighted, but a higher shift
into the Bronze. So really no change on the revenue side.

And the $800 million, we closed the year with about $800 million, you'll see it when we file the 10-K, with
about a little over $800 million of a risk-adjusted payable, and our expectation is still that, that kind of
based on the acuity shift goes down relatively close to 0.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And I think, as you look forward, going forward, as you heard Jon Dinesman talk about, there is
government support envisioned for those programs, which will make it a little less price-sensitive so that
we see that as a real positive that people just can't try to buy the business.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just one follow-up just on headwinds and tailwinds that you had provided. And I think you
guys captured most of the things that we're all sort of tracking here that have been playing out so far this
year. One thing you didn't mention was just the headwind from lower Medicare RAPS, and that's certainly
something that some of your peers have been emphasizing recently. Is that just because you had already
anticipated that and sort of talked about that and assumed that as a guidance? Or you're just not really
seeing that as much of an incremental headwind here for 2021?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Jeff?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. No, we talked about this at our December 18 guidance. We mentioned specifically the headwinds on
the risk adjustment side due to the inability of members or they didn't get to their doctor before the end
of the year. So that was already included in our December 18 number.

And our next question today comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.

Just one clarification. It sounded like the fee schedule, I think you mentioned, was a $200 million
headwind. And I think you said it was offset or you expect it to be offset by redetermination tailwinds. And
Michael said, the redetermination would be sort of upside. So I just want to make sure I was clear on the
fee schedule and the offset.

Okay. So is it an offset? Or would redeterminations be an incremental tailwind?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, there's an offset, and they go to the end of the year, it could be incremental. They do it quarter-by-
quarter, but we believe it'll be sufficient to offset that. And if I knew it, it's really going to be a whole lot
better than we'd give it to you. But -- and we'll know more come the Q1 call. But there is enough -- we
believe there'll be enough there to offset that $200 million.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then just one other quick clarification. On the margins on the HICS, did
you say it was below the 5% range or below the midpoint of that range? And then your expectation for
2021, sounds like it's going to be firmly in the range. Is that correct?

And our next question today comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Michael, I had two on Magellan. I think you've highlighted that Magellan helps to expand your behavioral
network, and I was hoping you could comment on kind of the buy versus build evaluation on that? Is
speed important to get to that expanded network?

And then secondly, second question around defending Magellan's existing business, they're a kind of
a carve-out player in behavioral, whereas I think you focus more on the advantages of integrated and
carved-in, and then they've also kind of held themselves out as the independent partner, and as part of
Centene, will not be that. So if you could comment on buy versus build and then defending Magellan's
business, please?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Well, I think -- I want to thank you for that question because we like -- I want to start off, and then
I'm going to ask Sarah London who oversees health care enterprises to amplify it a little bit more and give
you some more background on it.

But as it relates to buy versus own, with the importance behavioral health is playing and the fact it's so
underserved right now and recognized, having these assets as part of our total pet -- portfolio, we see as
a strong positive, and something that over time, it's no different than when we first got involved in that
specialty pharma, maybe 5, 6 years ago. I think the first year, we had a carry over to $200 million. And
now we talk in the billions. And I think -- because we recognize how specialty pharmas will grow.

I think -- and I'm not saying it's going to be billions and billions, but the point is, I think, we're going to
see behavioral health grow. Now we're also very sensitive to the fact that we want to keep it in other
users' mind, the independence of it. And we see that as a value because the stronger it is in serving other
customers and more it will eventually be in us. And Sarah, you might talk about health care enterprises
and how you're structuring it.

CENTENE CORPORATION FY 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Michael. So as we said, Magellan will sit within -- upon close, will sit within
health care enterprises, which is a separate operating division within Centene. And it is home to a number
of wholly owned subsidiary companies that are positioned to continue to operate independently. And we
take very seriously the ability of these companies to continue to serve third-party customers to not have
any cross-contamination, to not have any competitive disadvantage in our operations, but also to be
positioned to be a good partner to Centene.

And so that's exactly what we are going to do for Magellan. We've also established an independent Board
of Directors for health care enterprises that can oversee the decisions that are being made and ensure
that we are collectively making decisions that are good for the third-party customer base, and that's a big
part of Magellan's growth potential going forward.

Michael Frederic Neidorff

Thank you, Sarah.

David Howard Windley

Great. And Michael, if I could follow up quickly. You mentioned in your headwinds, additional rate cuts.
Justin, in his question, referenced New York. Is that the primary one you're thinking about? Or are there
others?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

No. There could be others. It will vary state by state. But as I said, if its actuarial is down, that's one
thing. That's fine. And if utilization is down, it will be offset. So -- and that's what CMS is looking at. And
-- so there could be others, but it's -- while it's a headwind, I think there's some offsetting factors that it's
not as problematic as it can be.

And our next question today comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Michael, I had one more follow-up on diversification and pharmacy. And I guess, could you talk about if
the company has any aspirations for the PBM business or the pharmacy business kind of outside of the
government payer book? And maybe would you guys look to expand into commercial businesses and talk
about initiatives there? And then, I guess, does the CVS partnership help or hinder that?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think the CVS partnership does not help or hinder it. So I'll get that out of the way first. Two, we
will treat it as fairly independent over time. Right now, the government services is so big, that's where
we're focused on. And as we move internationally, there's some other things. These opportunities have to
be evaluated first.

But if something came up that was appropriate and would not impact our basic strategy, sure, we'd look
at it. We're not going to -- I'm not -- if it's core because one has to think about strategically and the --
anything you do that increases the amount of pharma you're buying gives you an ongoing benefit to
all the people that are using it. So we're going to be very focused on the strategic impact of everything
we do. And I think I hope today, we demonstrated some of that. So yes, we might consider some large
opportunity there. But until it presents itself or we can look at it, we're a government services health plan
-- company.

We had a court case where it was a class action many, many years ago. It was in the eighth district. And
