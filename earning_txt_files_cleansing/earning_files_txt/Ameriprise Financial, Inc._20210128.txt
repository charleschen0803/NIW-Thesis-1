Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is Sylvia, and I'll be operator for today's call.

[Operator Instructions]

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you
may begin.

Alicia A. Charity
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Sylvia, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. On
the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer.
Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.

Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will
see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to
various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations.
Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials
and on our website at www.ir.ameriprise.com.

Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations
about future events and overall operating plans and performance.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different
from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release, our 2019
annual report to shareholders and our 2019 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or
revise these forward-looking statements.

On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that,
you see our adjusted operating results which management believes enhances the understanding of our
business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful
trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted
operating results.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Good morning, and thanks for joining our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. As you saw in our release,
Ameriprise delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year, considering the challenging operating
environment.

In the quarter, equity markets rallied on positive vaccine news, the outcome of the U.S. election and the
likelihood of further fiscal stimulus. The strength of our advice value proposition, investment expertise and
solutions are translating to our business results.

Client activity inflows in the quarter continue to be very strong. And we set new records, including ending
the quarter with assets under management and administration of $1.1 trillion, an important milestone.

Revenues in the quarter were quite good, up 3% to over $3, driven by strong business fundamentals and
positive equity markets, offsetting the interest rate headwinds. Earnings per share also increased nicely in
the quarter, up 8%, and ROE remains very strong at 36%.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

During the quarter, we continue to make good investments in the business as well as continuing to
execute against our reengineering goals, resulting in a 1% decline in G&A expenses. We're always looking
to drive efficiency and invest strategically to extend our position. It's core to how we operate.

We also returned more than $500 million to shareholders, which was 90% of our adjusted operating
earnings and among the best in financial services.

For the full-year, we returned close to $2 billion. Very clearly, our ability to consistently generate
substantial free cash flow as well as to reinvest and return to shareholders are key differentiators for us.

Let's turn to Advice & Wealth Management, where we delivered a very strong quarter and good organic
growth. Beginning with our clients, with delivering a differentiated level of advice, keeping clients focused
on their goals, which was key in a volatile, disruptive year. Total client assets were up 14% to $732 billion,
driven by excellent client flows and positive markets. As you know, we've built a leading investment
advisory business, and it continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were close to $8 billion,
up 82% over last year. This was another record for us and a great indication of our excellent client, adviser
engagement and focus on growth.

Another highlight was transactional activity bouncing back and up 5% over last year. And client cash
balances continue to grow and ended the quarter at $41.5 billion, up $2.1 billion from last quarter.
Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest to make our offering even more compelling for clients and advisers.
We continue to see very good engagement in our digital capabilities, allowing advisers and clients to
interact and transact seamlessly, and the majority of clients now have their goals online and follow their
progress.

Our advisers are utilizing our tools and capabilities on our integrated technology platform. They are
reporting that they're processing business more efficiently and spending more time with their clients and
growing their practices. That's evident in increased financial planning and adviser productivity, which was
up 8% adjusting for interest rates.

You've heard me share that one of the greatest benefits of being an Ameriprise adviser is our caring
culture, including truly best-in-class support and strong field leadership. I recently spoke with all of our
field leaders to kick off the year. They're energized about Ameriprise and are focused on continuing to
drive productivity and growth.

This high level of support is also reflected in our recruiting success. Our virtual recruiting program is
extremely effective and continues to drive strong results, with 82 experienced advisers joining us in the
fourth quarter. We're recruiting top advisers from across the industry who recognize that Ameriprise offers
the value proposition, technology and level of support that can help them deliver an exceptional adviser-
based client experience and take their practices to the next level of success.

And we have a track record of helping advisers grow 2.5x faster than peers which is very compelling from
a competitive perspective.

So far, in 2021, this momentum continues, and the recruiting pipeline remains strong. It was also great to
see that our client service teams were once again recognized by J.D. Power for the excellent experience
they deliver. This certification recognizes best practices from the highest performing contact centers across
all industries, not just financial services.

Regarding the bank, total assets grew to $8 billion, with $7 billion of sweep deposits. We plan to move
additional deposits to the bank this year. We also added pledged loans to the product portfolio in the
quarter, and we're seeing a good response to date. It's an appealing product for high-end net worth clients
seeking liquidity.

Wrapping up AWM, margin was strong at 19.8% and was up 60 basis points sequentially. As I mentioned
earlier, expenses continue to be well managed with G&A, up only 2%, and that includes investments in the
bank.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

Next, Retirement & Protection Solutions. This business is performing well and in line with our expectations.
We're executing our plan to drive a mix shift in the business, focusing on higher returning products given
the rate environment, which is further reducing our risk.

Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 20%, driven by the success of the structured product we
introduced earlier in the year, more than offsetting reduced sales of living benefit products.

Very importantly, this increased the percentage of VA sales without living benefits, which grew to 58% of
total sales in the quarter.

In Protection, while sales were down 4% year-over-year, we've seen improvement quarter-to-quarter.
Sales of our flagship VUL product doubled in the quarter, offsetting the reduced sales from IUL products.
This product both better meets clients' needs in this rate environment, while generating good returns for
the firm.

Clearly, as Ameriprise continues to grow overall, the Retirement & Protection Solutions segment will
represent a small part of our business mix over time.

With regard to fixed annuities, I know some of you are interested in our progress regarding a reinsurance
transaction. We are actively looking to execute a transaction this year and are encouraged by the recent
uptick in the tenure rate.

Turning to Asset Management. We continue to build on our progress and have a great story to share as
an active manager. The team is serving clients well in driving profitable growth. We continue to have
excellent client engagement and investment performance. The investments we're making, including in
data and digital, are helping to drive organic growth at Columbia Threadneedle, with strong results in
North America.

We're targeting advisers better and delivering a compelling experience. And importantly, we strengthened
our relationship with our distribution partners across regions, including with the large broker-dealer firms
and independents in the U.S. We're also investing in our operating platform, including important work to
reduce duplicate legacy systems.

In the quarter, we completed the final phase of the installation of our global trading portfolio management
system, which will help our investment teams and drive additional efficiency and scale globally. With a
continuation of positive flows and positive markets, assets under management grew 11% to $547 billion.

Our Asset Management business is making strong contributions to our overall earnings and free cash flow.
And margin for the quarter was nearly 40%. Looking ahead, we expect to remain in the 35% to 39%
range. However, if these market levels hold, we should come in at the higher end.

Strong investment performance has been essential to our success, and our teams have been collaborating
really well through this pandemic. We have steadily invested to build a strong global platform with a
disciplined research focus. And our people are delivering exceptional performance across all categories:
equities; fixed income; and multi-asset strategies.

At year-end, Columbia Threadneedle had 108, 4 and 5 star funds which shows the breadth and strength of
our product lineup. In equities, on a global basis, over 70% of our funds on an asset weighted basis were
above medium, while beating benchmarks over 1, 3 and 5-year periods. And that's across domestic and
international strategies.

With regard to fixed income, we also had great performance. More than 75% of our taxable funds on an
asset weighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks over the same time frames.

So with this type of investment performance and the growth focus across the business, flows continue to
be strong. Overall, excluding former parent outflows, we were net positive $8.3 billion for the quarter, an
improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

In terms of total retail flows, excluding former parent, we were net positive by $7.7 billion, including
reinvested dividends. These positive flows were driven by continued momentum in the U.S., where we
were net inflows for 10 months of the year, and that included this location in March.

For the quarter, U.S. retail had $7.1 billion of net inflows. In fact, 30 Columbia strategies were in net
inflows and 10 had gross sales in excess of $1 billion in 2020. And that's across equities, fixed income and
our multi-manager lineup.

In EMEA retail, we were in net inflows of more than $600 million in the quarter with particular strength
in Continental Europe. Which more than offset outflows in the U.K. We're optimistic that the resolution of
Brexit and the gradual reopening of the U.K. economy will be positive in terms of investor sentiment.

And in terms of global institutional, we continue to gain traction, have a significant opportunity and
platform to grow. We have a compelling lineup of capabilities and excellent investment performance. We
recently added to our consultant relations team and strengthened client service.

In the quarter, we had net inflows ex-former parent of about $500 million, driven by continued strength in
EMEA. The pipeline looks attractive across our regions. So when I look across asset management, I'm very
pleased with the momentum over the last number of quarters and our ability to sustain it.

Stepping back to Ameriprise overall, we're in a terrific position. We're delivering strong results and further
reinforcing our record of navigating uncertain times. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and advisers
and the resilience that they've shown during this pandemic.

They've stayed focused on our clients, while continuing to drive the strong results you're seeing.

Nearly a month into 2021, I feel very good about the high level of client engagement and business activity
that we're generating. From a capital perspective, we're continuing to deliver a differentiated level of
return. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent, and we're generating strong free cash flow.

With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail and then I'll take your questions.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics,
with adjusted operating EPS, up 8%. As strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds
from low interest rates. Assets under management and administration reached a record $1.1 trillion
including nearly $15 billion of inflows from RAP and Asset Management.

We achieved our targeted reengineering for the year while investing for future growth in Advice & Wealth
Management and Asset Management. We continue to effectively manage our profile with continued mix
shifts to lower risk, higher margin, Retirement & Protection Solution offerings and are actively exploring
additional reinsurance opportunities. In 2020, we returned over $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders.

Our strong balance sheet fundamentals, coupled with sustained underlying business growth are driving
free cash flow generation across our business segments. This positions us well as we enter 2021. Let's
turn to slide 6. Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenue grew 6%, driven by strong underlying business
trends and equity market appreciation. After excluding the benefit of $92 million of higher short-term
interest rates in the prior period, general and administrative expenses are down 1%, even as we make
investments for growth, including the bank. Expenses also include higher compensation associated with
the impact of AMP share price appreciation in the quarter and strong business performance. We are able
to achieve this result through disciplined reengineering initiatives. In total, we delivered strong underlying
EPS growth, excluding interest rates of over 20% and very strong margins in the quarter.

Turning to slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth management delivered robust organic growth.
We continue to benefit from sustained traction and experienced adviser recruiting, a personalized client
experience, effectiveness of our digital tools and success in reaching more of our target market. As you
can see in these core areas, we had strong growth in client assets, wrap flows and adviser productivity.
This is a good foundation as we move forward.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

On Page 8, financial results and Advice Wealth Management was strong, with underlying adjusted
operating earnings, up 19% to $352 million after the $92 million interest rate headwind. This was driven
by strong wrap net inflows, improved transactional activity and higher market levels as well as continued
expense management. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, which would have been 160 basis
points improvement year-over-year, excluding change in interest rates. On a sequential basis, the margin
improved 60 basis points.

Turning to page 9. Asset Management delivered very good financial performance and continued improved
flow trends. The cumulative impact of outflows has been a significant headwind for us in the past. As flows
improved this year, that has declined, and if inflows continue, this would provide a tailwind for us in 2021.

In the quarter, we had inflows of $8.3 billion, excluding former parent-related flows, which is a $4.1 billion
improvement from a year ago. Investment performance, table stake for net inflows is excellent across a
diverse product set. Adjusted operating revenues were $798 million. Revenue increased 7%, reflecting
improved flow trends, stable fee rate and market appreciation after normalizing for the timing of the
performance fees.

General and administrative expenses remain well managed, reflecting disciplined expense reengineering
that funded investments for growth. Adjusted for the timing of performance fees and other compensation
related expense, G&A increased 2%. Putting this together, pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 13%
with a 39.5% margin. Overall, we are very encouraged by the continued progress the business is making
that is resulting in both strong flows and financial performance.

Let's turn to page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in
this market and rate environment. We are executing our strategy to shift our risk profile. In the quarter,
58% of sales were on products without living benefits, up 24% a year ago, driven by our new structured
variable annuity product, along with the decline in sales of VA products with limping benefits.

In Protection, sales were down 4% in total, with a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a
significant decline in index universal life, a product that is not as attractive in this rate environment. These
mix shifts are expected to continue going forward.

Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased
1% to $180 million. Like the industry, we are seeing an uptick in claim counts related to COVID-19, but
we've experienced a limited financial impact. Overall, claims were more favorable than the prior year. This
business is well managed. Net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry, and our hedging
has been extremely effective.

Turning to Page 11. In total, the Corporate & Other segment had a $60 million loss in the quarter, which
was a $39 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding the closed blocks, the loss in Corporate
segment improved 23% to $79 million. The prior-year period had elevated losses related to impairments
in the affordable housing portfolio. The current year had approximately $24 million of incremental
compensation expense related to the impacts of share price appreciation and company performance.

In our closed blocks, long-term care had $21 million of earnings in the quarter due to a significant
increase in terminations and lower new claims. Fixed annuities had a $2 million loss related to the low
interest rate environment. We continue to evaluate opportunities to execute additional reinsurance
transactions this year.

Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely
strong. Including a liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of
$1.9 billion, 98% hedge effectiveness in the quarter and 97% for the full year as well as a defensively
positioned investment portfolio. Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at
36%. We returned $502 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, totaling
over $1.8 billion for the full year. Overall, this was an excellent result for the quarter.
With that, we'll take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

The first question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I'd like to start with the Advice & Wealth wrap net flows. I mean, $7.9 billion was phenomenal. Just 1.5
years ago, we thought the run rate was just a little over $4 billion.

Could you give a little color on the background? What drove it so high this quarter? And what kind of a --
what might be a sustainable range?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Andrew, this is Jim. We continue to see a good pickup of activity over the course of the year. We were
still having very strong wrap flows even in the prior quarter, as you saw in our results over the year. But
we saw a bit of an increase in the fourth quarter. We actually grew our client base. We -- our new client
acquisition picked up even more. And we saw a good level of activity with our advisers.

Now some of that could be people feeling a little better as the vaccine came about as well. And the idea
that the economy and activities would continue to open up. But I would probably say we've seen a more
consistent, strong flow coming in. So we feel good about the underlying growth factors. And it was both
from the legacy clients that we have, organically, as well as some new clients that we added.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I see. Great. And then with regard to general and admin across the board. I mean, just a real solid
outcome, down 1% year-over-year. I think earlier last year, you were guiding to about $125 million
expense general and admin decline year-over-year. And it was down about $76 million as we looked at the
quarter. And I think some of that was the share price. Some of that was maybe other investments that you
were making in the company. But just kind of looking forward, could you kind of see another $50 million
pickup getting back into that $125 million objective, could you go further? Where are you looking toward
G&A into 2021?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Okay. So we definitely more than achieved the reengineering goal that we mentioned to you of $125
million. So that's sort of embedded in our numbers. I think what you're seeing, overall, and we've been
talking about that, not just for like the fourth quarter, but over the course of the remaining part of the
year after the pandemic. And so we had increased our reengineering goals in that regard, and we did
achieve them.

Our expenses are being managed very well. But I would also say, we did also increase some investments
we were making. We wanted to accelerate because of the great productivity we're having to even add a bit
more in some of the technology and the capabilities that we wanted to bring to both the advisers and from
a client perspective in our web activities.

So our investment agenda, last year, was actually a bit higher in total dollars than in the year before. So
that was embedded in our numbers.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

What I would say is the pickup you saw and a little bit of expenses were more from the stock price
appreciation and what that does in some of our deferral programs on a mark-to-market. And that
absorbed and some true-ups and some compensation based on the year and the strong fourth quarter.

So I feel good about the expenses going into the new year. I think they will increase if the economy opens
up a bit more as we bring travel and T&E and some other expenses back to some extent. And we continue
our investment agenda. But I think we're going to manage expenses pretty well. And you can -- you know
how we do that over time, but we'll continue to look at the business growth, the revenue growth and the
market climate as we do that.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. Maybe just lastly, on the fixed annuity block, I think you lost, what, $2 million in the quarter. Target
was to free up about $700 million in capital, but with kind of a money-losing line like that, do you think
you'll get close to the $700 million? And how imminent is that fixed annuity block sale?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Okay. I'll let Walter respond on the fixed annuity side.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

So as Jim said and I said in my remarks, we are certainly actively looking. And we do believe that
certainly, we haven't freed up the capital that's there. And then we have to gauge the basic fees and then
the implications of the rate, but we certainly feel that we will free up a reasonable amount of capital, and
we're working to evaluate.

Operator

Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.

Hung-Fai Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

Just staying with AWM for a moment. The transactional activities for mutual funds and loan duration
products appear to be back to pre-pandemic levels.

Can you talk about how they trended throughout the quarter and what you are seeing into January?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we definitely saw a pickup as we went from the second to the third to the fourth quarter in
transaction activities, and they got back, more of that, to a normal level. In fact, they were up 5% over
the year before fourth quarter. So we felt good. The pickup was, as you mentioned, both in the brokerage
activity, but as well as in some long duration. I mean, even in our own business, where we sell our
annuities, there was a strong pickup and continued in our structured annuity business and even a pickup
in the insurance business.

So we feel like we've gotten back to a more normalized level, and we're thinking that, that will continue as
we go through the new year.

Hung-Fai Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

Got it. And then in terms of kind of capital deployment, as you plan for 2021. Can you remind us how you
think about capital deployment priority in terms of returning to shareholders versus M&A for whether it's
AWM or Asset Management?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we have a consistent capital deployment strategy as you've seen over the years. We, first of all,
make the right investments in the business that we think are good and appropriate for us that we'll get
strong growth and productivity from. From there, we then evaluate the opportunities that may, from both
continuing to us to increase our dividend, buy back appropriately based on the free cash flow that we
generate, which is very strong.

But we also evaluate acquisition opportunities. And in that regard, we do see that there's more
opportunities coming about, but we're very disciplined of what would strategically help us grow, what we
can get good returns, what would fit into both our culture and the environment to keep us on track.

And so we will continue to evaluate that. We have excess capital that would help along those lines as well
as what we would do, as we look out based on the cash that we generate.

So that's the way we look at it. We haven't changed that philosophy, and we'll continue to focus in that
way as we move forward.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

It's Walter. I'll just say, that we are still targeting about a 90% for this year. I think your question was on
buyback.

Hung-Fai Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

Okay. I guess on the M&A side, just to cut your lever a little bit. Is there any kind of preference between
scale versus capabilities?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

We look more for additional capabilities and that will continue to add our ability for us to grow. I mean,
in certain acquisitions, it does provide some additional scale. We do, and we've invested heavily into our
platform capabilities and technology that we could add more assets with very minimal cost. So we feel
that we have that ability as well. But primarily, we look strategically about how we continue to round out
and have a strong quality asset manager globally.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays.

Jeremy Edward Campbell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just want to stick there with asset management for a minute here. And you gave some good color. But
I hope you could spend some time going in a little more detail around the fund flows. And kind of just
wondering which high-performing strategies may be showing accelerating inflow momentum? And maybe
if there are strategies that are showing either fading headwinds or an inflection from outflows to inflows?
Any color there would be fantastic.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I think if you look at our supplemental, you'll see, first of all, we've had very strong investment
performance across our fund family. I mean, particularly, if you look at -- take equities as an example,
our -- beating the benchmark on the 1, 3 and 5 year. 3 and 5 year is especially strong. Our fixed income
strategies are strong. Threadneedle is having very strong performance across their range.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

So we feel like we have a broader, good lineup of funds. As what I mentioned to in my talking points,
there were over 30 funds in that gross more than $1 billion. We had good net inflows and a number in the
range of funds. So it's broadened from where we were. So we are continuing to see good flow in equities,
particularly in the income-oriented equities across our lineup.

We're seeing a pickup in activity in global and European activity in some of our funds there. In fixed
income, we see it in certain of our income ranges, like mortgages, et cetera. And -- you -- also in equities
and manage the -- we have risk allocation funds that are doing well and also growth.

And we're probably going to see a bit more of a shift, a little bit more into value maybe, which we have
a lineup there as well. So I would say it's broadened out. So I would also reckon that if you look at our
lineup and equities, it's been very strong as from a flow perspective.

Jeremy Edward Campbell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then anything notable that's maybe inflected from outflows, inflows over the past year as the overall
numbers have improved?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

I don't have that in front of me. We can look at it. I would probably say we've seen some turnaround like
in like some of our more concentrated funds that maybe the performance wasn't as strong previously, that
has bounced back where just based on the lower sales activity, there's always a level of redemptions and
so you move into a net outflow.

But I think some of those have really rectified themselves in some of our fund groups like Contrarian and
a few of the larger fund areas like that, that are seeing some nice performance of select growth area, et
cetera.

So it's -- some of that is more of a -- yes, to your point, a little bit more of a turnaround or adjustment in
picking up sales and lowering of the redemptions.

Jeremy Edward Campbell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then just 1 final one, just a clarification on the fixed annuity block. I think one thing we've heard in
the industry is that with rates rising in the last quarter of the year, like the bid-ask has widened out a little
bit. What are you guys seeing around demand for that block of assets, especially now with Blackstone
getting even bigger among the alternative guys that have already played in the same box there too?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Walter, you want to?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes, it's Walter. We're seeing good demand, as you're indicating. And certainly, while spreads are widened
-- excuse me, rates have widened, we've seen some narrowing spreads, but we feel very comfortable,
we're in ranges that transactions could be executed.

The next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets.

Just 1 on the Advice & Wealth Management business. You've been seeing a nice recovery in margins over
the last few quarters. Just wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a color around where you think
margins could trend over the near term?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I think what we would probably say is we see the trend line continuing. We see our adviser
productivity still quite strong up. I mean, if you adjust for sort of the interest, adviser productivity was up
8% or more. And that's across a very large base. And so that's really positive. We've seen a pickup, as
you saw in our flows and fees, our financial planning is up.

So I would say that we want to continue to see that trend line of the margin continue to accrete. We also
think we sort of hit a low point on the interest side of that. And over time, as we deploy a bit more into
the bank and get some spread there, that would be helpful as well. So I would probably want to see that
margin continue to be targeted to get back into the 20-plus percent range.

Kenneth S. Lee
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. That's very helpful. And just 1 quick follow-up. Just on the fixed annuity reinsurance again. And it
sounds like it's not too much dependent on 10-year yields further rising, but I just want to check in to see
whether the outlook for executing a transaction is predicated on any further increase in 10-year yields?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Well, I would say we're in the range. And certainly, from that standpoint, with the rates where they are
and looking at the spreads that transactions can be done. So while it certainly be beneficial if you get a
higher rate coming in, but we are certainly feeling comfortable in this range. And we are, as Jim indicated,
pursuing it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just I guess, a follow-up on what you're thinking on risk transfer, is one of the reasons that we haven't
heard that you've executed a fixed annuity deal yet because you're considering doing something broader
on risk transfer, potentially including the long-term care or other insurance businesses? Or should we think
about those potential transactions being done separately?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

So Tom, I would probably say, as we look at it, and I'll have Walter comment, we always evaluate our
businesses and look at them, both individually and collectively. But there's nothing that ties together, us
doing a fixed transaction, fixed annuity transaction versus evaluating something in addition to or different
than. So Walter, I'll let you...

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes. So let me just say this. On fixed annuities, there's a higher confidence. And clearly, from our
standpoint, that's what we're focusing on. And -- but as Jim has said, we'll entertain and look at that from
that standpoint if the quality of our book and the earnings and everything, it certainly has potential, and
we will continue to evaluate it. But right now, we're focused on fixed annuities.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

Chairman & CEO

Yes. The other thing I would say, Tom, is, as you saw, we have shifted our emphasis and also both the new
business being put on, but also the current business, derisk a lot in our book, just like we had closed off
fixed, are shifting now to structured from guarantees, are shifting from fixed insurance to variable, which
is a better product, both for the client and us in this rate environment.

So we're continuing to change that mix and the shift of that mix, but we will definitely continue to
evaluate if there are other books that could be or should be reinsured or that would make sense for us.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got you. That's helpful. I guess a question on advice and wealth. The -- and Jim, I heard your comments
about, I guess, the confidence in terms of the quality of the flows. And is it fair to say that the move up to
almost $8 billion of wrap flows could be a new level that you might be able to sustain?

And I guess, just relatedly, I just want to make sure there was nothing unusual or unsustainable in this
quarter's result, like big ticket, new advisers transferring assets over? Do you feel like this could be a new
higher level for AWM?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I would say, Tom, as I mentioned, all of the full -- mainly the increase of the total flows, we've had
more of an ongoing of bringing in new advisers. And so there is nothing special in the fourth quarter. It
was a continuation. I mean we continue to bring in a good level of top advisers in the industry with good
production.

But as you saw, that's been consistent. Third quarter, we brought in good, even the second quarter after
the pandemic that picked up nicely and the first quarter was good.

So no, that continues as an ongoing trend line in the spot of numbers. But I would say that it was more
of increased activity from our current client flows as well as new clients that our current advisers were
bringing into the franchise.

Now whether that continues that $8 billion being the base? I can't tell you that, right? I think we all saw
a pickup in some level of activities in the fourth quarter in the industry, clients put some more money to
work because maybe it's a bit more optimism of the opening. But I would say, underlying it, we feel good
about the activity, the level. It wasn't like it went from $2 billion to $8 billion. It was $6 billion in the third
quarter. So -- but whether it's $8 billion or $7 billion or $6 billion, I can't tell you that exactly. I mean,
there's always some level of seasonality, et cetera, as well. But I feel good about the underlying, and I
feel good that there will be a good underlying trend there as we move into this year, if there's no major
disruption. So that's what I would say.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And then, Walter, just 1 final one. The tax rate moved up a little bit. Can you talk about how we should
think about modeling it over the next year or 2? Should we see a little bit of an increase because of the
mix moving to some higher tax businesses now?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes. So I think we pretty much hit our target for the year-end. And you're correct, I would say probably
a good number to think about. It will move up because of the business mix shift. And we're, I would say,
move up maybe, 18% would be something like a reasonable number.

18% in 2021 and 2022, would you think? Or...

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

No, it's just 2021...

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

You said, don't move more gradual.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Just the 2021, best guess right now, and that's without any change in tax laws, obviously.

Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I wanted to go back to the retail flows. If we just think about it at a high level, it seems like over the past
couple of years, on a gross basis, your gross inflows have been tracking around $13 billion a quarter, and
now we're at something like $16 billion for this year or for 2020.

I guess the question is, how much of this improvement, would you say is due to fund performance? And
how much of it is due to sort of structural changes around distribution platforms and how you've improved
your positioning there? If there's any way that you can help us think about that?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

I think, Suneet, it's a combination of factors. I think we've definitely -- first of all, we had some strong
investment performance, but I think it's been very consistent, and it's been -- and now for some that were
underperforming has bounced back nicely as well.

So across a larger range, we have very good performance. So I think investment performance is part
of a given here of what's necessary. I think that the team has done a really great job of broadening the
distribution, getting better relationships established more on the various platforms and the due diligence
and et cetera.

I think we have a wide range of products that are -- a wider range that are being considered than in the
past as well, and particularly, in certain categories that are making sense, like I said, in income categories.

So I think it's a combination of factors that we worked hard at, over the last number of years that is
starting to show some good results. We've made a lot of investments, both in the AWM business to
continue to get flows and productivity. And the same thing in the Asset Management business.

You know we continue -- we actually completed our whole trading and attribution platform in Columbia
Threadneedle. The ability to share research globally has improved the ability to actually get more data and
analytics informed to our investment people, our distribution people, to improve targeting, to understand
where there might be some good opportunities.

I actually think that Europe showed a nice bounce back. Remember, we had to go through a lot of change
there of establishing a whole European lineup of funds with Brexit, and it sort of took us out of the market
a bit for a while. And now that we're -- we've got that lineup established, we saw really strong flows into
Europe this last quarter.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

U.K. is still a little weak because of the Brexit and the economy being closed, but we still see some signs
that if that can open, with Brexit moving to another completion there that, that would also help.

So I think it's a combination of factors, just as you said. I wouldn't point to one, but that's what gives us a
good feeling as we move forward.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then I guess moving to AWM. And if we look at the capital that you have in that segment, it's
up about $300 million year-over-year. I'm assuming that's based on the capital you're putting in the bank.

So the question is, how much capital would you be willing to put in the bank to support growth? And how
do you think about that sort of the trade-off in terms of capital that you could use for other purposes and
then growing the bank?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

So I would stop, and I'll let Walter complete. I mean, we feel like as we can continue to derive good
margin and good returns from the bank activity as a complement to get greater spread or growth in
various loan books there, like our pledged assets was growing nicely in the fourth quarter. We took over
half of that book back and it -- the growth is being picked up, which is -- will be a good product for us.

So we feel very comfortable continuing to add capital as required there. As you can see, all overall returns
for the total firm are up in the mid- to upper 30s. So it's not as though we have a return issue. And with --
still, even with that, our cash flow and what we generate is strong. So it still gives us a good capital that
we could continue to return or look for inorganic acquisitions.

So I don't think that is going to be a pressing issue for us. But Walter, if you have something to comment.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

No. The only thing I'll add to that is that we, in our plan, allocated additional capital for the growth that
Jim was talking about and feel comfortable where obviously the return is certainly good when we look at it
relative to the off balance sheet.

So we feel comfortable with that and to maintain that risk return equation. So yes, we have allocated
more capital to it, and we have the capacity to do that.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

And also, Suneet, as you can see, whether we evaluate the sale and do a transaction of fixed annuities
that will free up the capital there or even lighten some of the areas of where we have in some of the fixed
books.

Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

A couple of follow-ups around the asset management business as well. Could you guys talk a little bit
about the -- around sort of the incremental improvement in retail flows that we've seen for several
quarters now? And by the way, it feels like that's continuing into the new year, which is great.

But that incremental improvement, how much of that is coming from AWM versus third party distribution?
I know that's been a big focus to kind of a bigger third-party distribution platforms. And as that occurs,
how sort of does that mix shift, if it's meaningful at all, sort of impact the profitability for AMP as a whole?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2021

So in other words, like if you get much bigger in third-party distribution, does it impact sort the net
profitability from wide kind of flows that are coming through those channels?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

So I'm not sure, I understand the second part of the question. But I would first -- for the first part, I
would say, we've seen a nice pickup through the third-party channels in complement to Ameriprise.

Ameriprise actually picked up a bit. But what I would just say, it is no different than what we're seeing
as a pickup across the major distributors that we have. And so both have been positive in that regard
because of the combination of the products that were put into market and the performance, et cetera.
From a -- regard to what does that mean, the economics between the internal sale and the external sale
to us is the same. I mean, we pay the same on it. The fees are the same on it, et cetera.

So I'm not sure there is a material difference in that way. But overall, as you continue to get good flows, I
think the return will be good for us.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. If no material difference, then we can skip like that second part. I guess when it comes to M&A,
you gave a little -- you've given a little bit of color. So it sounds like if you were to do something on the
Asset Management M&A side, you're kind of looking at capabilities over -- capability type of deals over
big deals for scale purposes alone. So what are the capabilities that you guys still find compelling, in
particular, to better complement the rest of your platform?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

So I would say, Alex, as we look at our business, we have a good lineup. We have scale. We have a global
platform today. It's not as though, however, I could say we have everything we would want in fixed or
equities or solutions in all parts of the world.

So I think we individually evaluate that from sort of the core of what we do manage today as well as
looking at more of the type of platforms that are necessary.

So we're growing a bit more in our solutions business. We're adding some alternatives, some real estate
and things like that over time. So it's more of, are their other distribution capabilities and other methods
to add to. And how we manage assets for clients, things like that as well as from a product perspective.

We're not against adding scale. Let me be very clear about that. But it would have to be a transaction
where it gives us a complement of things rather than we just want to put assets on the platform.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. It sounds like a pretty wide range there, yes. Just a quick follow-up for Walter. I think there was
an early question on G&A at a firm-wide level, not -- I know people like to ask about AWM. But if you
think about, for a while, G&A, about $3.1 billion in 2020. It sounds like that could grow a little bit if maybe
T&E comes back and things like that. What is a reasonable growth rate for 2021 off of that $3.1 billion
number?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Like I said, we're managing expenses so well, and we're looking at the environment, but I would say that
you should look for a couple of basis points that we will evaluate on that, a couple of percent points on
that. That's the range as we look at it.

And we're looking to -- again, sticking to our investment strategy at the same time with our reinsurance
programs, but that's a reasonable range, a couple of percent points.

Our Next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.

Ryan Joel Krueger
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I just had a quick one. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for further growth in the bank
over the next year? And the opportunity to move more sweep assets there?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll begin and let Walter add. So we see an opportunity to continue, as we said, both for the
movement of some of our sweep activities further into the bank. As you saw over the course of last year,
we moved the bank, up from roughly $4 billion to $8 billion. So we gradually started to shift more into the
bank.

We see that continuing in the 2021 here in the new year. We're also trying to add more on the product
capability, like we picked up the pledged loan book. We launched the mortgage product. We'll start to look
to add some deposit products, other deposit products towards the latter part of the year maybe into next
year.

So there are different things like that we're looking at. But we feel the opportunity that will continue to
shift a bit more into the bank on a gradual quarterly basis as we move forward.

Walter, do you want to add anything?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

No, no. I think to the other part of your question, we certainly have the capacity of our balance sheet to
accommodate what Jim just said to -- in the plans that we filed to grow the bank. So -- and the capital. So
we are certainly positioned with that.

Operator

Our last question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Can you help us think about the overall organic growth in the AWM business? We can obviously see the
wrap net flows in total client AUM. But are there other metrics you can point to that help to paint a more
holistic view of organic net flows and new client growth and how this compares to some of your peers?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, I could probably say that organic growth in client acquisition is up, nicely, both for the overall
client base, but in particular, also for what we would call the targeted clients that we want in the 525
category.

That has been nice and strong and picked up nicely as we went through the quarters in the year. The flows
from the current client base continues to be good and actually picked up further in the fourth quarter, as I
said to you.

The years that we're bringing in and the business and production they're bringing in continues along
the trend line that we spoke to you about. Particularly as we continue to move more years into both the

employee channel and the independent channel. And that has picked up nicely and continue to add scale
to us.

So it's a combination of factors. We continue to get more efficient based on this technology we deployed
that helps advisers concentrate more on their client engagement and can actually focus more on what
they can do to deepen.

Our advice formula is working really well. We have more than 50% of the -- majority of our clients now
have goals online that they can track and progress with and see very visibly of what they're doing and
executing their strategies.

So all of those things, we feel really strengthen the underlying core of the base. And so remember, with
the client base we have, with the deepening we have with those clients, with the further engagement
around Advice. And with our advisers now feeling a little more comfortable dealing with the pandemic
that they can go out and get more new clients and add clients in this environment or as the environment
improves and open, I think, will be a positive for us.

So I can't judge it against any particular. I know a number of our competitors have -- if I look at what the
warehouses reported, et cetera, I think we're standing pretty strong against that.

If I look at competitors that have acquired and have added through to acquisitions, of course, you're
always going to see an increase because of what's put on from that end on a comparative basis. So I can't
necessarily separate them. But I feel, organically, and from a core business, we're doing very well.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

And then just 1 question for long-term care. Obviously, good results this quarter. How are you thinking
about the potential for IBNR, given that people may be eligible to make a claim, but haven't because of
the pandemic and not wanting to enter facility or have people come into their homes?

And I guess related to that, the improvement in the books' performance over the last year. Does that have
any potential impact on your ability to execute a reinsurance transaction for it?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Walter, you've been working closely on that so.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

So we -- as you saw this year, we saw improvements both, unfortunately, in the termination and
less people entering into long-term facilities care. We have not built any of that into our unlocking
assumptions, and we are not -- again, we're monitoring this situation and we're seeing -- but with the
programs we've put in place, both on premium increased benefit shifts and things like that and the claims
that we're seeing, and we feel very good about the book, and it's risk protected -- it's risk situation.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Got it. Okay. And so no change really in terms of the -- either appetite for reinsurance or kind of ability to
execute on something...

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

We've seen some interest in it. We feel very good about the position of the risk profile that we see. But
certainly, we've seen some interest, and we'll just continue to evaluate.

Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think as we continue to see what is happening, both in our book, but also as we evaluate client
behavior or what's happening in that regard.

I think, if anything, the risk profile continues to look as more favorable, right? And as people better
understand what that is in the marketplace and what they might be interested in, I think it does open up
some additional thoughts or opportunities, possibly, as we go forward.

So I think we're very open to continue to see how that plays out and through, and maybe that will provide
other evaluation and opportunities as we go along.
