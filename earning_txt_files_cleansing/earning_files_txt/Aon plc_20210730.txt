AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has an
objection, you may disconnect your line at this time.

It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements
that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such
differences are described in the press release covering our second quarter 2021 results as well as having
been posted on our website.

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'm
joined virtually by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we
posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.

We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 Aon colleagues for their dedication and focus on serving clients.
Over the last year plus, certainly, every organization around the world has wrestled with how to best
support employees, how to manage record volatility and how to deliver more value to customers. At Aon,
our colleagues have led through all this while also preparing for a substantial integration. What our team
has accomplished is extraordinary. Today, we move forward with the benefit of all that work without the
constraint of regulatory uncertainty.

My remarks will cover our outstanding financial performance in Q2 and year-to-date, provide some
observations on the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson, then speak to our go-
forward plan to continue delivering great service and innovation on behalf of clients, enabling growth for
colleagues and delivering excellent return to shareholders.

In Q2, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of our key financial metrics, and I'd
note particular strength across the top and bottom line with 11% organic revenue growth, driven by mid-
single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from every solution line, highlighted the particular strength
in commercial risk at 14%, which translated into 17% adjusted EPS growth in Q2 and 13% free cash flow
growth for the first half.

Our 8% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue
growth from 4 of our 5 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering net new business generation
and ongoing strong retention.

We also saw double-digit growth overall in the more discretionary portions of our business, including
transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions.

One fantastic Aon United client example in the quarter was around cybersecurity organization design.
Aon colleagues came together across solution lines to address a significant yet common client challenge.
Our client's cyber risk was increasing, while their security organization faced the rapidly increasing cost
of attracting and retaining top talent to execute their cyber defense strategy. Colleagues from our cyber
solutions group within commercial risk and from our rewards practice within human capital combined with
our unique expertise in cyber risk, with best practices and benchmarking around talent and compensation.

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

The results for our client was an organizational design solution that aligns their HR and technology teams
to manage their cyber risk in a more cost and efficient way. The result for Aon is a repeatable offering that
helps address the common need for many of our clients in an area of growing risk.

I would also note that we saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue
to assess 3 key factors as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and
vaccine rollout, including the potential impact of the delta variant; as well as government stimulus; and
overall GDP growth. These macro conditions do affect our clients and our business. For example, we
continue to see impact to our travel and defense practice within Data & Analytic Services. Considering the
current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth
for the full year 2021 and over the long term.

Turning now to the termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson. We recently announced
our mutual agreement to move forward as 2 independent companies. On behalf of Aon, I'd like to thank
our counterparts at Willis Towers Watson for their professionalism over the past 16 months since we
announced the transaction. We have the utmost respect for them and have truly enjoyed getting to know
the team.

The combination had significant regulatory momentum, including, notably, approval from the European
Commission as well as approval from many jurisdictions globally who had thoroughly evaluated and vetted
the transaction. The exception was the United States. The demands made by the U.S. Department of
Justice on our U.S. business would have stifled innovation and reduced our client-serving capability.

Meeting these demands would have significantly impacted our existing U.S. business, the potential
shareholder value creation of the combination, and our ability to continue to drive ongoing progress
against our key financial metrics. Similarly, the path forward on litigation was untenable because current
course appear to take us well into 2022, and we could not accept that level of delay. Ultimately, the choice
was clear. We simply would never compromise colleague and client priorities to close the combination. Our
decision to end the combination and pay the termination fee creates certainty and clarity about how we
move forward. And we're confident this is the right decision for our firm, for our colleagues, our clients and
our shareholders. We move forward with energy and a high confidence in our ability to continue delivering
new and innovative solutions for clients, exceptional opportunity for colleagues and financial performance
for shareholders.

As we look forward, there are 3 important points that were clear when we announced the combination
and are equally, if not more, important now. First, the world is becoming more volatile, and clients need
a partner capable to accelerate innovation on their behalf. Just look at the socioeconomic impact of the
pandemic, the rise of state-sponsored cyber hacking, the floods in Eastern Europe, the fires in Western
America and the challenges globally of working remotely.

Second, the events of the past 16 months have honed the power of Aon United and our ability to work
together to deliver new sources of value to clients. Over this time, we crystallized our operating model
and cemented our one firm mindset. We've uncovered countless new growth, investment and efficiency
opportunities. And at this point, we're better connected across our firm with all the value of this work and
none of integration distractions.

Third, we're moving forward with a proven platform and are operating from a position of strength and
momentum, as demonstrated by our client feedback and colleague engagement scores at/or approaching
their highest levels for the past decade. Our colleagues are delivering client retention and net new
business generation across all solution lines, driving 8% organic revenue growth over the first half and
11% organic revenue growth this quarter, our strongest performance in almost 2 decades.

And our Aon Business Services operating platform is digitizing our firm, improving the client experience
and enabling efficiency, as demonstrated by operating margin expansion and 13% free cash flow growth
in the first half. Aon has never been in a better position to propel top and bottom line growth and build on
over a decade of progress on our key financial metrics.

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

In summary, our second quarter results demonstrate the success and momentum of our Aon United
strategy. We're operating from a position of strength, and we've never been better positioned to deliver for
clients, support our colleagues and generate shareholder value.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our results, the financial impact of the
termination and our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We delivered continued progress for both the
quarter and year-to-date, including an impressive 11% organic revenue growth in Q2. Through the first
half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into double-digit operating income, earnings
per share and free cash flow growth, demonstrating the power of our Aon United strategy. As I further
reflect on our performance for the first half of the year, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 11%
in the second quarter and 8% year-to-date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic
revenue growth for the full year 2021 and over the long term.

I would also note the total reported revenue was up 16% in Q2 and 12% year-to-date, including the
favorable impact from changes in FX rates, driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Our
strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline contributed to adjusted operating income growth
of 11% in Q2 and 14% through the first half of the year.

Turning to expenses and margins. There are 2 key points I wanted to describe further. First, I want to
speak to the impact of our previously communicated repatterning of expenses as compared to COVID-
impacted spend in 2020, which I'll describe before any 2021 growth. As we communicated in Q1, the
timing of expenses is changing year-over-year such that $135 million of expenses moved into Q2 from Q4.
This impact is due to the actions we took and highlighted last year as we reduced discretionary expenses
to be prepared for the potential impacts of COVID-19 and potential macroeconomic distress.

The $135 million is approximately 1.5% of our total 2020 expense base. In Q2, this repatterning
negatively impacted margins by approximately 470 basis points, resulting in Q2 operating margin
contraction of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by 370 basis points
in Q2 and 250 basis points for the first half of 2021. As we said before, we expected a further $65 million
to move from Q4 into Q3 for a total of $200 million of expenses moving out of Q4.

A second key factor impacting margins has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment.
In Q2, excluding the impact of repatterning, our strong revenue growth significantly outpaced expense
growth. We continue to evaluate investments using our ROIC framework. While we made deliberate
investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth, the expenses associated
with these investments were not fully incurred in Q2 and will ramp up during the second half of the year.
We also anticipate some potential resumption of T&E and modest potential increase in real estate costs as
more colleagues return to the office.

Collectively, the headwind from expense repatterning and tailwind from slow investment as compared to
growth were the main factors driving 100 basis points of margin contraction in Q2 and the 40 basis points
of margin expansion in the first half of 2021. Looking forward, as we've said historically, we expect to
deliver full margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term.

Turning back to the results in the quarter. We've translated strong operating income growth into adjusted
EPS growth of 17% in Q2 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was
a favorable impact of approximately $0.04 in Q2 and $0.22 year-to-date. If currency to remain stable at
today's rates, we'd expect a $0.02 per share favorable impact in Q3 and $0.01 per share favorable impact
in Q4.

As Greg mentioned, Aon and Willis Towers Watson mutually agreed to terminate our business combination
agreements and move forward immediately as 2 independent firms. In accordance with the business
combination agreement, we have paid the $1 billion termination fee to Willis Towers Watson.

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

With respect to the termination fee, our U.S. businesses were the primary focus of the Department of
Justice's challenge, and we paid this fee to defend that business from additional remedy divestitures that
are essential to our ability to serve clients as well as the continuing delay and uncertainty in completing
the combination.

As part of the termination, we also expect to incur approximately $350 million to $400 million of additional
charges in Q3 related to transaction costs and compensation expenses as well as a small number of
actions related to further steps on our Aon United operating model. These charges are related to costs to
terminate and conclude the combination, including related divestitures. They will all be incurred in Q3 as
part of a clean break with Willis Towers Watson.

Given the outstanding work our colleagues have done over the last past 16 months, we've taken steps
internally to ensure our colleagues share in the growth potential of the firm going forward, and this
includes those who are previously offered retention bonuses in connection with the combination. The
majority of the cash relating to these charges will be paid in Q3 and Q4. Aside from these transaction
costs, we do not expect any further significant impacts from the termination of the transaction on our
financials going forward.

Excluding the termination fee, our performance and outlook for free cash flow growth in 2021 and going
forward remain strong. Free cash flow increased 13% year-to-date to $1.3 billion, driven primarily by
strong operating income growth and a decline in structural uses of cash. We continue to expect to drive
free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our long-term track record of 14% CAGR over the
last 10 years, based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and reduced structural
use of cash. As we communicated in Q1, we continue to expect CapEx for the full year to increase
modestly year-over-year as we invest in technology to drive business growth.

Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain
our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the second quarter, we repurchased
approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $240 million. We also expect to continue to invest
organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our
priority areas of investments are focused on: addressing new forms of volatility like cyber; helping clients
build a resilient workforce, with better solutions around engagement and employee benefits; rethinking
access to capital, such as within intellectual property solutions; and addressing the underserved with
digital solutions like CoverWallet. Our M&A pipeline is focused on bringing innovation at scale to our
clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United.

Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance
sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. Our financial profile has
improved over the past 18 months. And considering our June 30 balance sheet and the payment of the
termination fee, we estimate we have $1.5 billion of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the
second half as we return to historical leverage ratios while maintaining our current investment-grade
credit ratings.

Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as EBITDA grows. Further,
I'd note that free cash flow generation in the second half is seasonally stronger than the first half, and we
intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best use based on return on capital.

In summary, we ended the second quarter in a position of strength as our Aon United strategy and
investments in long-term growth are driving strong top and bottom line performance. While the
termination of our combination with Willis Towers Watson was not the outcome we originally intended,
the opportunity for Aon has only grown. Our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our
expected long-term free cash flow growth and increased debt opportunity, provides financial flexibility to
unlock significant shareholder value creation over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'd be happy to take your questions.

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question in the queue is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question, Christa, is on buyback. So you pointed out that you guys typically stronger free cash
flow in the second half than the first half. So last year, you guys had around $1.5 billion in the second half
free cash flow. And then you alluded to maybe an incremental $1.5 billion of additional debt that you guys
could issue. So is that meant to imply that we could see around $3 billion of incremental share repurchase
in the back half of this year?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

So Elyse, we don't give guidance on share repurchase. But what we can say is, as you mentioned, cash
flow in the second half of the year is our seasonally strongest cash flow generating 2 quarters, Q3 and Q4.
We've been very clear that we have the opportunity for additional debt of $1.5 billion in the second half
of the year. And therefore, we have substantial cash to invest back into the firm, whether that's organic
investment, M&A or share repurchase. I would note that we do allocate cash based on return on capital,
cash-on-cash returns. And buyback remains our highest return on capital opportunity. Even at today's
prices, it is a fantastic return on capital for shareholders. And on that basis, we expect to do substantial
share repurchases in the second half of the year.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then my second question, I think you mentioned that folks that were eligible for retention
payment with the transaction would be receiving some payments. I think that was the basis for the charge
that you're going to take in the third quarter. But can you -- so I just want to confirm that.

And then can you give us a sense of how the employee retention has trended? I know the past year has
been during the pandemic, but [ why ] the merger is going on or even over the past couple of months with
the regulatory review have retention levels been in line with normal expectations? Just can you give us a
sense of how things have been trending there?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So regarding the $350 million to $400 million of additional charges in Q3, they're really related to
the transaction costs and compensation expenses as well as a small number of expenses related to further
steps in our Aon United operating model. I would say these charges really related to the cost to terminate
and conclude the combination as part of a clean break with Willis Towers Watson.

Then in terms of the outstanding work our colleagues have done over the past 16 months, we've taken
steps to ensure that our colleagues share in the growth potential of the firm going forward, and that
includes those who are previously offered retention bonuses in connection with the combination. So with
that, I'll hand to Eric to talk to retention overall at Aon.

Eric Andersen
President

Sure. Thanks, Christa. And I would just say, Elyse, we continue to attract great people in all the key
strategic areas for growth and expertise that Christa outlined in her remarks. We don't really pay too
much attention to the headlines or the commentators that talk about talent and certainly reject the
premise of disruption that we've been hearing. Look, we have a great team. And just to give you a couple

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

of facts, voluntary attrition continues to be excellent for us. We just did a poll survey in June and ended up
with top quartile engagement scores for our colleagues.

These trends, I think, are the result of all the flexibility and connectivity and the support we've been giving
to our colleagues over the last 6 months, not just with the Willis Towers Watson combination, but also with
the pandemic. And so we feel really good about the team that we have, the bench, the development of all
of our talent and know we're really well-positioned going forward.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Maybe I just would add a thought on top of that. When you think of it as a colleague, you're sitting across
the table from a client, listening to their challenges, their opportunities. Where would you want to be? A
firm with the capability we have in the here and now, what we can do, also a greater level of spend and
investment on innovation than anyone in the world. And it's just been a great story that's evolved. And the
pandemic, as I tried to highlight in the opening comments, it just amplified the importance of this around
the need for innovation, climate, intellectual property, cyber, et cetera. So all these things come together
to make the value proposition quite unique.

But really, I just want to call out, our colleagues have been just magnificent over the last 16 months in
every way, shape or form in terms of how they not only managed through the -- all the different pieces
around integration, but also what they've done for clients had just been extraordinary to see, and that's
shown up in multiple ways.

Operator

Next question in the queue is from Suneet Kamath with Citi.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I guess for Christa, to start. If I think back to your guidance sort of pre-Willis Towers Watson in terms
of free cash flow growth, you typically talked about a double-digit growth rate. In today's deck, you just
talked about free cash flow growth. So I'm just trying to figure out, is there something that's different
relative to what you said in the past. Or do you still think double-digit free cash flow growth over the long
term is what you guys are positioned to achieve?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Suneet, we absolutely believe in double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term, and we're
incredibly excited about the growth potential in terms of revenue, margins and free cash flow over the
long term. So nothing's changed there.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then I did note in the second quarter, free cash flow was down maybe 13% relative to the
second quarter of last year. Is there anything unusual that sort of drove that?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

No, nothing. What we would say, look, you should really look at free cash flow growth over the course of
the year, and we will absolutely grow free cash flow during 2021. And I would just say, quarter-to-quarter,
there are some lumpy things. We're very excited about the free cash flow growth year-to-date of 13%.

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Okay. Makes sense. And I guess maybe a bigger-picture question for Greg. Post this experience with Willis
Towers Watson, just want to ask about your thoughts on -- you've mentioned transformative M&A in your
deck. What are you thinking there in terms of M&A? Should we be expecting things that you do would be
on the smaller side, given the past 16 months? Or just how you're thinking about inorganic growth?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Suneet, for us, you come back to what Christa teed up just a bit ago on Elyse's question. We have --
we've just got an enormously positive performance, and that sort of carried through over the last 16
months. That's shown up in what really is a focal point for Aon, which is translating revenue into free cash
flow and that ability to grow free cash flow.

And with that cash, it really comes how we invest it, and it truly comes back to return on invested capital.
So we're always going to take steps that actually maximize return on invested capital with cash-on-
cash return. And we'll look to opportunities or we have tremendous organic opportunities, inorganic
opportunities, all shapes and sizes. And very much looking forward to sort of driving shareholder value,
applying the cash in the appropriate way. And we'll continue to look for all the means to do that.

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

And maybe I might just add and say, look, we are incredibly excited about the cash flow growth potential
of the firm, both in the second half of the year and going forward. And then obviously, our ability to grow
debt as EBITDA grows. We've got an enormous amount of cash to invest. And we'll invest organically,
inorganically with M&A and in buyback on a return on capital basis.

And as I mentioned, we've actually got a number of priority areas for investment, really focused on
meeting unmet needs for clients. Addressing new forms of volatility like cyber, helping clients build a
resilient workforce, rethinking access to capital in innovative new areas like intellectual property and
addressing the underserved through our investments like CoverWallet. So we've got an exciting array of
investments that we are continuing to invest in. And so we're really excited about the growth potential
going forward.

Operator

Next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So I had a question on just organic growth in the commercial lines -- commercial risk business. And it was
obviously 14% for you guys, strong for most of your peers as well. And obviously, comps were pretty easy.
But other than comps, what are sort of the main drivers of that? I think you mentioned in your release,
pricing was a modest positive. But just trying to assess what are some of the things that might not be
sustainable because they're related to --either to a catch-up in business activity or other things versus
things that might continue at least in the near term.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Maybe I'll just start with a couple of overview thoughts, and then Eric can talk about the different pieces
in geographies around the world, where we've seen really strength on strength continue to evolve. For
us, there was really no catch-up in any way, shape or form. You go back to early last year, we're in a
very strong position and that just continued to build through the pandemic. As clients' need increased,
our ability to react to clients and serve them also continued to increase. And so Jimmy, we end up with
new business generation, net new business generation, really at all-time highs. And it continued to build,
moved into the third and fourth quarter of last year. Now you see it in the first half of this year.

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

And really for the last 5 quarters, a real kind of tour de force effort on behalf of colleagues around the
world on all areas as it relates to growth. It's why we underscore and reinforce the mid-single-digit organic
for the year and ongoing beyond 2021. But it really is the fundamental. It really is how we're connecting
with clients and supporting clients, how we're applying the Aon United strategy, bringing the best of our
firm to clients every day. And that actually has just strengthened and grown. That's why we really come
out of the last 18 months -- when you think about the chassis of Aon -- the Aon United Foundation, it's
stronger than ever before. But Eric, a lot's going on around the world by geography, a lot of good stories.
What -- thoughts?

Eric Andersen
President

Yes, sure. Listen, I think there's a couple of things to point out. One is we had double-digit growth in
commercial risk in each of our geographies around the world, so it's really a great quarter all the way
around. Really strong rollover, really strong retention, which really sets you up in the future for continued
growth.

And it was a couple of things. The core P&C business performed really well. So really pleased about that
everywhere, but also the discretionary work that Greg and Christa had talked about, whether it was
transaction liability, cyber, construction, other project-type work, all of which were performing very well
equally across the world. So we had a really solid performance everywhere and really excited about it,
obviously.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just on pricing, you mentioned a modest positive. It would have seemed like it would be
better than modest positive just given what we've been seeing with the underwriters. But what are your --
what's the sort of color on that?

Eric Andersen
President

Yes, sure. It's always a great question because people always wonder why the direct carrier sort of per
unit price doesn't show up and translate across to the intermediaries on the risk side. And listen, I would
just say clients make choices when prices move up or down, right? And one of the things that we do with
them, and I think I've mentioned this in the past, we first helped them to identify the risk that they have
and then try and manage them, right, without the use of risk transfer.

And then as prices go up, clients finance more of it themselves if they can handle it. And then ultimately,
when you get to the risk transfer part of whether they decide to trade the risk, they make choices there,
too, the amount of insurance that they buy, the coinsurance, deductibles, things they try and manage for
them, the budget that they have to spend on topics like risk transfer. So it's never a direct line from what
a carrier publishes as rate to what a client actually does for the risk that they're trying to transfer.

And so all those areas that we're talking about, clients have a real heightened focus on during a time when
pricing is increasing. They get very specific around how they try and manage it themselves or finance it
themselves before they try and risk transfer it into the market.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Are you seeing more pushback from clients on price hikes? Because it seems like commentary from the
underwriter side is still pretty positive on what's going on.

Eric Andersen
President

Well, listen, clients certainly don't want, after 3 years of a rising market, to pay more for a similar risk. But
ultimately, I think what they've done is they've continued to just get more sophisticated. And I think we've

been able to help them with our data and analytics and insight to be able to make better choices around
how they handle the risks.

Next question is from Greg Peters with Raymond James.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

My first question will just stay focused on organic. Beyond Commercial Risk Solutions, you had some very
strong results in Reinsurance and in Health. And Greg, I think you did call out a headwind or 2 in data
analytics. Your guidance is for mid-single-digit or better going forward. I guess what I'm trying to get at
here is how much of the second quarter result was a snapback and how much of it is permanent in terms
of how we should think about organic going forward?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Greg, I appreciate the question and the thought. Terrific. Listen, as we think about the growth profile,
we keep coming back to this idea of the commitment around mid-single-digit or greater for the rest of
the year for the year and for 2022 and beyond. If you think about it, we did 4 of the 5 solution lines that
were meeting that standard in the first half when we got great trajectory. No doubt there's variance sort
of in the solution lines. I highlighted in data analytics services. Look, our travel business is still under a
tremendous amount of pressure, as you would expect. But still, our colleagues are fighting through that
and finding opportunities, finding ways to connect with clients, and you're seeing that.

So for us, we feel good about mid-single-digit or greater. We've made that commitment before. And there
was really no snapback. As we said before, that the ability to connect with clients and drive growth has
sustained throughout the pandemic and certainly sustained, even amplified into 2021. So that's why we
feel quite strong about the outlook.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then, Christa, on the expense repatterning. As we gradually return back to whatever the new
normal looks like, when we -- and I know you don't like to comment on projections, but when I think
about 2022, are we going to have another expense repatterning if things go back to what the old normal
was? Or is what you're experiencing here in '21 sort of the new bar, which we can go to and measure on a
quarterly -- quarter-over-quarter basis going forward?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

So it is the new basis, and you should expect expenses to be consistent with this patterning going forward.
And so really, what I would say is it's reflecting changes from a COVID-impacted 2020 expense base. So
2020 was the unusual patterning, Greg. And 2021, we're repatterning to get back to our normal expense
patterning. So this is the correct performance across the year going forward.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Just to reiterate, Greg, as Christa highlighted very well, when you think about this over the course of a
year and what we're trying to do, not within quarters, exceptional performance that continues to improve.

Next question is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

I wanted to stick on cash flow. And I guess, first, it looks like -- I was just wondering, do you think CapEx
looked a little bit lower than I had thought? Do you still expect that to be up for the full year? And also, I
think -- when I think about the seasonality and second half is higher than the first half, I just wanted to
confirm that that's excluding the $350 million to $400 million of termination costs and retention bonuses.
So we should think -- I think that would take away a lot of the seasonality but just wanted to confirm that.

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So firstly, we expect very strong cash flow in the second half. And yes, it excludes the -- we expect
the termination expenses to be adjusted out of Q3. Having said that, we do expect free cash flow to be
strong for the full year. And we're extremely excited, obviously, about the 13% growth in free cash flow
year-to-date.

In terms of your question around CapEx, we would say that CapEx should increase modestly year-over-
year, driven by investments in technology to drive long-term growth. And I would say, look, going forward,
we expect free cash flow to grow double digits over the long term, really driven by 3 key things: growth
in operating income; declining uses of cash; and improvements in working capital. And so we're really
excited about the growth in free cash flow long term as well as our ability to add debt as EBITDA continues
to grow. So a substantial amount of cash to invest back in Aon.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a question just -- it definitely sounds just on the Willis merger
and any sort of impact that might have on the business. I know you guys spoke about it in response to
a previous question, but I'm hearing that it sounds like you didn't want the deal to stretch into '22. And
also, obviously, there are the retention payments and some of the other termination payments. I guess
could you just maybe elaborate on if you would expect any sort of disruption going forward in the organic
growth?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

So maybe let's start. It's worth actually just putting things in context when you think about sort of where
we've come over the last 16 months, and we'll translate it directly into growth, which will be a great story
as we've shown in the first half.

When you take a step back over the last 16 months, the primary thesis behind the combination is
exceptionally strong. In fact, pandemic has made it stronger over that period of time. Obviously, strong
shareholder approval, regulatory momentum in virtually every jurisdiction around the world. And I noted,
obviously, DG COMP in the European theater, but others around the world as well.

And just so you understand, we reached an impasse in the U.S. Department of Justice. We could have
completed the deal in a couple of ways, but we made the choice to reject what we believe were 2
unacceptable options. One was the remedies, and we could have completed the deal through the remedy
just like we did in Europe, but it wouldn't have been the right answer for us. It simply would not have
been the right answer. We roughly know what it would take. But candidly, it would have damaged our
client-serving capability as we described before, stifled innovation. And as I've said, you've heard Eric and
Christa talk, that we will never sacrifice our Aon United strategy to close the transaction. That's not going
to happen. And in the end, that's where we were on the remedies side.

And the second option, equally unappealing, was litigation. We have an exceptionally strong hand from
our view. But the time line pushed the deal into 2022, it looks -- looked like it did in every way, shape or
form, also unacceptable. We're just not going to wait in a holding pattern well into 2022 to sort of have
this resolved. It's just too long. So we wanted to make a choice, David, for our firm. And we said, on our
terms, to move forward independently, and obviously, they're in a position of strength. If you think about
where we were in 2020 and now where we are now, very much in a position of strength. And we're excited
about how we move forward with real enthusiasm given by our team and the strength of our Aon United

strategy. So that's the rough picture in terms of sort of where we are, but when we get to growth, Eric or
Christa, anything else you want to comment on that?

Eric Andersen
President

Yes. Sure, Greg. Maybe I'll talk a little bit about the integration planning process and how we're using that
work to help propel us forward post this event. Maybe to go back a little bit, we went into the, certainly,
the pandemic and the Willis Towers Watson combination, in a great place, right? We are very strong going
in, both operationally and with revenue growth. And when we started the integration management effort,
we were essentially able to maintain the client momentum and continue to work on our strategy. During
the last 16 months of planning, the teams really perfected our Aon operating model, the delivering Aon
United strategy as well as our go-to-market. How do we actually pull all these teams together for the
benefit of our clients? All that's going to be incorporated going forward, which will continue to likely build
the momentum. So I think while we came into this process in a strong position, I think we're actually
coming out of it in an even stronger position.

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Completely agree. And I would say, our financial results have strengthened in growth, in margins and in
free cash flow. If you look at 2021, we delivered 11% growth in Q2 organically, 8% growth organically
year-to-date and 13% growth in free cash flow year-to-date, just stunning financial results in 2021.
Building on a really strong 2020, 1% growth organically through COVID, 100 basis point margin expansion
to 28.5% and 64% growth in free cash flow to $2.6 billion. Building on a decade of progress, 4% average
organic growth over the last 10 years, 890 basis points in margin expansion over the last 10 years and
15% free cash flow growth each and every year over the last 10 years. So a phenomenal set of financial
results. So we would say our financial results have strengthened in growth, margin and free cash flow. But
Greg, do you just want to come back to the growth question?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Yes. So again, David, I think just want to give you a sense of sort of what that history has been over the
last 16 months, to your question, then you kind of say, "Well, how does that translate into growth?" I
think Eric's point was really important. The fundamental capability actually has strengthened. We spend so
much time thinking about opportunities on the growth side, on the efficiency side, on the investment side.
And we came up with a ton of them, and we're incorporating all of those. All that then reinforced by the
Aon United strategy and the connectivity.

And ironically, COVID created a situation where we are on WebEx. Now there's different systems. WebEx
connected our firm in a way in the -- sitting across a virtual table from clients in a way that's been
incredibly, incredibly powerful. And that's what's led to literally net new business growth and also growth
with existing clients, the strongest we've ever seen. So it really positions us exceptionally well to continue
to increase market share and take share around the world, which we've been doing and continue to do as
well as create net new.

And I just don't want to get away. This is not a zero-sum game for us. We're winning a zero-sum game,
but it isn't about that. It's about net new, as we put solutions in place around cyber, intellectual property
and climate. I mean it's just the 3 we talk about a lot. We spend a tremendous amount of time focused
on those. So we're very excited about the growth prospects. That's why we talk about mid-single-digit or
greater across all our solution lines in 2021 and beyond.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great. I mean I really appreciate that color. That's really helpful. And yes, I mean it's obviously not
showing up any sort of disruption. There's no evidence of that in the results. So I definitely appreciate
that.

Next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I guess my first question is on -- how do I put it -- communication philosophy because it looks like the
expectation for organic growth for 2021 is mid-single-digits or higher. And I would have assume that
this is, on a year-over-year basis, probably just a phenomenal operating environment with the economy,
hopefully coming back, and sustained rate increases. And I'm wondering whether the use of the sort of
traditional language event indicates that we shouldn't expect too much from these tailwinds.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Well, Meyer, I wouldn't say that. In fact, what we're trying to highlight is, listen, there's still a lot of
volatility out there in the world. It's moving around. We essentially have said, in the face of that volatility,
wherever it goes, we're very confident in mid-single-digit or greater. By the way, not just for this year,
but ongoing, as a piece, and then double-digit free cash flow. And our view is that economic model, as
we think about it from an investor standpoint, is extraordinary in terms of sort of what that means. And
so we -- what we want to do is make sure you understand. We're reflecting the high confidence in our
ability to achieve that, and we'll keep pushing forward on that basis. So there's -- it's not about rebound
or anything else. But Christa, anything else you want to add in that?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

The only other thing I'd add, Meyer, is there is still some macroeconomic uncertainty, and there are still
some areas of our business like travel, events that haven't fully come back. And so we will navigate
through this and still deliver phenomenal financial results for the year, mid-single-digit or greater in 2021
and going forward.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. Second question, I appreciate Eric's comment on employee retention and
attrition. When we look at the, I don't know, number of brokers that are out there in, I guess, reinsurance
or large accounts, is there any increased competition for talent that would require higher organic growth
rates for margin expansion than we've seen in the past?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

I think we just say, overall, it's competitive out there. It's always competitive, as Eric highlighted very
well. We love the model we have because the opportunity for colleagues at an individual level, and
literally together, and that's really what we talk about individual capabilities, but also collective greatness,
collective ability to succeed, is exceptional at Aon. And that's, for us, has served us exceptionally well.

But there's -- I wouldn't say -- Eric, to comment on this -- any more or less competition than there's
always been in terms of sort of what's been out there.

Eric Andersen
President

Yes, I agree, Greg. I mean it's always been a very competitive business across all the risk platforms,
whether it's the primary brokerage or the reinsurance brokerage. And so yes, I think, just ultimately, we
continue to have to bring our best each and every day to our clients with the best tools and insight. And if
we do that, I think we'll be fine. Christa, anything you'd add?

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And maybe just on the margin point. I guess what I would say is we can grow margins in any
operating environment. You saw last year when we produced 1% organic revenue growth, we expanded
margins.

And because of the investments we've made in Aon Business Services, really bringing together all of our
operating sort of infrastructure in one place, centers of excellence, all the people and capabilities in one
place, we're able to drive productivity benefits each year at scale. And so we'll continue to drive margin
expansion for the foreseeable future, building on the 890 basis points of margin expansion we drove for 90
basis points a year over the -- each year. And so we expect to drive margin expansion in 2021 and each
year thereafter regardless of growth.

Operator

Next question is from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. If I heard you correctly earlier, I think you had talked about a ramp in investment that's going to pick
up in the near future. I guess in my mind, the gap of growth in revenues versus underlying expenses is
going to narrow. Look, in the long run, this normalizes, as you talked about the expectations for margin
expansion. Can you just give us a frame to think about how this looks like in the short run in the extent to
which this gap may narrow and maybe some economic sensitivity to the broader recovery?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So really, the point I think I was making, Phil, was in Q2, we did see greater underlying margin
expansion, excluding the repatterning of expenses, because growth outpaced our ability to invest in that
growth. And a lot of the investments, while we did invest in people and operations and technology to drive
our business, some of that was not fully incurred in Q2. So it was really a statement about Q2 specifically,
Phil. And really, what I would say is -- what you said is exactly right, over the long term, growth and
expenses to drive that growth will be aligned.

Philip Michael Stefano
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And so my follow-on -- that fits perfectly into my follow-up of you've talked about deliberate
investments in people and technology. Can you give us a little more color on what exactly that means or
maybe an example or 2 of what's driving these deliberate investments?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean there's a number of areas, Phil, where we're investing. So maybe I'll start, and Eric and Greg,
you can jump in. But as an example, we're investing a lot in technology to help deliver innovative data
analytics-based solutions to our clients to help them manage risk, retirement and health more effectively.
So that will be one area. We're investing in security because, obviously, the security environment and
cyber has become a great threat for colleagues. And so that is another big area of investment. The last is
I'd say we're actually continuing to hire great talent into the firm. But maybe, Eric and Greg, do you want
to sort of build on it?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Just one piece, one real quick. And then I do want to -- Eric I know had some really important comments
here. When you think about the Aon Business Services, so that platform, as Christa described the
technology investment, cyber investment, this is -- over the years, it would have been very difficult for us

16

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

to sort of create the global impact of that investment because we couldn't scale it. We can scale it now.
So as Christa and the team guide this investment is incredibly efficient in terms of how we can actually
increase capability and make it real around the world. So I just don't want to lose that point. It's very,
very fundamental to what Aon Business Services is all about.

But in addition to that, these net new areas that Christa was alluding to are really exciting, and this
is a net new capability we're bringing in. Some of it is connected to risk. Some of it is connected to
just fundamental capabilities, certainly on the climate side, property side, on cyber side. So a lot we're
doing that we are very excited about in terms of the ability to help clients address issues critical to them
but, heretofore, haven't been addressed in the way they need it to be. So a lot happening from that
standpoint. But Eric, anything else you can throw in on this?

Eric Andersen
President

Yes. You just gave a great overview of it, Greg. But if you think about intellectual property and the new
skills required there, you think about the new risk areas about renewable energy, about climate modeling
capabilities that we need. You mentioned cyber. And certainly in our human capital business, trying to
invest in how we do ESG at scale for clients. So there's a whole lot happening on the ground, as Christa
said, that is supporting the growth that we're seeing and recognizing that we need to keep investing to
make sure we keep growing.

Operator

And the last question that we have in the queue for today is from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Two quick questions here. First one, just curious, Christa, what's the revenue impact of the sale of the
retirement exchange? It looks like you're continuing forward with that one.

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the revenue, Brian, in 2020 for the retiree exchange was $176 million. It is predominantly a Q4
business, as you know well.

Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Great. And then second question, I'm just curious, as a part of this process that you're going on with
Willis Towers Watson, you'd obviously identified a lot of cost synergies and expense potential savings
from the transaction. I'm curious if you were able to identify any -- specifically for Aon, that you could see
potentially here going forward to help with cost savings and efficiencies as you went through this process?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Brian, this is what we were alluding to and talked about before, and I'll come back -- Eric is going to
jump in on this. Eric's led this integration in the last 16 months, and this has really been at the one foot
level, literally as we engage and connect with colleagues around the world and with clients around the
world. And we've seen and uncovered multiple growth opportunities, investment opportunities, expense
opportunities, highly applicable to Aon specifically. And all those are going to be baked in as we move
forward. This is back to the theme. We came into March 2020 with exceptional capability strength. And
what we've done over the last 16 months around integration is fundamental improvement of our platform.
What's going to be the combination combined platform, but it absolutely is applicable to Aon. But Eric, you
led this, what do you think?

AON PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

President

Yes, Greg, I think there's 2 buckets, right? I think on the revenue synergies, you're talking about the client
value-creation model that we've been working on, otherwise are delivering in Aon United strategy about
how do you bring the firm together. We're talking about before how we're perfecting it. That was done in
the context of the integration management planning.

But also on the expense side, certainly real estate strategy, technology strategy, all the areas that you
would think, having a fresh look with teams that were built specifically to try and challenge the status quo
and really pressure test how can we do it better, how can we do it more efficiently? How do we leverage
our Aon Business Services model in a way that we had really started during pre-Willis Towers Watson
combination to really accelerate how we actually use that capability? I wouldn't necessarily call that last
one new. I would just call it expanding what we've been building and really getting it embedded across the
firm across the world.

Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
