We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your report
We also do not allow audio-taping and ask that you respect that
All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements
For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-K
All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements that we make wherever they appear
You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating
