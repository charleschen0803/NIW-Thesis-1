Thank you, Lance, and good morning everyone
Overall, we had a fantastic quarter and I’m very pleased with our results
We are hitting on all cylinders just like we said we would and this quarter’s performance is another example of why Halliburton is the execution company
Here are few highlights from the third quarter
Total company revenue was $5.4 billion, representing a 10% increase compared to our second quarter results, and we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow
Once again, we outgrew our peers on a global basis showing that we are taking global market share
Our North American revenue increased by 14%, significantly outpacing the average sequential U.S
land rig count growth of 6%
Total operating income increased 55% to over $630 million, primarily driven by continued strengthening of market conditions in North America and improved profitability in our drilling and evaluation product lines
Our completion and production division revenue increased 13% with 215 basis points of margin expansion, despite the approximately 50 basis-point negative impact of Hurricane Harvey
The drilling and evaluation division revenue increased 4% while operating margins expanded by 260 basis points to approximately 9%, demonstrating solid execution in our international franchise
Finally, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Summit ESP, which is an important strategic step in building out our production oriented business lines and makes us the number two ESP provider in North America
In August, the Texas Gulf Coast was severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey and our fantastic employees worked closely together to support those in our organization and the entire community affected by the storm
As a result of the weather, we had a few customers temporarily suspend activity in both the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford
We also experienced increased costs because diesel fuel was temporarily unavailable and reduced deficiency due to sand supply chain disruptions, both of which negatively affected our margins for the quarter
In spite of these disruptions, the sophistication and hard work of our supply chain organization allowed us to quickly adapt to these challenges and continue to execute and deliver superior service quality
Let me take a moment and talk about a few things we said about North America in the second quarter call
We told you the rig count growth would plateau, and that’s exactly what it did
We said our North America sequential revenue would significantly outperform average U.S
land rig count growth, and it did
We told you that our completion and production margins would continue to expand, and they did
We said operators were beginning to optimize as opposed to maximize the use of sand and turn to technology to increase production; this trend held true as we saw average sand per well remain flat sequentially
And finally, we said we would have the highest returns in the industry, and we do as we continue to outgrow our peers and take market share
Now, let me spend some more time on each of these topics
During the quarter, the U.S
land rig count effectively flattened as customers reacted to shareholder input and their own view of market conditions for the balance of the year
However, our revenue increased and we saw improved activity in our completions related product lines due to the natural lag between drilling and completing wells
Today, the industry is drilling approximately the same footage as in 2014 with half the rigs while completions intensity has significantly increased
As the rig count stabilizes, our customers are focused on efficiencies, optimization and making more barrels
These are all things Halliburton does really well, differentiating us from our peers
And I’m pleased with the progress we’ve made this quarter towards normalized margins in North America
Our strategy is working
And as I said in the past, the path to normalized margins begins with customer urgency, and I still see that urgency today
We have three levers to achieve our margin goals
And they’re, one, increasing pricing; two, improving equipment utilization; and three, structurally reducing our costs
Increasing pricing is important, but it’s just one component we can leverage to reach our goal
Ultimately, we will utilize a combination of all three levers to return to normalized margins
All three levers are important, and the great thing about Halliburton’s scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull on them all in a meaningful way
And you know Halliburton is the execution company
We’re going to pull these levers as necessary to get to our normalized margins
The North America completions market remains tight and we continue to push pricing across our portfolio every day
Demand for our completions equipment and service quality remains strong
The improving oil price outlook provides runway for us to increase our portfolio pricing as we go forward
So, let me be clear; we still have the ability to push price
Equipment utilization comes in a couple of forms
First, it has to be working; and second, it has to be working for the right customers
Our fleet is sold out for the remainder of the year and into 2018. We continue to place our equipment with those customers who know how to effectively and efficiently use us to increase their productivity, which improves our utilization
As for reducing costs, we continue to remove unnecessary costs from our company
It’s also critical that we save costs and increase utilization through the use of technology
Our wellhead ExpressKinect unit is a perfect example
This equipment allows us to increase our utilization by switching wellheads faster and more safely when doing zipper-frac operations
As a result, we’re able to reduce the number of people on location and improve our equipment efficiency
Let’s now take a minute and talk about a few topics that I hear frequently debated in the market
The first is sand
During the third quarter, total sand volume for Halliburton continued to increase, but our average sand per well remained sequentially flat
Data points from the last two quarters and my discussions with customers indicate customers are focused on cost-effective production
They hear a lot of conflicting anecdotes about sand used today, because they are based on individual operators and individual basis
But the facts are, for Halliburton, sand per well was down in the Bakken, Rockies and Northeast, and it was up in the Permian Basin
This happened because customers that know the production characteristics of the reservoirs have streamlined their operations to focus on cost per barrel of oil equivalent and are optimizing sand utilization
Conversely, those customers that are still drilling the whole acreage or exploring production boundaries at their reservoirs are continuing the pump jobs with higher sand loads
At the end of the day, Halliburton benefits from both scenarios
The second topic is supply and demand for pressure pumping equipment
Now, first, let me be clear
I believe the market is undersupplied today
At the same time, equipment is being used harder and maintenance costs are higher
As a result, there will be a greater call for new equipment, just to replace the active equipment that’s being worn out more quickly, meaning the day when supply and demand come into balance is further out than people think
Now, I believe companies that are not making money will struggle to build new equipment beyond their current fleet, take or pay commitments, as they work with constraint budgets and struggle to find capital to fund further purchases
You see many announcements of new fleet deployments, but no announcement of fleet retirements
But, I can tell you, they are happening
Next, completions intensity is not slowing down
We are pumping more sand with less equipment, and as a result, the maintenance costs associated with today’s completion designs are increasing
The design of our equipment gives us an advantage over the market that even we have seen an increase in maintenance costs
I believe deferred maintenance is happening throughout the industry
A proxy for deferred maintenance and the simplest place to see it is in the industry and horsepower creeping crew size
Now, while Halliburton continues to operate with an average fleet size 36,000 horsepower per crew and have for the last several years, the rest of the industry is now averaging closer to 45,000 horsepower per crew
Deferred maintenance is creating this equipment redundancy on location
The bottom line is that Halliburton has the advantage to respond to customer demand by bringing less equipment to the well side and designing our equipment to require less maintenance cost
Building our equipment internally gives us the ability to respond quickly to market changes and to design our equipment to reduce the total cost of ownership
As a follow-up to that point, I said last quarter, I’d be crazy to talk about new build equipment in detail terms, and this remains the case
But, what I said has not changed
We are first and foremost a returns focused organization
And we will only bring out new build equipment under certain conditions
And those conditions are, one, backed by customer commitment; two, captures leading-edge pricing, which is accretive to our margins; and finally, three, it generates acceptable return on investment
Turning to the international markets
Outside North America, our more conservative outlook for the last several quarters is proving accurate
Our customers around the world have different breakeven thresholds and production requirements that all face the headwinds of the current commodity price environment
Due to lower cash flow and project economics, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs
The result of this combination is less activity and more pricing pressure
In contrast to North America, where we believe that a $50 oil price drives significant activity, customers tell me, the longer duration international markets will react less to absolute oil price but more to a positive view of where price will be for several years
This isn’t surprising, given the longer investment cycle that many of our customers face
I believe that we found a floor in the international rig count earlier this year
However, due to the longer term contractual nature of international markets and the level of continuing price pressure, I expect discounts will offset activity gains over the near-term
In this environment, we have to execute and maintain margin by controlling costs
Our international organization is committed to making the toughest of markets sustainable and has continued to rightsize the business during the quarter, demonstrating impressive control over their costs
In addition, customers embrace the way we go to market
We collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and it is paying off
In the eastern hemisphere, we achieved a modest improvement in activity in the third quarter but the landscape remains challenged
Pricing pressure and cost cutting remained major themes, and the use of technology to lower the cost per BOE is ever more important
Our products service lines continue to deliver technology that drives our value proposition, maximizing asset value
The Middle East remains our most active international market with the largest part of the work focused on mature fields
Among many important technologies deployed in the region, I’d like to highlight our CoreVault system
This system effectively stores sidewall cores with up to 2.5 times more oil and gas than previously
This additional reservoir characterization and effective means for doing so allow our customers to make more barrels and reduce cost
In the Middle East, we continue to build on our leading position in project management because of our ability to work closely with our customers and deliver superior service quality
Our most recent contract win is a project to deliver over 300 wells in Oman, and we’ve seen increased project management activity in this region, allowing us to showcase our services and technologies that reduce time and cost on a project
We have seen significant market share growth as we have a proven execution track record and deliver better wells for our customers
In the North Sea, this year has been about reducing production costs through standardization and technology optimization
We have the technology portfolio to solve our customers’ problems from single density, variable slurry cement that can be used for all sections of well to our data sphere array monitoring system that due to its modular design provides customized reservoir monitoring
We help structurally reduce cost by decreasing the time to drill and complete a well or by producing more barrels
What’s most important to point out is how we collaborate with customers and together we create terrific results
Another example is in the North Sea where our ruthless focus on service quality, collaboration with the operator and rig contractor, driving efficiency on critical path items and responding to customer insight has laid to record-breaking performance on a multi-well integrated services contract
This project is truly a collaborative effort and through the collective thought and execution of the team, they’ve been able to reduce the time to finish a full year scope of work by over 165 days, saving over $170 million
The improved efficiency came from two areas, technique solutions for record growing performance and collaboration where our commercially aligned team coordinated collaborative planning and execution
Latin America saw a slight rig count growth in the third quarter, driven by increased activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil
While activity is improving, the pricing pressures across the region make it increasingly important to be efficient as we execute
This quarter in Mexico, we designed and ran especially drill bit to help tackle a particularly difficult reservoir
This design reduced the necessary runs in hole, resulting in a three-day reduction in rig time
This example shows that even in a tough pricing environment, there is an appetite for new technology, especially if there were reduced costs
Finally, in recent days, commodity prices have experienced the modest rebound, as we have seen some signs of tightening in the macro supply demand picture
However, I still believe that the oil and gas industry will largely remain in a range-bound commodity price environment in the near to medium term
I am confident that Halliburton has the right strategy
In this environment, we’re focused on returns and capital discipline
In this type of sustaining market, I expect that our capital spending should be approximately aligned with our depreciation expense
Our working capital should continue to improve over time as our day sales outstanding declines to traditional levels and our free cash flow conversion should be in line with or exceed our peers, and to deliver these metrics, we’re focused on maximizing asset utilization, improving working capital velocity, and capital discipline
When I take all of those together, I am confident that we will generate solid free cash flow in today’s market environment
Pure and simple, Halliburton is proud to be a service company, and we believe our investors and customers appreciate that
I am confident that we’re working on the right things that create the most value and generate the highest returns
Our strong competitive position is not only a function of geographic footprint, it’s also the depths of the products and services that we provide to our customers and use it to generate industry-leading returns for our shareholders
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update
Thanks, Chris
In closing, there are few things I want to highlight
First, I am very pleased with our third quarter results
I want to thank each of our employees for their hardworking commitment to execute at every turn and deliver Halliburton’s value preposition
These results clearly demonstrate the strength of our franchise and our ability to adapt to any environment
Second, Halliburton’s relative performance in the 2018 will remain strong, as a result of our ability to grow our North America revenue and margins, and improve our position in our international businesses
Finally, our strategy is working and we intend to stay the course
We are focused on delivering superior execution for our customers and achieving industry-leading returns and cash flow conversion for our shareholders
Now, let’s open it up for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning, James
Thanks, James
Look, our strategy is pretty simple and very executable, and it’s to be the best service company
And that means we focused on leading returns, margins and revenue growth, and along with that technology, directly focused on returns, collaborating with our customers, the strong BD group, and then delivering service quality
I think that returns focused, I mean that is our strategy and is working
Look, I -- when we look at the market as it’s playing out, I think we have what we need to execute
And as I described, what we see in front of us in terms of activity as I described international, described North America, I think at that sort of pace, then we ought to have a business that returns solid cash flow from that kind of market
And so, when I’ve described those types of parameters it’s to describe what we see
And you know again, focused on returns means that we are very efficient and we drive a lot of velocity with the equipment that we have, utilization, things of that nature, spend a lot of time talking about that
But that is in fact how we see generating a lot of cash flow
Well, I think we’re always going to be about returns
Clearly, we need share to drive the volume and the scale, and that’s where the efficiency and some of the things that I talk about are more meaningful at scale
But, specific to the building question, I’m just going to go back to what I said on this, answered this a couple of quarters now, but the three conditions being to meet client, leading edge pricing and generating adequate returns
But I don’t think that -- there is a lot of juice in utilization, there is a lot of juice and in effect market share comes from better utilization
So, I think you kind of under estimate the number of levers that we have in the market when it comes down to something that binary
Yes, thanks
This is -- for us, we call that integrated asset management, and it is really a capital allocation question; it’s where do we put our capital and what will make the best returns
And so, -- and along with those better returns, my view, a key part of that is asset velocity and to produce returns for shareholders
So, we’re not going to tie up our cash and things that we think had longer duration and likely lower returns
We have done some smaller deals, we’ve done a few things, we understand this space
And when we do it, we’ll do it with other people’s money to maintain those kinds of returns
Bill, I think that’s reasonable
Our guys push price all of the time
And so, maybe not accelerating the way it did in the spring, but still opportunity and momentum in North America
I think if we look at Q3, bit of a cause just as commodity prices bounced into the 40s, but we talked about, first and foremost finding the right customer to drive efficiency, and it doesn’t change the demand for our services today, and along with that comes ability to move on price
Well, I think if the question’s around the path to normalized margins, I’ve always said, it starts with customer urgency
We see that, calendar power being also important in terms of driving utilization and working with the efficient client
In terms of how far there is to move, each of those levers has fair amount of ways to move
I won’t give you the specifics, but it’s one of those things that we work every day
But it’s the precision around, for example what happens on location being able to measure all of those steps
And again, the measurement scale is a bit of a different matter
But, what’s special about that is that now when we make changes and drive efficiency, again driving better utilization, we can drive across just a fleet at a time
And so that gives me a lot of confidence around the ability to improve the number of turns on equipment in a day
From a cost perspective, we’re constantly working that
I’ve talked about our continuous improvement being one of the pillars of our strategy but really, Angie that’s what we do to systematically drive cost out of all of the components of our business
And often times that includes technology, I referred to some of that in my script
But, it’ll also be technology that takes all kinds of forms, some is customer-facing, a lot of it internally facing, so that all of that value accrues to us in terms of reducing costs
That’s probably about 60% of the fleet Q10 today
But again, big push several years ago with our retrofit, the fleet with Q10, don’t have that same requirement today, and that’s when we talk about capital, that’s why I’m comfortable with the kind of capital progression we laid out in this kind of market, because there is a very natural sort of replacement that happens over time
I will do that with Q10s, but I don’t think it’s going to be -- it won’t be anything like maybe what you’ve seen in the past
And the Q10s really have delivered and we continue to go to market with solidly less horsepower than competitors
And I think that also gets to -- if we think about the industry’s pace of replacement, I think we’re going to well outperform that and that’s going to show up in the form of returns
Short answer, yes, Jud, on to get there in 2018. The pulling on the different levers, you know us; we’re going to pull every lever we got
But those are the big levers that when we pull them, have the more meaningful impact
So, I’m not going to break one above the other necessarily, actually all three of them are very powerful
Well that’s the all of production is an opportunity for us to grow, in our wheelhouse, it’s -- as I talk about our strategy to collaborate an engineered solution, that fits well with what we do
Summit was such a nice add, I give a shout out to the new employees we have from Summit, fantastic business and yes, very scalable
And clearly, the plan is to scale that beyond the U.S
and to our international operations
And those activities are underway
The other components of that, I’ve talked about chemicals
I think that will likely be a more organic move than it is M&A, maybe a little bit a bolt-on around that
But, the guys are working hard at that every day, and I really think that that is something that we will just systematically build out and we’ll talk about it from time-to-time along that path, probably not every quarter but as it continues to grow, we’ll give you a better insight into that
Yes
I mean, Jim, our board is full through the first part of 2018 and the reality is the only people that probably talk to more customers than me is my BD group and I talk to the BD group every day
And so, we’re having constructive conversations about 2018 and encouraging discussions
I think the $50 oil through the planning cycle is a great thing, yes, and I mean this is the right time
And so, they are absolutely planning to work next year, hedges are getting in place
And I think it’s -- interesting thing, when we talk to our customers, we don’t lecture our customers, I mean, we listen to them
Because we listen to them, we hear the message that they are getting from their stakeholders, and I think this is important point
Because all of our -- with all of our conversations, my personal conversations, some are very focused on returns and there are others that are going to shoot them in because they like the acreage that they have
But that’s because that’s what their shareholders want
And at the end of the day, we work for both sets of customers
And so, I am very encouraged going into 2018, Jim
And Jim, I’ll just add the discussion around
Production and some of these things is part of what makes that C&P group a big group, and there is a lot of moving parts in there
Yes
I think that team absolutely executing in the marketplace
I think we are taking share by virtue of the performance that we saw this quarter and we’ve seen for several quarters
But, I think probably what’s more important when we think about international is I think we have a more realistic view what that market is
For example, we’re seeing more activity or at least signs of activity in the form of FIDs and things
But those are not tenders; those don’t convert the service revenue quickly
We did find the bottom, but I think that those are very competitive markets with a lot of visibility around the activity in those international markets
And so, I do believe that the pricing pressure will persist and likely offset a lot of the gains that you might expect from that kind of activity, particularly as we go into 2018.
And I think that’s just part of a process
It’s a combination of our continuous improvement activities where we’re consistently looking at technology to drive cost out
But, it’s hard; it is taking those things and turning it into how do we operate at lower cost point
And I would say that that team has done that consistently
That’s not a projection
They will just manage all the levers that they have to manage
I think that’s behind as at the end of Q3.
Yes
No, very excited about our strategy and I think we’ve laid that out but it is -- at its heart, and this is an important distinction and open architecture strategy which makes it a lot easier for customers to use
I think there will always be competition around data between customers
And I think customers are taking a closer and closer look at their own data and who owns and controls that data, and I suspect they will control it more so
It is just very competitive for our customers
And so, when we think about that, we want to make certain that we have the right set of tools that can be used effectively by them
And they’re open in the sense that our customers uptake of those tools and they can make them do what they need them to do
And I think tools is probably an oversimplification, I’m describing more of a platform and the philosophy
But, as we work with Microsoft for example, that’s again an ability to leverage I think a lot of investment and R&D and cloud that will help our customers
But again, I will tell you, we are very returns oriented
And so, when I think about what we do, we’re very specific about where we create value and what it proves to us versus necessarily scatter shooting across the space
I think all of our -- that will create -- lower costs, will create more headroom for our clients to work, no question
But I think the more important dynamic in the Permian than the price necessarily today is, is they better understand those reservoirs and how to make the best production at the lower cost per BOE
That’s why I held out the Permian as one where we see sands per well increasing
And I think that’s more evidentiary of our market that’s being learned as opposed to one being optimized and that makes perfect sense and that’s what our customers do
They make the best investment and they manage their business very carefully
And so, when they make decisions to do more of something, there will be a reason for that
I think that’s more the reason in West Texas today as reservoirs are better understood in other parts of the country that’s where you start to see more of that optimization
But, I would expect that it does free up more cash for doing more work, which is certainly positive
But, I would not assume that they don’t optimize in West Texas at some point either
I think as I described earlier specific to margins in C&P, we are making investments in other things, like production group is in that group
And so, there is more going on in that than purely North America frac
But, as it is a different question in terms of what kind of bottlenecks do we see, obviously, the Hurricane drove some bottlenecks here and across the country
I think that as mines come on, a lot of the bottlenecks you hear about around sand get alleviated
Again, when you have a bit of a differentiated view to those things given where we are and the fact our ability to buy at scale particularly with respect to sand, but then equally around people, again, we talk about people lot and our ability to hire the national level for people I think gives us a differentiated position as we view those bottlenecks
A plenty of room to move on all three
I mean that’s what we do every day; we’re always working on those
I mean, if the question is, are the one-offs in there, the reality there aren’t any one-offs in there; that group is absolutely executing very well, and I would say systematically driving cost out of the business, they winning the contracts they need to win and they are -0 we continue to drive technology into the D&E group that I think is paying off
And I’ve talked about the investment we’ve made in Sperry for some time
And I think that’s beginning to pay off
I think there is a lot of runway actually left to go there
But, it will come probably in fits and starts as we go into next year
With respect to production specifically, it will be -- we’ll invest in those things that we think we can uniquely use to drive value for us; in those places where we can’t, we’ll look to partner
I -- very much the strategy being executed now
So, I won’t get into all -- anymore details than that
But I would say, generally speaking, we’re not afraid to and in fact we will seek to, in some cases partner with companies that we believe are in businesses that we don’t want to be in, but maybe form part of the value chain
And I think we’ve demonstrated the ability to do that very effectively
In fact with rigs, we work very closely with rig contractors and had a lot of success in our project management business, driving lower cost and better returns, probably for us and the rig contractor than we would, if we were somehow jointly investing
We’ll have to see when 2018 gets here, Kurt
I mean, we use all of them that are available
And I am not -- and I will tell you, I put sort of equal time in all three of them
I’ll just go back to sort of Chris’s view -- incredible, as he mentioned earlier, we’ve come a long way, two quarters and we will continue to use all of those levers as we move into next year
Thank you, Shannon
Look, I’d like to wrap the call up with a couple of key takeaways today
First, the third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the effectiveness of our strategy
I thank all of our employees for their commitment to execution
Finally, I expect Halliburton’s relative performance in 2018 will remain strong as a result of our ability to grow North America revenue and margins and improve our position in our international businesses
So, I look forward to talking with you next quarter
Shannon, you may close out the call
