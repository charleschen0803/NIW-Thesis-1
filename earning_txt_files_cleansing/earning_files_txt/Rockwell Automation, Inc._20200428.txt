ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind
everyone, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms.
Kourakos, please go ahead.

Jessica Kourakos
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Sharon. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter
Fiscal 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and
Patrick Goris, our CFO.

Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our
website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures.
Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.

A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days. For your
convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of
today's call.

Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the
expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results
may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described
in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings.

So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin,
let me say to everyone listening on this call, thank you for your interest and support, and I hope that you
and those close to you are safe and healthy.

We're truly in unprecedented times, and our first priority is protecting employee health and safety. Our
employees are doing outstanding work, keeping our customers' operations up and running strong during
this crisis. We are an essential business that supports critical infrastructure because our customers
cannot build their products at scale without automation. So thank you to our employees, our suppliers,
our distribution partners and everyone else who has been working hard to serve our customers and
communities.

This pandemic will change how we live our lives and operate our businesses in the future. Rockwell's
financial strength positions us well to overcome the current challenges and to be more valuable than ever
as our customers learn to operate in this new environment.

Let me now review the topics for today's call. I'll first offer some color on how our people and our
customers are effectively managing through this crisis, then provide a brief overview of our Q2
performance, including a status report on our operations and supply chain, and then focus more time on
what we are seeing today and our outlook.

Please turn to Page 3 of the slide deck. When I think about how our business is being conducted right
now and how we are handling the current environment, I start with our employees and our customers.
The safety of our employees is always our first priority. We closely follow U.S. CDC and World Health
Organization guidelines. For our manufacturing workforce, we provide health screening, enhanced cleaning

measures and use of safety equipment and have implemented social distancing between workstations
across our facilities.

Our nonmanufacturing workforce has been exercising social distancing and working from home for over
a month now, and we have restricted nonessential business travel. Where we can, we are using our own
technologies and services to keep our people productive and support our customers. For example, we now
have 2,500 seats of Vuforia Augmented Reality activated internally to conduct witness testing as well as
customer support and training.

Turning to our customers. This health crisis is bringing us even closer to our customers as everyone is
rallying to help manufacture more necessary goods than ever before. For example, we have a strong
partnership with 3M as they ramp up respirator production. And we recently collaborated with Heng Chang
Machinery, a Chinese hygiene products machine builder, to increase the production capacity of their high-
speed mask-making machine. Our solution, based on Logix and our next-generation motion controllers,
increased their output from 150 to 500 masks per minute.

We're also supporting Abbott Labs and other pharmaceutical companies to increase testing capacity and
with GE Healthcare and others to ramp up their production of ventilators. We're also supporting companies
like Roche and Cytiva, who are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines and are investing in
manufacturing capabilities so that they are ready to scale up production as soon as possible.

We're also helping companies who have repurposed manufacturing assets to now produce masks,
ventilators, test kits and other equipment our communities desperately need. For example, automotive
and mining OEMs are now making ventilators, and food and beverage machine builders are now making
masks. Even the Jameson Distillery, which is located near our offices in Ireland, has diverted some of their
whiskey production lines to now produce alcohol sanitizing gels for hospitals and medical centers. These
are just a few stories showcasing the innovation going on in these difficult times.

Let's now turn to Slide 4 for our Q2 performance and some key accomplishments in the quarter. Total sales
grew slightly in the quarter, including a 3-point contribution from inorganic investments primarily related
to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were flat versus last year and were in line with what we were
expecting heading into the quarter despite an 18% decline in China related to COVID-19.

Our organic sales performance benefited from strong sales of Logix, which grew 8% versus the prior year,
led by strength in North America, particularly in Automotive and Food & Beverage. In addition to Logix, we
continue to see strong growth in other core platforms like Independent Cart Technology for motion control
and Network Infrastructure. Both of these grew double digits in the quarter, and we think we're taking
share.

We also had a number of important strategic wins in Automotive, Food & Beverage, Life Sciences, Mining
and Tire, where we were not the incumbent control platform. Information Solutions & Connected Services,
or IS/CS for short, was down slightly, largely due to a difficult comparison with major projects last year.
That said, the pipeline for IS/CS remains strong. We built strong backlog in the quarter, and we still expect
IS/CS sales to reach $400 million for the year.

Our IoT offering continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace. In the quarter, Rockwell was awarded
the Industrial IoT Company of the Year by Compass Intelligence, which adds to our recent recognition in
Gartner's annual Magic Quadrant survey as a leader in IoT software. We also saw very strong orders for
Vuforia as we help customers expand their remote engineering capabilities during this pandemic.

Turning now to Q2 earnings. Adjusted EPS grew 19% and includes the release of our bonus accrual. And
finally, free cash flow grew about 90% in the quarter, underscoring Rockwell's solid financial health and
strong balance sheet position.

Let's now turn to Slide 5 where I will provide a few highlights of our Q2 organic end-market performance.
Our discrete market segment grew high single digits, led by Auto, which grew by over 20% year-over-
year and grew double digits sequentially. Auto performed well above expectations in the quarter in almost
every region. We continue to see very good growth in electric vehicle programs, and we also benefited
from some traditional projects that we have been tracking.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Our hybrid market segment was flat in Q2. Our largest segment, Food & Beverage, grew low single digits,
including growth at packaging OEMs. Life Sciences declined modestly due to the very tough comparison
to last year. Many of our customers, particularly those in consumer-focused hybrid industries, have been
running their operations 24/7 to meet very high demand and have had little opportunity to implement
projects that divert resources from current production.

Process markets were down mid-single-digits with Oil & Gas also down mid-single digits. We'll talk more
about our outlook for Oil & Gas in just a few minutes.

Turning now to Slide 6 and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. Growth in North America
and Latin America was offset by an 18% decline in China, which accounts for about 6% of our global
revenue. We saw growth in Asia Pacific, excluding China, led by EV battery. EMEA was down low single
digits, but with relative strength in Automotive, Food & Beverage, Life Sciences and Semiconductor.

Turning now to Slide 7. Let me take a few minutes here to discuss how we're navigating the current
environment.

I first want to say that I'm very proud of the efforts we have taken to build resiliency in our operations and
supply chain over the years. Our plants are operational and meeting current demand. And while the many
actions we had taken to mitigate tariffs over the last couple of years reduced the impact from COVID-19
on our Chinese supply chain, segments of our global supply chain are seeing some disruption. Among the
biggest challenges have been reworking product flows to implement social distancing and managing shifts
to limit the number of employees in a facility at one time. We are actively managing what is a very fluid
situation. Patrick will have more details on our operations and supply chain.

As part of our actions to mitigate risk in our business and maintain our strong financial position, we
announced earlier this month a series of temporary actions that better align our cost with a reduction in
demand. The following principles are the foundation for our decision-making: keep our customer focus,
protect employment as much as possible, protect our most important initiatives and investments to drive
long-term differentiation, and position our company for success over the long term.

Balancing the near term with the long term is extremely important. This is why we have and we intend to
maintain a strong balance sheet. Our capital deployment priorities remain in order, organic and inorganic
investments, followed by dividends and repurchases.

Turning to Slide 8. The acquisitions we announced last quarter, ASEM and Kalypso, are expected to close
in the next couple of weeks. And we will continue to look for additional inorganic investment opportunities
that advance our strategic objectives. We expect ASEM and Kalypso to contribute about 0.5 point of
revenue growth this year and over 1 point of growth on a full year basis. Together with our other inorganic
investments, we expect total inorganic sales to contribute about 4 to 4.5 points of top line growth in fiscal
2020.

Turning now to our outlook on Slide 9. We're focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders
through these rapidly changing market conditions. The path of recovery is difficult to predict. As we
put together our forecast, we looked at a variety of inputs: our recent performance in China and Italy,
near-term industrial production forecast, our daily sales and order intake through April, and what we are
hearing from end customers and distributors. We expect that our fiscal third quarter sales will be down
approximately 20% year-over-year, followed by sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.

As a result, these are our expectations for the year. Organic sales down 8% at the midpoint. We continue
to expect inorganic investments, now including ASEM and Kalypso, to contribute about 4 to 4.5 points of
growth to the year. Adjusted EPS of $7.30 at the midpoint, and we're projecting free cash flow to convert
at over 100%.

As you can see from our organic end market projections for the second half and full year on Slide 10, the
midpoint of our projections assumes both Automotive and Oil & Gas will see particularly steep declines
in the second half of the year. We are also modeling more modest declines in Food & Beverage and other
industries. We expect most verticals, including Auto, to bottom in Q3 and gradually recover starting in Q4,
with the exception of Oil & Gas that we think will take longer to recover.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our second quarter financial
performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I will keep my remarks on second quarter results very
brief, and then switch to comments about our strong financial position, what we see in our supply chain
and operations, cost mitigation activities and fiscal 2020 outlook.

I'll start on Slide 11. For the second quarter, organic sales growth -- organic sales were down 0.2%
compared to last year, and acquisitions contributed 3% to total growth. Currency translation was a larger
headwind than expected due to a stronger U.S. dollar and decreased sales by 1.5 points. Within the
quarter, organic sales were up low single digits through February with very weak performance in China.
Again, through February, China was down about 30%, more than offset by better-than-expected North
America product sales. Global organic sales weakened in March and were down a little less than 4% for
the month compared to last year.

Overall company backlog, including for products and for solutions and services, increased both
sequentially and on a year-over-year basis for the quarter. Segment operating margin was 22.1%, up 80
basis points compared to last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense.

Our incentive programs are highly correlated to financial performance of the company. We no longer
expect an incentive compensation payout to be earned for fiscal 2020, and we, therefore, released our
incentive accruals. This represents a little over 200 basis points of segment margin tailwind, which is
partially offset by margin headwinds related to currency at a little over 0.5 point of margin and the impact
of acquisitions at about 0.5 point.

General corporate net expense was lower compared to last year, mainly as a result of favorable mark-to-
market adjustments related to our deferred and nonqualified compensation plans. I'll cover the adjusted
EPS bridge on a following slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 12.4% was
lower than we expected due to several discrete items. Free cash flow in the quarter of about $200 million
included a $31 million tax payment, which represents the second installment on the repatriation tax that is
owed as a result of tax reform.

Slide 12 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. Architecture
& Software had good organic growth in the quarter with strong Logix performance. Lower incentive
compensation was a margin tailwind of about 200 basis points for this segment. Currency was about a 100
basis point headwind.

Organic sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 3.6% with the products within this
segment down 3%, and the solutions and services down about 4%. Sensia represents almost all of the
5.8% revenue growth from inorganic investments in this segment. Second quarter organic book-to-bill for
our solutions and services businesses was 1.10. As I mentioned earlier, we built backlog in the quarter,
including for solutions and services. But starting in March, we have seen an increase in project delays
initiated by customers. Operating margin for the Control Products & Solutions segment was down 70 basis
points compared to last year.

The next slide, 13, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '19 to Q2 fiscal '20. As you can see,
core performance was up a little less than $0.05 despite no organic revenue growth in the quarter. Large
tailwinds related to incentive compensation and the lower tax rate were partially offset by the impacts of
currency.

As expected, the impact of acquisitions was about neutral.

I'll switch gears now and will provide some comments about our balance sheet and liquidity. Please move
to Slide 14. We continue to be in a strong position with regard to our capital structure and liquidity. At
March 31, cash on the balance sheet was about $640 million, and our total debt was about $2.1 billion.
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.0.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Last week, we executed a $400 million term loan, which provides us the funds to close 2 previously
announced acquisitions, ASEM and Kalypso, as well as funds for other general corporate purposes. The 2
acquisitions are expected to close in the next few weeks with a combined purchase price of approximately
$300 million. We expect both acquisitions to add about 0.5 point of revenue to fiscal '20 sales and expect
the fiscal '20 adjusted EPS impact, including onetime costs, to be about a $0.05 headwind.

From a liquidity perspective, in addition to our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation profile,
we have access to the commercial paper market for our operating needs. Our single A credit ratings
provide us good access to the capital markets. And finally, our liquidity is also supported by our existing
$1.25 billion credit facility, which expires in November of 2023. This credit facility remains available and
undrawn.

The only financial covenant we have in our debt agreements is an EBITDA to interest expense covenant
in our credit facility and the new term loan. We have plenty of room under that covenant, which we have
pressure-tested in our scenario analyses. As you know, we have a history of generating solid free cash
flow, and we expect, just like in prior downturns, working capital reduction to be a source of cash.

We're also deferring noncritical capital expenditures and now expect fiscal '20 capital expenditures to be
closer to $130 million compared to $160 million prior guidance. Finally, as we have mentioned in the past,
we do not expect to have any mandatory U.S. pension contributions in the next few years, and we have no
long-term debt maturities until 2025. In a nutshell, we continue to be in a strong financial position and are
focused on maintaining it.

Next, I'll make some comments about what we're seeing in our supply chain, manufacturing distribution
operations as well as our solutions and services businesses on Slide 15. We have a global supply chain,
including a network of suppliers in manufacturing and distribution facilities. Our supply chain team is
closely managing our end-to-end supply chain with a particular focus on all critical and at-risk suppliers
and supplier locations globally.

In late January and early February, we proactively increased inventory levels of certain, mostly China-
sourced components and products. We are currently experiencing some isolated supply and cross-border
transit disruptions and do see some increased supply chain costs, particularly related to reduced air freight
capacity. We're implementing freight surcharges to help mitigate the impact of these higher input costs.

All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating at this time. We have implemented
additional safety and hygiene processes, including separation of shifts and social distancing between
workstations to keep our employees safe. Some of the operational changes implemented as well as some
unplanned employee absentees are driving some inefficiencies in our operations, which we are in the
process of addressing.

Our solutions and services businesses include thousands of domain experts. They understand our
customers' challenges and priorities, and design and implement solutions and provide services through
a combination of domain expertise and our technology. Physical access to our customer facilities is often
important as we deliver those solutions and services.

As a result of COVID-19, access to customer facilities, in some instances, has been difficult, for example,
for on-site commissioning. While we have been leveraging our technology and that of our partners to
deliver certain services and solutions remotely, decreased access has led to some project delays as well as
inefficiencies due to lower labor utilization. We intend to protect our domain experts as much as possible
during this period.

Moving to Slide 16, overview of cost actions. In early April, we announced several actions to address
the current and anticipated business conditions as a result of the pandemic. I won't go through all of
these, but will point out that all these actions are expected to yield over $150 million of savings for fiscal
'20. As these salary reductions take effect May 1, we expect most of the savings to be realized in our
fourth quarter. We have identified additional cost actions to implement if business conditions require or to
reallocate resources to our highest priorities.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Finally, note that while our overall cost structure is coming down, we have maintained and, in some
cases, are selectively increasing investments in some of our highest-priority areas in order to increase
differentiation and create long-term value for customers and shareowners.

This takes us to Slide 17. This slide prevents an -- presents an overview of the business conditions we
saw in China and Italy, 2 of our larger end markets, which were impacted by COVID-19 before other
geographies. Note that the China and Italy charts provide an overview of the year-over-year growth in
order intake for our product businesses only. Products are 2/3 of our business and represent our shorter-
cycle book-and-bill business.

As you can see, the impact in China was severe in January and February, followed by a very strong V-
shaped recovery in March that has continued in April through Friday of last week. In Italy, we saw year-
over-year product orders growth through January, followed by a weak February and March. Order intake in
Italy remains weak in April but is up about 10% sequentially when compared to March order rates.

Using our product order trends in China and Italy as leading indicators, we expect most of our other
geographies to be down significantly in the third quarter and expect a more gradual recovery starting late
in the third quarter into our fourth quarter. Directionally, we expect solutions and services to also follow
this trend.

Moving to the right side of the slide, this represents our total company sales, including solutions and
services. Our guidance midpoint assumes that Q3 overall company organic sales will be down about 20%
year-over-year, followed by a sequential improvement in our fourth quarter, which we estimated to be up
above 10% sequentially, but still down over 10% compared to last year.

Let's move on to Slide 18, guidance. Incorporating the expected revenue contributions from ASEM and
Kalypso as well as updated currency forecasts, we now expect full year fiscal '20 reported sales of about
$6.35 billion and project organic sales to be down between 9.5% and 6.5% compared to last year.
Segment margin is expected to be in the range of 18.5% to 19.5% compared to 21.5% prior guidance,
mostly as a result of lower volumes, partially offset by our cost actions. The lower adjusted effective tax
rate mainly reflects some of the discrete benefits we recorded in the second quarter.

Slide 19 represents the full year fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS bridge, midpoint of January guidance to
midpoint of April guidance. Core performance includes the large unfavorable impact of volume and mix
as well as some of the inefficiencies in our supply chain, operations and solutions and services I referred
to. These are partially offset by our cost-reduction actions, including lower incentive compensation. A
headwind from currency and acquisitions is mostly offset by the lower tax rate.

On a year-over-year basis, our guidance at the midpoint assumes full year core earnings conversion,
which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions of a little over 35%. We expect a particularly
challenging third quarter. This is the quarter during which we expect our sales to trough with the weakest
performance in our higher-margin product businesses, and we won't have the full run rate savings of all
the actions we implemented. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be a little over $1 per share.

A few additional comments. General corporate net is now expected to be closer to $95 million. Purchase
accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $45 million, up $30 million
compared to last year. Net interest expense for fiscal '20 is still expected to be about $100 million. We
expect noncontrolling interest now to be about neutral, given lower expected sales and earnings at Sensia.
Average fully diluted share count is now expected to be $116 million for fiscal 2020.

With respect to repurchases, we are currently in the market but are monitoring business conditions closely
to inform the level of repurchases going forward. Finally, we expect continued strong free cash flow
performance with free cash flow conversion over 100% of adjusted income as we liquidate working capital,
particularly in the fourth quarter.

With that, I'll hand it back to you, Blake, for some closing remarks before Q&A.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Thanks, Patrick. We're managing our costs and protecting our balance sheet against the current reality of
unprecedented volatility, but we're also considering long-lasting changes that are being accelerated by the
pandemic. We remain optimistic about a world that learns to reduce the human toll from COVID-19 and
about Rockwell's role in increasing business resilience.

Here are some thoughts about that future, starting with the industries that we think will be especially
important. It's clear that countries like the U.S. want to increase local manufacturing capability for
medicines and medical devices, and we continue to grow share and capabilities in life sciences.

I've spoken earlier about some of the ways we're helping pharmaceutical and medical device companies
scale up the production of critically needed products during this crisis. Packaged food and beverages are
critically important when going out is not an option. Rockwell's Food & Beverage business is roughly 70%
retail for grocery stores and home delivery and 30% food service for restaurants. End users as well as
machine builders depend on Rockwell for the speed, flexibility and support that we can provide.

Electric vehicles are going to continue to increase their share. Our Q2 growth in auto had a significant
EV and battery component. And while we expect a tough road for the auto industry over the next few
quarters, our investments in motion technology and software for these applications will continue to bear
fruit.

The Oil & Gas industry is going to be focused on lower-cost production, not CapEx-driven capacity. Our
focus on new technology that lowers ongoing production costs from existing assets will be most important
for operators for the foreseeable future. Innovation will be necessary to lower the breakeven point for a
barrel of oil.

With respect to manufacturing footprint, we expect companies to reduce single points of failure in their
supply chain and plant capacity. We are increasing the resilience of our own worldwide system, and we
know our customers have plans to do the same. We are already seeing some manufacturers' plans to
return manufacturing to North America where we have higher share. Remote support of operations will be
important across many industries to provide expertise virtually when being physically on-site is impossible.
We're already doing this for hundreds of companies.

To ensure the highest quality and safety of products, product traceability is becoming more important,
which is an application we know very well from our life sciences experience. Flexibility is one of the biggest
benefits of automation. Rapidly ramping up output, designing lines to run multiple products and changing
packaging to meet evolving demand is likely to be even more important in the future. Software that
simulates throughput under different conditions and optimizes production is a part of this flexibility, and
we have a strong and growing offering in this area.

Finally, we're seeing diverse companies come together to solve tough problems quicker than we ever
thought possible. This is about the power of partnerships and the humility to recognize that no one
company can do it all. Partnering is a fundamental part of our culture. For all of these reasons, we believe
we are well positioned for a bright future.

With that, I'll turn it over to Jessica to start Q&A.

Jessica Kourakos
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Blake. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as
possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Sharon, let's take our first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So just on all these cost actions, how much of this flows into 2021?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Steve, Patrick here. It will depend on when we undo some of those temporary actions, and that will
depend on the business conditions. So the answer is it depends on when business conditions improve and
when we feel comfortable undoing some of these temporary actions.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Do any of the saves carry over into 2021? Like is there another step-up? I mean the incentive comp seems
like it's kind of an annual thing. I would assume you're now down to kind of 0 on that. I guess, I don't see
any real structural kind of change in the cost base. So I'm just wondering, is there any -- are there any
incremental savings if revenues don't come back?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So obviously, we have taken some structural actions in September, which are yielding savings this
year. We implemented temporary, not permanent, cost reductions at this time because we think it's a
temporary, not a permanent event. I want to protect our development programs in our R&D. Now also
those temporary actions enabled us to have a quick cost impact with no cash cost to implement. And as
I mentioned, we have identified additional, including structural cost actions, that we can implement if
business conditions require or to reallocate resources to higher priorities.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just on the fourth quarter, obviously, you guys are conservative, so the $1, we'll take with
a grain of salt, but still kind of a bounce back from even a number that's close to $1 in 4Q. Is that based
on kind of backlog visibility? Front log? What's kind of -- what gives you the confidence of that kind of
bounce back in fourth quarter?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So the $1, Steve, that was for the third quarter that I mentioned, a little over $1. So the fourth
quarter, we expect sequential improvement just because -- and given also what we've seen in geographies
like in China and in Italy, we've seen a deep, call it, pullback, followed by a gradual improvement. And that
is our 10% sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be broad-based, but with the
exception of Oil & Gas where we're not projecting an improvement.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And if I can add to that as well. Steve, we did build backlog both year-over-year and sequentially in
the quarter. And we have seen project delays, as Patrick mentioned, but we haven't seen cancellations.
So we still do see people in certain of the industries that we talked about continuing with plans, and that's

separate from the current rush to increase capacity in some of the essential products, and we've certainly
seen additional business in those areas.

Next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just wanted to drill in firstly on that second half, the decremental margins look very severe in that
second half, maybe 50%, 60% or so year-on-year. Maybe just help us understand the phasing, first half
to second half, of the $100 million or so of investment spend and also of the $150 million plus of savings.
And any color you could give, like how much of an impact from mix are you dialing in and from those
supply chain inefficiencies?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Julian, if you look at our earnings conversion for the full year, and I call it core convergence, so
I exclude the impact of acquisitions, which have a significant impact, and currency, for the full year,
earnings conversion is a little over 35% on 8% revenue -- organic revenue drop at the midpoint. For the
second half, again, adjusting for the impact of currency and acquisitions, our conversion is a little bit below
40%.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I see. That's helpful. And what's the phasing of that investment spend, Patrick, that $100 million or so? If
you could split that at all, first half, second half or something.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Julian, you're referring to the temporary actions?

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes, the temporary actions. And also, I think you talked about some -- you'd lowered the investment
spending, step-up assumption for the year. So just wondered how that spending delta shifts at all first half
or second half.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Got it. So the temporary actions will have a bigger impact in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter
just because of the timing of our pay cuts. So that's one. If I look at the investment specifically, in our
January guidance, we had said investment spending would be up about 2% year-over-year. That's about
$40 million. Currently, we expect that to be down 3% for the full year, and so that's a $100 million swing
versus our January guidance. We think that Q3, Q4 will be down about 6%, 7% each compared to the
prior year in terms of spend. And in dollar terms, it would be a little bit more in Q4 than in Q3.

Next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

A couple just to further clarify on the cost actions, Patrick. Fully understand the earlier comment about the
decision on 2021 will come at a later point in time. But if we look at these actions that you're taking that

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

do yield $150 million plus in 2020, what is the annualized run rate of those actions? Again, you may not
continue them for a full year, but what is the annualized run rate of those actions you've taken?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So the run rate of these actions, if I look at the bonus, we cannot count on that after this year, but
the full run rate of the pay cuts is north of $100 million. And so we get less than half of that this year. And
so there is another -- there is another over $50 million call of an annualized impact if we continue that into
next year. But as I said, it will depend on business conditions, whether we do so.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Correct. And just on the incentive compensation, just to be clear, in Q2, we have not only the absence of
an accrual, but we have the reversal of the Q1 accrual. And then I'm just wondering, in the second half,
what is the comparison? So we'll have 0 accrual in the second half of 2020 versus what actually fell in the
second half of 2019?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So in the -- for the balance of the year, we will have a $30-ish million decrease in bonus expense that
will mostly fall in Q4.

Operator

Next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Guys, you mentioned project delays. But like you said, there are no cancellations. I'm wondering if you
could give us a little more color on what verticals or areas of the world you're seeing these delays, if
they've been picking up sort of through April. And I know, Patrick, you had also talked about -- you put
China and Italy into a context -- or certainly, you put China into a context of a V-shaped recovery, but
your overall commentary seems to be anticipating something more of a gradual recovery. So I'm curious
if you could juxtapose those 2, to your commentary, do you think China is something of an anomaly it
rebounds much more quickly versus rest of world? Or can rest of world actually pick up steam based on
everything you're seeing, backlog and all that sort of stuff?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. John, so with respect to project delays, I don't think we saw any acceleration through April. But think
of final acceptance tests where it requires -- it might require some visitation. Those are the types of things
in projects that are causing delays because people just either can't get to the factory to take a look at the
system before they take delivery or on-site for the commissioning that Patrick talked about. So those are
the types of things that characterize delays. Oil & Gas would certainly see some of those because those
are often coordinated type systems.

In terms of the modeling for the recovery, we mentioned some of the inputs that we looked at. We looked
at China, which was a strong shape recovery. We looked at Italy, which was a little bit more gradual. And
consumer demand for our customers' end products will be something that we'll be looking at closely. But
we thought taking something between the 2 would make sense, and so that's what we've incorporated
in our guidance. We're watching orders daily to see the development around the world and in different
industries.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

So that makes sense. I guess in terms of -- just in terms of the environment, like is this comparable to
'08, '09? Or is there something that's very different? Is there something that's very different about it? And
also, I mean are you expecting Oil & Gas to cancel? I mean, oil prices are pretty darn low. Like, I realize
that you guys are about OpEx and it really -- it's about productivity and so forth. But how are you thinking
about that vertical? It's one of your largest and presumably most profitable.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So a couple of things. So first of all, with respect to comparisons with '08, '09, I think there was more
of a structural element to '08, '09 with respect to finance infrastructure. We really continue to look at this
as an event-driven activity. Now based on the duration, some other things could come into play, but we
really do characterize this as something of a different beast than '08, '09.

In terms of Oil & Gas, we have significant backlog in Oil & Gas. Process safety represents some of the
stronger recent order activity, and process safety is going to tend to hold up through this type of event.
Our assumptions for oil prices are up to, but not above, $30 a barrel for WTI, for West Texas Intermediate.
So we're not expecting or pricing in some major recovery in terms of oil prices as the basis for our
guidance.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

That's very helpful. If I could just ask one more. I think there's a not insignificant risk that the U.S. could
enter a partial or full-on cold war with China, especially if it becomes apparent the Chinese manufactured
and released the coronavirus. And I'm just wondering, you obviously took these supply chain actions.
Blake, is that enough? Like, how are you thinking about your China operations strategically? So you
mentioned reshoring in the U.S. that's going to benefit Rockwell. Do you potentially need to step up some
of the work around China actions? Or are there other things that you think you could perhaps be doing or
are thinking about?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think the key point to think about is what I mentioned earlier, and that is reducing single points of
failure in our supply chain. So whereas people have been looking at their supply chain for a while now as
costs and what were previously lower-cost areas are rising and then with the trade war putting further
stress on that, I think this event is going to cause people to make some changes in their supply chain.
We're considering changes to add resilience to our operations. And when we're thinking about it, I'm sure
there are hundreds of our customers who are thinking the same thing. That doesn't necessarily mean that
they're going to bring it all back to the U.S. But the concept of being local to their most important markets
and to have more than one place where you're manufacturing your high-value products, we think a lot of
manufacturers are going to follow that path coming out of this.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Yes, I agree. And it just doesn't make sense to have all our pharmaceuticals manufactured in China.

Operator

Next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just to kind of follow on that last question. I guess, Blake, you mentioned already seeing some input
from customers on regionalized manufacturing or reshoring. What kind of specific industries, I guess,
maybe outside of pharmaceuticals have you had those discussions on? It seems awfully early. I get maybe

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

someone wants to kick the tires or at least kind of formulate a plan. But any specific verticals that you're
starting to see an uptake on that discussion on?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Yes. So you mentioned the pharmaceuticals, medical devices. There are certainly actions that have
been dramatically accelerated through this current crisis. Other consumer products, so Stanley Black &
Decker has talked about bringing closer to their North American markets some of their manufacturing
operations. So that would be another example. But I think getting closer to our customers and consumer
markets would be a common theme.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just we've heard from some other folks that there was a good amount of
kind of pull forward and some isolated pushout, but in general, a lot of order shifting, I guess, in March
as folks decided what they wanted to do. Did you see any kind of pull forward into the quarter as folks
anticipated either trouble in getting products or imminent shutdowns such that they wanted to finish
something up before they were done? I think in the long run, this is all a timing noise thing, but just trying
to level set, if anything got pulled into the quarter.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We looked at that, and we really didn't see meaningful pull-ins in the quarter. So we looked at our
distributor inventories, which we work closely with distribution on, and there was nothing unusual going on
there. And then with respect to automotives, some of the projects that contributed to our strong growth
in the quarter included battery-making equipment in Asia, which is an ongoing series of successes that
we've talked about in previous quarters. We also had line of sight to some more traditional projects by
brand owners in internal combustion engines. These are projects that we've been tracking for well over a
year now. And then some activity additionally in auto from some of the tier suppliers in Europe, especially
in Eastern Europe. And so we've seen these projects. We've been tracking them for a while, and we really
haven't seen a distinctive trend that contributed to our strong Q2 results.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful. And I appreciate all the color this morning, especially some of your other peers
out there pull guidance. So all the detail greatly appreciated. Best of luck.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Josh. And then just on that note, we thought it was important to share an extra amount of
information that we thought was most helpful in navigating the current environment.

Next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

You talked about what you've seen in China and Italy in April. I'm sorry if I missed the broader discussion
on what you've seen in the Americas and Europe more broadly. But how is that down 20% compared to
what you've seen in April across your portfolio?

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

Yes, Nigel, Patrick here. In April, globally, and this is for both orders and ships, our product businesses
are down about 20% through Friday last week. And so consistent with our projection for the third quarter,
what we're seeing so far this month, and as I said, this is for products, 2/3 of our business.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

And would you expect April to be worse than 2Q? I mean, April is when we're in the sort of the eye of the
storm, if you will, of plant shutdowns. Why wouldn't we see sequential improvement in May and June?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Nigel, of course, it's a difficult question. We've seen weakness start at the end of March. I think it's too
early for us to say that in April, given where we are, that we have seen a bottom of that we call a bottom.
So it's unclear when we may bottom out. We do believe that, that will be sometime in Q3 in that late this
quarter. Mid or late June into the fourth quarter, we will see a sequential improvement.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Fair enough. And then I do want to come back to the 3Q EPS question. Again, the $1 seems like a
very low bar, but the decremental margins implied by that are extremely high. So I just want to sort of
ask the question a different way. Is there anything we should need to think about in terms of mix or cost
pressures or M&A dilution, FX hedges, et cetera, in terms of right setting 3Q EPS?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So specific to Q3, organic sales down about 20%. That represents well over $300 million of revenue,
which is weighted towards our product businesses, which, as you know, carry higher margins. We're not
getting the full run rate of our cost actions given the timing of the pay cuts. And so we expect Q3 to be
the trough. So Q3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, we expect our decrementals to be
close to about 50% for that quarter because of the reasons I mentioned.

Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.

Robert Paul McCarthy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I guess a couple of questions. I guess kind of the first question, maybe just update us on PTC and the
relationship there, in terms of what's going on, progress? And do you anticipate we'll have a virtual
Liveworks this year? And kind of what are the -- what's the agenda, particularly in this environment, to
drive growth from that collaboration?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Rob, we're still very happy with the partnership with PTC. We continue to see orders in the quarter,
both on top of our control platforms and also at competitive strongholds where the expanded scope of
those offerings and software and augmented reality are winning us new business that we would not have
otherwise won. The Liveworks or ROKLive activity will be virtual. I'll be participating in that. We'll be
talking about new products that we're working on. And so the partnership remains vibrant even under
these conditions, and we continue to strengthen it.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 28, 2020

That's helpful. And obviously, congratulations on a solid quarter and a constructive guide in providing
all the detail. Now that being said, we have seen the market rally pretty significantly here. And at least
tacitly, there seems to be some expectation of what looks like an interruption and then perhaps a U-
shaped or V recovery. But as Anthony Fauci always says, the virus gets to make the call. So if we go
into a bit of a double here in terms of the virus comes back, and you're seeing companies cut CapEx
across the board by 20% to 30%, and there's not a reason to believe we have creeping uncertainty until
there's a vaccine in 16 to 18 months, that you couldn't have a continued tough business CapEx and fixture
environment, which is not good for you despite some of these interesting secular trends for nearshoring.

How do you think -- how you address that environment? And back to some of the questions around
structural cost, what are some of the actions you could take to take some more structural cost out of the
business?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Rob, we're looking closely at that. We're modeling different views of the recovery, both in terms
of shape of the recovery as well as timing, depth and duration, all of those things. And we have plans
that are appropriate to those that go into deeper structural reductions if necessary. And so we watch
that. We've taken those actions in the past, and we'll take them now if we feel like that's the appropriate
response as the crisis unfolds.

Robert Paul McCarthy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Well, we're coming up against the market open. And from that standpoint, I think a lot of guys have to
write up or cover their a**, upgrade notes to neutral. So with that, I'll let you go.

We have a question from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

And I guess the real $10,000 question, Blake, is you talked about a lot of action that manufacturers of
all types are going to be taking to improve their business resiliency really as a direct response to this
crisis. And in the past, you've talked about, even at your Investor Day, talked about being able to grow
at a multiple of IP and increasing that. Should we be thinking and is it your view that coming out of this,
the nature of the industrial recovery is such that your multiple could even expand as manufacturers take
actions that play into your wheelhouse?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

We're optimistic, Noah, about our ability to play an even more important role for customers as we go
forward. And I've given some insight as to the industries and some of the trends that we think we're well
positioned to partner with those customers on. And we're going to be working hard in those areas, as
Patrick mentioned, in some cases, even investing in the areas of highest value. And we prefer to win in
those opportunities, see the growth, and then we'll talk about the resulting multiples. But our intention is
to make it happen.
