Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone
The Hematology & Oncology franchise had an excellent second quarter
We delivered a strong sales performance, with 16% year-over-year growth and an impressive 7% sequential growth
In addition, we made great progress with our near and mid-term pipeline
REVLIMID continues to have outstanding performance, with increases in share and duration across key markets
POMALYST/IMNOVID grew significantly through increasing treatment duration across all geographies
Finally, ABRAXANE remained stable overall, with continued leadership in pancreatic cancer around the globe
We are awaiting U.S
approval of IDHIFA, our oral targeted IDH2 inhibitor for relapsed refractory AML in August
We made significant progress in the quarter with our near-term pipeline and future growth drivers, completing enrollment into four Phase III trials
We're very excited about our collaboration with BeiGene for BGB-A317 in solid tumors, which significantly accelerates our solid tumor strategy and broadens the potential of our growing immuno-oncology portfolio
And finally, we made great progress toward initiating multiple pivotal programs, from marizomib in glioblastoma, bb2121 in relapsed refractory myeloma, JCAR017 and CC-122 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, luspatercept in front-line low-risk MDS, and durvalumab in myeloma, MDS, and AML
REVLIMID sales in the second quarter increased 20% year over year and an impressive 8% quarter over quarter
, we had an excellent 26% year-over-year and 10% sequential growth
growth in quarter two was mostly volume-based, driven by further market share increases in newly diagnosed myeloma and the continued increase in treatment duration
REVLIMID growth outside of the U.S
was 9% year over year and 4% sequentially
The year-over-year growth rate was impacted by the Russia tender we had in Q2 2016, as we would see twice the same year-over-year growth without the impact of last year's Russia tender
Year-over-year and sequential international volume growth was 17% and 4% respectively, driven by the strong increase in newly diagnosed myeloma market share and treatment duration in the EU, Japan, and Canada
We've seen over the past quarter some volatility in international sales patterns for REVLIMID
As we have explained previously, this was driven by distributor buying patterns, including the Russia tender and clinical drug supplies
However, when we correct for these factors and look at the true in-the-market sales trends, we see the steady progress of increasing volume and net sales that matches the strong uptake we are seeing in newly diagnosed market share
The international markets have not reached peak share in the newly diagnosed non-stem cell transplant segment, and we also have not had enough time yet to see the full impact of duration
In addition, we are just initiating stem cell transplant maintenance launches in countries with reimbursement, and see reimbursement and uptake of novel triplets in relapsed refractory myeloma in multiple European markets
All these drivers will ensure continued growth in 2017 as well as through 2020. We are awaiting the results of our (15:03) indolent lymphoma trials, including AUGMENT in relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma and RELEVANCE in front-line follicular lymphoma by year end
We are pleased with the rapid complete enrollment of our (15:14) ROBUST trial in first-line ABC diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and expect data next year
Finally, we are preparing to submit an sNDA for RVd in first-line transplant and non-transplant patients in the U.S
in the first quarter of 2018. The slight delay versus previous plans was due to additional regulatory authority data review requests
POMALYST/IMNOVID net sales continue to grow across geographies, with 23% year-over-year and 7% sequential growth
, POMALYST net sales grew 30% year over year and 12% quarter over quarter
As I mentioned during the first quarter call, the underlying demand for POMALYST in the U.S
is very strong, and the second quarter saw 7% sequential growth in prescriptions
POMALYST continues to maintain a leading share in third-line patients and duration is increasing
We believe that the recent FDA approval of POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma will be a key driver for our POMALYST performance
Outside of the U.S
, POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow, with 13% year-over-year growth and 2% sequential growth
Importantly, international sequential volume growth was 6% outside of the U.S
, driven by strong third-line-plus share and continued duration gains in all geographies, including Europe and Japan
Finally, as mentioned on our Q1 call, the Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib second or later treatment lines completed enrollment, and we expect data in 2018. ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall
ABRAXANE net sales grew 2% year over year and 8% quarter over quarter
sales decreased 8% year over year
ABRAXANE clearly maintained its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, but we are seeing the impact of quarterly buying patterns and increasing use of novel agents in non-small-cell lung cancer and breast cancer
Outside of the U.S
, ABRAXANE grew 25% year over year, with continued growth in pancreatic cancer
We anticipate multiple growth drivers in future for ABRAXANE
We expect results of the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017, and the pivotal ABRAXANE/ TECENTRIQ combination trials in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer will read out in 2018. We are very excited about the recent announcement of our new strategic immuno-oncology collaboration with BeiGene
As outlined in our press release, we are acquiring worldwide rights outside of Asia excluding Japan to develop and commercialize BGB-A317, an advanced clinical stage PD-1 inhibitor for solid tumors
We believe that BGB-A317 is potentially differentiated and provides us with the ability to combine a checkpoint inhibitor with our broad immuno-oncology portfolio in order to accelerate the development of best-in-class I-O combinations for multiple solid tumor indications
BGB-A317 complements our growing I-O solid tumor portfolio, enabling us to target selected tumor types through activating T-cells and macrophages, enhancing T-cell function and depleting inhibitory T regulatory cells
In hematological malignancies, we feel that the I-O portfolio of Celgene is equally uniquely positioned through our existing IMiDs and future cell mods, our ongoing FUSION PD-L1 development program with our partner AstraZeneca, our accelerating CAR-T and bi-specific T-cell engager programs against BCMA and CD19, as well as the opportunity to activate macrophages in T-regulatory cells in targeted malignancies
In summary, we had another great quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise
We had excellent sales performance and we achieved many key clinical milestones
Near-term growth drivers are in place
We are expecting U.S
approval of IDHIFA in IDH2 relapsed refractory AML in August
And we are actively working with commercial payers in the U.S
to ensure patient access to IDHIFA immediately following approval
For REVLIMID, we are just at the beginning of our stem cell transplant maintenance launch and are awaiting data by year end for our two Phase III trials in indolent lymphoma
We completed enrollment in four Phase III trials for REVLIMID, luspatercept, and CC-486, and we are preparing to initiate pivotal programs for many additional assets by the end of this year
Finally, we're working to maximize the potential of BGB-A317, a single agent in combination with targeted agents, chemotherapy, and our novel and differentiated I-O pipeline assets through our comprehensive global solid tumor development plan that we look forward to sharing with you in more detail later in the year
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Terrie
Hi, Michael
This is Michael
Thanks for the question
So let me start by saying that we are really excited about having the opportunity to develop this asset, as it is extremely well characterized
It's in late-stage clinical development, and more than 500 patients have been treated
And it may also offer the opportunity, at least from pre-clinical models, to be differentiated, and clinical data will show that
We think we have a great opportunity to use this asset to bring forward our I-O strategy and our solid tumor strategy
As we think that through deep translational work and understanding of the tumor but also the immune system, we will be able to come up very tailored and very thoughtful and logical combinatorial therapy
In that sense, I think our pipeline is extremely well positioned, as we cannot just go for activating T-cells
We can also alter T-cell function
We can go after T-regulatory cells
We have the opportunity to activate macrophages
And then, of course, we are really working heavily on cellular immunotherapy
So what we think is that we have all the ingredients for a very thoughtful and science-led approach and going into the right patient segments with the right combinatorial approaches
What you heard us saying is the plan that we are starting to work on is going be very comprehensive
It will have monotherapy, combinatorial approaches where we're also, of course, looking into potential targeted therapies, chemotherapy, and thoughtful I-O/I-O combinations
We're not ruling out any combination at this moment of time, but we feel we are extremely well positioned with the pipeline that we're having
I think we are confident that we can provide a very thorough update to you at ASH, yes
Hi, Raymond
Thanks for the question â€“ Chris
Starting with France, before you get reimbursement, there is some access opportunities in France, but they are limited, so by no way comparable to a situation where you have a price and you can promote
So we see some very limited uptake at this moment of time in France, but of course we expect a very marked change once reimbursement has been gained
We are confident that we can achieve this in Q3. We are working very closely with the payers
Of course, it's a large segment, and we have I think very constructive discussions about that
So the slide that you, by the way, also saw is a composite, and it has France in there without reimbursement at this moment of time
So we think that's going to change very nicely once we have achieved that
When we're thinking about treatment duration, which is another major opportunity, we are at this moment of time roundabout 14 to 15 months in Europe
And just don't forget, the change of treatment duration of REVLIMID as compared to second-line is something that needs to build up over time
So we're been launching one to two years ago starting with Germany, and then we got other reimbursement countries
What you see with the 14 to 15 months is still very much driven by treatment duration that we traditionally saw by second-line, and we need to overcome this once the countries have been getting reimbursement in order to get to these longer treatment durations that we see in the U.S
Our treatment duration is way above 20 months
The other key element, just to round it, is the triplets, which of course are much more used in the U.S
at this moment of time
But Europe is picking up, and we got reimbursement of triplets in a couple of markets, so we're going to see this effect coming in Europe as well
Over time, I think treatment duration will become very similar
So thanks for the question, Eric
We really wanted to start with our excitement about the ability to bring our first partnered asset from our distributed research model to approval and also, by the way, our first asset with a companion diagnostic
The other thing that of course is very exciting for us is the fact that relapsed refractory AML in particular is a patient population where their medical need is very high
Talking about the patient population in specific, IDH2 mutated relapsed refractory AML is our starting point patient population, so the relapsed refractory AML population that exists, and around about 10% to 15% of these patients have this mutation
And the way to move forward from a strategic standpoint here, apart from of course having a great launch in a patient population with a high medical need, is in parallel developing IDHIFA in first-line AML
Now different to relapsed refractory AML, this is going be a combinatorial strategy
We have two Phase II trials ongoing, one with 7+3, the other one with VIDAZA
They're going to both read out by the end of the year, and that allows us then to make decisions about our future development program
The true commercial opportunity for this asset is really in this population and through long treatment duration
But it's great to have this very first exciting step for those patients with monotherapy in relapsed refractory AML, and we're very confident about our launch preparations
Hi, this is Michael
I think this is an interesting question in the context of the fact that in the U.S
in particular but now also in Europe, triplets are really gaining a lot of traction
And of course, not all triplets are created equal
If you combine an IMiD with a proteasome inhibitor, that serves certain patient populations
If you combine an IMiD with an antibody, other patient populations may be served well
I think as a general comment, what you can achieve by combining an IMiD with either a proteasome inhibitor or antibody goes way beyond what you can achieve with doublets, positive for patients, but then certainly also positive for us as a company because REVLIMID treatment duration increases big time
And the same, by the way, is true if you combine pomalidomide with other assets
So I think that's a key reason why triplets are getting so much traction
I would really make a statement of it depends which triplets you are using from the exact patient that is sitting in front of you in the office
Hi, this is Michael
Thanks for the very good question
The starting point of the positioning of course is the clinical data, and you also have the very positive results that we've been showing at ASCO
You can't get any better than a 100% response rate in a partially penta-refractory population
And many of these patients have CR, so even a MIB-negative disease
So the starting point for the development of CAR-T is definitely taking the late-line population that has no additional treatment option
We are at this moment of time going into an expansion phase with bb2121 with the dose that we've been choosing, and we feel we can go right into a pivotal program
There is more opportunity, of course, for this asset when we're thinking about patient segments in multiple myeloma that are currently underserved, for example, patients who are relapsing very fast after standard therapy, for example, patients who have a genetic profile, risk patients
And those patients usually have a life expectancy of three to four years
Those are patients to think about
At the end of the day when you think about curing a patient population, you need to go into the first-line population
We're thinking about that as well
We will be very selective
There is a huge effort ongoing to really making sure that we can define high-risk patients in a way that regulatory authorities are going to appreciate the effort, but we feel that there is a role of this technology in the first-line setting as well
Our bi-specific antibody is really complementary to this effort for a couple of occasions
You need bridging therapy for CAR-T patients
You need to bring the initial cell count down before you can go CAR-T
You may not achieve a CR but only a PR, and then you can use bi-specific antibodies
So these different assets are very complementary, and they don't exclude themselves
There's certainly a population of elderly, frail patients where CAR-T may not be an option, and a bi-specific antibody may be optimal
So we're really thinking very, very comprehensively
I would just add when we're looking at BCMA as a target, which is a great target, it's not always thinking about options by excluding themselves
I think what the whole field is showing, the combinatorial approach is often the approach that makes the most sense, and that's what we have in mind
Great questions
Starting on the molecule, and I think we've been really choosing our words very carefully, as we said, potentially differentiated, and this potential differentiation is really based on pre-clinical observations
This asset has a silent Fc receptor that may actually lead to less interaction with inhibitory immune cells or other immune cells that you don't want
In pre-clinical models, there is an advantage, but this needs to show in the clinical models
What's really exciting for us and why we feel that our whole program can be differentiated is two things, and that also refers to MYSTIC
A), the breadth of our pipeline, which is not just including T-cell activating agents, but we have many, many other opportunities including cellular therapy to go after the patient populations that we want to go after
And B), and I think that's a bit of learning of MYSTIC, we really need to make an effort to fully understand which combination should go into which patient population and how we can better predict as to which other patients are really profiting from the therapy
PD-L1 may not be the sole answer here
I think this later point is nicely shown by the FUSION program that we are running where we really have a deep translational effort, and that's exactly what we're going to do with BGB-A317 as well
So I personally believe that while it is great to have a pre-clinical hint to differentiation, the true differentiation comes through the translational program and the combinatory approaches that we're going to use
As you know, I'm a huge fan of luspatercept
I'm always saying this
But I think we have created a wonderful starting point with two fully recruited Phase III studies in a later-line MDS, low-risk MDS population where we have a nice marker to identify those patients who have the highest likelihood to respond and in beta thalassemia starting with patients who are transfusion-dependent
And we're going to get these top line results by the middle of the year
And we really see this as a starting point for this asset, because what we are trying to do in the second half of this year is a couple of things
A), we've been showing to you data in an early-line low-risk MDS population which look really intriguing and, by the way, also intriguing in RS-negative patients
So what we're just doing at this moment of time is we're recruiting some of these patients so that we can make a pivotal decision for an early-line low-risk MDS study, which we call COMMANDS, by the end of the year
That offers a huge opportunity for us
Second big opportunity that follows in beta thalassemia is of course the non-transfusion-dependent patients, and we will look forward to that
Third big opportunity is myelofibrosis, where we saw really intriguing results with a system molecule
We want to repeat this and have a really good translational program and also combinatorial approach so that we can make a pivotal decision on myelofibrosis by the end of the year
If only some of these opportunities are hitting, luspatercept is going to be a huge drug
