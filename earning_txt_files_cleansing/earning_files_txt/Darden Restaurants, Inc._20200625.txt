DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the Darden Fiscal Year 2020 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This
conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Thanks so much.

Kevin Kalicak
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Analysis

Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on
the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO.

As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are
described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call,
which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com.

Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these
measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2021 first quarter earnings on
September 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. It has been 14 weeks since our last earnings call. I don't
know about all of you, but it felt more like 14 months. So much has happened. Over the past 3 months,
our businesses -- our business changed in ways we never imagined. So I want to spend my time with you
this morning trying to put it all in perspective for you, then Rick will share some of our fourth quarter and
year-end results and provide our outlook for the first quarter.

When I look back on all that has transpired, one thing that stands out is the resiliency of the full-service
dining industry. Prior to the pandemic, total annual sales for the casual dining industry was approximately
$108 billion. And while I do not know how long it will take the industry to recover from the significant
impact it experienced, I am confident that this category will get back to the size it once was. Our industry
plays a vital role in our communities, and that was evident in how the consumer relied on restaurants
over the last several months even in a to go-only environment. And while off-premise will continue to
play an important role as we recover, we know that the consumer still wants to enjoy an in-restaurant
experience. In fact, going out to a restaurant with friends and family is the #1 activity consumers say they
look forward to doing as the economy opens back up, and we've seen that as our dine-ins reopen across
the country.

As this vital industry continues to rebuild this tremendous opportunity to increase market share through
increased on-premise demand and incremental off-premise sales, those executing at the highest level are
going to continue to win, and Darden is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity.

We last spoke in March. We knew the pandemic was going to have a significant impact on our business.
Our ability to manage through this crisis has been driven by our commitment to prioritize guest and
team member safety, invest in our team members, provide frequent and transparent communication,
leverage our digital platform and be brilliant with the basics. The health and safety of our guests and
team members has always been our top priority. And we have taken a number of steps to create a
safe environment in our restaurants, from sourcing masks and other personal protective equipment for
our team members to developing a contactless curbside pickup process at our brands while dine-ins
were closed. We are mindful of the trust our guests and team members place in us. Today, our health

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

and safety commitments are focused on team member health checks, personal protective equipment,
enhanced sanitation processes, social distancing and frequent hand washing. We also provide paid sick
leave for all our team members so they can stay home if they're ill.

But we can't do it alone, and that is why we encourage our guests to join the online waitlist or make
reservations, not into our restaurants if they are symptomatic, wear a mask and utilize contactless or
mobile payment options where available.

We continue to invest in our team members as our dine-ins closed. In addition to rolling out permanent
paid sick leave, we introduced a 3-week emergency pay program that provided nearly $75 million of pay
during the fourth quarter for hourly team members who could not work. When emergency pay ended,
we covered insurance payments and benefit deductions for hourly team members who were furloughed.
As we brought hourly team members back to work to support increased to go volume, we introduced
an additional payment to help cover unexpected costs, such as transportation and childcare, incurred as
a result of the pandemic. And to recognize the unbelievable work our managers did during the quarter,
we paid their target bonus for the fourth quarter. We know our people are our greatest competitive
advantage. Not only were these investments the right thing to do to take care of our team members,
they've also created a deeper loyalty and strengthened engagement while we've seen this pay off as we
bring our people back to work.

Communication is the most important aspect of leadership during a crisis. We knew frequent and
transparent communication with our team members and investors was important. Beyond daily meetings
with all of our brand presidents, who, in turn, met with their operational leaders on a daily basis, we have
maintained a consistent communication cadence with our team members. Since this crisis began, I have
provided regular business updates to our people and have been open and honest about the impacts to our
business and, consequently, the impacts to them. We took the same approach with our shareholders and
the analysts by providing 4 business updates during the quarter.

The pandemic accelerated the consumers' desire for convenience, and we saw a significant increase in
digital engagement. The work we have done over the past few years, investing in our digital platform to
reduce friction, prepared us to quickly adapt to consumer behavior and deliver on their expectations of
convenience in our to go-only environment. During this time, we have strengthened our digital platform
and made meaningful progress against our digital strategy. In addition to improving the guest experience
across our digital channels, our strategy is focused on using technology to help our guests easily order
outside and inside the restaurant, improve the wait to be seated, streamline the order pickup process and
speed up how they pay. We've been building on our digital platform to support increased demand, and we
certainly tested it like never before.

During the quarter, online ordering at Olive Garden grew by more than 300% over prior year and
accounted for 58% of To Go sales. At LongHorn, online ordering grew by 400% and accounted for 49%
of To Go sales. Additionally, we accelerated our time line and rolled out online ordering at our brands that
had not yet deployed it. We also added the ability to order alcohol online for all of our brands and markets
where that was allowed. Our commitment to being brilliant with the basics allowed us to remain focused
on operational execution even as the environment forced us to radically change how we serve our guests.
Each one of our brands did a phenomenal job delivering a new guest experience by collaborating and
sharing best practices. This involved creating contactless curbside pickup that included designing what
was essentially a drive-thru in our parking lots. Wireless execution in this environment meant enabling our
guests to order and pay online and have our team members seamlessly place their sealed orders in their
vehicles. Our operators displayed tremendous innovation, flexibility and passion as they continue to serve
our guests.

And to ensure we consistently execute at the highest level, we took the opportunity to streamline our
menus and improve our processes and procedures. With these changes, we are seeing improvements in
execution and direct labor productivity.

So what have we learned from all this? We've learned a lot. But most importantly, this situation has
reinforced that our strategy that we developed 5 years ago, grounded in our "Back to Basics" operating
philosophy, leveraging our 4 competitive advantages and cultivating a portfolio of iconic brands, is still the

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

right one today. Strong brands with loyal guests have fared better, and the trust we have earned from our
guests is critical. Being brilliant with the basics by consistently delivering exceptional food, service and
atmosphere is imperative. However, we know how important safety and cleanliness are to our guests right
now and we must continue to earn their trust every day.

And throughout this unprecedented time, we have benefited greatly from our 4 competitive advantages:
our significant scale, our extensive data and insights, our rigorous strategic planning and our culture,
where the sourcing PPE for our team members, ensuring we're not impacted by supply chain issues, or
sharing best practices across 8 brands, the ability to leverage our scale has allowed us to quickly react to
constant change. Finally, as I said earlier, we know our people are our greatest competitive advantage,
and I'm impressed by how our team members responded and continue to respond to take care of our
guests and each other. Having a strong culture has been part of our DNA since we were founded. We
were able to keep the majority of our managers employed and we stayed connected with our furloughed
hourly team members. This allowed us to bring our people back quickly and get our dine-ins opened safely
without any delays.

As you saw in our press release, 91% of our dine-ins have reopened with at least limited capacity. We
have also brought 60,000 furloughed restaurant team members back to work, and we expect to bring at
least another 40,000 back as business continues to improve.

I'm incredibly proud that our culture has actually strengthened during this most difficult period in our
company's history. This, above all else, is what gives me confidence in Darden's future.

Now I'll turn it over to Rick.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2020 was on track for a solid year of performance,
and the beginning of Q4 was no different. The first few weeks of sales were strong, and then, nearly
overnight, the impact of COVID-19 required us to pivot to a to go-only format. This posed unprecedented
challenges for our restaurant and support center teams, and I am proud of how everyone moved quickly
to increase To Go sales, reduce costs, manage working capital and improve efficiency.

The simplifications Gene referenced helped reduce key variable expenses in our restaurants, especially
direct labor. The teams also worked to reduce or eliminate other fixed costs in our restaurants and
restaurant support center as well as eliminate nonessential capital spending. Given the significant
reduction in cash flow, we also had to work quickly to ensure we had enough cash for whatever might
occur. During the quarter, we suspended the dividend and share repurchases, fully drew down our $750
million credit facility, took out a $270 million term loan and raised over $500 million in a follow-on equity
offering. All these efforts and the strong loyalty of our guests resulted in us tripling our prior To Go sales
run rate averages and materially reducing our cash burn, as we disclosed to you through our periodic
business updates. Given the confidence in our cash flow trends and the ability to access it in the future,
we fully repaid our credit facility in early May.

Now turning to the results. The total sales were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 43.0%. Same-restaurant sales
decreased 47.7% and adjusted diluted net loss per share was $1.24. Because of the significant reduction
in total sales compared to last year, all of the expense lines experienced sales deleverage. So I'll just
touch on a few highlights. First, food and beverage costs were higher as a percent of sales, given menu
mix related to both To Go mix and simplified menus as well as increased packaging expense and elevated
beef costs. As we look at the labor line, there was significant deleverage in management labor, including
approximately $25 million in manager bonuses. However, we saw an improvement in hourly labor as a
percent of sales of over 150 basis points, even with a substantial reduction in sales. Restaurant expenses
per operating week decreased over 20% given our focus on cost management, even as we incurred over
$5 million in incremental cleaning supplies and PPE related to COVID-19. For marketing and G&A expense,
we were able to reduce the absolute spend by $37 million and $17 million, respectively, versus last year.
Included in our restaurant labor, and to a small extent, G&A, is approximately $50 million of investments
net of retention credits. This was related to emergency and furlough pay for our team members while they

were not working. This negatively impacted our EPS by $0.30, which was not adjusted out of reported
earnings.

During the quarter, we impaired $390 million of assets as a result of lower sales, reduced profitability and
lower market capitalization. The impairments related to $314 million of Cheddar's goodwill and trademark
assets, $47 million of restaurant-level assets and $29 million of other assets. We permanently closed 11
restaurants in the quarter, 6 of which were already impaired. The entire $300 million -- $390 million of
impairment charges were adjusted out of our reported earnings.

We ended the quarter with $763 million in cash and another $750 million available in our credit facility.
This gives us over $1.5 billion of liquidity available to weather the crisis and make appropriate investments
to grow profitably. Our adjusted debt-to-adjusted capital at the end of the quarter was 61%, well within
our debt covenant of 75%.

As we shifted to an off-premise only model, we took a disciplined approach to pursue sales opportunities
with an eye toward incremental profitability and cash flow by focusing on cost management and the guest
experience while ensuring our team members were taken care of. This approach resulted in a better finish
to Q4 than anticipated and is the underpinning for the strength of our business model that is reflected in
our first quarter financial outlook.

Now turning to fiscal 2021 performance. In today's release, we provided quarter-to-date same-restaurant
sales and the performance of our restaurants with dining rooms at least partially open. These results
are encouraging with last week's blended same-restaurant sales down 30%, we are operating cash flow
positive at these levels. Our To Go sales remain elevated in restaurants with dining rooms at least partially
reopened. Olive Garden To Go sales are approximately double their pre-COVID averages, and LongHorn
has more than tripled their pre-COVID averages in these restaurants.

While it is our normal practice to provide an annual financial outlook, due to the uncertainty in business
performance moving forward, we are only providing an outlook for the first quarter. We expect to achieve
approximately 70% of prior year sales levels, total EBITDA of at least $75 million, and diluted net earnings
per share of greater than or equal to 0 on a diluted share base of 131 million shares. At this point, we
don't intend to further share intra-quarter business updates since we have provided our first quarter
outlook.

For the full year, we intend to open between 35 and 40 net new restaurants. Our first opening of the year
is expected to be in early July, with a few others likely to be opened by the end of the first quarter. In
total, we expect between $250 million and $350 million of capital spending for fiscal '21.

Turning to other aspects of capital allocation. As you recall, we suspended our dividend last quarter due
to the level of cash flow uncertainty and the need to preserve as much cash as possible. We have been
consistent in our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, and our dividend is a big part of that. As
soon as we see the business begin to generate the sustainable cash flows to support a dividend and repay
our term loan, we will have discussions with our Board on our dividend policy.

And now I'll turn it back to Gene for some closing comments.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Rick. And as you've seen in our 8-K filing this morning, Dave George will be retiring on August
2. Dave will celebrate his 65th birthday later this year, and we've been discussing this transition for some
time.

Dave and I have been partners on this journey for 23 years. He was a joint venture partner for LongHorn
when I joined RARE in 1997. I still remember the first time I met him. We're going to visit his restaurants,
so he picked me up at the airport in his Volvo with no air-conditioning in the North Carolina heat. I knew
at the end of the day that Dave was a special operator. I wasted no time. We bought out his interest in
his joint venture and brought him into the company. Over the last 23 years, Dave has been successful in
every one of his leadership positions. He has led 3 of Darden's iconic brands, The Capital Grille, LongHorn

Steakhouse and Olive Garden; and most recently, has served as our Chief Operating Officer. He built
great teams and became a mentor to many operators and executives. His can-do approach and attitude
permeates throughout Darden and each of our brands today.

For many of the last 23 years, Dave and I have had lunch together on Monday to discuss what happened
the previous week and to talk about what needed to get done going forward. Not much has changed over
those 23 years, except today, we order salads instead of 2 or 3 entrees each. And for the last 5 years,
Dave has sat next to me during every earnings call, as he is today, helping me find the details I need to
answer your questions. I'll miss seeing him when I walk into the room on these days. For all the Darden
team members listening today, our annual conference, which usually happens in August, would have been
a great opportunity for everyone to see Dave, thank him and wish him well in person. Unfortunately,
because of COVID-19, our conference has been postponed until next year. We will, however, be inviting
Dave to our conference in 2021, and he's committed to come so we can celebrate all that he's done for
Darden and for many of you.
In closing, I want to say thank you to all our team members, those currently working and those who
remain on furlough. And as I've said to you repeatedly, your ability to adapt, innovate and collaborate
during this time has truly been inspiring. Thank you for your ongoing commitment to our guests and each
other. And now we'll open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird.

David E. Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

First, I want to pass along my congratulations to Dave George on a very successful career and wish him
the best as he retires.

So Gene, I guess my big picture question is related to what you think the environment could look like on
the other side.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

I lost you -- did I lose you just -- you there, David?

David E. Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Can you hear me okay?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

I lost you -- last word I heard was on the other side. Is there a period after that? Or...

David E. Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

No. Gene, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you think the environment will look on the other side of
the pandemic especially as it relates to the competition and the potential for unit closures and how you're
positioning Darden to potentially take advantage of that type of environment, whether it's potential to
grow faster? Or how do you think about those dynamics as you look longer term?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Yes, David. Yes, I think that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we went into this is a $108 billion
category. And I have been really impressed with the resiliency of the consumer and how important full-
service casual dining has been in everyday life of our guests. So I think the industry gets back to where
it was. I think it's important. I think people really miss it, probably miss it more than they know. There's
been a lot of predictions of how much capacity will come out of the system. I'm not going to sit here today
and say I know what the exact number is. The one thing I do believe is there'll be less competition as we
-- and less restaurants as we move forward. And I think that's a great opportunity for us. I think scale is
going to matter more than ever. I think that we believe that we can get back to 2% to 3% unit growth
pretty quickly. We're going to continue to open restaurants. We're going to continue to do new deals.
We think the economics going forward here in the short term should get better for us on new restaurant
development. And I think we'll go back to our basics. We're going to continue to try to improve our food
offerings. We're going to try to make sure we have the right value that we're offering the consumer. As we
mentioned in both our comments this morning, we've improved productivity in our restaurants through
more streamlined menus. So we think the opportunity is there. We also think that off-premise will play a
bigger role as we move forward. We think our capabilities in that have improved dramatically over the last
14 weeks. And we -- and I think a lot of consumers have the opportunity to maybe use our service off-
premise that hadn't used it before. I think they were really pleased with the overall experience.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

David E. Tarantino
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then, Gene, you mentioned kind of streamlining the operations and the menus. Is that
something you think will continue longer term? Or do you see that maybe some of the items coming back
that you removed?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, David, each brand is in a different place. Each brand went to a different place when they went
to off-premise only. So some brands, I would say, right now, are probably back to 100% of where they
will want to be other than maybe some promotional items here and there. Other brands still have 10%,
15% that they need to add back to their menus to make them competitive. But it was not only the menu.
I mean, I think when we basically closed down the operation, except for off-premise, we had the chance to
rebuild as we open back up. And we had a chance to look at all our processes and procedures, and I think
we were able to simplify and eliminate a lot of prep work in some of our businesses that we'll never get
back into the business. I think these are costs that we're going to -- we've gotten out. We've had a lot of
discussion around our table is that it's been much easier as we build the on-premise business back up, to
reimagine what the operation in the back of the house looks like versus trying to reimagine it why you're
operating. And we're really thrilled with the results so far.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co.

Brian John Bittner
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Also would like to wish Dave George, a very happy retirement. Congrats on a wonderful career.

Gene, I know during this pandemic, you've instituted lower order price thresholds for delivery across the
Olive Garden portfolio. What are the insights and maybe the impacts you're seeing from this? And what
are your updated thoughts on that opportunity as this environment has so rapidly changed these last few
months?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We've run a lot of tests there, David. I think where we're settling in right now is $50 minimum. It's
still the 5:00 call the day before. We find that to be the sweet spot. The average order size is still well
above that. We didn't see any benefit of going below that threshold. And so that's where we're going to --
that's what we're netting out, and we think that, that opportunity will continue to be there. We will tell you
that we did test doing our own delivery, found it really inefficient and it wasn't that additive. And so we're
really focused on this curbside operation and think that's the future for off-premise.

Brian John Bittner
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Okay. And my follow-up is just -- it's interesting to see the LongHorn sales recovery occur a bit more
rapidly than Olive Garden, particularly in units that have reopened their dining rooms. Gene, what do you
really attribute that to? And I asked that question in the spirit of the fact that To Go sales in the open
LongHorn units are actually much lower than Olive Garden. So I'm surprised we're seeing such a big
recovery in LongHorn versus Olive Garden more recently.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Brian, 2 things to consider. First of all, geographies is working for Longhorn. We've got the state
of Georgia. We have a huge presence there and business has come back real strong. I would also say

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

that the Olive Garden dining room yields a higher percentage of tables available in -- with the occupancy
restrictions than Olive Garden does.

And so I want to take this opportunity to talk just a little bit about occupancy. A lot of people have done a
lot of work on this. And I think that you're -- I think this -- I think you need to think about it just a little
bit differently. Once you're past 25% occupancy, the only thing that matters is there's 6 feet of social
distancing required. Remember, there's always significant inefficiencies in your seating capacity. We've
always got 2s and 4s, 4s and 6s. We got tables for large parties. Our average party size is 2.3. So different
layouts, even in different -- inside the same brand will yield you different seating efficiencies. We will
be installing temporary barriers in approximately 100 restaurants in the next 2 weeks to try to improve
this efficiency, especially in Olive Garden, and we want to do that while maintaining the social distancing
requirements. We'll analyze the sales growth after we've installed those barriers and decide how many
more restaurants we want to add it to.

So that's a long answer to your question, but I think that there's some confusion out there, and we have
to remember that once you're past 25% occupancy, the 6-foot restriction on social distancing trumps any
other restriction there is because you can't get to 50%.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.

John Stephenson Glass
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And congratulations, Dave, on your retirement. I wanted to ask about incremental margins as you think
about the recovery. So COVID made a lot of businesses, including yours, rethink how you do things. You
talked about menu simplification, but you also talked about this heavier To Go mix maybe influence food
costs. Do you think as your AUVs recover that you're able to get back to higher margins than may...

[Audio Gap]

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

John, thanks for the question. As it relates to margins incrementally going forward, right now, if you look
at our P&L and the way our margins look, our margins are better on a variable cost basis than they were
coming into the pandemic. So if we don't make other investments going forward, you would anticipate our
margins to be a little bit better than they were before. However, we're still making decisions on what we'll
do as the sales continue to grow. Whether we bring some things back or invest in our guests even more
to grow sales even faster. So I don't want to comment too much on what our margin structure is going to
look like in a year or 2 years because we may make choices that take away some of that margin gain that
we had or we may let that margin flow to the bottom line. But as of right now, our variable margins are
better than they were coming into the pandemic.

John Stephenson Glass
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then, Gene, just following up on your question about the To Go being your -- or your curbside
being the preferred off-premise channel, did you take the opportunity to test third party in this period of
time? Do you look at your results and say, they're just as good as many of your peers with third parties.
So what's the advantage? I mean, how do you conclude or look at this period of change in any way your
view on third party or maybe stiffing your resolve against it?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

John, we've had third-party delivery in some of our restaurants even before the pandemic started,
including some Olive Gardens, a lot of Yard House. And we actually added some third-party delivery in
Yard House in a different state. And we really didn't see that the third-party delivery grew faster than our

own To Go business. Our own To Go business actually grew faster than the third-party business in those
restaurants. And so we're still at the point where we believe that our off-premise business is really strong
and continues to grow, and we are not anticipating launching a third-party delivery model. Now as we've
said all the time, that can change. As soon as we see or if we see that those margins are equal to what we
do today, then maybe we'll go into the third-party model. But as of right now, our resolve is strong. We
believe that doing off-premise the way we do it, especially now that we've added this significant curbside
business, is the way to go.

Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America.

Gregory Ryan Francfort
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Sure. And Dave, congratulations on retirement. I have 2 questions. The first was a follow-up just to the
capacity restraints. I guess the point that average party size is lower in Olive Garden, which is what's
creating the 6-foot distancing. I think the 2.3 was overall, but I guess I was just trying to understand that
point. And then the other question I had was just on off-premise and how much maybe that could look like
in a full AUV recapture scenario. How are you guys looking at it? Because you guys give some data in the
release that maybe it's like 1/3 of prior sales volumes now or 60% of what the peak kind of off-premise
was. But I'm curious how you guys are thinking about that and trying to figure out what that business is
going to look like in terms of size after this.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. As far as capacity for Olive Garden goes, I'm not -- I don't really think it has -- the party size has
an impact on that. It's just more the way the physical layout is, and we have a lot more room. We have
rooms. We have less booths. And so we're trying to create that 6 feet is more difficult. Remember, some
of our smaller rooms are offset. They're family tables, they're larger parties. Olive Garden does a lot of
that. But the majority of our buildings right now, because the booth backs are less than 6 feet, we can't
create the same yield. If we -- and we are adhering to the local jurisdictions. If we adhere to those local
jurisdictions, we can't create the same percentage occupancy in the Olive -- most of the Olive Gardens
that we can in LongHorn. And that's why putting some of these temporary barriers that we're building in
there could help increase the yield. And where we're seeing -- I think when we talk about Olive Garden,
I think we need to focus on the absolute sales number, which is significant. And as we get towards the
weekend, our percentages come down a little -- I mean, get a little bit tougher to keep up, right? So the
bigger, bigger days that we have in Olive Garden are harder to match. Early in the week, our year-over-
year sales declines are a little bit less.

As far as off-premise, I think that we believe off-premise will play a bigger role going forward. I'm not so
sure that we expect to kind of keep these run rates once we get back to a normal environment as long as
there's a threat of COVID and people have modified their personal behaviors, then we think off-premise
business will continue to stay robust. We think this will be a contributor going forward. We think when we
level out, we'll be higher percentages of off-premise in all of our businesses. But I can't sit here today and
say what I think that percentage is going to be. I do think it will be greater.

Great. And I just also want to extend best wishes to Dave on your next chapter.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Well, Andrew, it was actually both. I mean, we did a top-down look at where we are geographically, what
we've been running lately. And our brands did their own bottom-up look at it by geography, et cetera. And
we came to around the same number. And so if you look at what we have, we're seeing approximately
70%, which is where we are after 3 weeks of this quarter. Now mind you, the restaurants that are open
with dining rooms open are doing a little bit better than that. But we just want to make sure that we don't
-- we don't know exactly when all these dining rooms are going to open. We don't know when -- if there's
going to be another wave or -- of some closures. We're hoping that doesn't happen. But that's where we
came up with our 70% number for sales. And then on the profit side, as you saw in our fourth quarter,
we did a much better job in controlling costs and expenses and everything else. And so we just have a
stronger business model, which makes us feel comfortable with our EPS of 0 or greater and a $75 million
or greater EBITDA, and that's total EBITDA in that restaurant level. That's everything.

Andrew Michael Charles
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then a question for you, Gene. Looking beyond the 35 to 40 openings planned for
2021, you talked about how you'll be able to achieve 2% to 3% net restaurant growth shorter term
rather than the longer term. But can you talk about how the pandemic has changed your practices for site
selection as well as changes the restaurant prototype to help maximize ROI for what looks to be a more
off-premise curbside-focused future?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would say it's too early to say it's really changed our philosophy on new restaurant development
at this point. The one thing I do believe is the economics are going to be more favorable than they were
pre-COVID. I think that there'll be a lot less people growing out there. So I think the cost of construction
should come down just like it did in '09, '10 and '11. I think the cost of the underlying land should come
down significantly. And so as we look forward, I think the economics look promising. The best restaurant
deals we did were after the recession in '09 and '10, especially for our specialty brands. So we'll push
hard on that to get favorable economics where possible. I do think that as we look at these businesses
transition to more curbside than folks coming into our restaurants and picking up the takeout order, and
we still don't know how when we get back to a normal environment, how that's going to migrate back,
whether it's going to stay 100% curbside or people are going to want to come in. We've got to really go
through that discovery process. I think the big work that needs to be done is to think about what do we
need to do inside the box to better support and stage curbside. If it's going to be that big part of our
business. Up until recently, in our existing restaurants, we've been doing remodels to create capacity for
inside pickup. Now we've got to really relook at that as we go forward. We have been developing in Olive
Garden more of a dedicated pickup space off the side of the kitchen that we're really happy with. But that
might not be the way we want to go going forward. We don't know. And so we'll see as we move forward.
I think we'll try to build a little more flexibility in our dining rooms and think about different barriers and
our floor plans, so that if something like this happens in the future, we might have more flexibility. But
I'm actually -- I'm really excited about the opportunity to build restaurants. I'm confident in our model.
I believe the cost -- the initial investment cost is going to be less or at least not be inflating at the rate
it was inflating. So we're going to be able to create significant value for Darden going forward with new
restaurant growth, and we'll probably be one of the few out there that's opening new restaurants.

at Olive Garden versus LongHorn, I was just wondering if you could speak to why it seems that the

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

off-premise sales perhaps are being a little bit -- cannibalized a little bit more at Olive Garden versus
Longhorn. And then my second question relates to the promotional environment. It seems like very
few of your competitors that are discounting or even advertising right now. I know you had that $12.99
promo earlier this month, but wondering when do you think the right time to be to restart the promotional
schedule and how you think the competition is setting up with regards to advertising new deals?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

On the first question, I think I'll -- I mean LongHorn just started at a much lower level for off-premise,
and that's why it's growing at 3x and not 2x. I don't think there's anything more to that. I think the
absolute dollar is going outside on Olive Garden on takeout are impressive. I mean there are -- to have
some of the CD levels of overall sales. I mean those are impressive numbers. If you look at 40% last week
on $81,000 per week, that's -- I mean that's a huge business. So I wouldn't read anything else into that
other than LongHorn started at a much lower level as far.

As promotional promotions go, we've pulled back -- obviously, we pulled back on almost all promotional
activity. You're seeing us do a little bit of television in Olive Garden because we own the spots. We bought
them in the upfronts. And so we need to -- we'll continue to advertise there. Right now, we don't think
it's prudent to be promoting people into our restaurants when we have long waits to get into the dining
rooms. I think we would just be creating more frustration for our guests who can't get in. And so at some
point, maybe we'll pivot to do some more off-premise advertising. But right now, we're looking -- we're
taking this opportunity to cleanse our marketing spend, to understand, as we put it back in, what works
better, what gets us the highest return on investment as we put it back into the system. And we think
that's going to be a big opportunity. Again, this is where scale will matter. We can come back in and
advertise our businesses at the right time. We don't think this is the right time to be advertising. We think
this is the right time to pull it back, analyze the situation, and we'll make a -- whenever it's doing this --
when the situation is right, then we'll start to layer some advertising back in and promotion back in.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets.

Christopher Emilio Carril
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And congratulations to Dave on his retirement. So Gene, you referenced Georgia performance regarding
recent LongHorn strength, so following up on that. Can you provide any additional detail on what you're
seeing more broadly in the states that were among the first to allow dining rooms to reopen? Are you
seeing sales in those states meaningfully different than that of your overall average? And how is off-
premise mixing in those states now versus the average?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think that -- I'll answer the first question -- last question first. The off-premise is strong. It's
maintaining. We're seeing no change in off-premise in those states for the most part. As far as how those
states are performing against others, it all depends, I think, on what your brand strength is and what your
relative share is in those markets. So obviously, when you look at LongHorn Atlanta, Georgia, we've got
the largest share of voice there. I mean we have 45 restaurants in the DMA. We're a very trusted brand.
We are borne out of LongHorn and out of Atlanta. And so I think people just trust the brand. And so where
we have great brand strength, whether it's a Cheddar's market that has great brand strength or an Olive
Garden market that has great brand strength, those restaurants come back faster and perform at a higher
level. And so I don't think it really has to do with as much as when the state opens, as much as what's
the brand strength in those specific markets. Another example is where -- we do really well in LongHorn
and Cincinnati is another one of those early markets, and we came back strong in Cincinnati as soon as we
opened. But that's true in -- for Cheddar's in certain markets. It's true for Olive Garden in certain markets.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.

Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. And congrats, Dave. That's a long time to be having weekly lunch with Gene. So congratulations.

Just one question, one follow-up. Just in terms of the question, the changes you discussed that you've
made during COVID, I'm just wondering maybe you can prioritize a few that you think are maybe good
business and will remain post-COVID. I know you mentioned curbside, and we talked about delivery. But
thoughts around social distancing. Or I know you mentioned the online wait list in reservations and the
reduced menu. I'm just wondering if any of those you see as kind of more permanent. And then I had one
follow-up.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, the most permanent and the most significant thing we've done is streamline the menus and our
processes and procedures, and that's forever. This was the opportunity that a lot of us have been waiting
for when we closed down our dining rooms and we knew we had to simplify for the off-premise. And then
we had those 3 or 4 weeks to really focus the corporate level with our teams. They say, "Okay, what do
we really need to come back and how do we keep this simple?" Because we had no idea what was going to
happen when we opened our dining rooms. We didn't know if anybody was going to show up. Right? And
so we have these simple menus out there. They're all disposable. We knew that we could change them
quickly if we needed to. But what we've learned was we could get enough variety on the menus to satisfy
the demand of the consumer, and we could simplify it because we want to make sure we didn't have as
much labor in the back of the house to execute it. So to me, that's the biggest thing our teams have done
and that's been the biggest insight that some of the -- what I would call the superfluous menu items
that are on our menu that 1 out of 100 people that were buying when they were coming in just aren't
important, and most of those created the complexity in the kitchen. And so with this, hopefully, once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity, we're able to pull those out, and I think that's what's going to be the lasting change.
It's going to have significant impact 2, 3, 4 years from today.

Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got you. And then my follow-up was just -- it was mentioned earlier, about the reinfections and seems
like it's ramping up in recent days and weeks. So I'm just wondering if there's any color you can give
directionally in states where you've seen recent spikes, how your business maybe changes or maybe how
your approach to decision is going to change versus the first time, whether speed to close or the duration
of closure. Just wondering what you've seen where those spikes have happened and how your business or
how you might change your process of making decisions this go around versus the first?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

All right. I would just say, real quickly, we've seen no change in our business trends in the states that are
starting to spike. Obviously, we're concerned. We're focused on it. But as a leadership team, we always
talk about, let's focus on what we can control, right? We can't control this. We're not doctors. We're not
in the government. Folks are going to do what their leadership inside the states are going to do what
they're going to do. What we -- if we were focused to pivot again to more restrictions, in-restaurant dining
or even if we have to go back all the way on off-premise, we can pivot that way. It's going to be a lot
easier this time to pivot that way because we know what we're going to do. We know how to do it. Last
time, we were kind of making it up as we were going. We made a lot of right decisions as we did that.
But this time, it would be a lot smoother for us to pivot back to -- on off-premise only experience for a
short period of time. I think the difference this time is that this will be micro, not macro, and that's how
we're thinking about it, and that we've got a team set up to manage day-to-day what's happening in these
local municipalities, and we'll adjust. But as we think about it, as a management and the leadership team,

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett.

Jeffrey Daniel Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

I just wanted to follow-up on the question that Jeff just asked. So I appreciate that you said that so far,
you're not seeing much of a change. But -- and just drilling down a little bit from that level. Again, is
there any type of like a pivot back to off-premise from on-premise, reduced frequency? It sounds like
you're seeing that. At least as it relates to the overall volume levels, you haven't seen much of a change.
But in terms of consumer behavior or taking a little bit of a deeper dive to see how those consumers are
behavior -- or those consumers are behaving in those states that have seen a dramatic jump in COVID
cases, is there anything you can add beyond what you've already answered for Jeff's question?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

No, [ Peter ]. I mean, it's -- we're talking here 6 or 7 days since we've really seen something. We haven't
seen any change in any behavior at this point in time that we can call out. And who knows? Maybe
something will change tomorrow. I don't know. But right now, there's nothing for us to say that can add
any value to this topic.

Jeffrey Daniel Farmer
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

And then just one other follow-up question. So is it possible for some of these restaurants that are
operating at 50%, 60%, 75% capacity to put up positive same-store sales numbers? Can they actually,
again, grow sales year-over-year positive comps with that 50% to 75% capacity constraint?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. As of today, we have somewhere between 10% to 15% of our restaurants that are putting up positive
same-restaurant sales. Their restaurants that have good, solid off-premise business, and they've got a
business that will -- that kind of goes all day, right? It's -- they're in trade areas where, even early in the
week, you've got business from 2 to 5 and after 8. So 10% to 15% of our restaurants today are positive
same-restaurant sales.

So you've got some margin, I guess, to spend. How are you thinking about value maybe over the next

unemployment environment and competition is coming more back online. Just trying to understand your

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

Yes. I think it's real simple. Once we have the capacity and if we see any let-up in demand, then we can
pivot to value. We have that opportunity to invest in value to drive traffic. At this point, it just doesn't
make any sense because we have no capacity to drive it to.

Peter Mokhlis Saleh
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Understood. And then, just my second question is on the -- you guys talked about a competitive
advantage and extensive data and insights that you guys have. Is there -- are you seeing anything in the
data that would move you more towards a loyalty program or away from a loyalty program in the future as
things normalize? Has anything changed during this environment?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Peter, this is Rick. Something did change during this environment. We actually canceled our loyalty
program test and that ended at the end of the fiscal year, and it ended for a couple of reasons. One is
we've had it out there for a while. We had seen some incremental improvement over time. But we just
didn't think this is the right time to continue to invest in that. We wanted to streamline everything we
were doing. That said, there is a chance that we'll bring one back in the future. We did get some good
data out of the loyalty test. So the data is richer than the data that we get from our credit cards and other
things. The real question was do we have enough of that to utilize to market and to do the right things.
And so we canceled the test, again, to streamline, to ensure that we're focusing on the things that are the
most important right now. That said, we may come back with another loyalty program in the future.

Dave, I want to wish you all the best in your retirement. I've really enjoyed covering your career at RARE
and Darden.

So I just have a couple of questions. Rick, the first quarter guidance implies no improvement in the
current trend. So I'm wondering if you're anticipating sales could be impacted when the supplemental
unemployment benefits expire.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Well, everything that we're anticipating is in our guidance. They could be impacted. That said, we don't
know if they're going to be expanded, right? Are they going to be extended? Are they going to be
extended at a different dollar amount? There's still some discussions along those lines. And so we put
everything in there. There's some positives in -- that could happen. There are some negatives that can
happen. And that's why we felt that our 70% sales number against last year was the right number.

Christopher Thomas O'Cull
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then, the company had 43% sales decline in the fourth quarter and lost about $1.25 in adjusted
earnings. You expect 30% sales decline in the first quarter and earnings to breakeven. Can you give us a
further -- a little more explanation as to what are the key line items driving that improvement in earnings
sensitivity?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, a couple of things. One is we had $58 million of costs that we did not adjust out of our earnings that
we won't have in this quarter. As we talked about before, the $58 million of investments that we made,

17

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

$50 million of that was definitely -- not definitely, but it was an impact that we wouldn't expect to happen
going forward. That's one. And two, when we came into this and started declining fast, it took us a little
bit of time to get some of those costs out, right? So you go from a positive sales in 1 week to negative
75% within a couple of weeks. It takes you a little bit of time to move those costs. Now we have all the
fixed costs where we like them. And so with a 70% sales -- so a 30% reduction versus last year, we can
be profitable.

Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.

Sara Harkavy Senatore
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I have 2 questions. One, about unit growth and want to follow-up on margins. The new units, we had
actually anticipated that you might have much lower unit growth just because there might be constraints
on construction or permitting, that kind of thing. Could you just talk about what -- whether we should
expect openings to be more back-end loaded or if the pace is sort of level-loaded or more like normal?
And then, I guess, the other -- and what brand would we expect to see -- is it safe to assume Olive
Garden and LongHorn, given the volume recovery there? So that's the first question, just on units cadence
and brands.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Sara, this is Rick. In terms of opening cadence for the year, recall, we stopped construction in the fourth
quarter, and a lot of those restaurants were either done or close to done. So the restaurant that's opening
in July was pretty much already completed. And so we will have some restaurants that can open quickly if
we want them to. We're opening, as I said, one in July. We've got probably a handful more that will open
by the end of the quarter. And that we're doing to make sure that we can train in social distancing and
make sure that we're training the teams correctly. And then after that, we've got a lot of them that can
open as soon as we think that we can serve the guests' need in -- that's coming into that restaurant. And
so we can flip the switch fairly quickly, but the likelihood is it will be a little bit more back-end loaded just
because we want to see what the environment is before we open a restaurant at limited capacity.

Sara Harkavy Senatore
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Got it. And on the -- the question I had about margins -- sorry, did you say which banners you might be
opening? Olive Garden, LongHorn? Or is it sort of look back at historical rates and that brought the right
mix?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I would look back at historical. Our plan this year is to open at least 1 restaurant for every brand.
And some of them, again, were already under construction, but the majority of our openings will be Olive
Garden and LongHorn.

Sara Harkavy Senatore
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just on the margin follow-up. Can you just give a little more color? You talked about
labor savings. But I'm also trying to understand, when we look at the margin, the complexion, sort of
food, labor, other, how much of that is different in off-premise versus on-premise and what those margins
look like? Or was there mix? I know if LongHorn is doing slightly better, I think that is negative for food
but good for labor. Just trying to understand how much of this is sort of the expense management and the
efficiencies that you found versus business mix?

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Sara, cost of sales was unfavorable to us in the fourth quarter. A lot of it because of mix in brands,
mix in To Go business and the higher expense for packaging. Unlike other brands, we actually put our
packaging costs in our cost of sales. It's not in restaurant expense. It's in cost of sales. So when you think
about how much we shifted to To Go and we had some value platforms in To Go, Olive Garden did buy 1
take 1 for almost the whole time for To Go. So that was a higher cost of sales. We had To Go packaging for
more entrees than normal. We had bundles at some of the other brands. So it was really a mix of To Go, a
mix of what we were selling. And then brand mix is a little bit of that. But it's not too much, except for the
fact that our higher-end brands actually had lower same-restaurant sales, so a bigger negative. And some
of those brands have a fairly good cost of sales measure.

On the labor front, it was all deleveraged. As we talked about -- as I talked about in the prepared
remarks, we had restaurant managers. We paid them even when they were on furlough. We had --
we kept most of our restaurant managers throughout this downturn. We had the $58 million of those
expenses that Gene mentioned, those were -- that was in our restaurant labor, primarily. There was a little
bit in G&A, but most of it was in restaurant labor. So that hurt our margin on that front, too. Those are
things that we don't expect to continue. What we do expect to continue is deleverage in the restaurant
manager labor line because that's a fixed cost. But we do have some, as we said, some favorability on the
hourly labor side.

Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush Securities.

Nerses Setyan
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Appreciating that we don't really know what happens to the incremental $600 a week or other stimulus
measures going forward, I mean -- but is there a sense kind of looking back internally around the extent
to which the stimulus measures contributed to date to the sales recovery? That's my first question, and I
have a follow-up.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

When you think about stimulus, I would say it's definitely a positive. I'm not sure we can quantify how
positive it is. And I would say that, yes, right now, there's -- we think it's -- some of that's going to go
away at the end of July. But I have to -- you have to -- at least I think that the government is going to
have to add some other stimulus to the economy. That should be a positive to us, and it just may come to
us through a different vehicle. And so I expect the overall economy that have stimulus in it. I don't think it
will come in the same form as it's coming today, but I think that we'll get our fair share of it.

Nerses Setyan
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

And given your experience, and you've navigated through a number of cycles, what's your sense that even
if the capacity constraints are completely normalized while we're in a low sort of teens or high single-digit
unemployment environment, what's your sense in terms of where sales eventually do stabilize? And then
just structurally around sort of the fine dining business or the Yard House business, given its exposure to
malls, et cetera, how do we think about those businesses in the medium to longer term?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think what you're asking me is impossible to predict right now because what we -- we don't really
understand the competitive situation. We don't understand how many competitors are going to be out
there. We don't understand the stimulus that the government is going to put in. So I don't know where
this levels out, right? But I do think it's important to note that our fine dining businesses and most --
primarily all our specialty businesses are going to return to normal more slowly than, I think, casual dining

will return to normal primarily because capital growing AUVs rely on business travel and entertainment
as a big part of their sales. And we saw that in '09 and '10. The businesses do shift. You become more
weekend-focused in fine dining in an environment like this. And we're already seeing that shift that our
weekends are actually fairly good in fine dining. Our mid-week business is weak. And so I think to sum it
up, especially brands are going to come back a little bit slower especially in some of -- like some of the
Yard Houses and -- that are tied to ballparks or stadiums or something like L.A. Live, as those areas come
-- those entertainment areas come back slower, they'll have some tough sledding going forward there. But
I don't know where this all ends up. All I do know is that with our strategy and we believe with our scale
and our competitive advantages that we are positioned to gain market share as we move forward. And
I'm confident in that, and I believe the investments we've made in our people are going to be the biggest
advantage we have.

Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS.

Dennis Geiger
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And Gene, thanks for the commentary on capacity constraints. Just wanted to follow up on Jeff's question
about kind of getting those AUVs headed back towards flat or positive. Just wondering if you could talk a
bit more about the things you can do, other than the partitions, to increase capacity or capacity utilization
while the restrictions are in place? Maybe even more broadly, in addition to the capacity utilization,
just speaking to some of the other key things that you can do to drive that AUV recovery with those
restrictions in place?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think it's tough. I think that that's -- we're balancing how much do we want -- how much capital
we want to invest in some sort of temporary solution. If you asked me 2 weeks ago, I would have thought
that we're on a better path to being able to see all the restrictions lifted. Obviously, that has changed here
in the short term. So there's not -- we don't think there's much more that we can do than create some
physical barriers without ruining the atmosphere in the restaurants to create capacity. I mean, some of
our folks have been really creative with outside seating, which I applaud, and I hope they continue to
do that. But then as we get into the summer months down south, that gets more difficult because of the
thunderstorms and things like that. So I really don't see. I think we have to learn to live with what the
restrictions are until such time they're removed.

Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler.

Nicole Miller Regan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I wanted to ask about your team in the stores. How are they feeling? If you think about reopening the
dining room, how many of what would have been a prior concept employee were you able to retain and
-- or not retain but actually bring back? And is that something that you're leveraging in terms of the
reopening process?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Absolutely. That's why we think the investment that we made with the emergency pay and then
paying their benefits has really paid off. We've had very little problem bringing our people back to work.
They're excited to come back to work. They missed their work family. And so depending on the brand,
we're anywhere between 50% and 70% of the initial workforce coming back. The -- in the restaurant
business, our reputation is one of the most important things that we have. And so we have great basic
hygiene processes and procedures already developed. And so our team members are used to working

in this environment. Now we're enforcing some social distancing. They have to wear masks. But they're
great already at washing their hands. The restaurants are already clean. They've got great food handling
procedures. And so there's a lot of confidence in our restaurants that these are great environments to
work in and they feel safe. Our people are just so excited to get back to work. And even -- I would even
say, even when we were in our off-premise only, the amount of people that would -- were coming back to
work and doing different types of jobs and just looking to contribute anyway was incredible. And so that's
why one of the things that we talked about as a leadership team, the first thing that we're going to do is
we're going to try to take care of our team members the best we possibly could in this very, very difficult
situation. And that's why we've invested, in a gross level, $75 million in additional pay for those first 3
weeks. And I think we're being paid back for that, not just today, but I believe we'll be paid back for that
in 2, 3, 4, 5 years. Our restaurant managers are incredibly loyal. We treated them very, very well during
this process.

Nicole Miller Regan
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And just to confirm and close the loop on that, if you think about being relatively back in the range of
70% of sales, the staffing levels are 50% to 70% as a match to the 70% of sales. Is that the way to think
about that?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

That's how I would think about it.

Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.

Andrew Marc Barish
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I'll ask one and then a quick follow-up. Just, Gene, can you give us sort of an update, progress report on
how Cheddar's has come through this? I know you were making some good strides on the people side.
Obviously, this was unprecedented, but just an overview on where Cheddar's is heading.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think Cheddar's made it through this very well. There's 2 things I would highlight on Cheddar's. First
of all, they've always under-indexed on off-premise. And we were able to do a couple of things through
this a lot quicker than we were planning to do. First of all, we only had 2 antiquated phone lines going into
each restaurant. And through this, we were able to get them an upgraded phone system so people could
actually call in orders and get a response from our team members. Second, we were able to transition
them to online ordering, which has had a big impact. And so their off-premise business has built and
continues to build each and every week through this process, which we think will be very beneficial.

The most important thing that happened for Cheddar's through all this is the way that we at Darden
treated them. And I think that when you think about the management and employees, especially
management, this was a critical -- I always look at, when we do acquisitions, it's always this critical
moment when the management forgets about the old days and they don't have that romance with it
and then they're thankful for the new days. And through this process, this is the time I think that our
Cheddar's leadership and people in our restaurants were just thankful that they were a big part of a big
company that could step up and do the right thing, and I think that is going to create incredible loyalty.
We've lost very few management people through this time, and people are really excited about what
they're doing. And lastly, they have the opportunity through this. They made the biggest change with their
menu and processes and procedures in the back of the house. That's going to have a long-lasting impact
on that business and improve the overall financial performance. So we're pleased. We think leadership did

a great job. We think management in the restaurants did a great job. The team members have come back
excited. So we think this was a positive for Cheddar's when it's all said and done.

Andrew Marc Barish
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And just a quick follow-up on the efficiency in the back of the house in lower prep hours. Was that
simply the menu changes? Or did you also -- were you also able to layer in some supply chain changes
with more value-added product or something like that?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

No. I think it was just a little bit of value add but not much. I think it was really -- there was just a --
there was a handful of products that weren't providing a whole lot of value to the consumer that caused a
lot of chaos and a lot of additional prep and cost in the kitchen that we just removed from the menu, and
our guests haven't been asking for it back. So I mean, there's just a lot of streamlining, but that menu has
come down. It's a lot simpler and they did some really good procedural work in -- from the back door to
the front to the dining room table that has just made it easy to execute.

BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I just wanted to circle back on the comment you made about some of the investments you're considering

something specific that you're looking for? Is it just a matter of timing? Just curious for any color around
that, please.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Are you talking about the investments in the facilities that create capacity?

Andrew Strelzik
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

There was a comment about kind of margins 2 or 3 years from now and not wanting to commit to
something around that. So I guess I'm just curious around those potential investments that you're
considering.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Andrew, this is Rick. Yes, I made the comment on margins. And there are a lot of investments we
can make. One of them is to bring marketing back. And so we took -- we're taking marketing down
significantly. Now we'll still have some number in our P&L in Q1 for marketing as a percent of sales. So I
would encourage none of you to put 0 in there. We do have some marketing, but we significantly reduced
it. These menu simplifications that we made. Are there some items that we need to bring back as we
do some more research down the road when we have full dining rooms? Do we have enough breadth
of appeal? And so if we bring them back, how do we do those -- how do we bring those back with a
simplified process? But it would still be a small investment. So there are other investments that we can
make. We can make investments in taking less pricing because we have margin to do that. We can make
investments in quality, which we're doing right now. LongHorn has just made some more significant
quality investments in their menu even throughout this process. I don't know if it's in the restaurant
yet, but it's coming. It's a higher ounce weight for one of their best products without really pricing for
it significantly. Olive Garden is making some significant investments right now in their menu in terms of

better quality and better value. And so we still have a lot of investments that we can make. We're not
going to talk necessarily about what we're going to look for to whether we make those investments or not.
But just be sure to know that the margin that we have today gives us room to make investments or gives
us room to drive it to the bottom line.

Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.

Jon Michael Tower
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And Dave, congratulations on your retirement. Just a few follow-ups for me. First, kind of going
-- zeroing in on this specifically. What percent of in-store sales can Olive Garden regain with the 6-foot
capacity constraints still in place?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Jon, this is Rick. That's actually a pretty difficult question to answer because every restaurant is different
in their layout -- not every restaurant, but a lot of restaurants are different in their layout. And we actually
showed in our presentation what they're doing today. So what the restaurants are doing that are open,
what are they doing in total sales and To Go sales so you can kind of get an idea of where they are. We
think we can make that a little bit better over time with some of these barriers that we're looking at. But
any one brand is different. It's kind of hard to tell you exactly what percent we can do. It also depends on
how much people are willing to go on the shoulders of a meal period. And so as the capacity constraints
happen, are people willing to wait a little bit longer or come in a little bit earlier? And that will help us
drive more sales. But I couldn't tell you exactly what percent is the right number.

Jon Michael Tower
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just on the labor savings so far. How much of the 150 basis points that you saw this
quarter do you think can stick when volumes kind of return back to normal? And then just lastly, I don't
think anybody has asked yet, and maybe I missed it, but you guys raised quite a bit of capital during the
quarter. Can you just discuss your intent on use of those proceeds?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Jon, as regards to the 150 basis points, how much can stick as sales go up, all of -- our hourly
labor is primarily variable. So unless we're making some significant changes to our menu or we're -- we
have to bring in some training again because there's a little bit less training in the fourth quarter. That
would be the reason that our labor as a percent would go up. Or if we determine, as we look at our guest
experience, did we take a little bit too much out? And so we don't believe that was the case because a lot
of this labor came out of the kitchen. But we'll look at it and see that and determine whether we need to
bring some of it back. But I would still say that the first quarter should have an hourly labor benefit. Now
remember, it's going to be offset by deleverage in the management labor side. And so if you can remind
me the second question, sorry.

Jon Michael Tower
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just in terms of the proceeds you raised.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

On the capital front, yes. When we raised that additional $500 million in capital, we said it was to invest
in growth and to shore up our balance sheet. And so we believe our balance sheet is shored up. As we

mentioned, our adjusted debt to adjusted capital ratio is 61% and our covenant is 75%. Had we not raised
that capital, we would have been a lot closer to that covenant. We are making investments in growth
right now. As I mentioned, some of the investments that we're making are investments in quality. We're
using some of that capital to invest in quality. We used some of that capital to invest in our team, as Gene
mentioned. So the things that we did that we think are going to benefit us in the long term. We now have
the capital to be able to start growth again. And as we said, we're going to start opening restaurants
again. We think that others might not have as much of a balance sheet to be able to do that. And so those
are the investments we're talking about today. And we'll continue to look at other ways to invest that
capital for future growth. We think there's a tremendous opportunity to invest, and that's why we took out
that extra equity.

Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners.

Brett Saul Levy
MKM Partners LLC, Research Division

And Dave, I think you really misunderstood what Gene was saying when he said that this is going to be a
work-at-home -- a stay-at-home economy. So congrats to your time off.

When you think about the capital that you provided us, the outlay for the $250 million to $300 million,
how much of that is going to go in towards the new level of maintenance that these units are going to
take? And also, just how are you thinking about areas like the stepped-up IT and the digital onslaught
that we're seeing? And then just when you think about your portfolio, you've talked about LongHorn, Olive
Garden, Cheddar's a bit. Where do you still see additional need to work on at the other chains to catch
them up to where you are? And I'll stop there.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Okay. So you got maintenance CapEx, technology and brand mix. So if you think about our maintenance
CapEx, our number of $250 million to $300 million is probably got $100 million to $125 million, $100
million to $120 million of maintenance, which is a little bit lower than we normally say, about $120 million.
So let's just say we take a $20 million number out of that.

On the technology front, we're still investing in technology. That's one of the things that we're going to
continue to invest in, and we made a lot of investments in the fourth quarter. When you think about what
we did to bring Cheddar's online, bring all the other brands that didn't have online ordering up, to make
some investments now on our curbside and how do we make that curbside even more streamlined through
technology, how do we improve payment and doing other things. So there's a lot more we're going to do
in technology. That team is really, really busy. We're really, really proud of what they did over the last
couple of weeks of the etched 14 weeks to ensure that our website stayed up and running as we drove a
lot more traffic.

I mean, as it turns to the brands that we're investing in, we believe that we should invest in all of
our brands. As we mentioned in a number of the openings, we're going to open, I believe, at least 1
restaurant for every brand if we can get through all of the space limitations and the social distancing
limitations in that 35 to 40 restaurants. And we are very excited about every one of our brands and their
ability to grow.

DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 25, 2020

Two questions. First on seating capacity. You talked about how social distancing is more of a constraint.
It sounded like it was more of a constraint for Olive Garden than LongHorn. I don't know if you meant to
imply that. And if that is the case, how much of a boost to capacity can occur with those barriers? And I
have a follow-up.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, the barriers that we're testing in Olive Garden can boost capacity significantly because the booth
back is so low in an Olive Garden. That's the difference between olive garden and LongHorn is that the
booth backs are much higher. And when you think about a LongHorn, LongHorn is just one big room. And
then what we do in a LongHorn is we use dividers to create space and to create the ambience that we
want, which ended up working in our favor. That created some social distancing. Whereas in Olive Garden,
everything is at a much lower level. It's like at 4 feet. So we're looking at how do we -- we have gone into
a majority of the Olive Gardens already put in Plexiglass in certain places to create some barriers to get
us to the occupancy that we're at. And also in Olive Garden, you have a lot of nooks and crannies where
we have 4 tables in there, and now we're lucky if we can -- we're only going to use 2. If we can -- in some
of those instances in those rooms, you only really get to use one. And so it just had to do more with what
the -- how the floor plan was and our ability to create barriers with booth backs.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I mean, is this -- is that 7% difference in the recent open stores roughly the difference? I mean, how
much of a boost to the capacity could you get?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

There is some -- there's some geography that's favoring LongHorn versus Olive Garden. A lot of Olive
Gardens -- I mean, just the way it's laid out, when you think about Georgia and the percentage of
restaurants that LongHorn has in Georgia, and there are no restrictions in Georgia right now for the most
part, they've really benefited from that.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And I guess you mentioned there was positive comps in 10% to 15% of restaurants. I mean, we're talking
about these capacity constraints. It's hard to get your head around how that's possible. Is there -- do you
have any comment on that? And how -- what sort of information that gives you about what's possible for
the rest of your restaurants?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's just a -- you got a significant off-premise business in those restaurants. And you have a
consumer that probably has limited access to other restaurants that is willing to eat at 2:00 in the
afternoon. And that's when I look at those restaurants, some of them are more rural, especially in
Georgia. And so I think each individual situation has got a specific reason why I think that individual
restaurant is performing the way it does. But it just says that, combined with good off-premise, consumer
-- our consumer base that is willing to roll through the whole day and use the facility, you can create some
volume greater than last year. Those are unique situations, though, David.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

You don't feel like -- yes. I mean, do you don't feel like sharing what percent capacity increase you could
get from these barriers on Olive Garden? Is that something you couldn't put your finger on?

Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.

John William Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I know we've kind of touched on unit development a couple of times. Just was looking for maybe some
clarification and also maybe a little bit of forward guidance. 35 to 40 net, how many is that gross? In other
words, how many are you expecting to actually close in '21? And obviously, I did see some impairments
and wondering if that was going to lead to some closures. And that CapEx number of $250 million to $300
million is a low number given the number of units that you are opening. And certainly, any CapEx that you
have in '21 would also kind of foretell whatever you're going to open in '22. So are you kind of thinking
that you can get back to a 2% to 3% unit development in fiscal '22? And how should we think about --
it's a lot of different questions here. How should we think about overall maintenance CapEx as perhaps a
percentage of D&A in a post-crisis environment as you've kind of rethought the overall business models?
And I'd like another question as well.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

All right, John. So the 35 to 40 restaurant is really almost gross and net. So there's -- we don't have a
whole lot of closings that we would anticipate in this fiscal year. We just closed 11 restaurants in the fourth
quarter. Some of them were already impaired and the rest of them, we impaired when we closed them.
And so if we had something that we were going to close, we already did it. Unless we had something
where the lease wouldn't allow us to close. So we don't anticipate closing any more restaurants this year
unless there's a lease expiration that we couldn't move or if something gets damaged in other ways. So
the gross-to-net is about the same.

In terms of CapEx, the $250 million to $300 million, remember, we had stopped construction of 17
restaurants that were supposed to open in Q4 or in the fourth quarter, really, of FY '20. And so a lot of
that CapEx has already been spent. Even if we ramp up development, we wouldn't be able to ramp it up
enough to spend a lot of CapEx in the late FY '21 for FY '22. We're not ready to talk about FY '22 openings.
So if you take out the 17 openings that we had delayed from FY '20 to FY '21, that cuts the 35 in half,
right? And it cuts the 40 down to 23. And so we do believe we could get to the 2% to 3% unit growth.
Get back to that fairly quickly. We'll probably be close to that this year when you think about the 35 to
40. The question will be '22 and how fast do we ramp up development when we have to make sure that
the landlords and the landowners and the construction folks understand there's probably a new price out
there today. And so that takes a little bit of time for price discovery. And so we'll see how long it takes us
to ramp back up. We have the team to be able to do it, and we're ready to do it what we need.

On the maintenance side, I think I mentioned $100 million to $120 million. It's not too different than
what we've been doing before. Remember, our #1 priority with capital is to make sure our restaurants are
maintained beautifully, and we've been consistent in that all along. And so we do not want to cut down
on maintenance that is essential and is needed, and we believe maintaining our restaurants is essential
maintenance. So while we did reduce that during the fourth quarter, because basically, restaurants weren't
very busy, we will bring that back. And that's why we've got $100 million to $120 million in our CapEx
number for this year.

Okay. And maybe thinking about maintenance CapEx as a percentage of D&A, maybe that's kind of
something to think about over the very long term, but it doesn't necessarily have to play out over a couple
of years, I suppose, is what you're telling me.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It won't play out much.

John William Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And the second topic, and it's kind of a completely different one, but it's a big spending
bucket. A lot of companies are kind of thinking about and reevaluating their calendar '21 versus calendar
'19 G&A. I mean, we're all kind of recognizing how different we can work in efficiency and how much
travel we actually need to do and how much money and time, virtual, work and work at home, what have
you, actually saves us. And that's something separate even in head count. But how many of the changes
in terms of the organization are you making? Whether it's spending per employee -- not on salary, but
on things on top of salary and also number of employees? Are we beginning to think it might be the right
level for the organization? And if it's possible to -- because it's such an important number to put in the
model and just to think about, what that calendar '21 versus calendar '19, if it's fair to think about it in
that way, could look like for Darden?

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

John, it's hard to answer calendar for us because we're a fiscal year company. We don't think calendar. So
to think that way would take a little bit of mental math.

John William Ivankoe
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. I understand, but it's like -- I just want to put an asterisk on calendar '20. But you're unusual and
you're right in the middle of it. So no. Okay.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

And just let me give you an idea, we would anticipate in the first half of our fiscal year to have significantly
less spend per employee in travel and in some of the department expenses that we have. We're also
looking at our organization to see what the right size of the organization is based on our sales levels
today. And so as we mentioned after -- in Q4, we saved $17 million in G&A. We don't anticipate to save
$17 million in Q1. But we're going to save some G&A in Q1 and continue into Q2. Without talking about
what the percent G&A percent is, it's not going to be hugely, hugely different than what it was at the
end of the fiscal -- in fiscal '20. So I wouldn't model dramatic changes. It could be 50 to 100 basis points
different but higher just because of the sales deleverage, but that's all in our guidance. It's all in what we
have in Q1. And as we get better understanding of what our sales levels are going to be going forward,
we'll have a better understanding of what our G&A as a percent will be. But we will spend less per person
on the department stuff and the travel in the first half of this fiscal year.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim.

Matthew James DiFrisco
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I have 2 quick questions. One for Gene. In particular, you guys have talked a lot about the bigger --
your scale being an advantage and the consolidation at the top. So some smaller independents, smaller
regional players potentially falling out, some capacity coming out. I wonder if you could update us on sort

of your outlook, say, the next 6 months or so, what we should look at as year-over-year capacity that
potentially could come out of the full-service casual dining sector.

And then secondly, for Rick, I wanted to sort of walk through that model where you gave about 30% down
on sales equates to a little over $600 million in sales in your model in 1Q. And then your EBITDA is about
$200 million or so less. I wonder, how do we get back to a whole basis year-over-year on EBITDA? Do we
need all of the $600 million or so of sales to come back? Or could we get a portion of that to get greater
than $200 million of EBITDA back? I'm trying to understand the flow-through on this new lower variable
cost model.

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

Matt, on the capacity, I think it -- I'm not going to tell you -- sit here today and predict a number, whether
that's 10%, 20%. There's a lot of people throwing around different numbers out there. The one thing I will
say, I believe there'll be significantly less restaurants out there to compete against in the near term. And
the longer this environment lasts, I think the more fallout you're going to have. And so I think that is an
advantage for us going forward.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Matt, and as it relates to sales to get back to our EBITDA, yes, you're right. It's about $600 million is what
you mentioned on the 30%. We don't need all $600 million to get back to that EBITDA based on what
our margin structure looks like today. I'm not going to give you exactly what we need. But it's not 100%
of what we were doing before. That said, the reason I'm not going to give you that number is because
we may invest some of that back. So I don't want to put out a number to say it's 90%, 95% or 100%
because we're going to do the right thing for our guests and our team members to make sure that this
cost structure that we have today is the right cost structure in the future. And if it's not, we'll make some
investments. But I will say that those investments may take a little bit of time. So we will have a better
flow-through in the first quarter on some of these sales than we would have had in the past.

And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs.

Katherine Irene Fogertey
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I have a couple of questions mainly around the menu simplification that you may have had to do during
the quarter. And I was hoping you could kind of walk through by brand where you found the greatest
amount of efficiency? And you mentioned some are about 15% to 20% below prior menu point. What
would be the catalyst to bring them back? And any kind of numbers you could put around the cost savings
you've found on that front? And I have a follow-up.

Ricardo Cardenas
Senior VP & CFO

Katie, this is Rick. On a brand-by-brand level to tell you what the margin differences are and what we've
done, it'd be a pretty long conversation. But I would say that, as Gene mentioned earlier, Cheddar's made
a lot of change to their menu and a lot of change in their procedures to bring a lot of direct labor out of
the system. So if you think about kind of in order of magnitude, Cheddar's had the most change in their
menu and the improvement in their labor costs over time. All of our brands are doing better in direct
labor as a percent of sales than they were last year. All of them. Cheddar's is doing a lot better. But to
tell you exactly what we did, again, all brands did things differently. All brands changed their menus a
little bit differently. But all brands focused on -- when we went in to an off-premise only model, they focus
on how can we serve, what can we serve, what are our highest value items, what are our highest guest
satisfaction items and what are the items that we can actually run it with just managers. And so if you
think about brands like Cheddar's, like Capital Grille, the smaller -- the specialty brands, most of their To

Go sales, when they were To Go only, were done with managers only. So we had to simplify that menu.
And Olive Garden also simplified even though they had team members in the restaurant at the same time.
But those simplifications, again, were to streamline the menu to the most value items for the guests and
the ones that the guests wanted the most. And so what's interesting now and without the menu marketing
and the different things that we do on menu development, guests are voting with what they're buying.
And it's amazing was as we simplify the menu, we can actually see what the guest favorites really are.
And the great thing is for a brand like Olive Garden, it's a few products that are on a few different menu
items. And so it actually is better to keep it that way because we streamline.

And so without giving you specific examples, those are some kind of high levels of how we did it. And
again, all brands had hourly labor efficiency improvements, and we expect those to stay. Maybe not as
good as they were, but we expect the efficiencies to stay.

Katherine Irene Fogertey
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's actually super helpful ranking on that guide. And then my follow-up question is actually around
the comments you made about investing for growth. Am I right to be thinking that M&A is a potential
opportunity just given you have some of the benefit of your balance sheet? And if that is right, what
categories look particularly attractive to you? What do you think would help with your overall -- would fit
well? Or do you have any holes in your portfolio that you are particularly excited about going forward?

Eugene I. Lee
President, CEO & Director

The management and the Board will continue to look at the opportunities that are available out there.
We'll look at our own portfolio. We look at what is out there that could possibly fit our portfolio. The only
thing I would say on specifics around that is that we believe we want to be in the full service business.
That's where we get the advantages of our scale. So as we look out there at the full-service environment,
I think that we'll continue to analyze the opportunities. And if something makes sense, then we'll try to
bring it into our platform. Our thought process is always, does it benefit by coming on our platform? And is
the platform benefit if they -- by them coming on the platform? You get through that screen and then that
can grow a little bit, then it makes sense. I think right now, it's about timing. It's about what's the right --
what the price discovery. And then we'd have to make the decision at that point in time.

Operator

It looks like that's all the questions that we have at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our
presenters.

Kevin Kalicak
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Analysis

Thank you, James. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind everyone that we plan to release first quarter
results on Thursday, September 24, before the market opens. Thank you for participating in today's call.

Operator
This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
