toll-free by dialing 1 (877) 344-7529. International callers may listen by dialing 1 (412) 317-0088. The
access code for replay is 10158766. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American
Water's Investor Relations website at ir.amwater.com/events.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr.
Vallejo, you may begin.

Edward D. Vallejo
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end
of our prepared remarks, we will, as usual, open the call for any of your questions. During the conference
call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make forward-looking
statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events.
These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations, estimates and assumptions.
However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different
from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks,
uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important
information is provided in the earnings release and in our June 30, 2021 Form 10-Q, each as filed with the
SEC.

Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information related to O&M efficiency ratio can be found in our
earnings release and in the appendix of the slide deck for this call. The slide deck has also been posted to
our Investor Relations page for our website. All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per
share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share and for purposes of the anchor year on long-term
EPS growth guidance, the anchor is weather-adjusted 2020 EPS of $3.84. And with that, I will turn the call
over to American Water's President and CEO, Walter Lynch.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Once again, the employees of American
Water delivered solid results as we continue to execute on our low-risk profile and predictable growth
story. Let's move to Slide 5 to cover the highlights of our second quarter and 6-month results. Our second
quarter 2021 earnings per share increased 17.5% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Included in
the results is a $0.03 per share benefit from weather primarily in the Northeast, where we saw a moderate
impact from warmer and drier-than-normal conditions.

In the first 6 months of 2021, we invested $782 million with the majority dedicated to needed
infrastructure improvements to better serve our customers. We continue to work hard to minimize the bill
impacts of these investments by focusing on capital and operating efficiencies, constructive regulatory
outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business. As a reminder, we previously announced
an O&M efficiency target of 30.4% by 2025. We also continue our disciplined approach to regulated
acquisitions.

We've added approximately 11,200 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic
growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 86,900 customer connections through pending
acquisitions. I'll provide more detail on growth in a moment.

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Moving to Slide 6. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make
in our regulated operations. We plan to spend $1.9 billion in 2021 and about $10.4 billion over the next
5 years. The continued investment is critical to improving and maintaining distribution and treatment
infrastructure, including improving water quality, fixing leaks and providing water for fire hydrants.

These efforts help our communities remain strong and attractive to residents and businesses. With
a strong first half of 2021 and continued execution of our strategies, we're affirming today our 2021
earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28 per share. We're also affirming our long-term EPS compound
annual growth rate range of 7% to 10%.

Turning to Slide 7. Let's go through some of the regulatory and legislative highlights of the second quarter
2021. On June 28, the Iowa Utilities Board issued an order approving an increase in annual base revenue
of $1 million for Iowa American Water. The company's investment of almost $87 million in water system
improvements was the primary driver behind the rate adjustment request. We also have pending cases
in West Virginia and California. We cover California American Water's general rate case as well as the
cost of capital application on the last call and both cases are progressing as expected. Let me spend a
few minutes on California's drought emergency. As you've likely heard, Governor Newsom expanded the
state's drought emergency declaration in 50 out of 58 counties. Currently, our water supplies in California
are in good shape, but we're activating mandatory conservation measures for our customers in Sonoma
County.

We're also conducting extensive outreach to our highest water users and encouraging our customers to
voluntarily reduce their water use across our entire service area. The drought once again highlights the
need for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. As we previously discussed, California American
Water refiled its application to the Coastal Commission on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the
Coastal Commission sent a notice requesting additional information. California American Water provided
the requested responses in March 2021. The Coastal Commission then requested additional information on
June 18.

Our California team is working on this additional request. Once we provide that information and staff
deems the application complete, by statute, the Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process it.
Additionally, on July 29, The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities issued a final order denying approval of
acquisition adjustments and rates associated with the purchase of Shorelands and Haddonfield in 2017
and 2015, respectively. The order is not the outcome we've been working towards, and we continue to
evaluate next steps.

However, we had a counter for this possibility and the decision will not have an impact on our financial
results. Moving to state legislation. We continue to engage with states as they take action to help address
water and wastewater challenges. In New Jersey, legislation that strengthens the state's Water Quality
Accountability Act has passed both houses unanimously and is awaiting the governor signature. The
enhancements include additional enforcement requirements for reporting data, stronger cybersecurity
requirements and asset management plans and requirements for the sale of systems with prolonged
violations.

New Jersey was the first state to pass the Water Quality Accountability Act, and we're pleased to see
the act strengthen on behalf of all water customers in New Jersey. Also in New Jersey, the Governor
signed a lead service line replacement bill that includes O&M expenses and interest accrued on customer-
owned lines as recoverable items. As you know, American Water is long advocated for full service line
replacement versus a partial replacement to address lead issues. In Missouri, the governor signed the
Water and Sewer Infrastructure Act, which will become effective on August 28, 2021.

This act establishes a new statewide infrastructure system replacement surcharge program that
broadens the list of eligible projects. It also increases the cap from 10% to 15% of Missouri American
Water's revenue requirement for these eligible projects. Additionally, customer-owned lead service line
replacements are excluded from the cap. Finally, as we mentioned last call, at a national level, we remain
supportive of investments in water and wastewater infrastructure. The proposed bipartisan package
supported by the administration includes $55 billion for water infrastructure. We believe the proposed

additions to state revolving funds for drinking water and the possible expansion of a water LIHEAP type
program for all water customers would help improve our nation's water infrastructure.

Moving to Slide 8. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart
investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending June
30, 2021, our O&M efficiency ratio was 33.9% compared to 34.3% for the 12-month period ended June
30, 2020. As we note each quarter, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they
were in 2010.

During that period, we've added approximately 333,000 customer connections while expenses only
increased at a compound annual growth rate of just over 1%. On the subject of cost, inflationary
pressures and scarcities of some supplies in certain sectors of the U.S. economy, let me remind you that
our company does have the advantage of volumetric purchases and economies of scale.

By leveraging our national size and scale and working closely with our suppliers in the water sector, we've
been able to shield ourselves for the most part from these effects. At this time, we've not experienced and
do not anticipate any material negative impacts on our supply chain.

Before we move to growth, let me provide a quick update on the sale of New York American Water. Both
American Water and Liberty remain committed to closing the sale and continue to work through the
regulatory process. As noted by 8-K filing on June 29, both parties agreed to extend the closing end date
in accordance with the terms of the stock purchase agreement. We remain confident that the sale will be
completed. Assuming progress continues as expected, we believe that the net impact from New York in
2021 results won't materially impact our 2021 guidance range.

Further, we don't anticipate any impact on the expected timing of our previously discussed future equity
needs. Moving to Slide 9. We've announced multiple acquisitions in the first half of 2021, including our
largest acquisition in York, Pennsylvania, which will add an equivalent customer connection total of more
than 45,000.

We continue to make progress on that acquisition, most recently filing an application with the Public Utility
Commission on July 1. As I mentioned earlier, so far in 2021, we've closed on 8 acquisitions in 4 different
states, adding approximately 3,000 new customer connections. We've also added approximately 8,200
customer connections to organic growth in the first 6 months. We look forward to adding another 86,900
customer connections through 37 currently signed agreements in 8 states. These new agreements reflect
our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions in communities where we can leverage our
scale and expertise. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges, and we're well
positioned to provide them solutions. Our growth is also a direct result of our commitment to customer
service.

I want to congratulate both our New Jersey and Illinois subsidiaries for earning J.D. Power awards for
ranking highest in customer satisfaction among large utilities, large water utilities in the Northeast and
Midwest. This is the second year in a row that our Illinois subsidiary, ranked highest. We're proud of our
teams and the way they put our customers first every day. With that, I'll turn it over to Susan.

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Walter. Let's start on Slide 11 with a review of results. Second quarter 2021 earnings were $1.14
per share compared to $0.97 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Walter mentioned, included in
earnings is an estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather, primarily in the Northeast, where
we saw conditions warmer and drier than normal through the quarter. Results for the Regulated Business
segment were $1.18 per share, an increase of $0.21 per share compared to 2020 earnings. Results for the
market-based business were $0.11 per share, a decrease of $0.02 per share.

And finally, parent company results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 as compared
to the same period last year. Our 2021 earnings through June 30 were $1.87 per share, an increase
of $0.22 per share compared to the same period last year. Results for the 6-month period include the
estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather in the second quarter of '21.

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Regulated business results increased $0.27 per share compared to 2020 earnings, and our market-based
business results decreased $0.05 per share and parent company results were unchanged year-over-year.
Moving on to Slide 12. Let me provide just a few more details by business. As I noted earlier, regulated
results increased $0.21 per share. And we saw a $0.30 per share increase in revenues from new rates
in effect from acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19
pandemic. As a reminder, we saw the 2020 full year impact on demand due to the pandemic to be nearly
0, and we see no real lingering impact on demand in 2021. Also, as I mentioned previously, results reflect
an estimated $0.03 per share increase from warmer and drier-than-normal weather, primarily in the
Northeast.

Partially offsetting these results, O&M expense increased by $0.09 per share and depreciation expense
increased $0.03 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. The Market-Based Business
results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of '21 as compared to the second quarter of
2020. The lower results reflect increased claims in 2021 in the Homeowner Services Group. The parent
results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared to the second quarter of 2020,
largely driven by higher interest expense to support regulated growth.

While on the topic of results, I'd like to also reiterate what we told you last quarter with regard to the
company's lower effective income tax rate. This results from an increase in the amortization of excess,
accumulated deferred income taxes as agreed to through the regulatory process and is largely offset with
lower revenue, resulting in no material impact to earnings, and we will continue to see this impact as that
amortization continues. Moving on to Slide 13. Consolidated results increased $0.22 per share for the
year-to-date period compared to the same period last year. Results for the regulated operations increased
$0.27 per share for the year-to-date period.

We saw a $0.50 per share increase from additional revenue -- additional authorized revenue from
acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of '20 attributable to the pandemic. Year-
to-date results also reflect the estimated $0.03 per share favorable weather benefit. Offsetting these
increases were increases in O&M expense of $0.18 per share and depreciation of $0.08 per share, all as
a result of growth in the business. The Market-Based Businesses results decreased $0.05 per share due
to higher claims in 2021 in Homeowner Services Group, including the extreme cold weather across the
country during the first quarter of '21, primarily in Texas and Illinois.

And parent results were flat compared to the same period in '20 as higher interest expense to support
regulated growth was offset by a number of small items that increased expenses in 2020. Moving on to
Slide 14. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability
to consistently deliver financial results. And to date, the regulated business has received $146 million in
annualized new revenues in 2021. This includes $100 million from general rate cases and step increases,
excluding the agreed reduction in revenue from the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income
taxes and $46 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final
orders on the 2 rate cases previously mentioned by Walter and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for
a total annualized revenue request of $71 million.

I'd also like to add that generally, we have received favorable regulatory decisions addressing our
incremental financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have received favorable deferral orders in
most jurisdictions, including cost recovery orders approved by our regulators in Illinois, Missouri and Iowa.

In Pennsylvania, the administrative law judge issued a recommendation that would allow us to defer our
incremental, uncollectible expense resulting from the pandemic, but would exclude other financial impacts,
such as waive delayed fees and additional interest costs. Our Pennsylvania subsidiary has filed exceptions
to the ALG recommendation -- recommended decision, highlighting among other things, the favorable
decisions we have received in other jurisdictions. We expect a final Pennsylvania deferral order addressing
these matters later in the third quarter.

Moving on to Slide 15. I want to provide a few details of the very favorable debt offering we executed in
May. The company successfully completed a $1.1 billion debt offering in support of our $10.4 billion 5-
year capital plan and to refinance approximately $327 million of high coupon debt. We issued $550 million
each of 10- and 30-year debt with coupon rates of 2.3% and 3.25%, respectively. These are the lowest

rates American Water has ever achieved on a public debt offering and is representative of the company's
healthy balance sheet and strong credit profile, and we're pleased to have achieved such favorable rates to
the benefit of our customers.

Moving on to Slide 16. I'd like to reiterate Walter's comments earlier because of our strong performance
and continued focus on execution, we are affirming our 2021 earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28
per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings per share, compound annual growth rate of 7%
to 10%. As shown on Slide 17, and as our results demonstrate, we continue to deliver on our earnings
commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and
superior dividend growth expectations provides excellent value for our shareholders.

We continue to outperform our peers. And as you can see on this slide, measured currently, we have
delivered a total shareholder return of 126% over the last 5 years, outpacing our peers in the Philadelphia
Utility Index as well as the S&P 500 Index.

And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for some closing remarks.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Susan. And before we move on to your questions, I want to take a few minutes to talk
about our ESG highlights over the last 6 months. We've been hearing from stakeholders if they'd like
to receive more ESG data on an annual basis. We've published 2 new documents on our website. First,
we made our environmental policy more visible by posting it on our ESG page. We also posted an ESG
data summary, which we'll update annually. We also continue to implement best practices and respond to
surveys and reports. For example, just last week, we submitted our annual CDP climate change response
which highlights American Water's efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions and risks associated with
climate variability.
As we've discussed previously, since 2007 through year-end 2020, we've reduced our greenhouse gas
emissions by approximately 36%. This means we're close to our goal of a 40% reduction by 2025. I also
want to mention our recent recognition as a top score in the Disability Equality Index for a third year
in a row. We firmly believe we're more successful when our workforce reflects the communities that we
serve. We're proud to be recognized by DEI and to be an ally to those with different abilities. Finally, as a
reminder, we'll be publishing and posting our 2019 to 2020 sustainability report this fall. With that, we're
happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just a couple of questions here. So first, starting with the sale of the New York utility, Walter, where
are we in the process versus kind of your expectations and guidance? And what is the potential creation of
these kind of water authorities you mean for the process, assuming the governor signs them?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Well, we continue to work with Liberty cooperatively to get to the endpoint of selling the systems, and
we do believe that this sale will happen. We're working with the commission staff, with the commission,
with the governor's office to advance the sale. There's just a lot there as far as the North Shore Water
Authority, the South Shore Water Authority, there was legislation passed, waiting governor's approval.
That's just all part, I think, of how they're looking at this on Long Island to get this deal done. So again,
we continue to work in a cooperative way with everybody to get to the endpoint. We're confident that this
will happen.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then the infrastructure bill in DC authorizes almost, I think, $15 billion for EPA water
funding and millions annually for like programs like leak reduction and sewer overflows. Do you sort of
see this as a crowding out of sort of the private capital like yours, i.e., slowing potential muni acquisition
growth? Or is it kind of a drop in the bucket from a national perspective?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for that, Shar. And we welcome the attention to the water and wastewater industry.
Significant investment that's needed over the next 20 years. And we've talked many times about $1
trillion needed. So while this is good money to be put to good causes, there's still a lot to go. And again,
we're just happy to be in the discussion with the administration as far as -- in the infrastructure plan. We
do think the money set aside for -- the lead service line replacement and also the PFAS treatment is good,
and it will help many communities out there. But again, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the overall
spending that's necessary.

And we don't see it impacting in any way, our investment or our growth in the water and wastewater
sector through acquisitions.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, it sounds like Monterey County is getting closer to filing for eminent
domain for the local system assets from Cal-Am. There is a third-party study that's, I think, forthcoming
based on the June 28 vote. Could we just get an overview of sort of what this process could look like from
a timing and valuation perspective?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Well, as we know, this is a multiyear process. And right now, they're working through getting approval
from the local agency formation commission. And then once they get that approval, they've got to go

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

through a series of different trials, the right to take trial and then a valuation trial. And so again, it will
take years to work through that. But the first step is getting through the what's called LAFCO, I mean
getting their approval before they can move forward with the condemnation.

Operator

Our next question will come from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America.

Ryan Greenwald
BofA Securities, Research Division

Any additional color you can offer at this point around the grand jury subpoena, whether it be time line for
resolution or potential implications as the process plays out?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Ryan, really, there's nothing more we can say. It's ongoing. Our disclosure is everything that we can
say about it at this point.

Ryan Greenwald
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And then you guys highlighted a couple of new state legislative items and then obviously, the infill
at the federal level. Any key states that you're watching from here just in terms of other constructive
legislation that could come up, but might be in earlier days still?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Well, in Pennsylvania, there's a Senate bill that's right in line with the Water Accountability Act, Water
Quality Accountability Act. So we're tracking that. That's working its way through in the Senate and then
it will be introduced into the house over there. So we're expecting that to progress this year in 2021. So
keep an eye off for that. That will be the fourth state. As you know, we are working with Missouri and
Indiana to get theirs and also start here in New Jersey. So we're thrilled that Pennsylvania is moving
forward with that.

Ryan Greenwald
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just lastly, in terms of the New York American Water sale piggybacking off the
earlier question. Is the expectation that the whole New York American Water operations would ultimately
get sold to Liberty? Or do you expect to carve out with the new authorities?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're working through that. We do expect the sale to go to Liberty in its entirety, and then they
would work through whatever comes after that.

Operator

Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Walter, just a quick clarification on the New York American. Just Susan, I think you mentioned in the
last call that the sale doesn't impact whether New York ends up being sold or not doesn't impact. A, the
amount of equity and timing of the equity. Is that still the case?

M. Susan Hardwick

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Yes, that's still the case, Durgesh.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just 2 quick things on 2021. Susan, just Market-Based earnings continue
to be down. This is the second consecutive quarter and you mentioned claims expense. Can you maybe
just elaborate on that a little bit? Is this still sort of the Texas event from Q1, dragging on to Q2? Or
what's -- are there claims in certain parts of the -- of your service territory that are more adverse than
others?

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Let me make just a couple of comments, and Walter can certainly weigh in. I think the weather event
that we saw in the first quarter in Texas and Illinois that was really isolated to the first quarter. But we
have seen a continuation of sort of higher claims experience I think, really largely driven by more at-home
activities.

We've got more folks at home and there's more pressure on systems. And so we're seeing more failures
and more work being done by the HOS team. And so that claims experience has been a bit higher than
we would have expected. And I think you can also expect higher claims just simply from growth in the
business. We've seen more of that occur. And there's also a little bit of higher marketing expense. We
didn't call that out specifically, but a bit more marketing expenses as we continue to introduce new
products throughout the HOS territory. So it really is a factor, I think, of sort of the pandemic itself and
just a bit higher experience than we would have anticipated.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful. And then just one last for me. Can you just share the July sort of weather
experience across your service territories?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Well, again, we benefit from having diversity across -- geographic diversity across our system. So we have
seen some wetter than normal conditions in some areas, but offset by drier and others.

But overall, I'd say, again, some additional precipitation in some areas and others not. So it's but all we
can say at this point, Durgesh.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

It sounds like more like neutral.

Our next question will come from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is on the pace of M&A, the tuck-in acquisitions. It seems like you guys still have a
pretty healthy run rate going there. What's a good annualized customer addition rate that we should be
embedding maybe in the 5-year plan and that might be embedded in your plan as well?

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Yes. Well, at 1.5% to 2.5%, we're around 50,000, 60,000, 70,000 customers a year is what we -- you
should think in that term. And again, we continue to build our pipeline into, and we've increased it from
1.23 million to 1.3 million. We continue to have discussions with communities across our footprint because
we can provide solutions, and that's what they're looking for. So we're really proud of our efforts there,
and we just continue to build that pipeline. And we're really proud to have 37 different deals signed up,
waiting to get regulatory approval across 8 different states. So the growth is not just happening in 2 or 3
or 4 states, it's happening across our footprint.

Insoo Kim
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Understood. And then just a little bit more broadly, as we see just continued increased focus on whether
it's at the federal level or state level on water infrastructure, water quality, whatnot. And you guys
always provide the breakout of the different investments you make on an annual basis, whether it's
pipes, sourcing, IT, others. Where do you think the most upside opportunity exists as we go through time
and if there's -- just to address some of the increased focus on these items? Is it more technological
advancements that we might be baking in? Just curious on your broader thoughts.

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

It's a real combination. I would say looking at the categories that water quality and resiliency are going
to continue to get a good size of our investment and maybe even increasing over time just because with
all the storms and the weather variability out there, we need to continue to make sure that our systems
are resilient. And we need to continue to address the emerging contaminants like PFOS and others. So it's
going to require significant investment.

Operator

Our next question will come from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.

Jonathan Garrett Reeder
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

A couple for you. I'll start with Missouri. Walter, the revised infrastructure service charge program, is that
going to allow you to extend the time between rate cases or the fact that it kind of encompasses a wider
range of eligible spend as it kind of keep you on that 3-year cadence still?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

We'll continue to evaluate that, Jonathan. We're just really thrilled that we're able to expand the program
outside of St. Louis County. And our team has worked hard to provide the input to the commission to see
how important that is that we invest across our footprint in Missouri. So we're excited about that and also
increasing the cap, so we can make more investment before we have to go into a rate case. So it may
contribute in some way to the timing between rate cases.

Jonathan Garrett Reeder
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then shifting closer to you Pennsylvania, what is the latest on the commissioner appointments
to fill the open sea plus Commissioner suites. I know Governor withdrew his one nominee back in May. Is
there any updates along those lines?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

No, none here. Well, Pennsylvania Commission has always been great to work with and reasonable in their
treatment towards us, and we expect that going forward.

AMERICAN WATER WORKS COMPANY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Are you assuming -- or maybe what do you anticipate in terms of the timing of the close of the
York wastewater deal? Is that assumed by the end of this year in order to get to that $300 million of M&A
capital deployed?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we're assuming at this point the first half of 2022. We submitted our application on July 1. The
commission is looking at it. Once they deem it complete, then they'll start processing. And again, we think
first half of 2022.

Jonathan Garrett Reeder
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. So without it, I guess I just kind of struggle to get to that $300 million based on what's in the
hopper. Is there something I'm missing? Or do you just have enough pending deals that close, excluding
the York one to get you to that $300 million? Or is that something that might fall a little short this year,
but then next year is going to more than offset it with the York deal?

Walter J. Lynch
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me say we're confident in the $1.9 billion number and that's from obviously, the investment in our
systems and the acquisitions that we're making.

Jonathan Garrett Reeder
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe, Susan, going back to Durgesh's question along Homeowner Services. If the
claims, I guess, were year-to-date, if they are more in line with historic levels, how would the market-
based businesses year-to-date EPS compared to last year, would it make up the entire $0.05 lower delta?

M. Susan Hardwick
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think that's a fair way to look at it. Again, we've just seen a much higher claims experience than we
have in the prior periods.

And we really think, again, much of it is related to more at-home activities. The business continues to
grow. We continue to execute on our partnership arrangements. We continue to look for new products and
roll out new products in that business. So I think the business is just -- is fundamentally doing what we
have set out for it to do. This claims experience issue is one that I think, again, is directly related to just
activity. And -- we'll hopefully see that mitigate some as we head into the latter part of this year and into
next as we hopefully, although it's difficult to sort of imagine that on a day-to-day basis these days, we'd
return to some sort of a normal environment where people are sort of out of the homes and back in work
environments. But that really is the primary driver. I'd say the rest of the business is operating as we'd
expect it to.

Jonathan Garrett Reeder
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got you. Yes. Came and getting back to that normalcy.

Okay. So it sounds like -- I mean everything other than that's kind of going well, whether it's, I guess, you
get to reprice the kind of the claims level for some reason, that doesn't.

I guess, the overall trajectory of market-based business to that 7% to 10% is still very much, I guess,
kind of where you would expect it to be absent this kind of temporary hiccup.
