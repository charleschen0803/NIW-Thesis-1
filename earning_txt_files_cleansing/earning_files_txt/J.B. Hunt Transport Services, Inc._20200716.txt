Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the J.B. Hunt Second Quarter 2020
Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] A replay will be made available after today's call on the company's
website at jbhunt.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to hand the call over to Brad Delco, Vice President of Finance and Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

A. Brad Delco
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Hopefully, everyone has had an opportunity to review our
earnings release that was issued earlier this afternoon. If not, you should be able to access the release on
the Investors section of our website at jbhunt.com. Before I introduce the speakers on today's call, I'd like
to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements.

This call may contain forward-looking statements with the meaning -- within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar
expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on
J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations and involve risk and uncertainties that could cause future
activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and
other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Now I'd like to introduce the speakers of today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts;
our Interim CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller and Senior Vice President of Finance, John Kuhlow;
Shelley Simpson, our Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services; Darren Field, our
President of Intermodal; and Nick Hobbs, President of Dedicated and Final Mile Services.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?

John N. Roberts
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Brad. The second quarter has confirmed the comprehensive nature of the virus throughout the
period. As noted, we immediately committed ourselves to the priorities of taking care of our people and
delivering on the promises we have made to our customers. We are encouraged with our results in both
areas through the second quarter. More than 75% of our employee base has been unable to work from
home due to the nature of our business and the ongoing needs of our customers. The safety practices and
PPE supplies we deployed early, and have continued to support and provide, have proven substantially
effective to date. We review both external and internal COVID-related data daily. We will continue to
monitor the situation and maintain focus on these important priorities. Additional facility investments have
been and are being made to all work areas in Lowell and across the country to help lower risk. Equally
rewarding has been the recognition and encouragement from so many of our customers in acknowledging
the performance of our people, particularly our drivers for providing consistent service and availability,
moving freight to where it is needed. We stand ready and able to continue to serve them and their
ultimate customers.

Another important discussion that has developed during the second quarter is about inclusion and
diversity. While this is not a new topic here at J.B. Hunt, the level and quality of dialogue has elevated
in recent weeks. I can report that the entire executive leadership team has actively engaged in
understanding where we are and determining where we want to go in improving these vital elements
through all levels of the company. I will again recognize and thank the amazing employees of J.B. Hunt for
their remarkable efforts to stay together, strong, safe and reliable over the past quarter. There is no quit

in our people. Our field operators, drivers, maintenance technicians, along with our support teams in the
field and in Lowell have remained vigilant and true to our mission. We are extremely proud of the entire
organization.

John Kuhlow will comment on our current financial situation. And as an enhancement to this call, our
segment leaders will address the performance and trends in each of the business units. I will focus my
remarks from the macro view we have today across the top of the business. Clearly, we are off our original
plans in many respects, and comparisons to last year did not help illuminate much about where we find
ourselves. What we do know is that during the quarter, we saw a stable and steady cadence of demand,
particularly in our Dedicated and Intermodal businesses, and even see some of the disruption in our
Highway Services, Brokerage and Truckload, signaling a similar upward slant to the demand curve, albeit
difficult on near-term margins.

Our Final Mile business lines are slowly but surely working their way back online. Finally, our need to hire
more drivers as an indication of what we hope is a bottom in the cycle. This is particularly encouraging
in that we have experienced some of the lowest driver turnover ever in the past 4 months. While still
too early to call, at least we have some potential signs of inflection in the demand curve. We will look for
more direction from import data, inventory levels and retail sales information as well as thoughtful input
from our customers to build confidence in the trends into the second half of the year. Until that confidence
firms, we maintain our current state of cost-control efforts, a conservative capital expenditure approach
and contained payroll and hiring practices.

We have restarted some strategic discussions around growth channel prospects, particularly in areas
where we anticipate potential demand-driven, rate-supported needs to expand fleet sizes, implementing
new Dedicated and Final Mile contracts as sales come back online and positioning for new investments in
technology. All in early-stage preparation for what we hope is the inevitable return to normalcy.

Having said all that, we are cautious. Recent COVID case count expansion and the uncertainty of what
that may present will drive us to hold back from now on any directional changes from the current state of
conservative thinking. And again, we will maintain the priorities of keeping our people safe and striving to
honor the commitments we have made to our customers going forward.

With that, let me turn it over to John Kuhlow for his thoughts. John?

John Kuhlow
Senior VP of Finance, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer & Interim CFO

Thank you, John. As mentioned, the segment leaders will cover business unit results, so I'll add some
comments on the consolidated financial results and update you on our approach to addressing the
pandemic during the current quarter and also going forward. The effects of the pandemic are far-reaching
throughout our financial statements, impacting revenues and expenses both positively and negatively
and throughout the quarter. It's difficult to talk through the specific impacts on each of the line items
that the pandemic has had on our results. However, we have identified approximately $11 million of
specific costs in the second quarter that were not planned prior to the pandemic. These costs consist
mostly of special paid time off for our employees, quarantines or for reduced pay from slowdowns as
well as costs for personal protective equipment, cleaning and security directly related to protecting our
employees. As previously announced, we incurred $15 million in the first quarter for COVID-related items
or approximately $25 million year-to-date.

We maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment, and our long-term strategy around that has not
changed. However, given the uncertainty entering the second quarter, we made an intentional adjustment
for the sake of protecting liquidity. Our opportunistic approach to buybacks has always contemplated
cash needs and with excess cash being used for buybacks. While we are confident in our balance sheet
strength, we believe that the overall uncertainty of the market made it prudent to maintain higher cash
positions until we receive some clarity on the environment.

Accordingly, we entered the quarter -- ended the quarter with approximately $275 million in cash or net
debt of approximately $1 billion. We still target our leverage ratio at 1x EBITDA and expect to stay within

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

close range of that metric throughout the year. We expect our capital allocation process in the second half
of the year to include stock repurchases and previously forecasted capital expenditures, but we maintain a
careful watch on a daily basis. We're currently forecasting our CapEx to be approximately $600 million to
$625 million for 2020, which is down from our original plan of $700 million, mostly due to the timing after
pausing certain projects within the second quarter.

Our investment approach continues with our long-term strategy. We are carefully monitoring the market
and environment, assessing our power equipment and container needs and purchasing as conditions
warrant. As previously explained, our model in DCS is success-driven so to the extent we win new
business or grow organically, our capital investment changes accordingly and we are well prepared to do
so.

From an M&A standpoint, I noted our target leverage ratio of 1x, but we are comfortable taking that
higher if acquisition targets meet our ROIC and margin considerations. With respect to margins during the
quarter, we focused our intention to discretionary spend. In addition to eliminating travel, we suspended
hiring unless there is a critical need. We are pleased with our ability to redeploy our people and assets
from shuttered to surging accounts. And while most of that is reverted back to normal operations, we'll
continue to use that strength as conditions warrant. We focused on our driver productivity using our
people and assets as efficiently as possible, avoiding furloughs and layoffs that set us up to be in the best
position as the economy comes back online.

We continue to carefully review our spend, balancing the need to invest for the long term, but being
mindful of the current environment. As we discussed during our first quarter call, aside from the
uncertainty of the freight market, we were concerned with the overall market liquidity and the impact
it may have on our customers and their ability to pay. While we experienced a slightly higher level of
uncollectible accounts during the second quarter, which we called out in the release, overall, we were
pleased with how our teams worked with our customers to deal with any payment issues. We continue to
watch our working capital metrics on a frequent basis.

With that, I've concluded my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to Darren to expand on Intermodal
operations.

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I thought I would focus my comments on 3 primary areas:
performance in the quarter; an update on Intermodal pricing dynamics; and finally, provide some thoughts
on fluidity of our network as a whole.

First, I'm extremely proud of the team's performance as they were able to react to significant demand
swings from the start until the end of the quarter. Sitting here 3 months ago, we had little visibility into
the outlook for the quarter, let alone the year. And to be honest, not much has changed as we sit here
today. In April, we were experiencing meaningful declines in our business with expectations that conditions
could further deteriorate based on expected port activity levels, availability of truck supply and lower fuel
prices. That said, we saw a general improvement in volume trends as the quarter progressed, with the
biggest surprise occurring in June. This is apparent with our monthly volumes, which were down 6% in
April, down 4% in May, and positive 5% in the month of June. Feedback we received from customers was
that sales trends were stronger than they expected as the economy began to reopen. And while we know
there is a lot of focus on imports, we did not see a normal correlation between import data and our West
Coast volumes.

As it relates to pricing we discussed on our last earnings call, we would take a balanced approach to both
volume and price during the bid season, and I believe we have executed on that strategy for 2020. At this
point, we have completed pricing on approximately 80% of our published business with the remainder to
implement in Q3. October 1 will begin a new pricing cycle. The rates we have -- the rates have come in
about where we would have expected. We finished Q2 at flat revenue per load, excluding fuel, on a year-
over-year basis. Mix and stronger West Coast Transcon volumes are providing a lift to the revenue per
load above what we would have anticipated.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

We have previously stated that we were very confident we would outperform the general industry trends
on volume. We based that thought on our awards from last year's bid process, which we will begin to lap
in this third quarter. Given our pricing strategy this year, we do not anticipate a significant deviation from
general industry trends or at least not to the extent we experienced last year.

The balance of our network continues to face significant challenges that I expect to become even more
difficult in the third quarter. The reality of the mix of our current customer base is significantly stronger
off the West Coast. We do expect we will have some cost pressure while we ship empty equipment to the
West Coast at higher levels than we would have expected going into the year.

Rail service has continued to hold up during the increase in volumes. As June volumes increased, we
aren't experiencing the record level network rail service that occurred in March and April as volumes had
declined. But as we have experienced the significant swing in demand, our rail providers have all worked
strategically with us to solve for capacity challenges. Together with our rail providers, we understand the
critical point in time to prove the value and strength of Intermodal as a solution with consideration for the
massive capacity requirements.

That concludes my remarks. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Shelley to discuss Highway Services.

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some highlights with regards to
our performance in Highway Services, which includes both our brokerage operations in ICS and our truck
operations in JBT, followed by sharing some perspective that gives us increased confidence in the rollout of
the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. Finally, I'll offer some thoughts on how we see the business continuing
to evolve to solve the needs of our customers and create raving fans of the platform.

First, as we stated at our Q1 earnings conference call, and John has alluded, we highlighted 2 key
objectives for this most recent quarter: number one, taking care of and focusing on the health and safety
of our people; and number two, serving and making sure we honor the commitments we have made to
our customers. I am proud of the way our team and the organization responded to all the challenges both
we and our customers faced in the quarter.

With regards to the quarter, market dynamics in Q2 were unique to say the least. While we continue
to see strong double-digit growth in our published business, spot opportunities, for the most part,
were nonexistent and revenue was further pressured by rates or revenue per load versus a year ago.
Additionally, while part of our strategy is to grow our penetration with small and medium-sized shippers,
I believe the segment of the market was disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which
also put pressure on some aspects of our business.

Second, I'm extremely encouraged by the trends we're seeing in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360,
which strengthens our confidence in the rollout of our platform. The trended data support our belief that
customers and carriers are increasingly wanting to connect digitally. This enhances product visibility
and transparency for both parties, and we believe market adoption is continuing to build momentum as
evidenced by our shipments per day in the platform continuing to grow at double digits versus a year
ago in what I would describe as a fairly challenging environment to grow volumes. I believe this is also
supported by the level of engagement and activity that we see in the platform.

When we talk about engagement activity, what are we really talking about? Well, we're talking about
the number of available loads, number of load searches, number of offers, offers per load, number of
carriers approved and activated as well as users in the platform. In fact, all of the KPIs we track in the
marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360, over 75% of those KPIs hit all-time records in the quarter. As we continue
to scale the platform, we have data to support that there's incredible value and efficiencies for both the
shipping and carrier communities as they transact in the platform.

Enhancing value and efficiencies for both shipper and carrier communities very much aligns with our
mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. So we remain encouraged by
the data not only how it creates value for the market, but also in terms of the visibility it provides to our

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

team and ensure that we utilize our own assets as efficiently as possible. As an example, we eliminated
over 2 million empty backhaul miles for both our JBI and DCS segments in the quarter, which exceeds
what we'd eliminated in all of 2019. This is just another example of how we see benefits across our
organization from the platform.

Now focusing in our investment in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. We remain committed to our
investment targeted in 3 key areas: our people, technology and scaling the platform. We believe our
investments should continue at the current pace on both people and technology fronts. We do not -- or
we do expect to continue to gain efficiencies in the platform with automation, but also expect some of
those efficiencies to be reinvested in our sales force to help build greater scale. Market dynamics will also
play a significant factor in terms of our ability to scale. So we will have to see how the market evolves,
but it is worth noting, at this point, scaling the platform is the primary opportunity and risk to achieving
profitability by the second half of 2021. It is also worth noting that we remain committed to building out
our 360box program, which falls in our JBT segment as JBT continues to shift into more of an asset-light
service offering.

In closing, we continue to see both ICS and JBT as well as our DCS and JBI businesses, growing and
evolving to becoming even more complementary within the J.B. Hunt 360 platform.

I'd now like to turn it over to Nick to talk about both Dedicated and Final Mile.

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

Good afternoon. I'll focus my comments on the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile in the
quarter, what opportunities and challenges we see in the current market and wrap up with some high-level
expectations for these businesses in the future. I'll start with Final Mile, or FMS. As we've discussed on our
Q1 earnings call, we expected Final Mile to be significantly impacted by the business disruptions caused
by COVID-19. And clearly, that was the case. While results were better than we expected, it was largely
due to the -- both the economy and, in particular, our customers opening back up for business sooner than
originally planned.

Across the 3 primary areas served by FMS, we saw some of the biggest challenges from our pool
distribution businesses, which, as a reminder, provides inventory replenishment services for off-price
retailers, most of which remain closed for a significant portion of the quarter.

Next, our furniture business was the second hardest hit and saw overall activity down about 30%. And
finally, our appliance business, despite a slower start, finished about in line with normal activity levels.
While the economic outlook and recent rise in COVID cases could create additional noise in Q3, at this
point, our expectations are we should see FMS return to profitability this quarter.

To finish up on FMS, we remain very encouraged by the level of engagement with our customers as well as
the opportunities to grow this business over the long term. We believe our asset and asset-light Final Mile
Solutions provides customers with a range of value-added services in this rapidly growing channel.

Now on to Dedicated, or DCS. First, I'm extremely proud of our performance in Dedicated, which delivered
strong results in light of all the challenges in the market. While the driver of this performance was
primarily a result of strong execution from our team as it relates to asset turns and utilizations, lower
start-up costs, stronger safety performance and lower driver turnover also contributed to margin benefits.
I think the performance that this team delivered highlights a key metric that we focus on internally, and
that is delivering on our CVD, or customer value delivery.

We performed an extensive review of each of our accounts throughout the year, quantified the value we
are able to deliver to the customer over the last 2 quarters with the extreme examples we experienced
from customers closing down facilities to some accounts surging as much as 150% above base levels.
Our customers enjoyed outstanding service and the flexibility offered by professionally outsourced fleet
solution, a solution that we think cannot easily be replicated given our size and density across the country.
I think this performance also speaks to our diverse portfolio of industries that we serve, from agriculture,
food, home improvement, grocery, manufacturing, retail and others.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

We sold 430 trucks worth of new dedicated business year-to-date. We still expect to fall within our
previously stated range of 600 to 800 trucks for the year. And while the pipeline remains strong, we do
have some concerns with regards to new prospects entering the early stages of our top line as a result of
limited opportunities for our sales team to engage with potential customers. We will have to see how this
plays out, but it could slow the pace of sales and start-ups later this year and into early 2021. Net-net,
as it stands now, we expect the fleet count to remain relatively stable from Q2 levels as some of our fleet
additions will be offset some attrition we are seeing at some of our existing accounts.
That concludes my remarks. So I think we're ready to turn it back over to the operator and open the line
for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

A. Brad Delco
Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

[Operator Instructions]

Operator

And our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

So Darren, just a couple for you. Maybe any color you can give us on volume trends in April. Your
commentary around the West Coast imbalances as a cost issue, do you think that there is some offset
where it helps rev per load? And then any change in thinking on the 11% to 13% margin longer term?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Okay. Well, that was a predictable question. I'll get that out of the way right away. No, we haven't
changed our long-term outlook on our margin target. That continues to be our target. From a volume
perspective, yes, I think in the earlier comments in the call, we were highlighting that while prices were
coming in relatively in line with what we had expected going into the year, mix was contributing to benefit
our revenue per load. And our revenue per load was flat for the quarter. So pricing is not necessarily flat.
Prices have been slightly negative. But the mix of our traffic is driving a benefit to that in keeping our
revenue per load at a flat level.

From a volume perspective, April was headed down rapidly. At the time we did this call back in mid-
April, we were seeing bookings and feedback from our customers suggested that we were going to be
really, really in -- headed down. And by the end of the month, it did obviously kind of stabilize with, I
think, we said negative 6% in April. At that point, you started with a lot of info on blanking of ships and
import traffic really, really falling. And so we were concerned a lot about May and June. But as the quarter
continued on, volumes hung in there. And then as we got into June, really volumes were significantly
stronger than we had anticipated

We did highlight that we're beginning to lap the comparisons against last year. Last year at this time,
during the third quarter, we had some nice gains in our volumes from -- through the pricing cycles with
customers. And we're going to begin to compare against that. So volumes being 5% up in June, as we
highlighted earlier, our volume run rate so far in July has been relatively in line with the same weekly
volumes we're doing in June, but the comparison is certainly different. So the comp will get more and
more difficult as we move through the third quarter on growth percent.

Scott H. Group
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. That's helpful. And then just last one for Nick. You've had 2 quarters of 15% margins. How are
you thinking about margins either back half of the year and then longer term relative to the 11% to 13%
target?

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

We're not going to change our long-term margins at this point. We've got some really unique benefits from
very, very low driver turnover, safety results that were phenomenal just because less amount of traffic
out on the road, no T&E. So we just got a lot of things. So we need to let this get biased before we really
reassess that. But we're comfortable with our stated margins as they are right now.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. So maybe to start with Intermodal, going back to some of your commentary,
Darren. Any expectation you'd be willing to share on Intermodal volumes as we look into the third and
fourth quarter? And then in terms of market share now that we're wrapping up bid season, it doesn't
sound like anything changed materially. But just wanted to get your thoughts around that as well.

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Yes. Justin, I don't think I can really give any kind of guidance on volume moving forward. I would say
it's very clearly our expectation to grow with the market. At a minimum, we expect to maintain our
market share and feel confident in our ability to do that. That's probably about as much as I can say about
volumes moving forward at this point.

Justin Trennon Long
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then on Intermodal pricing, you mentioned that new cycle starts October 1. I
wanted to ask how you're thinking about Intermodal pricing in the next year relative to TL pricing. Is your
expectation that the rate of change from a contractual perspective should look similar as we kind of get
into the early stages of this recovery? Or is there a reason to think we see a divergence between the 2?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Historically, I think with -- the length of haul is so much different between Truckload and Intermodal.
There are times that the Truckload price might dip further than Intermodal. But at times when prices are
climbing, the inverse is true. The Truckload price is climbing further as a percentage simply because it's
a smaller revenue per load. I don't know that -- how to forecast next year. I do think that in the current
environment, as we sit here today, July 16, it feels like we have some cost pressure coming at us. And so
I would expect that prices will have some -- we'll be talking to customers about cost pressures. Certainly,
the railroads will have something to say about their cost challenges, and we'll all be talking more about
that and learning more. I know John had highlighted in his comments, we're cautious right now in this
environment. We just don't -- it's hard to see 3 months, 4 months from now, much less next year in that
pricing cycle. But as we sit here today, I do think that we're all feeling some challenges on the cost front
headed our way.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Congrats, everybody, on the solid results. Darren, if I could, I just wanted to follow up on the Intermodal
June outperformance. I mean we've heard -- I mean it's been pretty much out there that shippers are
being a little bit more aggressive per diem box costs. And of course, you guys have an advantage there
with your huge container fleet. Anything there that may explain some of the outperformance in June? Or
any specifics about port inventories being relatively high and there was maybe a pent-up demand release

as the economy started opening up? I'm just trying to figure out what the underlying dynamics are with
respect to the volume improvement and if those are sustainable or maybe explained by specific things that
are happening in what is really kind of a unique and volatile environment.

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Sure. Okay. Well, I don't know that I think our ability to -- the demurrage on box time at customers and
detention billing, whether it's a rail loan piece of equipment or private, and the different philosophies
amongst all the different providers for Intermodal has a lot to do with it. I think over our experience
with our customers, I'd like to believe we have proven ourselves as a high-quality service provider. We
have -- we do have a large fleet of containers, and we certainly have been -- have relationships with a
wide variety of customers. And that lent itself well to us in June. We were positioned with equipment in
the right markets. When we needed the equipment, it was right there for us and available to help our
customers with their demand.

Just the data around imports and port activity compared to our -- even the domestic Intermodal business
as a whole. Just -- we haven't been able to figure out a direct correlation as to how that looked in June.
It just feels like there was a little bit of a disconnect. Demand certainly seemed higher than what the
import data would have suggested. I don't know if that is pent-up demand from equipment at ports or if
it's simply there was more inventory in the West Coast warehouses. I -- you'd have to ask customers to
help determine that. But at the end of the day, I think our customers were -- trusted us and gave us the
opportunity for a strong business in June from all the years of experience we've had working with those
customers.

Amit Singh Mehrotra
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And just for my follow-up question, the Intermodal margins were obviously, I
think, great in the context of volumes and general pricing. But I guess the network was obviously still
unbalanced in the quarter and that's introduced some extra cost and had a detrimental kind of network
effect. Is that getting easier in July or the third quarter in terms of some of those headwinds on the
profitability of the Intermodal business? And then, obviously, box turns have been lower than where you'd
like. Do you expect that to get better kind of sequentially as the volume environment gets better?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Well, certainly, with the overall second quarter being at negative 2%, if we can get our volume back to
something north of 2%, I would expect the turn number in the third quarter to look better. I mean the
turn number is going to be related to volume and April, and May weren't very good in the quarter. So from
a box turn's perspective, I would expect a slight improvement. From a margin perspective, we've had --
Nick highlighted in some of his comments, we had very successful quarter on the safety front that was
effective for us and helped us on the margin front. We had low driver turnover that helps us on the margin
front. We were able to use our drayage assets at a higher percentage, and we dipped into some of the
outsourcing we do in that area. That's beneficial to our margin. We do still need price to really move and
help and improve margin.

But just on a sequential perspective, I think that I highlighted that the network balance in Q3, I think,
is actually going to become a larger challenge for us in Q3 than it was in Q2. For a lot of the first half of
the year, we were positioning our equipment into the market where we expected volume to return. And
so we had equipment already in California. We had equipment in the Midwest, in Chicago, where demand
began to come back faster. Well, as the network is running today, we're going to be moving more empty
equipment. And not all of our customers are back at the same pace, and that's creating a little bit of a
hard prediction of the network impact from balance. But I expect in Q3 to actually be more challenged on
the network balance than we were even in Q2.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

So you think Q3 margins could be down in Q2? Or is that just still going to be dependent on the volume
environment how strong it is?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Well, I just -- we just aren't going to comment on the expectation of the margin in the next quarter.

Your next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

You guys have done a pretty good job, as you said, of keeping your share in Intermodal growing much
faster than the overall industry. Are you surprised at all that Intermodal volumes haven't come back
stronger than they have in the back half of 2Q, especially relative to what trucking volumes have done?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Well, I'm surprised. Ravi, I don't know how to characterize my thought on that. Being in a global
pandemic, I guess, I just don't know what would have surprised us or what we would have expected any
more than what did happen. I mean the networks are all busy today. I'm certain we have competitors that
are experiencing a lift in their volumes as well. I mean the whole entire system is moving more business in
the back half of June than it certainly was in April and May.

Ravi Shanker
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And then maybe a follow-up for Shelley. Shelley, can you give us an update on the
competitive environment in the truck brokerage business, both from some of the larger incumbents as
well as some of the new digital entrants? And have you seen any change in either of them in terms of
behavior?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

I think the market's been difficult, particularly in the brokerage business. It has had wild fluctuations from
a margin perspective and then also was right in the middle of the kind of last part of the bid process.
So I think it's been difficult to estimate what margins would look like in a month, much less putting in
a full year price for customers. So we have seen really the front half of the quarter to the back half of
the quarter, prices did change from a bid process and what customers awarded volumes at. I would say
it was more competitive in the first half of the quarter versus the second half of the quarter. And we're
seeing customers across our segments come back with more -- many bids and bids that weren't getting
implemented or carriers weren't taking the volumes that were awarded. Those are coming back out in
many bids from a tighter capacity environment really across the board in general. I would say we've
seen some larger brokers, I think, defend their position, much like we would as well. So I don't think that
anybody was ill-behaved in the market. But I do think it's been a more competitive price environment
from large incumbents. And then from a digital freight perspective, I think that there's not a lot of change
there. There's always been an aggressive mentality from a price perspective with customers, but I don't
think anything is different.

Your next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

Yes. Just a question. Can you refresh my memory on what your DCS dedicated margin target is?
Obviously, it's been pretty solid. And I know you mentioned some of the reasons behind it. But if you could
touch on that a little bit, that would be great.

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

Yes, it's 11 to 13 is where we're at. And that's kind of the guidelines that we try to bounce around in
between, and it affected a lot. If we have a lot of start-ups, sometimes it gets a little thinner. But a lot of
factors go into that, but that's our target.

Jordan Robert Alliger
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

But is there any reason to think in the near term that the pace you're at now from a margin standpoint
would be different in the coming quarter or 2?

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

It's -- if it's what's going to happen in the next 2 or 3 months with the pandemic, then I can probably help
you on that. But I really don't know. I don't know what the volume is going to do with our customers.
We're very agile, but if it was normal times, maybe I could give you a better prediction. But I'm just
nervous about what it's going to do with all the COVID cases coming back up and all those things, I don't
know if they're going to shut business down. It's just affecting different industries different ways. So I
really wouldn't feel comfortable addressing the next couple of quarters.

Jordan Robert Alliger
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just on truck brokerage, it was very helpful, a rundown on the pricing front. I'm just
curious, as you -- there's so many moving pieces in truck brokerage these days and second quarter
was probably a tale of two halves, as you alluded to. But do you feel like, taking into account price and
competitiveness, that the framework, excluding all the costs you have from 360, the framework for truck
brokerage is looking brighter at this point from a profit perspective?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

I would say that as we have ended the second quarter and began the third quarter that the margins are
unsustainable inside brokerage, I would say across the industry right now. So you're really seeing the
supply and demand tightness occurring. I think it's one of the most constrained environments I have
seen. Obviously, we are in a pandemic, but I think that in this market, the number of turn downs that
are occurring from customers, the challenges that are happening from a capacity perspective and then
the lack of margin, if you will, I think things if they were to continue as is, I think things will change in
near term versus long term. I do think that brokerage as an overall is a great answer for our customers.
It has gained market share over the last several years as a total, as a percentage of total shipments that
are happening. And it's because the flexibility and being able to be agile in price and capacity for our
customers when surges in demand are happening. So I think the outlook is good. We just have to get
through the near-term headwinds that are occurring in the business.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And great job on the quarter. John or Darren, maybe you could talk a little bit about the opportunity of
grow capacity. You mentioned that earlier, but then you also mentioned kind of -- John mentioned being

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

cautious on the use of cash. So obviously, conflicting thoughts there. Maybe you can just delve into that in
a bit?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

So at this point, to grow capacity for Intermodal would require -- you're going to place a container order
with the manufacturer, there aren't a lot of manufacturing opportunities located here in North America.
So it is as much about the opportunity to produce and provide the transportation for the containers into
the country in a timely enough manner to assist in certainly this year. We are trying to be more balanced
in -- or we are trying to be balanced in both volume and price as we've been talking about for really
several quarters now. And our margins need some improvement. And so we're cautious on how quickly we
want to go add capacity. At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on truckload capacity, is there an
opportunity to get back to a stronger growth trajectory for Intermodal in the eastern network that would
certainly drive some consideration in expanding our fleet and investing in more capacity? It will always,
always, always be our goal to grow Intermodal, but we understand the return profile our shareholders
expect, we expect and hold ourselves to is going to drive that decision first.

Kenneth Scott Hoexter
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And then for a quick follow-up, Shelley. Just you talked about the losses kind of going 12 to 18 months at
ICS when you started the plan. Just want to understand how do you think about that is now? And maybe
in the answer, you can talk about your thoughts on spot and contract pricing as you see in the market
now.

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Yes. So I talked about that in my opening remarks that really scaling the business is an important
component in our return to profitability as we have created a level of investment right now that is --
should be able to scale really from here. And depending on how quickly we can add revenue will depend
on how quickly return to profitability in total. I am somewhat cautious as to what the second half will look
like. But as Nick said earlier, we really don't have great forecast from our customers as to what revenue
is going to do or shipments are going to do. So I think it's too early to tell what would happen from that
perspective. When I look at what's happened in both spot and published, I think that you saw inside the
quarter spot revenue per shipment moved down substantially and then back up with a rebound in June.
And so things were very different by month in the quarter in total and published pricing really is at a low
watermark that I think has room to move as carriers are pushing prices on a day-to-day basis. From a
brokerage perspective, I think price will change at the customer view as well. There -- before COVID,
there was a change occurring, and I talked about this in our Q1 earnings release call that January and
December were both unusually and unseasonally tight in those weeks that I talked about. We've seen
some of that emerge back here in June and continuing into July. So I think published pricing will move.
I think it is moving as we speak. And I know, certainly, we're talking through with customers what that
means when it comes to other business that they're talking to us about, and I'm certainly talking to others
about as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Maybe just picking up on that last point, Shelley. Can you talk a little bit -- you mentioned sort of the 2
halves in the quarter on the ICS gross margin side. Can you give us a little bit of sense of the magnitude
of the potential change downward as you kind of exited 2Q? And maybe a little bit of a sense of what
maybe things look like here in July. Just trying to get a -- kind of scale the magnitude of the potential
changes as the quarter progressed.

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Yes. I would say, at the start of the quarter, we experienced what I would characterize as the high end
of our margins, and at the end of June, we experienced at the low end of our margins. So the swing
was significant throughout the quarter in total. I think moving into July, there's been an even further
tightening, and there's evidence of that in reports around turndowns and what we've seen from an MDI
perspective as well in the industry. So we're certainly feeling that impact from a price perspective at a spot
capacity with carriers. So I would say it's probably tightest right now here in July.

Christian F. Wetherbee
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just back to the 360 scaling comment and how that
relates to the back half of next year and the potential for turning profits at that point. I guess I just didn't
quite understand. I think you said it was an opportunity, but also a potential execution point as you think
about that scaling up. So could you maybe help us a little better understand with what you know now
is sort of the back half of next year, still sort of the most likely case for profit coming back from an ICS
perspective? I just want to make sure I wouldn't have been sort of missing something in that explanation.

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Yes. I think right now, the back half of next year, we still have scheduled to return to profitability, but it
will be -- I talked about this in my opening remarks. We have redeployed resources that we've already
seen efficiency in scaling the business operationally into our customer side of the business. And so we
have made investments in scaling the platform and technology and in people. And so holding those costs
flat as we build revenue, each one of those as a percentage of revenue start to contribute more towards
the bottom line. There is a revenue number that really takes us into a possible state as an organization,
and that will largely depend on how quickly we can get there and if COVID has an impact more than
what it has had really in April and May. I would say if the environment stays like it is right now, I still feel
comfortable with the second half of 2021. But things have changed throughout the quarter, so it's very
difficult for us to predict what's going to happen.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.

Thomas Richard Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. Shelley, I know you've been asked a couple in a row. I guess I'm going to keep that string going. How
do you think about -- it would seem that the freight market tightened and improved quite a bit in June
and through the quarter. And it sounds like you're pretty happy with how the technology is working and
the -- I guess you mentioned a lot of the KPI is working well. But yet, we saw the volumes down 11%.
It's just -- I guess it's surprising not to see volumes do better in that environment. And especially, if you
compare it with Intermodal, seeing some improvement just down, I guess, of 1.5, so what do you think
is happening that you're not getting more traction on the volume side in ICS? And what do you think it is
that would really change that because it sounds like that's really a key factor in terms of seeing a lot of
volume growth and share gain in brokerage.

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

So in my opening remarks, I did talk about that the platform experienced double-digit volume increases.
And so if you think about how we're connecting with both shippers and carriers digitally, that means
that connecting points happening through our technology. So that actually scaled in the platform. If --
I also mentioned what happened with spot volumes throughout the quarter. We have been growing and
continued to grow in Q2 our committed contractual business with customers. So we call that our published

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

business. That business continued to experience good market share growth in those segments that was
offset by what happened in the spot market in total. So both from a revenue per load and total shipments,
we just could not overcome the lack of spot in both April and May. We did see that rebound in June and
have continued to see that move forward in July.

Thomas Richard Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. My other question is just a kind of overall freight view. Some of the comments certainly point to
tightness in the market in June and July. I think you saw some nice growth in June in volume. But your
overall commentary seems kind of cautious on the outlook despite pretty significant tightness in freight
right now. What is it that really is driving the caution? Or do you think that there's this framework that
freight could keep improving as we look into third quarter?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Well, I think the cautiousness comes as a result of just our experience of what's happened here in Q2. If
you'll recall our discussion points from the first quarter, we had a lot of caution as to what would happen in
Q2, and I think that served us well because each month was different than expectation. And I'm not even
sure that we had good expectations from both our customers and also internally. So as we saw Q2 really
go through a wild roller coaster ride, we aren't sure what's going to happen in Q3. I do think that volumes
could continue to move up. But I think what Nick said earlier around what's happening with the pandemic,
with cases rising, we just aren't sure what's going to happen to the end consumer. And so it's just too
difficult for us to say exactly what is going to happen. We really can speak about what's happening right
now and the forecast for the next few weeks and past that, our customers are struggling knowing what's
going to happen and certainly we are as well.

Thomas Richard Wadewitz
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. So it's really good right now, but just concern on COVID?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Correct.

Your next question comes from the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Todd Clark Fowler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Great. Shelley, I'll give you a break and I'll ask Nick a question. On the expectations for Final Mile to shift
to being profitable in the third quarter, is Final Mile at a point now where you can consistently operate
in that 2% to 4% margin range? And Nick, I think you gave some comments on your expectation for
Dedicated growth on kind of fleet size into the back half. What's your thought on Final Mile with the shift
that we're seeing right now in consumption habits? Is that still a 10% top line growth business? Or does
that change or accelerate either based on end markets and consumer trends?

Nicholas Hobbs
Executive VP & President of Dedicated Contract Services

Yes. I think that's a good -- that's a pretty strong force right now. The demand is very high. It's a small
niche industry, but the exercise equipment in home is really strong right now. So we're seeing that grow.
Appliances, as I said in my statement, is very solid enough. Furniture is really coming back strong, not
back where it was, but it's coming back strong. So we really see that Final Mile is going to have some good
growth and excited about that. The margin guidance, I think we're comfortable with what you said there

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

that we'll see that. So the demand is really good. The off-price retailer that's part of our Final Mile is --
normally, it's okay during this time of the year, but it is really, really a strong force at this point. So we
hope that'll stay up there and continue. So that's good.

And then the Dedicated demand, we're still going with our 600 to 800 truck adds is what we think. We still
love that model. We think the growth is going to be stronger next year once we get out of the pandemic
and people can start seeing us because it is a big decision to replace a private fleet. It takes a while to sell
it. I've always said 18 to 22 months, but it takes a lot of [ FaceTime ] to do that as well. And it's hard to
do on Teams meeting or Zoom or whatever you're doing. So we're hitting it -- we've seen a little pause
there. We've sold 430 trucks so far this year. And so hopefully, that will pick up a little bit in the back half,
again, depending upon what the pandemic has done.

Todd Clark Fowler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. That makes sense. And just for one quick follow-up. On the COVID cost you had in
2Q, that $11 million, does it feel like that that's kind of the right run rate for the foreseeable future? Or
are there any things that would shift that to either be higher or lower as we think about modeling into the
back half?

John Kuhlow
Senior VP of Finance, Controller, Chief Accounting Officer & Interim CFO

Yes. Tom, this is John Kuhlow. I think that most of that is some of the special PTO we've had for our
quarantine, and then also it's on PPE. And so I think that the PPE is going to continue. We are seeing the
PTO drop off a little bit. And as Nick and others have mentioned, we really don't know what's -- if there's a
second wave or how it's going to look. But for right now, I think that most of those -- that's a pretty good
run rate.

Operator

Our last question come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.

Brian Patrick Ossenbeck
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Shelley, I just want to come back to you on the truckload market and the overall capacity. You mentioned
supply has been different -- the [ near ] are different, different points during the quarter, even last
quarter. So what do you think is the underlying factors, a few factors here? And how do you see that
progressing throughout the remainder of the year sort of independent of what the demand side does?

Shelley Simpson
Corporate Executive VP, Chief Commercial Officer & President of Highway Services

Well, Brian, I think that's been the question for us really for the quarter. We had that question also in
the first quarter, the tightening that was occurring from a supply perspective early on. We do think that
possibly PPE and unemployment has had an impact from a supply perspective. I also think that prices
really fell in April and May, and there was a lot of frustration from a carrier community because they live
in a spot environment from a PPE perspective. And so I think that some of those carriers chose to stay
home and chose to do other work outside of the trucking industry until business came back or business
was in a healthier state. And so I think that could impact part of it as well. I would tell you, I think we're
seeing signs of a change in the environment from a cost perspective that Darren talked about earlier.
If that were to continue to occur, I think that's putting pressure on margins across the board, and we'll
have to think about what that means over the longer term. Certainly, we'll be ready to handle that. But as
we're working closely with our customers to help our customers right now, one thing that's happening is
business is out of balance. And so we talked a little bit about what's happening on the West Coast, that's
also happening throughout the country as there are different customers shipping right now and different
lanes that are moving right now that's causing a problem in the market as well. And so that problem,

18

J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 16, 2020

we're working closely with customers. We want to make sure that we continue to deliver on the promises
of our customers. That's creating an environment also from a spot perspective that's constraining margins.

Brian Patrick Ossenbeck
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then one last one for Darren. Actually this point on network balance, it's always been
a goal. It's difficult to do in practice for a lot of the reasons we already talked about. And it sounds like
it's actually going to be more challenging in the third quarter. So maybe just help me understand what it
is that you're doing differently. Because I think historically, we've seen it's much easier, obviously, to get
balance in a strong freight market, which we may or may not have going forward here. So maybe just
help me understand what's different with this goal to sort of get there independent on the freight market.
Is there extra capacity you need to manage through, lanes that need to be adjusted? What else is going
into that equation?

Darren P. Field
Executive VP & President of Intermodal

Okay. So really, I mean the balance challenge has come from the opportunities for growth and the
rate of shipping from our customers. I mean there was a significant lift in West Coast demand to come
eastbound, which is predominantly imported cargoes. The cargo that's going westbound is going to be
food products and consumer products to support the large population bases on the West Coast. So the
realities are, it's just -- it's been driven mostly from import goods that may be consumer behavior and the
high sales from some of various retailers. And that's what's driving the balance challenge.

From a -- if we -- when we talk about balance challenges, too, we're a growth organization. We're always
going to try to grow. We want to grow. That's our goal every minute of every day. So you're not going
to grow with balance. So I don't expect us to be balanced, but I do expect the ability to improve on the
network from where we were a year ago. And this year, in this particular kind of very odd time, that's been
more difficult than -- but I view that more as an outcome of the pandemic and kind of the odd state of
consumers and the way our shippers or the patterns that our shippers are moving in.

John N. Roberts
President, CEO & Director

Thank you. Thank you all of you for your participation today. I think we've had some good discussion
here. I'd like to say I'm really proud of our leadership team. This is a very experienced group of people.
They -- we really have seen a lot of different conditions in different markets through different cycles.
And I know that we are talking a lot about the future state of during and after the pandemic, what the
demand changes will be in areas for our core businesses and what demand changes will present, and new
opportunities for us in technology and e-commerce and things that feel like they're going to be a part of
our conversation.

I think the quarter did present some positives. But I think the cautious tone that you hear from us is that
we just still don't have enough longer-term data to say this is how we feel that you can rely on what we're
looking for, but we are talking and watching carefully. So I know that it's a very active discussion. We're
still waiting to see that confidence firm up, and we'll obviously keep you posted. On the questions around
margin dynamics, obviously, we've discussed those questions. And again, we're just not in normal times.
So let us have enough to kind of see what a normal cycle, normal demand would look like, and we'll be
able to have more thought on that for you going forward.
