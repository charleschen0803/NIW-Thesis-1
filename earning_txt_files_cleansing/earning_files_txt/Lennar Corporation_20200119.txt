Presentation

Operator

Welcome to Lennar's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is
being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.

I will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.

Alexandra Lumpkin
Associate General Counsel

Thank you, and good morning. Today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, including
statements regarding Lennar's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies
and prospects. Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this
conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-
looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject
to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar's actual activities
or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements.
These factors include those described in this morning's press release and our SEC filings, including those
under the caption Risk Factors contained in Lennar's annual report on Form 10-K most recently filed with
the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Operator

I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Good morning, everyone, and thank you. This morning, I'm here in Miami and, as you can imagine, with
a scaled-down crew: Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; and David Collins, our Controller. Bruce
Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services, and of course, Alex, who you just heard from, are here with me.
Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer, is in Dallas; and Jon Jaffe, our President, is in Irvine, California,
and they're on the line with us this morning. We are all properly socially spaced.

Inasmuch as this is a complicated time to have an earnings call, we're going to alter our traditional format.
I'm going to give an overview and Diane will give some brief financial highlights, and then we'll attempt
to answer as many of your questions as possible. But as you all consider framing your questions, please
remember that the national landscape continues to evolve and the economy is stretching to find a way
to pause in order to flatten the COVID-19 curve. Businesses across the country like ours are searching
for playbooks and institutional memory to help guide the way forward. Those simply do not exist.
There are no financial models to populate and no views around dark corners to illuminate. There is only
management, hands-on management, working day by day and making adjustments looking for signals
and making decisions in an imperfect environment that will have to be considered and reconsidered as the
landscape evolves. This time is different. Change has been sudden and unexpected and immediate and the
changing has not subsided. It continues.

So as many of you know, our company experienced the grief of losing one of our Seattle associates
to coronavirus on March 2, just after our quarter ended. A successful quarter turned quickly to shock
and despair, as this was only the third or fourth casualty of COVID-19 in the country. Pete Anderson
was known as the big deal in Seattle because like many of our associates, he was an impact player and
positively affected the hearts and minds of his Seattle team, of all of his customers and of many of our
trade partners as well. Pete participated in all of our Seattle division's Focused Acts of Caring that is
Lennar's charitable outreach to community program, while he made our customers tickled, delighted and
happy as a customer care representative. Perhaps I've gone too far, but I simply had to tell the story to
properly respect Pete's legacy as well as the brave Seattle -- Lennar Seattle team that proudly supported

him, his family and the future of our business. This very sad call to action focused our management's
attention on the new day unfolding even as we mourned the loss of an associate.

Our leadership team immediately began to take action to make safety first as the health and hygiene
of our associates, customers and trade partners became our #1 priority while we remained open for
business. We flew to the problem, not away from it. Our senior management team immediately flew to
Seattle to meet with our team there in order to have a firsthand understanding of the issues and concerns
of an affected population. With firsthand experience, we set up a daily call that Rick and Jon now lead.
And I must say parenthetically that there is simply no partnership and leadership that I've ever seen
like the one defined by the respect, engagement and camaraderie shared by Rick and Jon. The strength
and durability of this partnership has never been more evident than in this time of turmoil. Their daily
meeting includes our regional presidents, our corporate leaders, along with leadership from Lennar
Financial Services, Lennar Multifamily, and Dr. Goldschmidt, who I mentioned in our earnings -- in our
press release, is now our Chief Medical Officer.

On this call, our management team addresses issues and concerns around staying open for business. In
a real-time setting, the team reviews and implements the plans, the protocols and procedures to manage
our business while we keep our people safe in this very fluid environment. This daily management meeting
is where we implement everything from quarantine protocols to daily wellness check-ins for 100% of our
associates and from pausing land purchases, adjusting start pace and to creating new closing programs
and procedures. Our management team is rigorously evaluating every aspect of the business on a daily
basis and making the necessary adjustments to ensure that we're on the best and, of course, safest
course possible.

With safety first, we still have an essential business to run. People are still buying homes. People are still
closing on homes, and Lennar is still building homes. Let me give you some detail. Even in the current
environment, we are selling homes. Our customers are attracted to the safety and security of a home of
their own while interest rates are low and inventory is limited, although fears of the general economic
slowdown, stock market signals, and, of course, unemployment concerns may well come to bear.

What we have seen so far, since the end of the first quarter, is that new orders have continued to be
strong. For the first 2 weeks, new orders were up 16%, exceeding plan in each of our operating regions,
and traffic in our Welcome Home Centers has remained relatively strong. Nevertheless, we have started
to see a slowdown in traffic over the past several days while, at the same time, we have seen a higher
conversion rate of traffic to sales as those coming out are now more serious buyers.

As the economy slows, we expect that our traffic will decline and we will see the corresponding slowdown
in sales. We've moved to an appointment-only environment in most of our Welcome Home Centers, and in
all of our communities, we tour only one family at a time to prioritize the safety of our associates and of
our customers.

Just as we are selling homes, we are also delivering or closing homes. Our customers need and want
their new home now more than ever. Whether to live comfortably during an economic pause or to work
comfortably from home, to date, our customers have wanted to proceed to closing. We have not yet seen
an increase in cancellations nor an impact on closing since the end of the quarter. We are working very
closely with local municipalities to make sure that we can attain COs and continue to close homes.

With an increased focus on health and safety of both our associates and our customers, we have increased
the number of digital closings and creating -- and created an express drive-through closing program,
where our customers can close their home from their car. We are also implementing a virtual new home
orientation process so our homebuyers can walk and review their completed home via FaceTime. In a
changing environment, we are accelerating our digital platform to accommodate our customers' desire to
close on their home but to close without risk or contact.

While we're selling and closing homes, we're also continuing to build homes. Our construction sites
continue to be active and fully functional to date. We have not yet seen an impact on our trades or on
our supply chain. We're very focused on the health and safety of our trades and have established clear
protocols with this in mind. We have been in constant communication with our trade partners to help

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

them implement their own safety standards and understand the steps we are taking. We also benefit from
the fact that most of our construction activities are in open-air environments with appropriate spacing.
We've begun using FaceTime and other technology to help facilitate inspections and we've suspended all
nonemergency customer care to protect our associates, our customers and our trade partners.

Although our business has not shut down, we are keenly aware that this landscape can change very
quickly. We are focused on bringing money in the door while limiting money going out the door and
focusing on liquidity. Maintaining and innovating our sales, construction and closing operations in this
environment is critical to cash coming in. To support these functions, we've accelerated various technology
initiatives to accommodate our safety-first mandate and to bring confidence in troubling times.

Likewise, controlling our spend in uncertain times is critical to maximizing our cash position. Land
acquisition, land development and home starts are our 3 biggest areas of focus. On land acquisition, we
are working with land sellers to understand that since the overall economy has paused, we all need to
pause as well. In that regard, we are working collaboratively with our strong relationships with national,
regional and local developers to activate a circuit breaker pausing by extending the closing date of our
land purchases. This benefits us all.

We've also slowed down the amount of cash we are investing in land development and rephasing our
development to produce -- to reduce the number of home sites developed at one time.

Finally, we're also adjusting our start pace and further limiting the amount of spec inventory production in
order to closely match new starts with new sales.

While we are a safety-first selling, closing and building -- while we are with safety-first selling, closing
and building homes and managing cash flow, we are also supporting our community. I am proud to
be a homebuilder and have never been prouder than yesterday, when our Leading Builders of America
association initiated an industry-wide plan to find surgical masks and eye protection used in the industry in
order to support our hospitals and health providers that are in great need of supplies. The entire industry
jumped right in and got to work to show the country that our homebuilders care and that we can do well
by doing good. I'm very proud to be partners with all of my competitors as we seek to contribute in this
time of great need.

So in conclusion, let me say, Lennar's first quarter results were excellent and exceeded guidance and
expectations on all metrics. That is our first quarter result in a nutshell. But beyond the first quarter, as
change and crisis have begun to alter the broader economic foundation, our management team has been
connected top to bottom on daily calls to adjust the way our business operates. Most importantly, those
first quarter results reflect the work of a very talented and hands-on management team that carefully
manages our business on a day-to-day basis. We have faced adversity before, and although this time it is
different, we have adapted and adjusted to meet the moment and to execute.

I hope you have heard that the health and safety of our associates, customers and trade partners is and
will continue to be our absolute #1 priority. People matter. With every day that has passed, we have been
focused on what is the right next step to keep everyone safe while we remain open for business. With
each passing week, we have learned and evolved our work environment to match the way we work with
expectation -- within the expectations of our associates. This week, for example, with a focus on social
distancing, we've developed a program to allow as many of our associates to work from home as possible.
While this is new and we are just beginning, we feel confident that with daily focus we can adjust, learn,
evolve and manage all aspects of our business within the boundaries of this program.

We're very proud of the quick actions that we've taken to carefully manage our business through these
difficult times. We want to thank, in conclusion, all of our associates for their tireless effort, their focus and
their dedication. We also want to thank our trade partners, who have worked collaboratively with us to
ensure not only a safe, healthy home but a quality home. And finally, we want to thank our customers for
understanding that we're working hard to adjust many procedures and protocols to safely deliver the new
home of their dreams.

So with that, let me turn over to Diane.

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

Diane J. Bessette
VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Stuart, and good morning to everyone. So I'd like to spend just a few minutes reviewing
the highlights from our first quarter. So for many decades, we have operated with a balance sheet-first
philosophy and a strong focus on liquidity, and given today's uncertain environment, this is a very good
place to start.

As noted in our release, we ended the quarter with $785 million of cash on the balance sheet and
$2.1 billion of additional availability under our revolving credit facility. We reduced our year's supply of
inventory owned to 4.0 as a result of our continued focus on cash flow generation. At quarter end, our
stockholders' equity increased to $16 billion and our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio was 33.6%,
down from 38.5% in the prior year. As we look at the balance of the year, we have a very manageable
level of debt maturities with only $300 million due in May and only $300 million due in November.

So with those balance sheet highlights, let me now briefly review our operating performance starting with
homebuilding. New orders increased 18% from the prior year and deliveries increased 17% from the same
period. We ended the quarter with 1,258 active communities. Our first quarter gross margin was 20.5%,
up 40 basis points from the prior year, and our SG&A was 9.2%, which is the lowest first quarter SG&A
percent we have ever achieved. These core results are evidence that we are managing our homebuilding
business extremely well.

And our financial services team also executed at high levels. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $41
million from $15 million in the prior year. We continue with our technology focus, which will be valuable
as we manage forward. Title operating earnings were $10 million net of noncontrolling interest compared
to $5 million in the prior year. LMF Commercial, formerly our Rialto Mortgage Finance business, produced
operating earnings of $7 million compared to about breakeven in the prior year.

And just to spend a minute on our tax rate. The tax rate for the quarter was 7.5% as a result of our
tax team's tremendous effort to obtain the benefit from the new energy-efficient home credit extension
passed by Congress in December 2019.

So in summary, our first quarter results demonstrate that we have a high-quality management team that
focuses on strategy and execution, which results in exceeding expectations. And so to come back to where
I started, today, we find ourselves in turbulent waters, and we will do what we always do. We will manage
our cash inflows and cash outflows with great focus to ensure we maintain our strong liquidity position and
preserve the strength of our balance sheet.
And so with those brief comments, let me turn it over to the operator so that we can respond to your
questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates.

Ivy Lynne Zelman
Zelman & Associates LLC

First, I just wanted to say thank you, Stuart, for your calming and steady rational voice in this crisis and to
commend all of the management team for all the steps that you're taking for keeping your employees safe
and all the protocols you've implemented. I know it's really rough sailing out there, but you guys are the
best, and we want to obviously hear everything you have to say.

So let me start with a question about what we've seen in the equity markets. It's a complete collapse of
the values of the companies. And your stock, I think, was trading at half of book, which is worse than --
or close to where it traded, if not at, below where it traded during the crisis. People are expecting massive
impairments because they don't believe the book.

So maybe you can help us first by walking through, let's just make a -- put a stake in the ground and
say this thing is behind us, God willing, by the end of the second quarter and we're going to get back to
normal. If that was the case -- and I will say making it even a more difficult question for you, but you
know me. If you had to shut down completely, you were mandated like Boston, no construction job sites
are allowed to continue -- using that to answer the impairment question. So a 2-part question, and then
I'll let others ask because I know that's a lot.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Yes. So first, I want to say, Ivy, we noted that that was a compound question. So that counts as the
question and a follow-up, and you're still adhering to that rule. But look, that's an important and serious
question.

First, as it relates to impairment, I've emphasized in my opening comments that this time, it is different.
This is not a financially -- or financial sector-driven slowdown. It does not derive from inventory buildup.
It doesn't derive from overproduction of mortgages or excesses. It is a true black swan. It comes from
a very different part of the world. So we're going to have to wait to see how this resolves and moves
forward.

But the impairment question really relates to what kind of duration we have and to what extent we see
real impact to the overall and broad economy or to what extent we see snapback. You have to remember
that when you start to look at impairing assets, there's a built-in kind of shock absorber or buffer between
a reduction in the market and an impairment, and that is our gross margin. As you know, our gross
margin has been robust and remains strong. You're also looking at inventory levels across the industry
that had been defined by short supply and production deficits. And so it's going to be some time before
we're called on to raise the question of impairment. But with that said, it's possible.

But the other counterbalancing thought is to keep in mind that we started a number of years ago a soft
pivot to lighter and shorter duration land positions. And those shorter duration land positions will certainly
not suffer the kind of impairment that we've seen in prior cycles. Our balance sheet is in excellent stead
with shorter land positions, strong margin and a short supply of product in the market for population that
has a great affection for having a home that's defined by safety and security for the family.

So I think it's premature to start thinking in terms of balance sheet impairment and asset impairment.
But I think as we look forward and think that there could be that question, I think it's going to be muted
relative to anything that we've seen in the past. So that's number one.

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

Zelman & Associates LLC

The shock absorber, though, you mentioned, is it -- how far did gross margins have to fall? I think that
would be helpful if you could quantify it. Is it 10% of gross margin before you have an impairment test?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

You'd probably have to see 50% or greater in a reduction in gross margin to start even thinking about
impairment test. So really, as long as we are generally positive and generally cash flow positive, and Diane
gave a rather magnificent impairment primer as we went through the last...

Diane J. Bessette
VP, CFO & Treasurer

[indiscernible] ago.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

As we went through the last downturn. So Diane, perhaps you'd like to talk about this.

Diane J. Bessette
VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I was going to say -- I mean as I think about it, again, high level, I mean if you think about where
our gross margins are, let's say that's about 21%, and the impairment process considers selling and
marketing expenses. So that's around 6%. So you're already starting with a 15% net margin as your
starting point. So that's reasonably healthy, higher than the net margin that we had if you kind of think
around that 2006 time frame, give or take. So there's no crystal ball. It's very early, but I do think that
that higher bar is very helpful to us.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

So the second part of your question was a shutdown for 1-month to 2-month period. And we, in no way,
discount the possibilities as we look around the corner right now. So let me say that we've been very quick
to react. And as I noted in the opening remarks, we absolutely have our fingers on all the levers relative
to cash going out. If we are shut down and cash stops coming in, we will immediately be regulating as well
on the other side of that equation.

I hope I've highlighted well that we are focusing on a people first, people safety approach. And that
means that while we would regulate the outflow of capital relative to land acquisition, land development
and new starts, the very last thing that we would be considering will be laying off or thinking about
reducing our labor force. We are dedicated to supporting our people. We've made this very clear through
the organization. And so we think that that's our most valuable asset right now. But I think that we can
balance the inflows and outflows of capital by managing carefully land, land development and production
and maintain our organization in a constructive and healthy way.

Operator

Our next question is from Stephen Kim, Evercore ISI.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. Stuart, I definitely agree and glad to hear you say the emphasis is on people first. I think that's
absolutely right.

I want to ask you about the bigger picture. As we look -- as we're heading into this downturn, you can't
help but think back to the previous downturns. And in past downturns, we saw that some builders chose
to "toe the line" on price. And they ultimately suffered for that as they were left with too much land in an
Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

even worse market environment later. But you, to your credit, discounted your homes and built out your
communities as quickly as possible in order to work down your landholding. But as you said, this time
seems a bit different and it sounds like now you're looking to moderate production to keep it in line with
demand.

And so my question, kind of a 2-part question is: one, does this mean that if demand slows sharply in the
near term, you think it won't be as price-elastic as in the past? And therefore, that you would be slower to
discount your homes than in the past?

And then secondarily, if so, how exactly would you do that? Would it still be left up to the discretion of the
DPs, the Division Presidents? Or would corporate be more involved? And how long would you be willing to
maintain that kind of a posture?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

So Steve, I really like your question because it highlights the statement that I made a number of times,
and that is it is very, very different this time. And in a traditional economic slowdown, economy-driven
slowdown, accelerating production, there is a price discovery mechanism. The question here is to
what extent are markets going to be paused for a period of time, and will we even be able to keep our
construction sites moving forward. So the landscape is shifting and changing on a daily basis.

The answer to your question is embedded in my statement that it's all about management. It's all about
hands-on management and adjusting to the landscape day by day as it unfolds. So the answer to your
direct question is going to be we'll see. Let's see what the components are that define a slowdown, a
reduction in sales. Let's see if buyers are out there, if they have appetite.

Right now, pricing isn't really the big issue because we all know that our customers don't buy price. They
buy monthly payment. And with interest rates low, the ability to purchase at a price, their pricing is good.
The question is do they have the capacity. Do they feel uncomfortable with unemployment possibilities?
Where is the economy going? How is it rebuilding?

We're going to have to wait and see. Navigating the waters is going to be a day-by-day process, and that's
exactly what we're doing. It's an everyday focus. And I would just ask, Rick, Jon, would you like to chime
in on this?

Jonathan M. Jaffe
President & Director

We're partners. What we're seeing is exactly what you described is price is not the issue right now. PITI is
actually in most of our markets less than monthly rents, but it's very attractive for those that are out there
shopping for a new home. So we're going to have to really react as we see things change on a daily basis.
And what we're already seeing is it's different market by market. So -- and even within that, I think we'll
see fluctuations. So we're going to adjust as we go.

Richard Beckwitt
CEO & Director

And I don't think you can underestimate Stuart's comment about the safety of having your own home.
We're seeing that much of the customers coming in, they want a place where they can stay. And it's
-- that, combined with the low rate environment and limited inventory that's continuing to drive the
opportunity set.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great. Well, that's very encouraging, obviously. And it was also encouraging, Stuart, that you indicated
that you really hadn't seen a slowdown in the traffic -- or not meaningful increase in cancellations, I
should say, and that the slowdown in traffic was actually met with an increase in conversion rate.

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

The one question that I had -- the second question I had for you, which is shorter, is basically, if you're
making any marketing changes or see any opportunity to make marketing changes using your strong
online presence, if you're finding that customers -- or anticipating that customers will be more willing to
go further in the shopping experience online, and if that might actually result in some unintended benefits
such as, just to pick one, maybe a reduction in co-broker commissions, let's say, or maybe some other
benefits from your investments you've been doing online?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

So I hate, at this time, to be talking about unintended benefits. But the answer is, we have a focused
team approach right now on looking at our digital- and technology-oriented initiatives and tying them
together. We basically have 3 focused strands that are customer-facing. One of them is lead production
through digital contracting, the entire process of generating a lead, scoring a lead, attributing leads,
engaging our customers in a digital format through Internet, new home consultants and bringing a digital
representation of our homes.

The entire process of engaging our customers on a digital platform is something that we are accelerating.
We, of course, as you know, and I've spoken about in prior earnings calls, it has been a focal point of the
company. This is a time where we're leaning into that. And of course, the change management that might
have been frictional in the past is less frictional today because it's just an opportunity to accommodate the
market as it exists today. So the answer is a defined yes.

The second strand is in the closing process. We've been focused, we've mentioned before a one-tap
solution all the way from the contract through to the closing, from mortgage application to mortgage
approval, title insurance, appraisal. All of the components we've been working on digital platforms. Bruce
has been tirelessly working soup to nuts on that, and we've regaled the progress that we've been making.
This just even focuses our attention even more on getting to that digital platform. And even in the interim,
the innovation around a digital closing or a drive-by closing, which is an innovation on the fly of engaging
the notarization process and the papers that need to be signed right from the comfort of someone's car,
not having to come into the office is an accommodation to the market that exists today. And Bruce and
our Financial Services group have been working on that.

And then, of course, relative to warranty. We are working on a more robust, 0-defect closing, necessitating
much less warranty engagement, which is not desired today, touch points are not desired, and engaging
our relationship with some of our digital partners to rethink our warranty programs. But these strands
in our digital platform have given us a head start and are enabling us to think differently about how we
manage our business through a very quickly changing environment.

Our next question is from Buck Horne from Raymond James.

Buck Horne
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And first of all, let me start with just condolences to your team and the Lennar family. I had heard about
Pete's loss while out in the field last week. And so I just want to pass that along and we're all thinking of
you and hope you all stay safe and well.

First of all -- yes, and let me just clarify one thing. Are there any communities out there that are under
an operational shutdown due to shelter-in-place ordinances or anything that's close to shutting down
operationally?

Jonathan M. Jaffe
President & Director

This is Jon. There's just 3 or 4 small municipalities at this point that are impacted, a couple of small
ones in the Philadelphia area, Newark and Gilroy out here in California. But for the most part, even

when there's been shelter-in-place ordinances, construction has been viewed as essential and business
continues.

Buck Horne
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And when we're thinking about trimming back on the land acquisition, development spending
to build the cash flow, have you taken any initial swags at kind of how much you trim the budget for this
year? Or is it just kind of still all very much in flux at this point? Or how quickly could the -- I guess the
cash outflow from land purchases or development be trimmed back in a situation like this?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Rick, you're leading that.

Richard Beckwitt
CEO & Director

Well, I'll tell you, we're very focused on cash going out the door. We've started the process immediately
when this whole situation came up. And it's really a weekly focus on each land transaction, wire going out.
It requires my approval, Jon's approval, Stuart's approval.

And so we've taken -- we've looked at the time line of all of our deals, all of our deposits, and we've
engaged in dialogue with the close relationships that we've got going out several, several months. And
at some point, this will come to a pass. We're not walking away from these opportunities. We're really,
as Stuart said, looking to postpone the closing, and we're working hand in hand with the development
community.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Let me add to that, Rick, and say because what we've talked about is this is a legitimate circuit breaker.
Right now, the market has shifted rather abruptly. I think we all recognize that. This is a circuit breaker
that enables the world, the market and ourselves to recalibrate just a little bit to take a breath. And that's
how we're talking to our land partners and that's how we view them. They might be selling, and we might
be adverse at the negotiating table, but right now, it's all about how are we going to migrate forward.

The economy is taking a pause, and so too do the land deals have to take a pause. And we're working with
most of them, it won't be all of them, but most of them to put a pause in place and enable the market to
reset. And that's the way to think about it right now. But it materially alters the outflow of capital as we
prepare for a stabilized balance sheet and foundation to navigate forward.

Diane J. Bessette
VP, CFO & Treasurer

And I think, Buck, the only other thing that I would add is, if it wasn't clear, land development is in the
same category. Those dollars are equally large. And so we have looked at every single community and
every single dollar being spent in that community with the same level of rigor.

And our next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And I also want to extend my condolences to the Lennar team and your associate in Seattle, very sad to
hear that and commend everyone on all of the thoughtful approach that you've described, particularly in
terms of safety and health since that point or perhaps that had started before that point.

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

The first question I had kind of harkens back a little bit to an earlier question around just the current
market backdrop amid a pause and, again, kind of recognizing how different and -- how different the
drivers are of the current economic backdrop and perhaps what's to come over the next quarter or 2
relative to the great financial crisis in that you don't have the same type of drivers to the destruction of
demand from either a mortgage market standpoint, an excess inventory standpoint.

I'm curious if you've had comments as it relates with your other homebuilding peers. You alluded to the
fact before some of the efforts by the industry association around some of the surgical supplies, but from
a market standpoint, to the extent that you just have a pause not because of demand but because of
public safety and other factors. Obviously, you've talked about home prices being pretty reasonable at this
point, particularly coming off of the affordability crunch 18 months ago. I'm curious if you've talked to any
of your other homebuilding peers around, in effect, holding the line for a quarter or 2, not making any
rash decisions, particularly given the fact that I think cash flows are also very different this time around.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

So let me say, Mike, one of the things we don't ever do is have coordinated efforts relative to pricing or
any of the operational side. We compete head to head. We are competitors. But I do want to say in that
light that I'm a proud partner with our competitors in the jump to action across the industry to think about
how we can participate in fortifying supplies, both surgical masks, as you know, used in painting and other
parts of our business as well as eye protection to help our health services.

So while I have to say most emphatically that we're not having the discussions around pricing or holding
the line. I'm not even sure that it would be appropriate to do that. We are definitely coordinated with
our competitors as partners in serving our community and doing -- and serving the greater good as
homebuilders really care.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And I appreciate that. And I guess my question was -- I didn't mean to imply any type of coordination of
price more just I guess for me an informal approach, but I understand your response.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Let me say that our competitive field is a group of very smart, capable professional homebuilders. They're
going to each -- and we're going to each make decisions day by day, running our businesses quite
independently. And we're all seeing the same data points in the market. I think that intelligent decisions
will be made across the industry.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I appreciate that. I guess, secondly, coming off of your comments around cash management, which is
obviously critical here in the next quarter or 2, and hopefully, it isn't as necessary perhaps as we get into
the back half of the year if things hopefully normalize. But you've talked about community by community
monitoring spend on land -- spend on land development, et cetera. I was hopeful to get a sense of maybe
before this started, what -- if you could remind us what your plans were from a land spend and land
development standpoint in terms of the dollars that you are expecting as part of your former guidance?
And to the extent that things go to a hard stop, how much of that is -- could be pulled back?

And separately, also again in this light of cash out the door, if there are elements of the corporate G&A line
and SG&A line that combines right now around 10%, what parts of that -- those line items could also be
pulled back to the extent that business does grind to a halt for a period of time?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

So look, as it relates to land, you'll remember that our base strategy has been, had been, continues to
be migrating to a higher percentage of options, lower percentage of owned land. We have been migrating
to a materially smaller spend relative to land, and our cash flows were starting to demonstrate that. Of
course, we're continuing along those lines. And so before the change in circumstance, we were on path to
a materially lighter land position and expect to continue that trajectory.

As it relates to SG&A, as I said, it's people first right now, so let's not even think about the people side of
the business because we're here to support our people and they are -- they've been out there supporting
us. But on the SG&A side, there are marketing costs and other costs that, of course, we are managing and
monitoring. We've been watching our SG&A migrate downward anyway as an organic part of our business
model. That will be something that we continue to focus on.

I'd basically say to you to focus on the fact that this is a management team that has its fingers and hands
on all levers. And as markets define themselves, we will be defining both the spend, liquidity and SG&A
and managing in concert with market condition.

Our next question is from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.

Carl Edwin Reichardt
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

And my condolences as well, and I hope you're all safe and healthy there in your scattered locations. I
have a question for Bruce if he's in there. I just wanted to get sort of a real broad sketch of how you're
looking at the mortgage market now, Bruce. Obviously, an MBS investor is worried about prepayments.
Rates have been all over the place. Banks are snowed under with refi demand. I just want to see how
the mortgage market, in your view, is functioning right now and how your customers are reacting to the
bounce around in rate.

Bruce E. Gross
Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Financial Services

Sure, Carl. So with respect to the mortgage market, we have not seen disruption thus far. The Fed
stepping in and backing the MBS market this week has offered quite a bit of support. If you think about
where we sell our loans to, about 70% of them are sold to the GSEs. So to the extent any of the investors
in that subset were to become weaker, we could increase the percentage to the GSE. So it's functioning
really well.

On top of that, the GSEs have been great partners through this. They're looking at things such as
verifications of employment, which people have been asking about. And where typically you have to get
a verbal approval, they're looking at accepting e-mails in this environment instead of verbal verifications.
Appraisals, they're looking at desktops and drive-bys. That would be helpful as well.

So they're looking to eliminate friction points. So we're pleased with the fact that it's operating somewhat
normal thus far. People are trying to be anticipatory as far as what could be friction points, and they are
dealing with those one at a time.

With respect to us, Stuart mentioned full digital closings are really helping. So the fact that we focused
on technology early really helps. So we went to our banks, and we got approval for electronic notes to be
sold through the banking system, which allows for a full digital closing for us. That's already approved.
So when we have somebody that's working remotely with a remote online notary from the comfort of
their home, they could go ahead and electronically sign the documents, work with this remote notary, go
through our system digitally, have the e-mail transferred, so there's no human contact.

So I think the fact that Stuart focused us on technology early and the financial service team has been
working hard at this gave us a head start and put us in a good position to take advantage of these
technologies, and the GSE is a great partner. So we feel like this is working more normal than certainly
people are expecting at this point.

Carl Edwin Reichardt
BTIG, LLC, Research Division

That is really helpful. And then, Stuart, just a follow-up on a couple of questions about residential
construction being deemed an essential service in some of the shutdown and shelter-in-place orders. Are
you -- in your conversations with the other builders, with NAHB, with BIAs or with governmental entities,
are you getting a sense that as this rolls out, that the Bay Area model, which exempted residential
construction, is going to be the go-forward model? Do you have any sense of that at this point?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Thanks for the question, Carl. The landscape is still defining itself, and it's too early to tell. We have a
general sense that that is more the case. Jon, maybe you'd like to weigh in on that.

Jonathan M. Jaffe
President & Director

Yes. It's a somewhat of a murky landscape right now. Each city is acting independently. What we found
is, there is actually, as you noted in your question, a coordinated effort through the building industry
associations working with each municipality to get clarity. All I can tell you is what we found to date
is when we have the opportunity to have that audience have the discussion, the cities are clarifying
that construction can continue, reporting offices for title. Transfers can continue. But it's -- there's no
coordinated effort between municipalities at this point. This is all on a one-off basis. So we're just going to
have to monitor it.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Rick, you have any different perspective?

Richard Beckwitt
CEO & Director

No. That's just spot on. I think that what's happening is you're seeing an increasing use of some of the
newer technologies utilized by the municipalities in doing inspections and doing appraisals and keeping
their businesses open. They're very focused on not shutting down housing, but we're going to have to see
how this morphs over the next several weeks.

Jonathan M. Jaffe
President & Director

So let me just add on. In real time, Nevada put out an order that there was confusion about. Just this
morning they clarified that construction is exempt. So construction will continue in Nevada, which affects
Las Vegas and Reno, obviously. But that's just a good example how it's one-off. The building industry goes
and meets with the offices. In this case, it's the governor's office because this was a state-wide order, and
we ended up with for the time being, the resolution that construction will continue in Nevada.

Our next question is from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Sorry to hear about Pete, and I hope the rest of you are healthy and safe. First question, just a
clarification, Diane. Following up on Ivy's question, you were talking about the impairment process, and
you said 21% gross margins, 6% selling costs. So I believe you were implying that really kind of a 15%
decline in gross margin is really necessary for impairments. Is that clear -- or is that correct?

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

VP, CFO & Treasurer

Directionally, that's right. Those are the components. That's where the bar is right now, so that's the
starting point because we're only considering the selling and marketing, not the division G&A. It's always
the cost directly associated with the land. So that's directionally correct.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

But let me just also say because Diane raised this point to me the other day, and that is even as you think
of impairment and getting to that place, the duration of land that we have sitting on our books is so much
less than we ever saw before. The biggest impacts are to your later-dated land. And as you go through the
impairment model, that's where the big impact is. So even if you got to that point, the impact would be
significantly less.

Diane J. Bessette
VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I was going to punctuate that as well. That's right. So even if you got there, the amount of land that
you're applying that to is far less. So your numbers will be lower.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Actually, Stuart, you actually touched on kind of my main question on the land impairments. Clearly,
investors are very worried about this and a potential recession. But could you maybe discuss, you again
already touched on this, but how your business model has changed versus the 2006 crash? I'm thinking
JVs, your land structure because I believe you all were a bit more -- one of the more aggressive to write
off your land in the '06 crash. And then also, Stuart, your company has been around for 65 years. Any
period in history where you've seen material land impairments outside of the great housing recession?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

So let me say that in last downturn, if you dissect the way that we approached the financial downturn of
what we think of as 2000 -- end of '05, '06, '07, '08, '09, those years, we adjusted, first, our home prices
very quickly as we saw the market start to deteriorate and we started selling homes at lower prices and
looking at price discovery. That was our starting point. And of course, the market continued to migrate
downward for an extended period of time, which at a later date, translated into land impairments because
the pricing was coming down so quickly.

In the current environment, we're not thinking about it this way. Today, we have a shortage of supply
of homes on the market, a shortage of supply of dwelling, a production deficit that is still being made
up since that downturn. It still hasn't been made up. There's still a need for dwelling. If you go to the
discourse at local communities across the country before the current issues arrived, the discourse was
about a lack of affordable housing, a shortage of affordable housing. And the concerns that were being
raised at local levels were how do we get more? It's not -- we were not in an oversupplied situation.

In today's environment, we're looking at a very different program. Right now, we're looking at an
economic pause. There's going to be -- there's a beginning. There's going to be an end to this. How we
will recover from there is going to be a question. But with that said, I don't think that we don't feel that
price and financial instigators are going to be at the heart of this. It's going to be more a recalibration.
This is not an environment where we're going to build into it and build up inventory and sell at price
discovery. What we've already highlighted is we're staying very close to the market. We're looking at on-
and-off switches to see what's available, what we can do. And it's going to be very market-by-market,
case-by-case-specific. And that's why I highlight the value of that hands-on management team that's
meeting every day, market by market, to look at what's happening to define our way forward.

It's a very, very different landscape. I don't think we can go backwards in history, either to the last
downturn or any of the prior ones. We've not seen one that looks like this. So there really isn't specific

history to draw from. We're going to have to create this playbook as we go, and I think that we're uniquely
positioned to be able to do that.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Given that this is a pretty unique situation and you all are focused on managing cash flow,
what does that imply near-term for share repurchase? And you all mentioned you have $300 million in
debt coming due in May and another $300 million in November. Do you plan on paying that down? What
are you planning on doing with your dividend? And then also, you mentioned adjusting the spec level.
Does that mean that you all are going to remain extremely rational with pricing and just work off whatever
specs you currently have on hand?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Yes. So thanks for that question. Look, as it relates to stock repurchase, we're clearly pausing stock
repurchase as we look ahead in today's environment because there is enough uncertainty where nothing
is on autopilot. Nothing in our company is on autopilot. Everything that happens in this company is being
considered on a day-by-day basis.

As it relates to our debt pay-down, the $300 million coming due and then the next $300 million, it is our
expectation right now that we will repay those outstanding bonds. And one of the things I would highlight
is that we are in the enviable position with an already recast balance sheet, an already strong liquidity
where we have the ability to meet those opportunities to pay down that debt, which has been our primary
focus for some time and to meet that quite comfortably.

So that is our thinking right now. That's the way that we're approaching the market, not stock buybacks,
yes, pay down the debt and manage the business and liquidity on a day-by-day basis. Everything is being
manually engaged, nothing on autopilot.

Our final question today is from John Lovallo from Bank of America.

John Lovallo
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I guess the first question is accessing credit lines proved pretty challenging when things got tough during
the financial crisis, and in many cases, as you know, bank lines -- or banks pulled these lines from
companies. Have you considered preemptively drawing on your lines just out of an abundance of caution?

Diane J. Bessette
VP, CFO & Treasurer

No. John, that really hasn't been the direction. I think our real focus is just generating cash. That's the
better answer. So as we've been -- you've heard us say throughout this call, it's really managing the cash
flow, and it is not our desire or goal to draw down on our lines has been the talk in today's market.

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

I think that -- look, again, we look day by day and consider the world as it unfolds. We are in the enviable
position of a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. With that said, we don't want to be caught off
guard. But as we look at the national environment and what the government is doing right now, it seems
that the government is very, very focused on getting ahead and focusing on liquidity in order to support
businesses and support individuals as we migrate through the soft spot. So our immediate reaction right
now is not to, and we don't have to, pull down on those lines.

LENNAR CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAR 19, 2020

That's helpful. And then that actually feeds into another question here. With interest rates near 0 and the
Fed seemingly doing a lot and the government willing to pull out all stops here to avoid a recession or
even potentially a depression, Stuart, if you could ask the government for one action that you think could
help the homebuilding industry, what would that be?

Stuart A. Miller
Executive Chairman

Look, that's such a hard question. I think if I could ask the government for one action, it would be to
demonstrate leadership and putting safety, security and health and hygiene, first and foremost, across our
landscape, and this is probably a great place to conclude.

Across our landscape, we were faced with the tragedy, and we ran to the fire and we focused on what's
the landscape, what's really happening and how do we address it. How do we put people and safety first
and foremost? How do we focus on health and hygiene? And how do we operate in a socially connected
environment in a way that is pro social and it keeps us all safe?

I think that leadership in these circumstances is critically important. It's the tone of our voice. It's the
way that we confront and deal with the issues of the day. And I think that our work with our now Chief
Medical Officer, Dr. Pascal Goldschmidt, has helped us navigate the circumstances, operate our business
and I think very much keep our people safe while we operate in an appropriate way. I guess I would
ask of the government that it show the same leadership, the same focus on if you're sick, stay home. If
you're together, stay 6 feet apart and let's don't shake hands, let's not even elbow bump. Let's focus on
promoting safety while we navigate the waters of finding a cure and ultimately a vaccine. And so that's
what I think would help the homebuilding world and perhaps the rest of the economy heal appropriately,
and I would ask for just good, strong, smart, focused leadership.

So with that, let's end it there. And let me say thanks for joining us for our first quarter conference call.
And we look forward to keeping you apprised of the progress inside our company as we figure out how the
landscape is changing and as we run our business and do the best that we can in changing times. Thank
you for joining.
