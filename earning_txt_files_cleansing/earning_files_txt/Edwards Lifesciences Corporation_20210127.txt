Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Fourth Quarter 2020 Results Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Thank you. You may begin.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Diego.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us, everyone. With me on today's call are Mike Mussallem,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer.

Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released fourth quarter 2020 financial results.
During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying
financial schedules, and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates,
assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and
expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation,
reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as of
the date when they were made, and Edwards does not take -- undertake any obligation to update them
after today.

Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated
with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors
that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in the press release,
our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the
company's website at edwards.com.

Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring
to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between
GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Mark.

Before we discuss fourth quarter results and our expectations for 2021 and beyond, I want to spend
a minute reflecting on 2020. Structural heart patients were severely impacted beginning in March,
experiencing significant difficulties entering the system, which also had a profound impact on second
quarter procedures. And even though health care systems adapted to the challenge, the resurgence of
COVID that began late in the year continues to impact structural heart patients who need care.

Despite unprecedented challenges throughout the year, I'm proud of our team's steadfast dedication to
our patient-focused strategy. We continue to invest in developing solutions that extend lives, improve the
quality of life and offer greater value for the health care system.

Along those lines, we celebrated some exciting milestones in 2020 that directly impacted patients. In
TAVR, despite headwinds, more than 100,000 patients benefited from treatment with SAPIEN valves
worldwide. In Surgical Structural Heart, we launched our KONECT aortic valve conduit, and INSPIRIS

became the leading aortic surgical valve worldwide. We've seen early positive clinical evidence across the
TMTT platform. Physician feedback is encouraging, and patient outcomes have been distinguished. And in
Critical Care, we met the increased demand for core pressure monitoring products due to the pandemic,
and we're proud that we are able to help over 1 million COVID patients globally with our monitoring
technology.

To support our innovation and growth, we continued to invest in our people and our infrastructure. During
a year when job losses impacted many families across the globe, Edwards prioritized protecting our
employees, and we grew our team to 15,000 worldwide. We continue to make strategic R&D investments
that enabled us to fuel progress. And despite this unique environment and extraordinary prior year
growth, underlying sales grew 1% in 2020 to $4.4 billion, which is a reflection of the life-threatening
needs of the patients that Edwards serves.

Looking into 2021, while we expect the pandemic to continue to impact the global health care system, we
remain optimistic about the year ahead. As we indicated at our investor conference, we expect full year
sales between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion, representing mid-teens underlying growth on a year-over-
year basis. Based on our year-to-date experience, we expect Q1 sales to be slightly down sequentially,
although in line with the first quarter of last year, which was largely unaffected by COVID.

Our 2021 guidance continues to assume COVID will stress the global health care system at least through
the winter months with procedures ramping later in the year. This expectation assumes that vaccines are
effective and widely administered by midyear 2021 and hospitals continue to improve their ability to treat
non-COVID patients who need care for conditions such as aortic stenosis. And even though we expect the
COVID impact on sales at the start of the year, we are continuing to invest now in our innovations that
have the tremendous opportunity to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the health care
system.

We recognize the uncertain impact and time frame for recovery from this unique global challenge, but we
remain confident that our patient-focused strategy of continued investment positions us well and even
stronger when the world emerges from the pandemic.

Now turning to our quarterly results. Consistent with our guidance at our investor conference last month,
fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion were in line with the year ago period when Edwards grew nearly 20%
on an underlying basis reflecting the strength even during the ongoing pandemic. Full year 2020 global
sales -- global TAVR sales of $2.9 billion increased 4% on an underlying basis over the prior year. 2020
growth reflected increased sales in every region, lifted by greater awareness of the benefits of TAVR
therapy and increased adoption of our leading technologies.

Based on the strength of the SAPIEN platform, we retained our strong leadership position while also
maintaining our disciplined price strategy. In the fourth quarter, global TAVR sales were $776 million, up
slightly from the year ago period. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our
growth. And globally, average selling prices were stable.

Although the rollout was somewhat impacted, SAPIEN 3 Ultra now represents more than 2/3 of our
global TAVR sales, and physician feedback on ease-of-use and improved paravalvular leak performance
remains outstanding. In the U.S., our Q4 TAVR sales were approximately level with the third quarter and
declined in the mid-single-digit range versus last year. We estimate overall Q4 U.S. procedures declined
at a comparable rate. Recall that our U.S. TAVR sales in the year ago period increased nearly 40%, driven
by the strong PARTNER III evidence that led to a third quarter 2019 indication expansion and improved
patient access under an updated TAVR NCD. We expect these factors to resume lifting treatment rates as
the pandemic subsides.

Growth at smaller TAVR centers, which are providing local access to aortic stenosis patients was more than
offset by declines in larger accounts where referrals have been disrupted by the resurgence of COVID.
Outside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, we estimated total TAVR procedures grew in the high single digits
on a year-over-year basis, and Edwards' growth was comparable. Edwards underlying TAVR growth in
Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single-digit range. Growth was driven by continued strong

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was more pronounced in countries that were more severely impacted
by the first wave of COVID in 2020.

Outside of the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see very good TAVR adoption in the fourth quarter.
Sales growth in Japan, Australia and Korea were strong where therapy adoption is still low. In Japan, we
continue to anticipate providing SAPIEN 3 for low-risk patients prior to the end of this year. In China,
which was a minor contributor to Q4 sales, we remain focused on growing our dedicated clinical support
team to assist leading hospitals as they build their TAVR programs.

In addition to geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion. We
talked at our recent investor conference about our EARLY-TAVR Trial, which is focused on the treatment
of asymptomatic patients. Enrollment is now 2/3 complete, and we remain optimistic that the trial will be
fully enrolled in 2021.

Separately, we continue to plan to initiate an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to
determine the optimal time to treat patients who have this progressive disease. We believe that some
patients may benefit from earlier treatment when they have moderate AS rather than risking irreversible
damage as the disease progresses. We're optimistic about the potential of this trial, and we anticipate FDA
approval to begin enrollment this year.

In November 2020, we were pleased that the American Heart Association announced the launch of
an initiative called Target: Aortic Stenosis, a quality improvement program aimed to develop optimal
standards of care. The program features a learning collaborative comprised of experts and volunteers from
pilot hospital locations around the nation. AHA noticed that if left untreated, the condition worsens, and
patients with severe aortic stenosis have a survival rate as low as 50% at 2 years. Aortic stenosis is also
a risk factor for heart failure, a costly disease projected to cost the U.S. health care system $70 billion in
2030.

In summary, we continue to anticipate 2021 underlying TAVR sales growth in the 15% to 20% range as
we shared at our investor conference. We expect continuing COVID-related challenges early in 2021,
turning to a more normalized growth environment in the second half of the year. We remain confident this
large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in
the low double-digit range.

Turning to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies, or TMTT. We've made meaningful progress moving
from early-stage development to clinical use across all of our platforms with over 3,000 patients treated to
date. To transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity, we remain focused
on 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support
approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes.

In Europe, PASCAL leaflet repair continues to deliver excellent results. In Q4, we continued the
introduction of PASCAL ACE for mitral and tricuspid patients, and we're pleased with the early real-world
results and positive physician feedback regarding its differentiated features and narrower profile. We
plan to make both PASCAL ACE and PASCAL available on a single next-generation platform called the
PASCAL Precision System. This new system is designed to elevate the user experience with enhanced
maneuverability, navigation and stability, enabling improved procedural precision.

From a clinical perspective, in this challenging near-term environment, we are experiencing a negative
impact to clinical trial enrollment. However, our team and research partners are highly motivated to build
on the differentiated data presented in 2020 and expand our body of clinical evidence in this exciting field.
We will look forward to presenting meaningful follow-up data across our portfolio at medical meetings later
this year.

We progressed in the enrollment of our 3 CLASP pivotal studies. We also received approval for use of the
Edwards PASCAL Precision System in these pivotal studies. The company still expects U.S. approval of
PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. We continue enrolling SAPIEN M3 pivotal study, ENCIRCLE,
designed to demonstrate strong safety and efficacy for transcatheter mitral replacement, and we're on
track to initiate our first clinical experience with our next-generation EVOQUE mitral replacement system.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

The EVOQUE tricuspid replacement study, TRISCEND, continued to enroll in Q4, and we're on track to
initiate the TRISCEND II randomized pivotal study based on FDA's breakthrough pathway designation. We
look forward to bringing this important treatment option to more patients that are in significant need.

Turning to recent news. We commend CMS for ensuring mitral valve disease patients have improved
access to therapy options through the updated NCD. This update, which includes coverage with evidence
development, achieves the balance of patient access with high-quality outcomes.

Fourth quarter global sales were $13 million, representing sequential improvement versus Q3. Full year
2020 sales were $42 million. We expect continuing COVID-related challenges early in 2021, but we
anticipate a ramp-up through the rest of the year. We maintain our belief that the total TMTT sales will
approximately double in 2021. We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach $3 billion
by 2025, with significant growth beyond. We remain committed to transforming the treatment of these
patients and believe our portfolio strategy positions us well for ultimate leadership.

In Surgical Structural Heart, full year 2020 global sales of $762 million decreased 10% on an underlying
basis over the prior year, in line of our guidance -- with our guidance of 5% to 15% decline. Fourth quarter
sales of $204 million held steady with Q3 and declined 2% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which
was below our previous expectation for positive growth.

Over the course of the quarter, hospitals experienced an influx of COVID patients limiting surgical
procedures. Despite this impact, we are encouraged that the U.S. achieved positive growth in Q4 driven by
adoption of our newest premium technologies. We remain very encouraged by the steady global adoption
of Edwards premium RESILIA tissue valves, including the INSPIRIS aortic surgical valve and the recently
launched KONECT aortic valve conduit. In the fourth quarter, INSPIRIS valve utilization grew in all regions,
and we continue to add new centers.

Sales in the U.S. are ramping for KONECT, the first preassembled ready-to-implant aortic tissue valve
conduit for patients who require replacement of the aortic valve, root and ascending aorta, which is a
critical unmet patient need. We continue to focus on comprehensive physician training and robust data
collection for the HARPOON beating heart mitral valve repair system. We are seeing favorable patient
outcomes, with faster surgery and recovery times with this minimally invasive therapy. The U.S. pivotal
trial is now underway, and the first patient was treated in December.

In summary, we expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for Surgical
Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our newest technologies. After a challenging start, we
expect improving year-over-year comparisons as we progress through the year. We are excited by
our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our global
leadership in premium surgical structural heart technologies. We believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical
Structural Heart opportunity will grow mid-single digits through 2026.

In Critical Care, full year 2020 global sales of $725 million decreased 3% on an underlying basis versus
the prior year, in line with our guidance of flat to down 5%. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $198
million decreased 2% on an underlying basis, driven by the decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as
hospitals limited their capital spending. Sales of our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used
in the ICU were lifted by the increased COVID hospitalizations late in the fourth quarter in both the U.S.
and Europe. Demand for our products used in more intense surgeries remained strong, but were more
than offset by the impact of delayed elective procedures.

In summary, we expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for critical
care. We remain excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to
smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients.

Now I'll ask Scott to provide some more detail on the company's financial results.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Hey. Thanks a lot, Mike.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2020 including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide
an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021.

Despite the wave of COVID that began during the fourth quarter, we are pleased that we were able to
achieve our sales guidance ranges across all product lines. Sales in the fourth quarter were flat year-over-
year on an underlying basis, and adjusted earnings per share grew 2% to $0.50 versus the prior year.
GAAP earnings per share was similar at $0.49. For the full year 2020, sales increased 1% on an underlying
basis to $4.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was flat at $1.86, and we generated over $700 million of
adjusted free cash flow.

During 2020, we achieved cost efficiencies, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly
impact our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy.

I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2021. For the fourth quarter, our
adjusted gross profit margin was 75.3% compared to 75.8% in the same period last year. This reduction
was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding
to COVID partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. We continue to expect our 2021
adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Our rate should be lifted by an improved
product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $339 million or 28.4% of sales
compared to $347 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced spending
resulting from COVID and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by the impact from
foreign exchange. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special
items, to be 28% to 29%, which is similar to pre-COVID levels.

Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 1% to $196 million or 16.4% of sales. This small
increase was primarily the result of higher investments in TMTT and costs associated with discontinuing
our SUTRAFIX program, partially offset by reduced performance-based compensation.

For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18%
range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence
to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT including enrolling 7 clinical trials.

Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1% or 13.9%, excluding the impact of special
items. This rate included a 350 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation.
Our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items, was 12.5%. We continue to expect our full year
rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 5
percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.

Foreign exchange rates increased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 150 basis points or $18 million
compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million positive impact
or about 2% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter
gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year.

Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $287 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of
$400 million less capital spending of $113 million.

Now turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with approximately $2.2 billion in
cash and investments as of the end of the year. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit of up to
$1 billion. We have public bonds outstanding of about $600 million that don't mature until 2028. Average
shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were 632 million, relatively consistent with the prior quarter.
We now expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635 million.

So before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with financial guidance for 2021. We are maintaining
all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion
to $5.3 billion. For TAVR, we expect sales of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. For TMTT, we expect sales of
approximately $80 million. We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $800 million to $900 million and
Critical Care sales of $725 million to $800 million.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

For the full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2 to $2.20. For the first
quarter of 2021, we project total sales to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings
per share of $0.43 to $0.50.

And so with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Scott.

While a year like 2020 could threaten to cause persistent disruptions, our strategy of patient-focused
innovations remains unwavering. As we look to 2021 and beyond, I'm as excited as ever about the work
happening at Edwards and more importantly, what we envision for the future of patient care. I continue to
believe we are poised for success and that our innovation and cultural imperative to put patients first will
drive strong organic sales growth and create long-term value. .

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks a lot, Mike. With that, we're ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Diego?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Mike, I was wondering, since we just met in December, if you can comment on maybe just 2 quick
things. First question would be just how different is the environment out there right now -- the selling
environment out there right now versus what you were seeing at the time of the Analyst Day? Kind of
on the margins, are things getting a little worse, are they getting a little better? Just would love some
thoughts on that topic. And then I have one quick follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I would say in general, it's been a little worse. It was already trending negative, and we anticipated
it was going to be a tough winter, and it certainly has turned out to be that way, but probably trending a
little worse since that time.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then the other thing I'd love to get your quick comments on is just thinking a little bit long term
on the tricuspid opportunity. And the reason I ask is that obviously Abbott has reported some numbers,
too, and their tricuspid business is already annualizing at over $50 million, if you just take the results this
quarter and multiply times 4. So it looks like some pretty robust interest in tricuspid repair right off the
bat.

So would love your thoughts on that market and how quickly you think that could develop and what
hurdles might be.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bob. It's interesting. So the tricuspid market size in terms of number of patients, it's very
large. It's certainly as big as the mitral opportunity. And we've talked about the fact that, that patient
group is greatly underserved. So in terms of people actually getting procedures, you're talking about 1%,
2%, 3%, very low numbers.

So if we could actually develop a great solution for them, it's going to be an important deal. They don't
have great answers, and so the burden is going to be on us to develop great solutions and to create
evidence that we are actually doing that. We have a high level of confidence that we can do it. Of course,
mitral is going to be bigger here in the near term. It's got an earlier start, but we think there's a lot of
potential in this.

The patients themselves are very diverse. And that's why we think when it's all done for tricuspid patients,
it's going to require a portfolio.

Operator

Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

Mike or Scott, just want to follow up here on guidance for a second. So obviously, resurge in trends have
probably trended more negatively than when you sort of gave early guidance in December. So while things
are trending more negatively, you're still sort of holding the outlook for '21.

So I guess what's providing that kind of comfort that even though your near-term things are heading more
difficultly, you still feel very good about the '21 numbers? Is that just what you're seeing here in the first
quarter? Is that new account recovery? Is that just the pace of the recovery you saw last time, but same
confidence, stacks have changed? What's providing that confidence? And a quick follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, David. So we always anticipated it was going to be a slow start to the year. It was going to
take a while for vaccines to have any impact. It's probably turned out to be a little worse than we thought,
but it really hasn't changed our outlook. We really believe that coming out of the winter, we're going to
start gaining ground on this, that you're going to have vaccines widely distributed by the middle of the
year and that we're going to be returning to normalization. So when we put that together, it gives us
considerable confidence.

Yes, is it maybe slightly weaker than it was when we gave the guidance at the investor conference. Yes,
maybe, but we're still very much in the range.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just, Mike, just strategically, this comment of clinical trial enrollment is coming up a lot
from you, other companies now. And I wonder 2 things. The first is, have you rethought -- you have a
significant number of clinical trials sort of ongoing, have you thought at all about change in the clinical trial
strategy, slowing some down, emphasizing others as sort of question one.

And then related is just figuring it benefits the incumbent for all the companies that are trying to get into
this marketplace. They've lost basically 18 months and sort of, competitively, does that start becoming a
bigger advantage to those that are already in the market, specifically in structural heart and TAVR with the
trial burden is very high?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, David. You make a good point. The trial burden is high, and so it is more difficult right now. I
can tell you that our team and our researchers are very committed. They're ready to get back at it. And so
although there were delays, I don't know if it's fair to characterize it as an 18-month delay, David. I think
that's probably overstating it to some extent. I think we talked when we said what happened in 2020, for
example, in some of the TMTT trials, it certainly cost us a couple of quarters, and now we're seeing it a
little slow again. But our team really feels, through conversations with researchers, that it's going to come
back.

When you're trying to develop real new opportunities like TMTT or expand indications in TAVR like early
TAVR in moderate AS, those are heavy lifts that take long-term commitment, and we're getting really nice
participation in cooperation with FDA. So it's going to get done. It just is a bit of a headwind right now.

I wanted to ask a little bit on the near term as well. You mentioned that some of the larger centers were
maybe seeing slower referrals. Is there anything you can comment really on how that pipeline looks and

how quickly can refill if things do start to open up? In a sense, will there be a kind of continued lag effect
on your recovery relative to what happens in the broader market because of that referral network?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Raj. So what we were referring to is just reflecting back on the fourth quarter, we had
this observation that the larger centers saw less growth than the smaller centers. The exactly why that
happened, we can -- we only kind of speculate, Raj.

So we obviously have conversations with them, and we have anecdotal information that suggests, hey,
those larger centers maybe used to pull from much broader geography, and maybe there's less referrals
during this time of COVID than you would expect in a normal environment.

So having said that, when these centers slow down, yes, they also slow down qualifying patients. So it
takes a while for that pipeline to refill. So that is -- that's legitimate. But then again, when we gave our
estimates, we've taken that into account. So when we say, "Hey, we think TAVR is going to grow 15% to
20% in 2021," we've taken into account that, yes, there's this lag at the beginning of the year. So we're
still coming on sites to engage with patients, and they're very motivated to do that. But to give you -- you
know where we're headed.

Rajbir Singh Denhoy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. Yes. And then just one quick follow-up on that. So LOTUS, obviously off the market globally.
Have you seen much impact in the marketplace? Have you been able to capture some of that share? Any
thoughts early on in how that's faring?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Raj. They didn't have a really large share position. And so I'm sure we were the beneficiary
to a small extent. If I reflect all the way back to our investor conference in 2019, we estimated that we
would probably have some small share loss during 2020, and we don't -- it's kind of tough for us to find
that at this point. We're not sure that, that happened. That may have been part of a contributor.

Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

One on PASCAL for me, one on a different one separately. So Mike, you expect to launch PASCAL in the
U.S. in late '22. Does that assume completing enrollment in 2021 of CLASP IID and presenting the data in
early '22? And PASCAL Precision, Mike, what are the benefits of that and the timing? And I had one follow-
up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Larry. So let me be a little bit more precise. So what we said is that we'll get approval by
the end of '22 and the next year, and we'll probably be launching in '23. So I wouldn't want to necessarily
model sales in 2022. Exactly what the run-up looks like before that, we're not -- we haven't really
talked about. We haven't laid it up. Obviously, you're right, there's multiple steps: when do we complete
enrollment, when do we complete the follow-up, when do the report show up. And I don't have clear
estimates for you at this time of when that's going to happen.

As it relates to the PASCAL Precision, we're really proud of that system. It's designed to deliver significant
advancements to our stabilizer and our catheter and our handle. It's -- the Precision 1 is now -- we

probably come back with more accurate timing at a later date.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And Mike, a few years ago, you were developing a product for aortic insufficiency. What's the status?
And what are your thoughts on that market opportunity? Is it just to too small, given all the bigger
opportunities that you're pursuing now?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We really don't have much there, Larry, to say that, that is a pipeline item that's imminent. That goes
back quite a way.

The one product that we have that sort of helps that group of patients is really in the surgical side. This
KONECT product that also replaces the aortic route, that certainly helps those kind of patients. But to
suggest that we have a transcatheter one around the corner would be overstating it.

Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. So with a little slowdown here with COVID, what are you seeing in terms of trial enrollment? Is that
also getting delayed? And is that assumed in the time lines that you gave us today?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Robbie. So yes, we are feeling it in trial enrollment. This is not an easy time when we're
going through what we just saw here at the end of the quarter and the start of this quarter. It is a tough
time.

It's kind of funny. I mean, the hospitals that -- it's not like all hospitals have been impacted, but the ones
that have been impacted are really full up, right? They really struggle to be able to handle new patients,
which includes clinical trials.

So -- but having said that, all the dates that we gave you anticipated what's going on. We would give
you new dates if we didn't think that we could achieve those. So yes, it's at a tough time right now. Yes,
it is. But do we think that there's going to be a recovery? There's a lot of interest amongst the clinical
researchers to get back at it. And really, they're enthusiastic about it as we are, and so we think that we're
going to get after it pretty hard when it opens back up again.

Great. Still a lot of sick patients that need help.

Maybe just a quick follow-up. You're still generating a very healthy amount of cash even in 2021 here.
How should we think about the priorities for that use of cash? And are there any areas to the business that
might see some M&A potential?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Robbie, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. So our focus and our priorities for use of cash haven't really
changed. The first one, of course, is making sure that we've got sufficient cash to invest in internal growth
opportunities, and that includes building out our plant infrastructure. So we've got now multiple production
facilities around the world. We've recently gotten a lot further along and are almost completed with Costa
Rica. We've broken ground on a new facility in Ireland. And as the company continues to grow, we'll
continue to in a disciplined fashion, invest capital to support that growth on the production side.

As it relates to M&A, we're very active on the business development front, and we are continually looking
for external growth opportunities. As you know, most of these are typically small. We usually buy pre-
revenue companies or technologies or we'll make investments in companies or buy options to acquire
companies based upon how they perform in development efforts. And so those activities will continue.
We've got this -- we've got a good problem to have, which is we continue to generate net cash, and that's
why we've got over $2 billion now on the balance sheet.

And so we think carefully about how to do that, and we think carefully about how to manage the share
count. And for the time being and for the foreseeable future, our preferred means of returning capital
to shareholders will be through continued share repurchase. And we've got over $600 million of share
repurchase authorization left.

Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Just 2, one, the $7 billion -- reiteration, the $7 billion TAVR market by 2024. The first is you've had that
target for a couple little while now in front of the China approval. Does that include an internal assumption
for -- within the market for China TAVR?

And then the second layer is just thinking about TAVR-in-TAVR and TAVR-in-SAVR, could those 2
indications represent 10% or more of that $7 billion opportunity in 2024?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Josh. Yes. So we feel pretty confident in that plus $7 billion TAVR market opportunity. It does
include China. It also includes most of those indication expansions like you just mentioned, like TAVR-in-
TAVR and TAVR-in-SAVR. What's not in there really is EARLY TAVR, so these asymptomatic patients. If
we got that, it would be very late in the period, so probably hardly an impact. And we're not expecting
moderate to read out and really impact that number as well. So maybe that is -- is that sufficient to
answer your question?

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

Mike, a couple of quick questions. I just wanted to follow up on Raj's question on TAVR, and then I have
a TMTT question. Forgive me if I heard it wrong, why would referrals in the largest centers in the U.S. be
different than the smaller centers?

And if I could throw in my TMTT question, for PASCAL in Europe, Mike, for the centers that are early
adopters, what is the -- if a patient comes in, what would be the key rationale for them choosing PASCAL
versus, let's say, a G3 MitraClip?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Sure. So going back to the large centers versus small centers. First of all, this was simply an observation
on our part. If we looked at our largest centers versus our smaller centers, the smallest centers grew
faster in the fourth quarter than the largest centers. So now why is that? Well, now we start speculating to
some extent because we really don't have that clear a picture. It's just the fact of how that happened.

Part of what we have heard anecdotally is that the large centers will often prove -- a matter of fact, attract
patients, let's say, from a multistate area, whereas a small center might only attract patients in their local
area. And given COVID being what it is, are these elderly patients willing to travel long distances to a
referral center? We wonder and we hear from others, they speculate that that's the reason. So again, you
can take that for what it's worth, but that's probably the best answer that we have on that one.

The -- in terms of the centers that are adopters, how does it compare? We feel really good about the
outcomes. We've been doing a lot of work in Europe trying to help people have outstanding outcomes.
And so clinicians have experience with PASCAL, and many of those experiences have -- many of those
clinicians also have experience with the MitraClip system. We have both PASCAL and PASCAL ACE, so they
have options in terms of what they might use. And I think it's a patient-specific decision that clinicians are
making at this point of what they think might be best for their patients.

It's still early. Our data by comparison is still relatively light. Although we're proud that we have 3,000
patients that were treated last year, and most of those are with PASCAL. So we're starting to get some
pretty good experience. But it's still -- there is some time before this plays out.

Operator

Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So I did want to have a follow-up on MitraClip. It's just -- and on the mitral repair, I should say, and
PASCAL in Europe. Wondering if you're seeing any difference in the sort of variability or referral of, say,
mitral repair in the small -- relatively smaller footprint that you have there versus TAVR. Just one of your
competitors reported, and those numbers were down a little harder maybe then sort TAVR volumes are
down. I'm just trying to sort through what that could mean, if anything. And any color you have would be
appreciated. I have one follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think I understand your question. Are you saying, "Hey, it looks like the mitral
numbers are down more than the aortic numbers?" And is that the question?

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

Okay. Yes. In fact, that is our observation as well. It appears that, that is indeed the case. Now I'm going
to speculate as to why.

TAVR has been out there for quite a while. We have really compelling evidence. We have very mature
systems, very reproducible results, well-trained infrastructure. By comparison on the mitral side, it's still
relatively young. The indications aren't nearly as clear. So it's a less mature market and not a surprise
probably that, that's taking place. But I think your observations are correct ones.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then just a follow-up, and I apologize if it's been asked, but just the sort of maybe confidence
in the sort of, I call it, acceleration maybe off of a slightly lower, more sluggish Q1 and then getting to
your original range for full year, what gives you that sort of confidence that you'll be able to kind of bounce
back in Q2 and still wind up in roughly the same place?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. There was a version of that, that, that was Matt, and that's fine. We really do have confidence that it's
going to come back. We think it's going to be ramped during the course of the year.

Q1, just based on what we're seeing so far, is going to be a tough quarter, and so we acknowledge
that. But we always thought it would be tough. It might be a little tougher than we thought, but we
really believe that there's a lot of pent-up demand of patients and that they're very much going to seek
treatment. And once the fear of COVID and once hospitals get themselves squared away, we think they
really will -- they'll be in much better shape by the time we get into the second half of the year that we're
going to realize those kind of growth rates.

Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Mike, if I could just follow up on the referral question. And I'm not sure what level of visibility you guys do
have into the referral channel. But just curious what you saw in the sort of June, July, August time frame
as far as refilling the funnel and how quickly that happens and whether that could serve as a proxy to
what we could see whenever we get past this most recent COVID resurgence.

And I don't know if the right way to think about it is diagnostic facilities were operating at x percent of
normal levels or what, but any color you could give there would be great.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes, your observation is a good one. I think we all remember the trauma that happened when the sort of
the bottom fell out in the middle of March last year, and -- but we also remember that things recovered
pretty quickly, right? There was a pretty sharp V that we felt.

And so this question about how fast does the pipeline fill up and how fast the patients come back, if that's
any indication, it didn't take -- though it wasn't quarters. It was a matter of months, when things really
started to bounce and pack. So yes, you're right. You could use that as some kind of a proxy to try and
estimate what might happen now.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

A couple of quick, I guess, guidance questions. Gross margins, I think I heard you, Scott, mention 150
basis points of headwind in Q4. Given your comments on FX, any changes on how FX impact gross
margins for fiscal '21 or Q1 perhaps?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure. So in '21, we think FX probably hits us another 50 basis points negative on the gross margin line,
and so we're coming off of -- in the fourth quarter, we finished at 75.3%, but we're also expecting better
mix as TAVR continues to grow.

We've also got some operational efficiencies that they're going to continue to benefit on the gross margin
line. And so we think we'll be able to largely offset that additional 50 basis points of FX pressure on gross
margin and end up in that 76% to 77% range that we guided to.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful. And then perhaps, Mike, you can chime in on this, but I'm curious, the share count
assumption here for Q1 presumes no buybacks. I'm just curious, given the cash position, what would
cause, I guess, for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive on the buybacks?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll start, and I'll encourage Scott to jump in because he's very much the leader of this and a good
partner.

We have a long history of opportunistically buying shares when we think that there's a disconnect, but
what we do routinely is to try and offset the dilution that's associated with our equity programs. So
we're going to expect to do that. And I think that would be something that's typical. In terms of doing
something opportunistic, we basically just look for disconnects.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. So we don't match exactly period-by-period the offsetting of dilution from equity awards, but we do,
over time, try to not only offset that dilution but also buy down the total net shares outstanding. You've
seen us do that consistently over time.

So last year, we bought back about $625 million for the stock, which was in excess of the dilution from
employee option exercises and delivery of restricted stock and the like. And so you should expect that
we're going to continue to be opportunistic, as Mike said, and be active repurchasers over time.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I want to say those average shares are around $68 a share. We consider that an opportunity.

Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I had 2 related questions. So we talked a lot about your clinical pipeline and new product flow. I was
just hoping you could give us a couple key guideposts. What are you looking for this year in terms of data
at PCR or other places, approvals that we should be watching out for?

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 27, 2021

And then as we're talking about the clinical trial delays in terms of enrollment, has it gotten to a point
where you feel like you need to adjust any of your time lines? Or is it just a little bit slower and you're not
there yet?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I'll start with the second question. We really are not changing our time lines. If we were changing
our time lines, we would certainly tell you. And we believe that we're going to hit those, and those are our
best estimates. We try and do that as accurately as we can.

In terms of what you're going to expect to see this year out of meetings like Euro PCR, I think what you're
going to see for the most part is follow-up on the many trials, everything from EFS to CE Mark trials and
more. So there'll be more patients. There'll be longer time frames where data will be shared. And so you'll
see that we've got quite an extensive portfolio in TMTT. So I think you're going to see a number of reports
over the course of the year.

Operator

And our last question comes from -- I'm sorry, our next question comes from Pito Chickering with
Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Two quick ones here. For the U.S. market, like your largest competitor has been pretty aggressive trying
to take back market share in the back half of 2020. I'm just curious if you can give us any color on where
the market share ended up during sort of the fourth quarter, and how we should think about market share
changing one way or the other in 2021?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So yes, I think what we try to do is to -- I provided a statement in our prepared remarks that said
that we felt like the market grew pretty much at the same pace that we did. So we didn't really see
appreciable share change in the quarter.

So again, having said that, it's pretty hard to determine what exact share positions are, and it's even more
difficult during a pandemic. So we're not suggesting that it's exact, but in our estimates, it was pretty flat.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Then a quick follow-up for guidance. The U.S. markets and Europe is obviously weaker than you
expected in December. We talked about strength in Japan, Australia and South Korea. Can you walk us
through if those markets have accelerated versus the year -- your guidance at the Analyst Day and getting
more color on the market?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

So we're not suggesting that those 3 countries, for example, were better since the Analyst Day. What
we're saying is those are examples of countries where the penetration is low and the growth rate is high.
So those were really healthy growth rates, significantly above the rest of the portfolio that's pulling it up.

Now some of those are pretty small base by comparison. Like Korea and Australia would be pretty small
compared to what's going on in Europe, et cetera. But nonetheless, as those treatment rates increase in
those countries, it certainly helps the growth rate.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I'll make it quick. Doubling TMTT revenues in 2021 is impressive. Do you think you've hit sort of a tipping
point? Can we think of this as an accelerant over the next couple of years? Or how do you think, broadly
speaking -- and I recognize COVID makes it more difficult -- the TMT market in Europe?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think maybe it's just fair to say, Joanne, is this is a really big market opportunity. Remember,
when we talk about it, we talk about it in billions. And when you look at where our sales are right now,
they're really low. So our opportunity to grow at a pretty significant pace, I don't think it should be that
surprising.

The doubling is nice, and we're pleased to do that, but we've got a long way to go. We really think it's
important. It's a big opportunity for us. The big drivers are going to be our evidence. When we really put
strong clinical evidence up there that's compelling in significant clinical trials, those are the kind of things
that are really going to drive even more significant inflection points, if you will.

Of course, we've got a great team and a nice reputation and nice really differentiated products, but the
data is going to be the bigger issue. And again, it's got much more potential than this in the long run.
