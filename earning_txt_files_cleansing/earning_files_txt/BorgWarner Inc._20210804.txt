Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2021 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you
may begin your conference.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Jerome. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings
release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our home page and on our
Investor Relations home page.

With regard to our Investor Relations calendar, we will be attending multiple conferences between now and
our next earnings release. Please see the Events section of our Investor Relations home page for a full list.

Before we begin, I just need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements,
which involve risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly
from the matters discussed today.

During today's presentation, we will highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer
picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes with prior periods. When
you hear us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other
noncomparable items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When
you hear us say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A.

We will also refer to our growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the
change in light vehicle and commercial vehicle production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our
outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change versus the market.

Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you
to follow along with these slides during our discussion. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Pat, and good day, everyone. First, on Slide 5, I'm very proud of our strong performance in the
quarter despite the ongoing component supply headwinds. With just under $3.8 billion in sales, our second
quarter revenue increased over 72% organically, with strong incremental margins and free cash flow. As
Kevin will discuss, we are increasing our full year guidance as we believe higher outgrowth and synergies
are offsetting commodity and other headwinds. That's for the short-term execution.

Now going forward, I'm very proud of our sustainability strategy highlighted in our report that our team
just published. The acquisition of AKASOL was completed in early June, and I'm very positive about what
I see: great technology, great entrepreneurial spirit and mindset. Welcome, AKASOL, to BorgWarner. And
we secured multiple new product awards for electrified vehicles, which I'll speak about in a few moments.

Starting with our overarching sustainability topic and our vision to a cleaner and more energy-efficient
world, I would like to highlight some key takeaways from our global sustainability report called Evolving
for All on Slide 6. Evolving for All compiles into one document what is possible when nearly 50,000 people
resolve to do the right things. It is a testament to our commitment to create an enterprise that is shaping
the future of sustainable mobility. We are accelerating our clean mobility technologies, we're reducing our
carbon footprint and are well on our way to achieving our stated goal of carbon neutrality by 2035.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

The report also includes Scope 3 emissions data to illustrate how our products are improving the world in
which we all live. We're fostering a diverse and safe workplace and giving back to our communities, and
our pay equity analysis shows parity results. I'm extremely proud of our sustainability focus.

Moving on to another pillar of CHARGING FORWARD, we have completed the takeover offer of AKASOL
early June, as detailed on Slide 7. Since then, we have increased our ownership stake to approximately
93% through additional share purchases. We have informed AKASOL of our intention to progress towards
a squeeze-out process to achieve 100% ownership. To put in perspective, we expect AKASOL to represent
20% to 25% of the M&A portion of our CHARGING FORWARD project announced just 4 months ago.

AKASOL also continues to secure additional new business awards. Last month, they announced an
agreement to supply their battery systems to a major bus and commercial vehicle manufacturer from
Belgium. AKASOL will supply the second and third generation of their high-energy battery systems for the
customer's new all-electric city bus starting in 2021.

Now let's go to China and look at other recently announced new product awards for electrified vehicles
on Slide 8. First, we announced new contracts to supply dual inverters for Great Wall Motor and another
major Chinese OEM. The dual inverters will be features on both hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in electric
vehicles for these customers.

By combining different power electronic technologies into one compact package, our dual inverter provides
unrivaled functionality. A single unit can control and drive 2 electric motors while delivering cost and
weight reductions. These advanced inverter awards showcase not only the product leadership we have in
these domains, but also the trust and confidence we have built in our electrified applications with multiple
OEMs globally.

In addition to their midterm revenue opportunities, advanced hybrid programs such as these allow us to
drive additional scale and product capabilities that help improve our overall competitiveness in the world of
battery electric vehicles.

Also, downstream the battery, I would like to highlight another iDM award. This new 3-in-1 has a bigger
size and output functionalities than the one already announced a few months ago with Hyundai. This one
is also all BorgWarner-made, mechanical, motors, vertically integrated electronics and software. We're
partnering with a leading luxury new energy vehicle maker in China, with SOP in 2023.

Designed, developed and manufactured by BorgWarner, this iDM features our electric motor, our gearbox
and our integrated power electronics. It operates at 400 volts and has a peak power of 250 kilowatts.

Now adjacent to the battery packs, I would like to shed some light today on our high-voltage coolant
heaters on Slide 9. This product line is a great example of a best product developed organically by
BorgWarner and now commercialized and manufactured at scale. It helps improve the battery-operated
range of our customer battery electric vehicles by controlling the battery temperature at an optimal level
while also increasing passenger comfort through the delivery of an ideal interior climate.

We recently expanded our existing business with the launch of a new program with Geely. And as you
can see by the chart on the slide, the business is expected to grow rapidly from 600,000 units in 2021 to
4 million units by 2025. That's a 60% CAGR, 6-0. With multiple customer awards, we expect the high-
voltage coolant heaters to already account for $400 million in revenue by 2025. Or to put it another way,
we expect this product to account for close to 10% of our planned EV revenue by 2025 under CHARGING
FORWARD. This product line does not get as much attention as the more high-profile product lines like
iDM, inverters or motors but still contributes meaningfully to our EV content.

So let me summarize our second quarter results and our outlook. The second quarter results were strong,
particularly considering the supply challenges currently impacting the industry. We delivered strong top
line growth, and we believe we're tracking well towards our full year margin and free cash flow objectives.
We're increasing our full year revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance.

As we look beyond these near-term results, I'm extremely excited about our long-term positioning. We
are continuing to secure new business for electric vehicles to support our long-term revenue targets, and

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

I'm pleased to see awards both on the component and on the system level. BorgWarner continues to
develop clean and energy-efficient solutions like our iDM family of products. And lastly, we're focusing on
a disciplined, inorganic investment approach like the acquisition of AKASOL that add great technology and
additional scale to our portfolio while supplementing our growth profile.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Given the number of financial topics we have to get
through this morning, I'm going to dive right into the details. So let's turn to Slide 10. As we look at our
year-over-year revenue walk for Q2, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $2.1 billion,
which includes $628 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies.

Foreign currencies increased revenue by about 11% from a year ago. Then our organic growth year-
over-year was more than 72% compared to a 64% increase in weighted average market production. The
significant year-over-year changes in industry production and the varying levels of supply disruptions
among our customers make it difficult to draw conclusions from the quarterly outgrowth figures.
Nonetheless, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter.

Looking at our regional performance. In Europe, we outperformed by double digits, driven by growth
in small gasoline turbochargers, VCT and fuel injection. In China, we also outperformed the market
by double digits, driven by growth in DCT, all-wheel drive and fuel injection. And in North America, we
underperformed the market primarily due to customer exposure. The sum of all this was just under $3.8
billion of revenue in Q2.

Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on Slide 11. Our second quarter adjusted
operating income was $401 million compared to a pro forma loss of $52 million in the second quarter
of 2020. This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 10.7%. On a comparable basis, excluding the
impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased $423 million on about $1.5 billion of
higher sales. That translates to a strong incremental margin of over 28%, driven by conversion on higher
volumes, restructuring savings and Delphi-related synergies in excess of purchase price amortization.
We were particularly pleased with this performance given elevated supplier and commodity costs that we
experienced during the quarter.

Moving on to cash flow. We're proud of the fact that we generated $133 million of positive free cash
flow during the second quarter, which was achieved despite an investment in inventory to help us better
manage the challenging production environment.

Let's now turn to Slide 12, where you can see our perspective on global industry production for 2021. As
you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in
the range of 8.5% to 11%, which is down from our previous assumption of a 9% to 12% increase. This
reduction from our prior market outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the semiconductor shortage on
industry production, which is reducing our expectations for North American and European industry growth.

We do expect light vehicle industry production to improve sequentially in the third and fourth quarters
relative to Q2 as we believe the impact of the semiconductor shortages will be lower in the second half of
the year than what we saw last quarter. However, given lower commercial vehicle production in the second
half and the varying impact of ongoing supply constraints on our mix of customers, we're not expecting Q3
and Q4 revenues to return to Q1 levels.

Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on Slide 13. You can see that our end market
assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $965 million to
$1.2 billion. Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 500 to 600 basis
points, which is a meaningful step-up from our previous guidance of 300 to 500 basis points.

Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 14% to 17% relative
to 2020 pro forma revenue. Then adding a $520 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies and $75

million of revenue related to the acquisition of AKASOL, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the
range of $15.2 billion to $15.6 billion.

From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.2%
to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 margin of 8.3%. This contemplates the business delivering full
year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase
price accounting.

From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $100 million to $105 million of incremental
benefit in 2021, which is higher than our previous guidance of $70 million to $80 million. As I'll discuss in
more detail momentarily, the cost synergies are simply being realized faster than we previously expected.

Partially offsetting this favorability are 2 things: first, the acquisition of AKASOL is expected to reduce full
year margins by 10 basis points; and second, we're anticipating a net negative impact from commodities
in the range of $70 million to $90 million, which is worse than we previously expected. But even with
these 2 headwinds, we're holding our margin roughly in line with our prior guidance. Based on this
revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.15 to $4.40 per diluted
share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4 to $4.35 per diluted share.

And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range
for the full year. This is flat with our prior guidance as we expect the higher sales outlook to drive an
increase in working capital that largely offsets higher adjusted operating income. This would still represent
record free cash flow generation for the company. That's our 2021 outlook.

Let's turn to Slide 14 for an update on the financial impact of the Delphi Technologies acquisition. As I
alluded to earlier, the cost synergies related to the transaction are being realized more quickly than we
previously expected. The primary driver is faster execution of headcount reductions related to our planned
SG&A cost synergies. In fact, at this point, we've completed more than 95% of the headcount reductions
associated with our synergy plan.

As a result, we now expect 2021 cost synergies to be $100 million to $105 million, which means that
cumulatively, we expect to have achieved synergies of $115 million to $120 million by the end of the year.
But to be clear, this is an acceleration of the timing of our synergies as opposed to an overall increase in
our performance. Therefore, our total cost synergy target of $175 million is unchanged.

In addition to higher cost synergies, Delphi's revenue contribution in 2021 is also tracking ahead of our
original expectations. As a result of these 2 factors, the accretion to 2021 adjusted EPS from the Delphi
acquisition is now expected to be positive $0.20 to $0.30 versus our expectation at closing of a dilutive
impact of approximately $0.15. This is a great result and a testament to the work being done by the
integration teams across the company.

And as we look beyond 2021, it's important to note that the revenue synergies associated with the
transaction are also progressing very well. We're pleased with the systems awards that we've generated
through combining our electric vehicle capabilities, including the iDM award in China that Fred mentioned
earlier. We've been able to secure these and other components awards as a result of leveraging Delphi's
technology leadership, with BorgWarner's commercial relationships, operational capabilities and financial
strength.

Let's turn to Slide 15 for a summary of the financial impact of the AKASOL acquisition. As you can see, we
expect AKASOL to contribute 2021 sales of $75 million to BorgWarner's second half results. Then we would
expect those sales to grow significantly over the next few years, with 2024 sales still expected to be in the
$0.5 billion range. This growth is supported by AKASOL's previously reported backlog.

From an EPS perspective, we expect AKASOL to have a roughly breakeven impact on the total company
in 2021, excluding the impact of purchase price amortization. Then as the business grow sequentially
each year, we do expect to see conversion on the incremental revenue, which we expect to drive accretion
of $0.12 by 2024, also excluding the impact of purchase price amortization. We're pleased with the
transaction and the medium to long-term benefits it's expected to deliver.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had another solid quarter despite the industry
challenges. We meaningfully outperformed the market, delivered a 10.7% operating margin and generated
$133 million of free cash flow. And then coming off that Q2 performance, we've increased our full
year revenue and earnings guidance even while moderating our industry production assumptions and
considering higher commodity costs.

Looking beyond our near-term results, we believe the faster accretion from the Delphi Technologies
acquisition and the completion of the AKASOL acquisition illustrate our ability to execute the inorganic
actions that are part of our Project CHARGING FORWARD initiative. The electrification wins discussed by
Fred also highlight some of our progress toward the organic portion of our plan.

Ultimately, it's the pillars of near-term execution, securing future profitable growth and disciplined
inorganic investments that will drive the success of our strategy and thus drive value creation for our
shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Wanted to maybe talk a little bit about the second half assumption. Just based on your guidance, you had
a very strong first half, $850 million of EBITDA. The guidance in the second half implies something lower
in the $750 million to $800 million range, which would obviously be down sequentially, but also down
year-over-year versus the pro forma that you provided on up revenue. So if you could just provide some
of the puts and takes there, that would be really helpful.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think maybe to make it simpler, why don't I speak relative to the midpoint of the range. But as
you think first half to second half, I think when you exclude the impact of AKASOL, which is $75 million,
revenue sequentially, first half to second half, is down a couple of hundred million dollars. So obviously, we
have loss conversion on that revenue.

But then on top of that, as you're going first half to second half, you've got the net commodity headwinds,
which are an incremental $20 million to $40 million in the second half. Our R&D on a net basis is stepping
up in the second half, another $25 million to $30 million, and those things are being partially offset by
about $20 million to $25 million of incremental synergies. So that's kind of the walk as you look first half
to second half.

I think the thing -- if you look year-over-year, if you're talking second half of this year versus our pro
forma second half of last year, I think one of the things you have to keep in mind is part of the revenue
walk is AKASOL of $75 million and foreign exchange, which is a little bit over $100 million. So $200 million
of our revenue improvement comes with virtually no margin because FX converts it basically our operating
income. And AKASOL actually, because of purchase price amortization, is dilutive this year, about $10
million. The net is no conversion on that incremental $200 million.

Which means what? It means then on the revenue that's left, there's actually the downside conversion
at the midpoint of our guide, plus those other things I spoke of, the commodity costs, R&D being up, but
synergies being a little bit of an offset. So hopefully, that helps.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

No. That's great detail. And then if we go talk to the secular side of the business, and you announced
several EV wins in the quarter. Of note, the 3 on high-voltage that obviously are of more significant value,
the 2 inverters and the one iDM, could you talk about just relative -- I mean, you can give a hard number,
but the relative side to the window? Are we talking about hundreds of million in the backlog addition
where it's either 100,000 per year type vehicles? Or is it something that you expect that's a little bit
smaller?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I think the volumes are meaningful. And what we've seen also is each time we book a business in this
field, volume is -- expectation is going up and up. So those are 2 great programs for us. And from an
iDM perspective, as you've seen, it's -- we're building a modular portfolio. It's a different power output,
different power level. And so very happy about that and hitting the market with great products.

Your next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird.

Luke L. Junk
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

First question I want to ask, if there's any additional color that you could share in the scope of the iDM
award that you disclosed today. Should we think about this as an award on the single vehicle? Or could it
potentially cut cross-platform at the customer?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So right now, the iDM -- the iDM is a power level. So within that power level, it cuts across the vehicles
that the customer wants to tailor for that power level. So that's the color I can give you. It starts with the
platform and will cut across at the 250-kilowatt power level.

Luke L. Junk
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then bigger picture, one of the focus areas that you'd highlighted at your
Investor Day in March was iDMs in Asia in general. The thing here, 5, 6 months later, you've now booked
a couple of these awards, and we're still not even a year out from the close of the Delphi deal. Is it fair
to say that the level of interest in Asia is consistent with or maybe even a little better than you had
anticipated in March?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

It's in line with what we expected. And this is currently where the music is played the loudest from an
EV acceleration standpoint. This is where we're going to gain scale early, very happy about that. And the
technologies that we're bringing to the market and the competitiveness that we're bringing to the market
with in-house transmission motor electronic software is very, very well received.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Thanks for that first half or second half walk. That was helpful. I guess just on the commodities, if I'm
following along, it seems like on a year-over-year basis, you're talking about another $55-or-so million
headwind in the back half. I just want to confirm that. And also if you could just sort of remind us of
your policy here because I thought, over time, you tend to get some recoveries there. So as we begin to
think about the bridge into '22, does this sort of headwind remain? Or do you start to get some of those
recoveries on the raw materials?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think you've got the number right. As you look at the second half of the year on a year-over-year
basis, it's in the $45 million to $65 million range. So you've hit the midpoint exactly right. And that is a
net number, net of our recoveries. Now obviously, there are some timing lags as it relates to recoveries,
but the bulk of those recoveries are expected to be in our results as we progress through the year.

And so that number that we're talking about, the $45 million to $65 million, in the back half of the year on
a year-over-year basis is net of the recoveries already, but there might be a little bit of a tailwind heading
into the first quarter of next year.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So I mean if we -- so if these commodity levels hold, then it's fair to assume at an absolute level, there's
still a headwind in the first half of next year even if -- maybe it's mitigated somewhat by some of the
recovery timing?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, a little bit. So certainly, because the headwinds, as we go first half to second half, are definitely more
negative, call it, $20 million to $40 million and as that carries over -- to the extent it carries over into Q1
of next year, that would be an incremental headwind on a year-over-year basis relative to Q1 of this year.
But of course, there's lots of moving pieces as we head into the beginning of the year.

We know next year, in '23, we got another $55 million to $60 million of synergies to recoup from the
Delphi transaction. We've got the legacy BorgWarner restructuring actions we announced 18 months ago.
And you remember, we said those actions were to mitigate unknown risks. These are the types of risks
exactly than it was geared toward, things that were unforeseen at the time. And that's another $25 plus
million of tailwind next year.

There's the legacy Delphi restructuring actions, Project Pioneer, which is incremental tailwind next year,
and then any conversion on our continued outgrowth. So there's lots of puts and takes as we head
towards next year. But incrementally, if commodity levels held, there would be an incremental headwind
heading into next Q1 versus this year's Q1.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then the second question is just, Fred, maybe -- this is a question we've been getting a lot
from investors, right? So at your Analyst Day earlier this year, I think you sort of put up a slide that
showed that thought 80% of inverters would be outsourced. It seems like during the quarter, whether
it was Renault or Ford or some others, like there's been more and more announcements of automakers
trying to do power electronics themselves. And so it seems like -- it would seem like maybe that figure
is incrementally more challenged. I'm curious whether your view has changed there. Or is this just a
definitional issue, meaning like by in-sourcing, you mean like the OEMs actually make it, but in reality, in
some of these cases, like the OEMs might help with design, but they won't necessarily build?

Yes. I think in inverter, we -- I believe we are in a very, very strong position. And we've already announced
more than 1.1 million units by 2025 in Europe. If you do the math, it's a significant share of the overall
European inverter volume for BEVs. And since then, more booking has happened. We don't see too much
change.

I think -- and it's due to 3 reasons. We're successful in this field for 3 reasons. First, it's our product
leadership. The different voltage, 400, 800, the silicon carbide, we continue to innovate with cost and
weight reduction with more efficiencies. Two is we have scale. And I absolutely believe that this continues
to be a strength. And we are leveraging the whole electronics business that we have. And last but not
least, I think we also have a high degree of vertical integration, enhanced capabilities, integrated circuit
development, software power modules and maybe more in the future.

I think this is a very competitive business. We -- you have to have the best efficiency at the best cost. You
have to have scale. I'm very confident that we are in a very good position to grab a significant portion of
what will be outsourced. And we're not seeing a change from about 80% of outsourced inverter volume to
suppliers.

Your next question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.

Colin M. Langan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

You've done a pretty good job here. You keep cutting your sort of production assumption and yet you keep
raising your sales guidance. I mean what is driving that much better-than-expected growth over market?
Does mix have anything to do with that, with commercial maybe holding in better?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So I think we outgrew the market in Q2. We underperformed in North America due to customer
exposures, and we overperformed Europe and China, double digit, driven pretty much by all products.
There is not one product that drives more than the other.

Now in Q2, I must admit, there was a lot of moving pieces. And we're not looking at outgrowth per
quarter. That is too finite. So -- but we're very happy with the way our top line is evolving this year and
very happy to be able to beat and raise in the short term. Also very focused in the long term. We are
investing R&D in order to -- in R&D in order to support the programs that have been booked and very
happy with where we are, both short term on the margin and cash flow and also the activities from a long-
term booking.

And I want to take the example, people focus a lot on downstream the battery. But the example of that
high-voltage coolant heater, I think, is a great example where BorgWarner can develop in-house and really
solve a problem of battery electric vehicle. Battery electric vehicle require innovation solutions for 2 critical
functions: battery thermal and cabin heating.

And the solution that we gave to the market is taking a lot of traction. You won't be surprised, we have
our own integrated electronics and software, and we are leveraging the heating technologies that we have
from other BorgWarner product lines. So very happy about where we are, both organic and inorganic in
the long term.

Colin M. Langan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And any color on the commercial market? I kind of thought that was holding in better, but if I look
at your guidance from Q1 to Q2, actually, your outlook is it's getting -- it actually came down. So did that
actually hold up better in the quarter? Does it get a lot worse in the second half now? Because I know
that's a pretty high-margin business. I think with the Delphi deal, it's a larger chunk of your business now.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean one of the big things is that China, we would expect to see headwinds as we look at the back
half of the year from a year-over-year production perspective, and that obviously has an impact on us on
our overall outlook.

Colin M. Langan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And is that -- okay. So the second half is getting weaker. Okay.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Second half is weaker on a year-over-year basis, definitely, and China is a big driver of that.

Operator

And your next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I just want to follow up on Colin's question there, just on the outgrowth. Can you maybe unpack some
of the items that you saw in the second quarter that drove the outgrowth between the DCT and turbo
and GDi? Just maybe a little more color on what exactly was driving that. And as we're thinking about,
especially in Europe, the push to BEV, is there any shift in where GDi and turbo sits in automakers pushing
toward their CO2 targets?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And as I mentioned before, we outgrew Europe and China double digit, driven by a lot of factors. But
you're right, gas turbos, VCTs and GDi in Europe, also all-wheel drives. And so this is driven by also --
don't forget that in any hybrid powertrain architecture, you've got a good gasoline engine with turbos and
GDi and other elements. And don't forget that hybrid powertrain, especially in Europe, but also in China,
and the business that we booked with that dual inverter is a good example, is ramping up very, very fast.

And that is giving us on the E side scale and launch expertise that are translatable into the world of BEV.
And on the combustion side, it just pulls our products that drive efficient combustion engines. So I think
it's that particular reason. I don't have the color about how much is turbo versus VCT or GDi or all-wheel
drive, but I'm pretty sure Pat can follow up off-line with you.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then the line of sight for the remainder of the year as far as GDi and turbo in Europe, is that
something that is still playing a role in driving CO2 targets? Or...

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Absolutely, it does. Absolutely, it does. It does in reducing the CO2 and emissions of combustion engines,
it does because it is an enabler of hybrid powertrains. And as you've seen, this is helping carmakers in
Europe, especially to meet the CO2 target. So absolutely, it does help.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to follow up on last quarter's announcement, which we
got a little more color in June, the iDM award with Hyundai. So you have an A segment car here, and

13

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

it's putting in iDM content that's -- if I had to guess, it's $1,000, give or take. I mean if you can maybe
comment on the content. But the question is usually, an A segment car is going to be a much tighter
content cost, there's much lower budget for content. So what does that tell us about going into B or C
segment platforms? Does that tell you that there's better potential to scale that up to B or C segment? Or
is there something unique about an A segment vehicle that makes them more likely to approach you on an
iDM as opposed to doing it in-house?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So last quarter, we announced the iDM award on Class A, so small. Small doesn't mean simple, but small.
This quarter, we're announcing a different type of iDM, bigger, with about twice the output power than
the one from Hyundai. And as I mentioned in the last call, we're building iDM modular portfolio. And
this is a great example of launching 2 different power levels, all BorgWarner-made, in Asia. Combined
with the iDMs that we are currently producing as an integrator, you see that we are starting seeing a
path of integrating with other motors or even other inverters, if the customer wishes to do that, a path
for different power levels and different sizes of iDM, all-BorgWarner-made, transmission motor, power
electronic software and vertically integrated on the ASICs and so on, and a path with components.

And as we mentioned in past calls, we're very happy to sell inverters to customers who want to make iDM
in-house. So you're seeing the strategy of developing and commercializing a portfolio of iDMs globally that
is seeing daylight.

Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I guess first, congrats on closing AKASOL. I just wanted to understand, what margins roughly are you
assuming for AKASOL by 2024 in the accretion estimates you've provided, excluding amortization? And
then more strategically, how do you see AKASOL maintaining competitive differentiation in battery packs
over time?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. With respect to the margins, we're not disclosing a margin outlook at this point in time, but I think
you can probably do some math underlying our EPS and get a sense as to what the pretax assumptions
are as it relates to the overall performance of that P&L relative to the $0.5 billion or so of revenue that
we're expecting by the year 2024. But at this point, again, not going to disclose any margin profiles other
than we think it's going to be a profitable business over time.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

As far as technological edge at AKASOL, a few things, Noah. First, they're currently producing their gen 2.
They're launching their gen 3 later this year. And being able to launch generation and improve efficiency
and power density regularly is key.

Now they're part of -- soon, they'll be fully, fully part of BorgWarner. And you can imagine that we will
be working with them and linking them with the battery management system and software that we have
currently in production coming from ex-Delphi Technologies. We certainly are going to link them also to
the high-voltage coolant heaters. Those elements are heating the coolant for the batteries. And I'm --
I expect that we're going to find innovation and products that are going to be generating value for our
customers and for BorgWarner going forward.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Very helpful. And then just around R&D, to clarify, the new guide is $725 million of spend. That compares
to 5% previously. So a, just to understand, are you actually bumping up R&D levels from prior guidance?
If so, is that driven by EV programs? Kind of where is the focus? Just help us understand.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'll take that. A couple of things worth noting around the R&D guide. First thing is that when you
look at our Q2 results and when you get a chance to go through our 10-Q, you'll see that our net R&D
sequentially was down in the second quarter versus the first quarter. But it's because we actually had
higher customer recoveries from engineering perspective than we had anticipated and than we had in Q1,
by about $20 million.

If you look at our gross R&D going from Q1 to Q2, it was actually up sequentially, but the net was down.
And so what that means is it's actually had an impact. We've actually brought down our implied full year
R&D from what was about $740 million implicitly at the beginning of the year to about $725 million as our
current guide. And so that's really being driven by the higher-than-anticipated customer recoveries that
we generated in the second quarter.

As you look at it as a percent -- the reason we gave a dollar guide as opposed to a percentage guide is the
percentage is coming down. And the reason the percentage in 2021 is coming down is because revenue is
going up. So it's not because we're cutting our R&D spend. We had better recoveries, but our R&D spend
is actually still $725 million. But with revenue coming -- going up, the R&D as a percent of sales is actually
now 4.6% to 4.8%, which just looks like a lower percentage, but it's implying lower spend, but it really
isn't the case.

So as we look to the full year, that's what the $725 million represents, about a $15 million reduction but
really driven by the recoveries. And then as we think ahead to next year and beyond, we continue to
expect that we're going to be driving R&D spend in that 5-plus percent range on a go-forward basis.

Our next question comes from David Kelley with Jefferies.

Gavin Lorne Kennedy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is Gavin Kennedy on for David. Two from my end. First, you mentioned that North America customer
mix was a headwind in 2Q. Just was curious what BorgWarner is seeing as far as visibility to customer
schedules in North America through year-end.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

What we're seeing is a better mix and recovery coming into Q3 and Q4 from the Q2 level and still very
volatile, especially because of the semiconductor supply issues. That's what we're currently seeing, Gavin.

Gavin Lorne Kennedy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then switching gears. At your Investor Day, you mentioned $3 billion to $4
billion in targeted legacy [ ICE ] dispositions by '25 and about, call it, $1 billion in the next year or so.
Can you comment on how disposition conversations are going, particularly given the volatile current
environment? And any additional commentary you can give us on what products you might be focused on
these dispositions? That would be helpful.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean it's in progress. Just as you noted, the $1 billion or so, we expect it to execute over a 12- to
18-month time frame from what we announced at Investor Day, which means as we get to the end of Q3,

15

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

we'd expect to complete that full $1 billion or so. And we're in progress right now. And as we talked about,
we're really focused on disposing product lines or businesses that don't meet the long-term financial
objectives of our portfolio, which means they lack 1 of 3 things: they either lack product leadership, they
lack medium to long-term growth prospects or they lack strong margin and cash flow generating ability.
And so if a product line or a business doesn't tick all 3 of those boxes, it's a candidate for disposition.

So at this point, we're actively moving forward in line with what we talked about at our Investor Day. And
we think we're on track to deliver that $1 billion or so of dispositions, I call it mid- to late 2022, consistent
with the time frame that we laid out back at Investor Day. And then we continue to expect $3 billion to $4
billion by the end of 2025.

Your next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Apologize if this was covered in the opening, but I kind of doubt it. When I -- when you look at the 800-
volt market, I was struck at the Chicago Auto Show by the Hyundai 800-volt systems and, of course, the
advantages. A small question is, can you confirm if you're on that or not? But the bigger question is 800
volts started in the high-performance performance market with the Porsche. Now we see it in Hyundai's.
I know your new high -- your new EV motor runs on 800 volts for commercial. So my question is, do
you see 800 volt as a big trend, one. Two, is the inverter product line you got from Delphi Tech uniquely
positioned in that market relative to competitors? And three, are there synergies then between your 800-
volt converter capability, your e-motor capability and where AKASOL could go? And is AKASOL capable of
doing 800-volt packs?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So the answer to your first question, is 800 volt a big trend and is it going down in vehicle sales, the
answer is yes. Why? Because it increases the power density and decreases the charging time. Are we well-
equipped? Absolutely. The answer is absolutely, yes. We are going to be one of the first one launching very
soon, 800-volt silicon carbide at high volume. This is a competitive advantage that we have to master,
high-voltage silicon carbide, and also master 800 volts, made in-house, power module, which is the heart
of the inverter.

Synergies, absolutely. I was talking about high-voltage coolant heaters. We will start in 2024, an 800-volt
high-voltage coolant heater. And yes, there are synergies across the different product portfolio that we
have running at 800 volts, Brian.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And could AKASOL do 800-volt packs?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I need to check that. My answer is yes, but I have -- I need to go back to you on this one particularly.

And your next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

First question is about your gross over market outlook. It's good to see you boosting the outlook for the
full year. Can you talk in a little bit more detail around what you're expecting for the second half of the

year? Obviously, you mentioned mix, improving and customer mix, in particular. But then obviously, you
had pretty solid growth over market already in the second quarter. And then for the full year, you had 500
to 600 basis points. How would you see this play out in the second half?

And then just looking a little bit more forward, how should we think about the mix going forward? Does
this then represent a headwind in 2022? Does this acceleration in growth over market make you rethink
your framework for growth over market?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean a couple of things. When you look at the first half, year-to-date, we're somewhere between
650, 700 basis points of cumulative outgrowth for the first half. And so as we look at the second half of
the year, we don't think we'll be operating at quite that pace. We think we're probably in the 400 to 550
basis points for that second half.

The first half, we benefited from some mix. We probably benefited from some production of vehicles that
weren't ultimately in the production numbers of the OE. So there's probably some level of giveback that's
implied in our numbers in the second half, which is why you see it lower year-over-year and implicitly a
step-down sequentially going from the first half to second half. But overall, I feel good about our ability to
deliver 500 to 600 basis points for the full year.

In terms of what that translates to for future years, not prepared to give any update on that. I mean we
feel good about the backlog we've disclosed previously, looking at '22 to '24. And we'll probably give an
update on that as we get into the beginning of next year.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then second question on iDM. Can you just -- so just diving a little bit deeper here, can you
just give us a sense of how you think about the range of content per vehicle? And how would you see your
either volume or revenue and margin profile of that line of business evolve over the next few years? So
sort of like a mid-term outlook on how you would see iDM go from here.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Average content per vehicle is going to range from about $1,000 for the smaller versions and times 3 or
4 for much higher sizes. I'm not going to comment on volumes. I'm not allowed to comment on volumes.
Only -- I think that gives you some color on the content per vehicle.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

And then on the margin side of the equation, I think as we've talked about before, any new product
programs, whether they're a combustion-based product or an EV product like an iDM, we look at on a
return on invested capital basis. And given that we're predominantly from a manufacturing perspective in
the assembly business, what that means is the capital intensity of our programs, including the iDM, tend
to be similar to our other product lines.

And so as we drive to deliver consistent ROIC across our product portfolio and we have relatively
consistent capital intensity, it means the margin profile on any discrete program looks substantially similar
to the margin programs of other business that we approve throughout the company, whether it's EV or
not.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And that would be from day 1? Or is there a target data on this?

Kevin A. Nowlan

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

BORGWARNER INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2021

Executive VP & CFO

Well, that's the life of a program. So when you look at our EV programs, generally speaking, they tend
to have much more R&D intensity, which tends to be upfront. So as we're growing in EVs, what happens
is we have a lot more R&D hitting the P&L upfront, and then you generate the contribution margins over
time. And the blend of all that hits our ROIC targets over the life of the program.

But what that means as you're in ramp-up mode across EV, your R&D is much higher proportionally
relative to the conversion you're generating on the incremental revenue because the revenue is still
coming in the future. So the EV portfolio in total has a more depressed margin while you're in growth
mode. But that's not because of the underlying fundamentals of the business. It's because we're growing
and investing in R&D to support the contribution margins that we'll generate over the coming years as we
start to generate the revenue.

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Two things I would add, Emmanuel. First is that everything that Kevin has said -- is the additional R&D
that we do for EV is already in our margin profile, right? And two, currently spending 30% of R&D in EV
when our revenue is 3% to 5%, like -- where like the market is, quite frankly. So that shows you how
deliberate we are in accelerating the path towards electrification.

Operator

We have time for one final question, and that question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

First, I wanted to talk on Delphi. And reflecting back when that was announced, part of the industrial logic
was that Delphi would give the company a broader set of technologies, including for EVs. I know some
of that's with iDM, but more holistically. So now that you've had that asset for a longer period of time,
you have a few wins with iDM, can you give more clarity on your win rates and to what extent you're
converting on that broader set of solutions to the extent that you had been anticipating?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So yes, we -- it's only 6 months after the close we booked iDMs, which is very important, but it's not
limited to those systems. We also booked a lot of inverters that we think could be booked only with
that combination. We are also accelerating on battery management systems, the software battery
management system. So from a top line synergy perspective, we're absolutely on track with what we
expected coming into the Delphi acquisition.

Mark Trevor Delaney
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then you talked already a little bit about the supply chain situation and your
views on the second half versus the first half. But maybe you can talk a little bit more on the longer-term
implications from the supply shortages. Some of the OEMs have said that they want to change how they're
going to procure supply and work more directly with some of the semiconductor companies. And how
do you think that may impact a Tier 1 like BorgWarner in terms of how you may partner both with your
customers and suppliers and some of the implications around margins and working capital?

Frederic B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So we are not seeing that trend, at least in the products that we focus on. But what I think is -- what that
semiconductor issue has told us is that it is extremely important to partner upstream and downstream,
upstream with our customers and downstream with our semiconductor suppliers. And the second thing

notch. And I think those 2 lessons, we're going to keep very close to our mind when we move forward in
the next years.
