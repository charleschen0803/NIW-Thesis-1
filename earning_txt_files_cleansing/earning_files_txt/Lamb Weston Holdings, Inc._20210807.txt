LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 07, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Lamb Weston First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being
recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations
of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead.

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This
morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.

Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's
expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may
differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors
contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.

Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can
find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.

With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our
Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some comments on our performance as well as a brief overview
of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results and
fiscal 2022 outlook.

With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our strong
sales growth in the quarter, which reflects the ongoing broad recovery in demand across our out-of-home
sales channels as well as continued improvement in our key international markets. However, our margin
improvement lags our volume recovery as a result of the timing of pricing actions to offset cost inflation
as well as challenging macro factors that increase our cost and affected our production run rates and
throughput.

These ongoing challenges, combined with the extreme summer's heat, negative impact on potato crops
in the Pacific Northwest will result in a higher cost as the year progresses. As a result, we now expect our
gross profit margins will remain below pre-pandemic levels through fiscal 2022.

We believe many of these costs and supply chain challenges are transitory, and we're taking aggressive
actions to mitigate their effects on our operations and financial performance. We're confident that our
actions, along with our investments to improve productivity and operations over the long term, will get us
back on track to deliver higher margins and sustainable growth.

Before Bernadette gets into some of the specifics of our first quarter results and outlook, let's briefly
review the current operating environment, starting with demand. In the U.S., we continue to be
encouraged by the pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and demand for fries. Overall, restaurant traffic
has largely stabilized at about 5% below pre-pandemic levels, led by the continued solid performance at
quick service restaurants. Traffic at full service restaurants continued to rebound in June and July, but it
did soften a bit in August as the Delta variant surged across most of the country.

Demand improved at noncommercial foodservice outlets, especially in the education market, which helped
to offset the near-term slowdown in full service restaurants. The fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is a

rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, also continued
to help support the recovery in demand by remaining above pre-pandemic levels. Demand in U.S. retail
channels also remained solid, with overall category volumes in the quarter still up 15% to 20% from pre-
pandemic levels.

Outside the U.S., overall fry demand continued to improve in the quarter, although the rate of
improvement varied widely among our key international markets. Demand in Europe, which is served
by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, gradually recovered as vaccination rates climbed. Demand in
Asia and Oceania was solid, but also softened in August due to the spread of the Delta variant. And South
America remained challenged, especially in Brazil. So overall, we're happy with the recovery in global
demand and believe it provides a solid foundation for continued volume growth in fiscal 2022.

With respect to the pricing environment, I'm pleased with the progress of our recently implemented
pricing actions to manage sharp input cost inflation. In our Foodservice and Retail segments as well as
in some of our international business, we'll begin to realize some of the pricing benefits in the second
quarter and more fully in the third quarter. In our Global segment, the contract renewables for large chain
restaurant customers have largely progressed as we expected and we'll generally begin to see the impact
of any pricing actions associated with these contracts in our third quarter. In addition, we'll continue to
benefit from price escalators for most of the global contracts that are not up for renewal this year. These
price adjustments reset based on the underlying timing of the contract renewals, but largely during our
fiscal third quarter.

Overall, we expect our price increases across our business segments will, in aggregate, mitigate most
of the cost inflation. However, depending on the pace and scope of inflation and the increase of potato
costs resulting from this year's poor crop, we may take further price action as the year progresses. In
contrast to demand and pricing, the manufacturing and distribution environment continues to be difficult.
Our supply chain costs on a per pound basis have increased significantly due to input and transportation
cost inflation as well as labor availability and other macro supply chain disruptions that are continuing
to cause production inefficiencies across our global manufacturing network. Although we're making
gradual progress to mitigate these challenges, they have slowed our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing
operations during the first half of fiscal 2022. As a result, we expect the turnaround in our supply chain
will take longer than we initially anticipated.

Now turning to the crop. The early read on this year's crop in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta
indicates that it will be well below average levels in both yield and quality due to the extreme heat over
the summer. As we're still in the middle of the main crop harvest, the extent of the financial impact of the
crop condition will be determined over the coming quarter as the harvest is completed. While we expect
this impact will be significant, we're examining a variety of levers to mitigate the effect on our earnings as
well as on customer service and supply. As usual, we'll provide a more complete assessment of the crop
and its impact on earnings when we release our second quarter results in early January.

So in summary, I feel good about the overall pace of recovery in french fry demand, especially in the
U.S. I believe it provides a solid foundation for future growth. I also feel good about the current pricing
environment and how we're executing pricing actions in the marketplace. We do expect higher potato
costs, input and transportation inflation, labor challenges and other industry-wide operational headwinds
to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we're taking specific actions to mitigate these
challenges, they will keep our gross margins below pre-pandemic levels through fiscal 2022.

And finally, I'm confident that we're taking the right steps to get our company back on track to delivering
more normalized profit margins. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our
first quarter results and our fiscal 2022 outlook.

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As many of you know, this is my first earnings call as CFO of
Lamb Weston. I've now been in the role for about 9 weeks. For those on the line that I haven't met, it's

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 07, 2021

a pleasure to meet you over the phone. I'm looking forward to meeting many of you in person over the
coming months as we get back into the cadence of in-person investor meetings and industry events.

As Tom discussed, we feel good about the health of the category and our top line performance in the first
quarter, and expect our gross margins going forward will improve as we benefit from our recent pricing
actions as well as from other actions that we're taking to mitigate some of the macro challenges affecting
our supply chain.

Specifically, in the quarter, sales increased 13% to $984 million, with volume up 11% and price/mix
up 2%. As expected, volume was the primary driver of sales growth, reflecting the ongoing recovery in
fry demand outside the home in the U.S. and in some of our key international markets as well as the
comparison to relatively soft shipments in the prior year quarter. Lower retail segment sales volume
partially offset this growth, largely as a result of incremental losses of low-margin private-label business.
Overall, our sales volume in the first quarter was about 95% of what it was during the first quarter of
fiscal 2020, before the pandemic impacted demand.

Moving to pricing, pricing actions and favorable mix drove an increase in price/mix in each of our core
business segments. As I'll discuss in more detail later, our pricing actions include the benefit of higher
prices charged to customers for product delivery in an effort to pass through rising freight costs. The offset
to this is higher transportation costs and cost of goods sold.

Gross profit in the quarter declined $63 million as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by
higher manufacturing and transportation costs on a per pound basis. The decline in gross profit also
includes a $6 million decrease in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, which includes a $1 million gain
in the current quarter compared with a $7 million gain in the prior year quarter.

The increase in cost per pound primarily related to 3 factors: first, we incurred double-digit cost inflation
for key commodity inputs, most notably, edible oils, which has more than doubled versus the prior year
quarter. Other inputs that saw significant inflation include ingredients such as wheat and starches used to
make batter and other coatings and containerboard and plastic film for packaging. Higher labor costs were
also a factor as we incurred more expense from increased unplanned overtime.

Second, our transportation costs increased due to rising freight rates as global logistics networks continue
to struggle. Our costs also rose due to an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail as we took
extraordinary steps to deliver product to our customers. Together, inflation for commodity inputs and
transportation accounted for approximately 3/4 of the increase in our cost per pound.

The third factor driving the increase in cost per pound was lower production run rates and throughput
at our plants from lost production days and unplanned downtime. This resulted in incremental costs and
inefficiencies. Some of this is attributable to ongoing upstream supply chain disruption including the timely
delivery of key inputs and other vendor-supplied materials and services. However, most of the impact on
run rate was attributable to volatile labor availability and shortages across our manufacturing network.

So what are we doing to mitigate these higher costs and stabilize our supply chain? First, price. We
are executing our recently announced price increases across each of our business segments and
implementation of these pricing actions are on track. Our price/cost relationship will progressively improve
as our pass-through pricing catches up with the inflationary cost increases. We'll begin to see some benefit
from these actions in the second quarter and it will continue to build through the year. If needed, we will
implement additional rounds of price increases to mitigate the impact of further cost inflation.

We've also increased the freight rates that we charge customers to recover the cost of product delivery,
and we are adjusting them more frequently to better reflect changes to the market rates. These
adjustments have also lagged the cost increases. While we saw some benefit in the first quarter, we
expect to see more of a benefit beginning in the second quarter. In addition, we're significantly restricting
the use of higher cost spot rate trucking.

Second, we're optimizing our portfolio. We're eliminating underperforming SKUs to drive savings through
simplification in terms of procurement, production, inventory management and distribution. We are also
partnering with our customers to modify product specifications without compromising food safety and

quality. These modifications will help mitigate the impact of lower potato crop yields from this year's crop
as well as some of the impact of reduced potato utilization that results from poor raw potato quality.

Third, we're increasing productivity savings with our Win As One program. While realized savings to date
have been small, given that the initiative is still fairly new, we began to execute specific cost reduction
programs around procurement, commodity utilization, manufacturing waste, inventory management and
logistics as well as programs to improve demand planning and throughput. We expect savings from these
and other productivity programs will steadily build as our supply chain stabilizes.

And finally, we're managing labor availability and volatility. This includes changing how we schedule our
labor crews, which provides our employees more control and predictability over their personal schedules
and reduces unplanned overtime. We're also reviewing compensation levels to make sure we remain an
employer of choice in each of our local communities. This is in addition to the other recruiting tools and
incentives such as signing and retention bonuses.

Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $13 million in the quarter. This increase was largely
driven by 3 factors: first, it reflects the investments we're making behind information technology,
commercial and supply chain productivity initiatives that should improve our operations over the long
term. About $4 million this quarter represents nonrecurring ERP-related expenses; second, it reflects
higher compensation and benefits expense; and third, it includes an additional $3 million of advertising
and promotional support behind the launch of new branded items in our Retail segment. This increase
compares to a low base in the prior year when we significantly reduced A&P activities at the onset of the
pandemic. Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.20, down from $0.61 in the prior year,
while adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $123 million, down from $202 million.

Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment were up 12% in the quarter, with volume up 10%
and price/mix up 2%. Overall, the segment's total shipments are trending above pre-pandemic levels
due to strength in our North American chain restaurant business, especially at QSRs. Our international
shipments in the quarter also approached pre-pandemic levels despite congestion at West Coast ports and
the worldwide shipping container shortage continuing to disrupt our exports as well as softening demand
in Asia due to the spread of the Delta variant. The 2% increase in price/mix reflected the benefit of higher
prices charged for freight, inflation-driven price escalators and favorable customer mix. Global's product
contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses, declined 45% to $43
million. Input and transportation cost inflation as well as higher manufacturing cost per pound more than
offset the benefit of higher sales volume and favorable price/mix.

Moving to our Foodservice segment. Sales increased 36%, with volume up 35% and price/mix up 1%.
The strong increase in sales volumes largely reflected the year-over-year recovery in shipments to small
and regional restaurant chains and independently-owned restaurants. However, shipments to these end
customers, along with restaurant traffic, slowed in August, due to the surge of the Delta variant across the
U.S. Volume growth in August was also tempered by the inability to service full customer demand due to
lower production run rates and throughput at our plants largely due to labor availability.

Our shipments to noncommercial customers improved through the quarter as the education, lodging and
entertainment channels continue to strengthen. Overall, noncommercial shipments were up sequentially to
75% to 80% of pre-pandemic levels from about 65% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase
in price/mix largely reflected pricing actions, including the benefit of higher prices charged for freight.
Foodservice's product contribution margin rose 12% to $96 million. Higher sales volumes and favorable
price/mix more than offset input and transportation cost inflation as well as higher manufacturing cost per
pound.

Moving to our Retail segment. Sales declined 14%, with volume down 15% and price/mix up 1%. The
sales volume decline largely reflects lower shipments of private-label products, resulting from incremental
losses of certain low-margin business. Sales of branded products were down slightly from a strong prior
year quarter that benefited from very high in-home consumption demand due to the pandemic, but
remain well above pre-pandemic levels. The increase in price/mix was largely driven by favorable price,
including higher prices charged for freight. Retail's product contribution margin declined 59% to $15

million. Input and transportation cost inflation, higher manufacturing cost per pound, lower sales volumes
and a $2 million increase in A&P expenses to support the launch of new products drove the decline.

Let's move to our cash flow and liquidity position. In the first quarter, we generated more than $160
million of cash from operations. That's down about $90 million versus the prior year quarter due primarily
to lower earnings. We spent nearly $80 million in capital expenditures and paid $34 million in dividends.
We also bought back nearly $26 million worth of stock or about double what we have typically repurchased
in prior quarters. During the quarter, we amended our revolver to increase its capacity from $750 million
to $1 billion and extended its maturity date to August 2026. At the end of the first quarter, our revolver
was undrawn, and we had nearly $790 million of cash on hand. Our total debt was about $2.75 billion and
our net debt to EBITDA, including joint ventures ratio was 2.7x.

Now let's turn to our updated outlook. We continue to expect our sales growth in fiscal 2022 to be above
our long-term target of low to mid-single digits. In the second quarter, we continue to anticipate sales
growth will be largely driven by higher volumes as we lap a comparison to relatively soft shipments during
the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic. We expect price/mix will be up sequentially versus
the 2% that we delivered in Q1 as the execution of pricing actions in all of our segments remain on track.

For the second half of the year, we continue to expect our sales growth will reflect more of a balance
of higher volume and improved price/mix as we begin to lap some of the softer volume comparisons
from the prior year, and as the benefit from our earlier pricing actions continue to build. Our volume
growth, however, may be tempered by global logistics disruptions and container shortages that affects
both domestic and export shipments. It may also be tempered by lower factory production due to macro
industry and labor challenges as well as a poor quality crop.

With respect to earnings, we expect net income and adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, will
continue to be pressured through fiscal 2022. That's a change from our previous expectation of earnings
gradually approaching pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the year. Driving most of this change is
our expectation of significantly higher potato costs resulting from poor yield and quality of the crops in our
growing regions. We previously assumed a potato crop that approached historical averages. Outside of
raw potatoes, we expect double-digit inflation for key production inputs such as edible oils, transportation
and packaging to continue through fiscal 2022. We have previously assumed these costs would begin to
gradually ease during the second half of the year.

We also expect the macro challenges that have slowed the turnaround in our supply chain to continue
through fiscal 2022. That said, we expect the labor and transportation actions that I described earlier,
along with our Win As One productivity initiatives, will help us continue to gradually stabilize operations,
improve production run rates and throughput, and manage costs as the year progresses.

For the full year, we expect our gross margin may be at least 5 to 8 points below our normalized annual
margin rate of 25% to 26%. While we recognize this is a wide range, it reflects the volatility and high
degree of uncertainty regarding the cost pressures that I've discussed. Consistent with prior years, we'll
have a better understanding of the crop's financial impact in the next couple of months, and we will
provide an update when we release our second quarter results in early January. Below gross margin, we
expect our quarterly SG&A expense will be in the high 90s as we continue our investments to improve
our operations over the long term, while equity earnings will likely remain pressured, due to input cost
inflation and higher manufacturing costs, both in Europe and the U.S.

We've also updated a couple of our other targets for the year. First, we've reduced our capital expenditure
estimate to $450 million from our previous estimate of $650 million to $700 million. This significant
reduction is due to the timing of spend behind our large capital projects and effectively shift the spend
into early 2023 -- fiscal 2023. Despite the shift in expenditures, our expansion projects in Idaho and
China remain on track to open in the spring and fall of 2023, respectively. And second, we're reducing our
estimated full year effective tax rate to approximately 22%, down from our previous estimate of between
23% and 24%. Our estimates for total interest expense of around $115 million and total depreciation and
amortization expense of approximately $190 million remain unchanged.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 07, 2021

So in summary, the strong recovery in demand helped fuel our top line growth in the first quarter, but
higher manufacturing and distribution costs led to lower earnings. For fiscal 2022, we expect net sales
growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, but that our earnings will continue
to be pressured for the remainder of the year due to higher potato costs from a poor crop and persistent
inflationary and macro challenges. Nonetheless, we expect to begin to see earnings improve in the second
quarter, behind our pricing actions and the steps we're taking to improve our costs.

Now here's Tom for some closing comments.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Bernadette. Let me just sum it up. We feel good about the near-term recovery in demand in the
U.S., in our key international markets as well as the long-term health and growth of the category. We're
taking the necessary steps with respect to pricing and continuing to focus on stabilizing our supply chain
to mitigate near-term operational headwinds and improve profitability. We're on track with our recently
announced capacity investments to support our customer and category growth as well as our long-term
strategic and financial objectives.
Thank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just to kick off, maybe ask on the pricing side. I know your initial round is just starting to work its way
through the market. But it sounds like it's not going to fully offset inflation. Could you maybe talk about at
what point, just from a timing standpoint, you could think about that second round being instituted? And
then to what extent do you think you'll be able to price for potato inflation? I know that your sourcing is
maybe a little bit different than what the broader U.S. might be facing this year in terms of potato costs.
So just trying to kind of understand that pricing dynamic.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the pricing -- this is Tom Werner. The pricing generally, we have priced through to offset inflation
across the portfolio. It's a matter of timing. So as we've stated, we'll start realizing some of that here in
Q2, but the full impact of our pricing actions across our segments, we'll start to realize in Q3, and that's
pretty typical in previous years.

And one of the things that impacted this quarter is we got behind on it, quite frankly. So we're catching
up. And as we evaluate the go forward, we're closer to it. We're taking a number of different actions,
particularly in our freight area to pass those costs through based on freight availability and managing
customer service. So we've adjusted and we'll evaluate it going forward and determine based on how
inflation is coming at us, we'll react a lot quicker.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then I know this is a small segment, but it actually was, I guess, a meaningful margin overhang
this quarter. The other segment swinging to a loss despite mark-to-market gains. What drove that this
quarter? Is that something we should expect to recur? Or was it kind of unusual item?

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

I can -- Tom, it's Dexter. We had a sizable gain, I think, last year, and so -- in mark-to-market and that
flows through other and the gain to mark-to-market this year is smaller.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Yes. I mean even excluding that, I think you're looking at around a $15 million decline year-over-
year.

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

No, no, no. I have to look that up again.

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Yes.

Vice President of Investor Relations

But it's not that. It's much more than that. I mean, the details on that will come out of the K offhand, but
we'll circle back on this call to give you the answer on that, but we'll just look it up real quick.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So first, hoping to ask on some of the gross margin commentary burn that you just gave in your prepared
script. The 2022 gross margins coming in 500 to 800 basis points below your normalized range. And I
know that there was expectations that the first half of the fiscal year would have lower gross margins than
the second half when you reported back in July. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much that has
actually changed and what the increments to -- or the decrement to the outlook is this year on margins?
And specifically in terms of how that outlook has changed, how much is the potato crop at this point?

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for your question. The 500 to 800 basis points that we referenced, a lot of that is due to
the potato crop. So the things that I mentioned that has changed is we've got a worse potato crop than
we've seen in many years. There's a couple of things that we're doing, as I mentioned, in terms of SKU
rationalization and the product spec changes that we're doing, that we're hoping to offset some of that
impact on costs. But most of that is related to a poor crop.

And then the other thing that I mentioned is that we had previously anticipated the inflation would
gradually ease, and we do no longer expect that. So we've given the guidance of 5 to 8 points, but we will
come back in January, and we'll update that further depending on what we learn more about the crop as
we typically have done.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Right. So just to be clear, because there wasn't a similar kind of margin number framed back in July. What
-- how much did it change versus the outlook in July?

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Well, I think the outlook in July, we said we were approaching our normal margins, which is the 25% to
26%. And so now we are saying it's 5 to 8 points below.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I guess the second question is more of a conceptual one because clearly, these inflationary
dynamics are not easing. Is the goal not just to recover cost one for one, but actually to price for margins
as well? It's a very different item if we're thinking, okay, well, unit margins on a per pound basis go back
to pre-pandemic levels as opposed to percent margins in an inflationary environment go back to pre-
pandemic levels.

And I'm really also thinking as we go into calendar '22 and even your fiscal '23, the way some of these
input markets would be shaping up, it would seem like your contracted potato costs for next year are
going to be up a lot. And I'm just trying to think about conceptually, is it -- is the goal to price for unit
margins? Or is the goal to actually price for those percent margins?

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 07, 2021

Yes. So the goal is to continue to price through inflation and at levels we historically do. So that's number
one. Number two, the 2022 crop, I'll comment on that as we do -- as we get through negotiations on how
that's shaping out for the next crop year.

The good -- the thing I just want to remind to everybody is we're dealing with a challenging crop. There's
no question about it. And we'll work through it. We're focused on all the right things. The good news in
this business, we get started all over for the next crop. So we'll manage through it as best we can. We're
focused on all the right things. But as things start playing out, like I said to the previous questions, we'll
evaluate additional actions we need to take to price through inflation.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

Rob, it's Dexter. Can you hold off for a second? I just want to close off Tom's question on the other
product margin. Year-over-year, with reported basis, down 20%; ex mark-to-market, we're down 4%.
So as you can see, the biggest swing is due to the mark-to-market in this year and last year. And on an
operational basis, again, down $4 million. That's due to higher manufacturing costs and lower volumes in
our vegetable business. Sorry, Rob.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

No problem, Dexter. Great. I guess just first question, it sounds like upfront, you said demand is kind of
overall maybe around 5% lower than it was pre-pandemic, but maybe shipments are a little bit lower, just
kind of given all the supply chain issues. So as you then speak to trying to stabilize the supply to improve
the cost situation going forward, like how do you kind of view that shipment piece relative to demand?
Because demand seems strong, maybe you're kind of -- you're underperforming a bit relative to that
demand equation, but it sounds like there's obviously, good line of sight how to get there. So I'm just kind
of curious as to cadence for the year.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So this is Tom. The international business has been -- with the container shortages challenges on
the ports and the exports and even the containers coming in, we're essentially allocated a certain number
of containers. So we're managing to that level based on our freight partners. And every day is a little bit
different. So the team is doing a good job, making sure we're allocating the product to our key customers
internationally, but it's a challenge.

And on the flip side of that, that does -- as we look at our forecast weekly, we're managing the pile
on production and other customers domestically to ensure they're getting their products. So it's a
really dynamic situation with the containers and even the trucking and the rail and all those things. But
essentially, we're managing to what we can ship based on our allocation of containers, and that's what
we're dealing with. And as that frees up, and we get more containers available, that will help the exports
to our international markets.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then Tom, maybe just kind of a -- just a question on kind of broader competitive
dynamic. I heard some people say, maybe including yourself a bit, kind of given your geographic sourcing
focus, that maybe you might be in less of a kind of beneficial competitive position versus some of the
other larger processors. That being said, I've also heard some of the other processors say kind of not so
fast, just given where demand is and kind of where kind of the overall crop is coming in that supply in
general could just be short, right, not just for you.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 07, 2021

So just curious if you can provide any color, basically your perspective around kind of where you stand,
potentially in this environment relative to some of the other players that you're aware of in the market?
And then I have a quick follow-up.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Rob, it's a fluid situation right now because we're right in the middle of main crop harvest. So
obviously, we're -- we've got -- we're getting an early read, like I said, on how the quality and the
yields are. We really won't have a clear view until the end of this month on what the overall potato
yields, what that means, we have an idea. And I'd rather, as I do every year in January, give you a clear
understanding. So right now, it's -- we're just learning how the main crop is going to perform as we
harvest and how it's running through the plants, and we'll have more info on that in January.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then just a quick technical question. In the Foodservice division in Q1, price/mix
was up 1%. Obviously, there was some material deceleration relative to what we saw in Q4, which is likely
very mix driven. So just any clarity as to kind of how we should think about that going forward on the mix
side, just given the delta Q1 -- sorry, Q4 to Q1?

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. A lot of that -- this is Bernadette, Rob. A lot of that is mix driven. And then what we see in the
Foodservice side is we're not going to see a lot of those pricing increases effective until second quarter
and then more in third quarter as we discussed. But then again, too, we are seeing increases in our
noncommercial segment in first quarter relative to fourth quarter. We're now 70% to 80% there. So a lot
of it is mix. Changes in branded products.

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

And then last year, Q4 was such an anomaly because that's the first quarter that was really impacted by
the pandemic. And a lot of the -- with perspective, we saw a lot less branded product during that quarter
as inventories were destocked.

Operator

And we'll go to our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I seem to remember at one point, having a conversation around -- and correct me if I'm wrong, about
back many years ago when it was like the worst potato crop anyone in the industry sort of could
remember, it was sort of like a $25 million hit to EBITDA for Lamb Weston at the time. And I may be off
on that. But I'm curious if there's any way -- and it might be tough to do, but to dimensionalize what kind
of an impact to EBITDA specifically sort of this crop is likely to have on EBITDA this year? And maybe
it's just too early to do that. But do I have that data point right and would this crop be worse than the
one previously that was the worst that anybody in the industry had seen? I'm just trying to get some
perspective on that.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Andrew, I think the -- how you framed up what we talked about on the 20 -- the worst crop
historically was $14 million, so your numbers around $25 million to $30 million are right. And secondly,
Andrew, it is too early to frame it up in terms of what the overall financial impact is going to be. And what

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 07, 2021

I will say is it's worse -- this crop is going to be worse than the previously worst crop ever. So the financial
impact, we'll put some guardrails around it in January as we get it harvested, and we're running it through
the plant and we understand what we're dealing with.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. And then I guess as we -- I think a lot of us certainly knew that even from the fourth
quarter call that there was going to be a lot of pressure points and sort of pain points on the cost side for
a host of reasons in fiscal '22. And then it was really all about just like sequential improvement as you
went through the year. And obviously, that will take a little more time now.

So I'm trying to think out if we just think ahead for a minute to fiscal '23, and just maybe if you play out
the sort of the potential sort of puts and takes, what are the things that in theory could be more positive?
Where are some of the things that maybe you still don't really have a lot of clarity on? So in other words,
you're clearly putting a lot of pricing through, potentially could put more through. There's always a little
bit of a timing lag, but one would think that's going to certainly better help you get a lot closer to where
your costs are. I'm trying -- I'm struggling with like the labor piece. And are you making progress on that?
Is it just slow?

And I'm trying to get a sense if some of these negatives can kind of bleed into '23. Or is there a reason
that there could be a pretty dramatic bounce back in operating margin and gross margins in '23? Like
do the next 3 quarters give you enough time essentially, to figure out some of these issues? Or frankly,
are some of these thorny enough that they could go beyond that? Even if you don't think there's some
structural reason "longer term" to not get back to historical margins?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Andrew, I am 100% confident over -- we don't have any structural issues in the company. And
everything you're poking at, we are focused on addressing labor challenges, we're aware of that, made a
number of references of what we're doing differently, and we're seeing progress. It's just slow going. The
thing that will take time is even within our supply chain and our suppliers' supply chain, it's disrupting our
production and driving inefficiencies in our plants that we're doing a number of things to address that as
well. And from last summer to now, it's just going to take more time.

We are seeing progress. It's not as fast as we -- any of us want. But as I think through the next 3
quarters, where we will be a year from now, with the things we're doing in the company in terms of
addressing inflation, adjusting how our supply chain -- we're focused on our supply chain differently,
some of the actions we're taking. And a year from now, we're in a new potato crop, and that's going to be
hopefully back in average normalized levels. We will have a certain amount of probably inflation over that
time that we'll address. But everything we're doing, it's going to take time, Andrew. And the category is
very healthy.

And so we're preparing for it to -- with a number of capacity investments that we're doing right now. Our
long-term strategy is sound. It's just we're going to be a little choppy in the near term, but the things
we're doing operationally, I'm 100% confident it may take more time than any of us want, but we're
addressing all the right things.

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

And Andrew, I was just going to add that the portfolio optimization that I talked about, that's just going
to benefit us even more into fiscal '23. And then the increases in productivity around a lot of those cost
reduction programs, around Win As One, again, that should just continue to gain momentum into fiscal '23
as well.

We'll take our next question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 07, 2021

Peter Thomas Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe just to piggyback off of Andrew's question there. I guess, Bernadette, as we're thinking about some
of the things that are within your control, some of the SKU rationalization and cost savings, just -- is there
any way to kind of help us frame how much of that 500 to 800 basis points of normalized margin that
you're losing this year? Like how much could that potentially make up as we start to think about a more
normalized year for fiscal '23?

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So the way I'd answer that, Peter, is a lot of the decrease that we've explained in terms of the 5 to 8
points, that's taking into consideration that SKU rationalization and the spec modifications. So the impact
of the crop is what is significantly decreasing our margin estimates. And then we are looking to get some
gains on that to get to the 500 to 800 basis point decrease with the SKU rationalization and product spec
modifications. Otherwise, it could have been even greater without that, is the way I would explain it.

Peter Thomas Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then I guess just as we're thinking about the second quarter, I think
you had mentioned kind of sequential gross margin improvement. Can you just dimension maybe a little
bit more how you're thinking about that?

And Tom, I know you talked about on-premise or foodservice kind of in August being impacted by Delta.
But just how did September trend? Was it materially better or worse? Or kind of the same?

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So for second quarter and the sequential improvement that we're expecting to see there, generally,
our lowest margin quarter is our first quarter. And even though the crop is not what it has been in the
previous years, we are going to get some benefits in the second quarter of running out of field and not
having to move those potatoes to storage before we start running those through.

And then additionally, these other actions that we're taking in terms of further SKU rationalization, we're
going out with our second round of those. And then the product spec changes, we're expecting to see
some benefit from that and should see an increase from Q1, which again is our lowest margin quarter
historically.

Peter Thomas Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

And Tom, anything on September?

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

And the pricing. Absolutely. We'll definitely see the benefit of pricing. And I'm sorry, Peter, was there
another follow-on question that I missed?

Peter Thomas Galbo
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes, sorry. Just on kind of Foodservice, Tom had talked a bit about the softening in August, but just was
curious if there was any early takes on September or even the first week of October?

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

It's similar to August.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's pretty similar to August. I mean, it's softened a bit, but it's kind of leveled out.

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And what I'd say there, Peter, is that, that foodservice demand is there, and we are seeing just
difficulty in some respects in making sure that we can provide that product, given the lower throughput
that we're getting through the plants.

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

And the logistics.

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

And logistics issues.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Matt Smith with Stifel.

Matthew Edward Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I just had a question for you. In addition to the margin headwind, I believe you mentioned volume growth
may be tempered by the challenges you're seeing in global logistics and supply chain disruption and the
potato crop. Is that potential volume weakness reflected in your guidance calling for sales growth above
your long-term targets?

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, that has been included.

Matthew Edward Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then is the potential impact from the potato crop, should we think of that more as a second half
event as you run some older potatoes with the poor quality?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it will definitely be in the second half, it will start manifesting itself.

Matthew Edward Smith
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, is there -- can you talk about how you can mitigate the impact of
that as we look forward to the first half of next year? And I'll leave it there and pass it on.

Bernadette M. Madarieta
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Matt, as I referenced, the way we're looking to mitigate that is with some of our product spec
changes and the other things that we are doing by working with our customers.
