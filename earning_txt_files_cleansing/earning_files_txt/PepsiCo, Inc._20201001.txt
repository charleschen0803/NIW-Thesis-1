Operator

Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's Third Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator
Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.

It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr.
Pamnani, you may begin.

Ravi Pamnani
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and
prepared comments, both of which are available on our website.

Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements
on today's call, including about our business plans, 2020 outlook and the potential impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and only
reflect our view as of today, and we are under no obligation to update.

When discussing our results, we may refer to non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items from
reported results. Please refer to today's earnings release and 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions
and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a
discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.

Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and
CFO, Hugh Johnston.
[Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.

PEPSICO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 01, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.

Dara Warren Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Hi. Can you hear me?

Hugh F. Johnston
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

We can.

Dara Warren Mohsenian
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay, great. So with the better-than-expected results here in Q3 and for full year earnings guidance, we're
likely to end up with a pretty solid 2020 earnings result, all things considered, post-COVID. So I know
you won't guide explicitly for next year, but just trying to understand at a high level, do you view 2020
as a depressed earnings result and sort of a depressed earnings base that we should see outsized growth
off of as we look out to 2021, particularly as COVID costs drop off? Or is your bias more to reinvest any
assumed drop-off in COVID cost?

And perhaps you can just discuss some of the key puts and takes potentially looking out to 2021 relative
to what's obviously an abnormal 2020?

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Okay, Dara. Yes. Listen, we're very happy with the quarter and how our investments are starting to deliver
in terms of, I would say, a global market share improvement and sustained top line acceleration, and also
how some of that is flowing down to the bottom of the P&L, as you saw in our EPS numbers.

In terms of your question of are we going to keep investing or not? I think you know our philosophy.
We've been trying to have sustainable growth for the business, top line, bottom line, very balanced in
that respect. I think there are continuous reinvestments required in terms of brands pivoting into new
spaces or new capabilities required because of the new ways consumers are shopping, especially around
the omni-channel transformation. There are sustainability reinvestments required.

So we're going to continue to run the business in a very balanced way, right? Where we're going to flow
to the bottom line along the lines of what we said a couple of years ago when we defined our high single-
digit ambition for EPS long term. And -- but makes sure that we don't sacrifice the reinvestments that are
required for a company of our scale to remain competitive long term, given what's going on externally.

So that's how we're thinking about the business. Obviously, we'll give you more information in February.
We'll know more about how the pandemic evolves, the costs that will still be required to run the business.
I would not be assuming at this point that the pandemic cost will go away by next year. I think we'll
continue to have to put some costs back into the business to run the business safely.

So more in February, but I just wanted you to get the philosophy, how we're thinking about the long-term
reinvestment in the business and the delivery of our EPS on a yearly basis.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I hope all is well. So you spoke on the resilience of the business in developed markets and the recovery in
beverages, in particular in north America and also in Europe. So I was hoping if you can elaborate more,
Ramon, on the trends for the on-premises with the reopening. And how are you planning your price points
in places in emerging markets where the recession may be hitting more, the consumer?

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Andrea. Good. Yes, listen -- yes, I can give you a bit more color on the away-from-home business.
It has rebounded from the very lows of April, May, right? It's better. There's more mobility. There's more
traffic in some channels. I would say there's a lot of innovation in a lot of the customers. So they're
adapting to the new reality. Especially, restaurants and some entrepreneurs are finding ways to adjust. But
still is a very big drag in our business, I would say in the levels of 30% to 40% versus year ago, negative,
still in most of the developed markets.

So still a very negative. It's better than the minus 60s, 70s that we had in the April, May. But I'm sure it's
going to be improving, right? We see some channels still hurting a lot, like hospitality or entertainment or
transportation. Those are still very low. We see some other channels improving, and we're obviously going
to lean into those channels to capture most of the growth. So that's the first part.

On the second part, Andrea, the -- yes, we see developing markets, especially, I would say, Latin America,
parts of Africa, Middle East, starting to feel the economic challenges for a lot of the households. So
people are starting to -- there's a bit more unemployment, and there's obviously these possible income
challenges for many families. We tend to do well in those circumstances. We can adjust our price points
quite fast, and we have good playbooks on how to play in recessions, how to adjust entry points to the
category, how to deliver good value on some of the family sizes that are now preferred as well.

So I think we're going to do okay. We tend to do okay in these situations. But yes, there is, I would say
Latin America and Africa, Middle East, signs of economic challenges for many households.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Lee Herzog
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I had a question on your FY '20 guidance, which implies that organic sales growth should, I guess,
modestly accelerate to, I think, around 5% in Q4 versus the 4.2% you reported in Q3. But then when I
think about your full year EPS guidance, that implies EPS growth in the fourth quarter will moderate a fair
amount to around -- or from the 9% that you're reporting Q3 to around 3%. So I just really wanted to
understand how conservative your guidance might be, especially as I think about you facing maybe even
fewer COVID-related headwinds as you round out the year.

And then maybe you guys could touch on what that assumes for A&M spending in Q4. I guess it could
assume a pretty big step-up and maybe put pressure on your margins, but drive an acceleration on your
top line. So any color there would be helpful.

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Hugh, you want to cover this one?

Hugh F. Johnston
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

Yes, happy to. A couple of things. Maybe you and Ravi can talk a little bit. My math is a little different on
the top line for Q4. I think it lands somewhere in the mid-4s based on the implied full year backing into
Q4.

PEPSICO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 01, 2020

And in terms of the margin implications, probably the biggest factor in all of it will continue to be the
COVID cost. We mentioned that we had about $150 million worth of COVID cost in Q3, and that will
continue to some degree in Q4 as well. And it's a bit of a longer quarter in that regard.

In addition to that, you know that our A&M spend is booked on a curve. And as we get into the fourth
quarter, the curve will be affected by the full year A&M spend. So I think it's a bit more of a drag in Q4
than it was in Q3. So nothing beyond those things, nothing in terms of other big, notable costs, other than
higher A&M and COVID costs that will continue based on what you've seen so far.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Wanted to ask a question about PBNA and good sequential improvement in the third quarter. And I guess,
Ramon, what I'd like to understand now is, now that you've got an energy drink -- a more comprehensive
energy drink portfolio, can you elaborate a little bit more on some of the things you're going to do to
potentially, I guess, take advantage of this situation? You've got a largely company-owned bottling
system. You've got the resources to spend. So are there opportunities to begin to accelerate market share
from here?

And then maybe if you could just touch on, in the third quarter specifically, were there any market share
issues or any issues with out of stocks relative to maybe can shortages or packaging?

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Yes, good question. Listen, when we talked about PBNA about a year ago, we said we're going to try to
go 1 step at a time trying to fix all the different opportunities we had with the different brands, right? And
the truth is that Q3 is a good reflection of that effort that the team has done over the last year, 1.5 years.
If you look at every one of our large brands, is accelerating. So Pepsi is growing; Mountain Dew, good
growth; Gatorade, good -- very good growth, I would say; our coffees, our teas, our juices are growing
double digit. So very good performance across.

We've then -- with regards to the energy integration, as you can imagine, there's a lot of small details,
right, in -- operational details in integrating a business like Bang, which is quite sizable, and trying to
move it from a very dispersed distribution setup to a more consolidated one. So in every state, we have
different anecdotes, and also the ROCKSTAR integration. So I think the team has done very good job in
terms of both the integration. Now we're starting to run it as a full business.

So to your question on the future, I think we're going to continue to double down on what I think has
driven the success, which is very good innovation, right? So if you think about all our Zero innovation, it's
doing very well. Gatorade Zero, massive innovation; Mountain Dew Zero is doing very well and starting to
bring new consumers into the franchise, younger consumers that we had not been very successful with, so
we feel good about that. Pepsi Zero growing very nicely. Then obviously bubly continues to do very well.

So we'll continue to double down on innovation as a lever. We'll continue to double down on execution and
becoming a better operating company. So I think the changes we've made to our organization to more
of a division structure is giving us more granularity and more local excellence, if you wish, in terms of
execution. We're going to double down on that.

The energy portfolio gives us much more scale in the convenience channel, which was a -- some sort of
a weakness for us. And so we're improving in that channel. If you see the market share in convenience
stores in the summer, great progress. So we're happy with how we're doing in that respect. So we'll
continue with the playbook. It's working for us. Now we have 1 more set of tools in our arsenal with this
energy portfolio.

PEPSICO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 01, 2020

We're happy with the way Gatorade is working. We're seeing a lot of more people exercising. It's a good
trend. We like it, that people are exercising at home. People are embracing daily routines of exercising.
That helps the sports drink category and obviously Gatorade as a leader in that category.

So we see a lot of positives for growth in the portfolio. And then we're happy with Mountain Dew.
Mountain Dew Zero has been a great addition to the team. And it's -- I mean, it's getting scale and it's
getting very good trial, very good repeats and is very incremental to the brand.

So I think you will see, I think, that sustained performance in PBNA. And hopefully, we can yet improve
our market competitiveness as we go along.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I just had a quick clarification question, and then my real question. Ramon, I was hoping you could just
clarify your comments around the COVID-related costs, in saying that you expect them to stick around
in 2021 or beyond this year. I just wanted to see if you can just clarify how much of it actually, out of the
total pool of COVID costs, do you actually think will stick around?

And then my actual question is just on Pepsi Beverages North America and its margin profile. So
margins today are 400, 500 basis points below the peak. So I'm just trying to understand how you're
philosophically thinking about the migration of that margin back up to kind of where they used to be. I
mean, is this something that you want to really see happen quickly? Or do you think it will be a much
more of a measured pace? Any thoughts around that would be helpful.

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. On the COVID cost, my point is, I don't know how the pandemic will evolve, but I think it's
going to be very likely that we still have to be very careful and keep our people safe for a large part of
the year next year. It's not going to be as much as what we had this year, especially at the beginning. I
think we're getting better at this. We're finding more effective ways to run the business under this difficult
circumstances. But there's going to be a -- still some inefficiency and some additional cost because of
COVID. So that was my point.

With regards to the PBNA business and the shape of its -- the portfolio and the profitability. Obviously, we
want to get back to at much higher levels. The speed of the transition to the higher levels will depend on
our success to drive market share and to drive efficiency on our -- especially S&D and supply chain, which
is where I think we have more of the opportunity.

So we have a sense of urgency in all these, in becoming a better-performing top line company and in
improving the efficiency of the business. As you can see from the Q3 results, it's a good performance, but
we're not going to sacrifice the long term for the short term. So we're going to continue to invest in our
brands, make sure that they're well funded, that we'll continue to keep our consumers in our brands, keep
them engaged. We innovate with well-funded innovation, and that we invest in data. Especially, data and
infrastructure investments are required to pivot to the multi -- the omnichannel world that we're living.
And we're not going to sacrifice those investments for an accelerated profit improvement. But you should
see profit improvement in PBNA going forward.

Hugh F. Johnston
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

Ramon, if I can just add to Nik's question a bit on the COVID cost. Nik, to build on Ramon's answer a bit.
Obviously, up front, there were sort of 2 implications. One was around taking reserves around potential
losses due to customers exiting their businesses, particularly in the food service area. And then the second
piece of the cost is personal protective equipment and sanitation and things like that, which is more

ongoing. In Q3 and Q4, those numbers are sort of landing at about $150 million or so. Depending on the
course of the pandemic for next year, obviously, we're going to need to continue to protect our people. So
those costs, obviously, will continue until we get to a point where we have a different outcome from the
perspective of the virus.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.

Lauren Rae Lieberman
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

You touched a little bit on your ability to move quickly in emerging markets to adjust pricing in a
challenging macroeconomic environment. I was curious, number one, the degree to which you've already
started to make those moves. Because in some of those markets, the price/mix is a little bit below what
I'd modeled, but volume was a bit better. So I was curious kind of to what degree we've already started to
put that playbook into place.

And then from a longer-term perspective, Ramon, I think 1.5 years ago, when you first started
communicating with The Street about your longer-term plans, you talked about the need to broaden out
the portfolio in international snacking into the value tiers, and that's where kind of your share performance
wasn't quite what it could be. So I was curious if you've made any progress on that front. Of course,
knowing COVID kind of interrupted business as usual, but I was curious about any progress there as well.

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Yes, yes. It's good. No, listen, I think international is probably the biggest opportunity we have long term,
right? I mean, the per caps in both our beverages and our snacks still very low. And we see that as our #1
driver of future value for the company. So that's a big focus for us. We think the levers to drive per capita
consumption, affordability clearly is a big one for us. And we continue to make progress on adjusting our
cost structures to the different market realities. And that allows us to have much more flexibility on the
price points and on the -- then what we decide to do with the different levels of tiering of the market.

So the big enabler, if you want, for being a really affordable product, and that would drive per caps, is our
cost structures. And I think we're making great progress on adjusting a lot of the levers of that at the NR
-- the cost, be it in the supply chain, be it in the G&A, be it in the selling and distribution. So I think we're
making great progress on adjusting the decisions we make on supply, delivery and management for the
different realities in the different developing markets. And that's driving affordability. That's driving, as you
were saying, volume increase, even in a situation where a lot of those markets are suffering. Obviously, a
lot of small stores are still closed.

And there's a lot of adjustment to the COVID reality in many of those markets from the consumer and
customer point of view. But our strategic intent continues to be that one, reduction of costs, adjustment
of the price points and continue to invest in the brands and the innovation that will drive the per cap
development in international.

Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Can we talk a little bit about Quaker? And if we should be thinking about Quaker differently long-term
in that right now, obviously, it's benefiting from the environment that we're in. But is there anything
happening there that might suggest trends could look different on a run rate basis for that part of your
business?

PEPSICO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 01, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Yes. Listen, a couple of things there. Number one, we are gaining penetration in a good way with Quaker,
most of the segments in the Quaker business, in these last 6 months. So we've gained penetration. We're
investing to retain those new families and obviously to increase frequency in the -- it was a pretty large
penetrated brand, it's not a small penetrated. So make sure that consumers kind of reconnect with the
brand; and with the transformation we've made to the portfolio in the last few years, eliminating artificials
or making the product, I would say, more forward-looking products. So I think that work is in motion,
and I think consumers are voting that they like our products, and we're gaining share in many of the
subsegments of the Quaker family.

Now going forward, our assumptions, and -- but it's still to be validated with future -- we need to see
where the consumer really ends up. I think there's going to be more cooking and eating occasions at
home going forward. And especially, we think that breakfast, there will be at least 1 or 2 more occasions
at home every week because I don't think we're going to go back to work in the same way that we used
to. And that's our assumption at this point.

Obviously, we can be right or we can wrong. But if you judge by how, in developed markets, everybody
is thinking about their return to the offices, I think it's going to be a much more flexible environment, a
much more tech-enabled remote kind of work where consumers will be at home a few days of the week.
And that will drive, I think, a different behavior in terms of breakfast consumption and potentially some of
the other mills during the day, especially lunch.

So that's how we're thinking about the long-term category growth, and we're trying to position ourselves
to compete well in that new environment, where there should be more occasions for our products.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.

Robert Edward Ottenstein
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

First, just a clarification of your prerecorded tape, in which you said you expect the U.S. to be fairly
steady, but international being somewhat choppy. I'm wondering if you could tell us kind of what you
actually saw in September in international markets to drive that.

And then my main question is you put out now some very interesting direct-to-consumer businesses in
the U.S. Realizing that they're very small today, but can you talk about what you're learning from those
in terms of the consumer behavior, habits and innovation, and how you expect to use those direct-to-
consumer channels in the future.

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The direct-to-consumer models, as you're saying, is more of an attempt for us to stay closer to the
consumer, read them, understand reaction to early innovation, and then obviously take it mainstream
into the balance of the channels. It is still, as you're saying, very embryo-nary, smaller percentage.
But we're getting good insights, and we plan to obviously scale them up a little bit and get better at
reading consumers early, test and learning with our innovation. And also improving the way we segment
consumers. We have prototypes with consumers that we can innovate and talk to in our communication.
So that's the journey going forward.

In terms of the COVID in international, as you read around, there is an increase in COVID cases in
especially Europe, I would say. They had managed to control the pandemic pretty well. Now September,
they've seen a number of cases going up. The way we're seeing governments managing the situation so
far is with local restrictions. When that happens, the business gets a little bit impacted, but not as much,
obviously, as it was during the April, May, more dramatic restrictions on people mobility.

PEPSICO, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 01, 2020

So we're not seeing the business being impacted much at this point. That doesn't mean that as the winter
comes and there is -- if they have -- the governments have to take more restrictions, that the business
may be a little bit more impacted, especially on the away-from-home and some of the more capital
channels.

So far, we haven't seen that. And we're seeing the governments making very -- a bit more balanced
decisions between keeping the economy going and trying to protect everybody against the spread of the
pandemic. So that's the situation, especially in Europe, as we've seen the situation evolving there.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Ramon, when you think back to the original faster, better, stronger framework that you laid out early
last year and the investment priorities that you laid out alongside that, I guess I'm curious just to hear
whether the experiences of 2020 have altered those priorities at all. I'm interested whether there are key
things that have been permanently accelerated or added new to the mix versus other things that maybe
have been deprioritized even if only temporarily.

And I guess related to that, maybe this is for Hugh. Just -- I just note that CapEx for the year is about
the -- is now coming in about $1 billion lower versus the original outlook when 2020 started. And should
we consider that simply a deferral? Or have you found efficiencies to more structurally reduce those
investments?

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

That's good question. Listen, I think we're happy that we had that framework going into this pandemic,
right? Both the PepsiCo ways with very clear behaviors for our people, it has helped us a lot in managing
through the pandemic, especially when we have now a more kind of empower organization, making more
decisions in the front line. And they have a very, I think, good framework, clarity on what's expected, and
I think that's helping us perform.

In terms of the 3 vectors you were referring to, the faster, stronger, better. We're happy with the faster.
Clearly, we're becoming more competitive in the marketplace. As we look into the future, I think we're
going to have to probably go more after drivers of share because categories might slow down a little bit.
So I think innovation brands, execution will play a very high role in trying to capture that market share.

When you look at the stronger, we had some -- obviously, it was part of the agenda to invest in becoming
a much better omni-channel company, right? So e-commerce was big, supply chain flexibility was big
to enable that omnichannel. Obviously, I mean, the -- what's happened, you saw the numbers, the
penetration of e-commerce or e-grocery has just accelerated by 3 years. So what we had forecasted to be
3, 4 years from now, it's happening now. So that is a big focus of the organization. How do we accelerate
the pivot into the omnichannel much faster? Which means that we're going to have to up some of the
capabilities that we have.

I think we've made great progress in how we deal with consumer data and how we have much more
performance in marketing, we're improving a lot of those capabilities, creating internal content. All that
is happening on the flexibility of the supply chain as well. I think we were lucky that we made a lot of
investments in additional capacity last year, and that's helping us this year big time and helping us to have
more flexibility. So good progress there. I think we need to pivot with more of a sense of urgency.

The other area where we're doubling down is what we call holistic cost management. Holistic cost
management was a capability we had. But clearly, we need more of that in terms of being able to
repurpose money from one part of the P&L to another part of the P&L., and where we have inefficiencies,
get rid of those inefficiencies to reinvest back we're going to get the best ROI in terms of growth and flow-

through. So that capability, I think we've made good progress. That's another area where we're putting a
lot of emphasis.

On the better side, I would say the social consciousness, I mean, the need for becoming much more of a
social company -- not social company, but social-aware company, both in terms of the environment and
the inequalities, I think has also increased given the pandemic. So you saw we increased the foundation
funding. We're also quite focused on improving all our environmental footprint.

So those are areas that, more than changing the trajectory, is more a sense of urgency to get them done
earlier as the consumer and society is expecting us to, I think, go faster in those areas.

Hugh F. Johnston
Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Steve, to finish off on your question around CapEx. Clearly, there's some element of timing as
COVID's made it more difficult to execute capital projects. But I would also tell you, we spent a lot of time
and energy around identifying new low-cost sources of capital and doing things in a much more efficient
way. That clearly is going to benefit the level of spending going forward. So in terms of specifics, more to
come in February. But I would tell you, we are getting more efficient with capital spending.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.

Kevin Michael Grundy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. Congratulations, guys. Great results so far year to date. Ramon, question for you. We've covered
a lot of ground. I did want to ask you about your openness to moving into the alcohol space, specifically
hard seltzers. So as you know, the category has been growing rapidly. You've seen Coca-Cola's launch
here with Topo Chico in Latin America recently. They plan to launch in the U.S. next year with Molson
Coors. There's also discussion that Monster and perhaps some others, non-alcohol players, may be moving
into the space.

So I was hoping you could comment on your openness to moving into hard seltzers. Is this an area
that PepsiCo is looking at? How much time are you spending internally? And then maybe some of the
governors that may be in place around that possible decision.

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Yes, welcome. No, listen, our focus today, 100% focus, is getting the energy strategy right. Right, in terms
of executing that. I think, as I said earlier, it's a multi-vector strategy that requires both ROCKSTAR doing
very well, it requires to do a great job with Bang, it requires innovation in Mountain Dew to move into that
space and then do a great job with Starbucks. So those 4 big pillars, that's taking a lot of our focus, and
that's going to be our priority, right, especially 2021. And I think you will see great progress in all those 4
front.

Now obviously, we look at every opportunity, right, there is in the industry. And a couple of years ago, it
was CBD, now it's more alcohol. So we get a lot of opportunities in front of us. Of course, we're looking at
all of them, and of course, we have people that are thinking more long-term versus the very immediate
2021. So we're reflecting, we're thinking what are the best options, and we will make decisions in the
coming quarters whether this is an area where PepsiCo wants to play. And then more importantly, how do
we capture a lot of value of this opportunity? Given the 3-tier system, it's not obvious how you capture a
lot of value.

So there is a -- first, I would say, do we play or not? Second, very important, is who do we play with and
who do we partner to maximize the value for PepsiCo?

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.

Laurent Daniel Grandet
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Ramon and Hugh, and despite the current environment, definitely a strong quarter. So congrats to the
entire team. A lot has been covered, so just a clarification maybe on PBNA results. Strong results in the
quarter, especially as the economics in there continued to suffer. So maybe you could help us reconcile
the difference between what we are seeing in Nielsen from your reported numbers. So could you tell us
how big now is e-commerce and on-premise channels for PBNA and the growth you are seeing in those 2
channels.

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Laurent. I mean, there's been quite a discrepancy always between the Nielsen numbers and the full
performance of PBNA. So I would not go into the details of what is each channel. Obviously, e-commerce
is booming and e-commerce is large. But there's much more than e-commerce between the final, I would
say, results of the company and what Nielsen covers in its review sample. So that's as much as I can say.
There's obviously away from home. There's many channels that are not well covered, including some, I
would say, organized channels that are not well covered by Nielsen.

Our final question will come from the line of Bill Chappell of Truist Securities.

Grant Blandford O'Brien
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

This is actually Grant on for Bill. Just a quick one on Frito and the competitive dynamics in that space.
You had a fairly large regional competitor that is now public and talked about some geographic expansion
opportunities across the U.S. So wondering if you guys have seen anything different so far in the
competitive dynamics or pricing in that space, or if you would expect to maybe over the next couple of
years. I know there's been a focus on share and holding share, gaining share in this call. So wondering if
that would change your strategy or their strategy going forward.

Ramon Luis Laguarta
Chairman & CEO

Yes, great question. We like -- obviously, our category is savory, and there's a lot of people that like it
as well. So it's obviously driving new entrants from people that were not playing in savory and people
that were playing in savory and have extended their ambitions to play beyond their original geographical
limitation.

So I think we welcome competition in that sense. To me, the more competitors, the more investments in
the brands, the higher -- the larger the category becomes. That's my experience globally, and I think it's
everywhere in the world. So we welcome players to the arena. Players that -- they play with the levers
that I think develop the category, which is advertising, innovation, better products. Those are the levers
that develop a category, and we welcome anyone in the business.

It's hard to compete with freedom, right? Given the advantages that the company has, the scale of the
brands, the distribution systems, the cost advantage, everything else. So it's not easy to compete with
Frito, but I think it's good that we have multiple competitors, and that develops a category.

That was our final question. Are there any closing remarks?
