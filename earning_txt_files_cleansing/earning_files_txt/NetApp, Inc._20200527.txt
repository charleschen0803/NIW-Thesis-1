Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get into the results of
the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented situation we are all experiencing.
First and foremost, I want to express my sympathy for those who have been impacted by COVID-19 and
my gratitude to those frontline workers whose efforts help to keep us healthy and safe.

I also want to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work that the NetApp team has done to coordinate
efforts around the globe to keep our teams safe, while going above and beyond to be a strong partner
to our customers. NetApp is an essential business providing critical infrastructure to vital public health
and safety services, first responders and public sector institutions in battleground cities. We've increased
our level of support for them so that they can stay focused on their critical missions. In partnership, with
Core Scientific, we are giving COVID-19 researchers, free access to AI as a service powered by ONTAP AI
and NVIDIA. We are also helping customers rapidly build virtual desktop infrastructure environments to
support their growing remote workforce and to help continue the education of our younger generation,
our cloud solutions have been rapidly adopted in the last few weeks alone by many new state, local and
education customers to support VDI for telework and remote classrooms. I'm so proud of the commitment
and courage the NetApp team has demonstrated to each other, to our partners and customers and to our
communities. My sincere thanks for all these fantastic efforts. They are representative of NetApp at our
very best.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 27, 2020

Now let's turn to the results of the quarter. We continue to make progress in improving our operational
execution. By focusing on what we can control, we delivered strong gross margin, cash flow and operating
leverage in Q4 despite the challenging environment. The quarter started off well and we were tracking
to our targets until countries around the globe began going into lockdown. In April, the pace of business
slowed significantly and our visibility was reduced. We saw delays in some large deals, while at the same
time, some companies accelerated orders to get ahead of shutdowns and others initiated new transactions
to address the demands of remote working and digital business. Over the course of FY '20, I've outlined
our plan to get in front of more buyers and more accounts with our industry-leading portfolio where we
know we can win. Our continued success in our dedicated acquired districts reinforced our decision to
maintain the investments to expand our reach, despite the current market uncertainty.

In Q4, we achieved our target of adding 200 primary sales head count, 1 quarter ahead of schedule. This
additional sales capacity has enabled us to close coverage gaps and to dedicate resources focused on new
customer acquisitions. As a reminder, we funded this head count by making trade-offs in the business,
not by adding to the company's total operating expenses. Additionally, we continue to sharpen our focus
on markets, where we have both a significant presence and clear competitive advantage, our storage
and cloud data services businesses. Our file, block and object storage systems have strong industry and
market endorsement from customers, partners and analysts. We've made our solutions easier to consume
with Keystone, our reinvention of the customer experience. Keystone gives companies a real path to
hybrid multi-cloud IT by delivering a consistent experience and subscription business model, in both the
biggest public clouds and in company's data center.

We made tremendous progress in our cloud business in FY '20. As I noted last quarter, we achieved
general availability on all the leading cloud providers. NetApp Cloud Volumes is the #1 shared file storage
platform available in all the public clouds. Our intellectual property is embedded in every region and data
center that Microsoft, Google and Amazon Web Services bring online. We were again named Google Cloud
Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure. Azure NetApp Files is Microsoft's shared storage platform
for primary workloads, SAP, high-performance computing, database, Windows Virtual Desktop and the
Azure VMware service. Azure continues to be a good source for new customer acquisition, with more than
40% of Azure Netapp Files customers being new to NetApp.

Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications and
invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business.

Based on the last month of Q4, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to
$111 million. We saw growth accelerate through the quarter as we continue to scale our cloud volume
service and more companies turn to cloud to rapidly meet the requirements of remote working and digital
business. We are adding new cloud customers and additional data services such as cloud backup and cloud
compliance, which are helping to drive new workloads and increased usage amongst existing customers.
And we continue to bring more value to the Cloud Volumes platform.

In the past 2 months, we acquired Talon, a provider of file caching software for remote and branch
office workloads and CloudJumper, a provider of a virtual desktop in the public cloud. We've added these
services to our cloud offerings to deliver a comprehensive, modern workplace foundation for all companies
from born in the cloud startups and small businesses to the largest global enterprises. We are excited to
include these talented teams in the NetApp family.

As we enter into FY '21, we will continue to manage the business efficiently while focusing on 2 clear
priorities: returning to growth with share gains in our storage business, powered by our industry-leading
file, block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated cloud data services business. We will
exploit competitive transitions and the accelerating shift to cloud to expand the usage of our products and
services.

We will continue to simplify the customer experience by bringing cloud-like flexibility to on-premises
environments and deepening the connections between on-premises and cloud, and we will continue to
strengthen our partnerships with the cloud providers and add value to our cloud data services. All of
which will make it easier for customers to manage data in the hybrid multi-cloud environment and drive

preference for our technology. We will also continue to evolve and align our sales and marketing to capture
the opportunity ahead.

We recently announced that Cesar Cernuda will join NetApp in July as President, leading sales, marketing,
services and support. Cesar has an impressive track record in leading transformations, building diverse,
high-performing teams and driving a successful cloud business. He will continue to evolve our go-to-
market strategy and operations to transform how we capitalize on the changing customer landscape to
drive growth, particularly in cloud.

Entering FY '21, we created a separate globally integrated structure for our cloud data services sales
teams with the sole focus of scaling our cloud services business by maximizing our partnerships with the
world's biggest public clouds and helping our customers and partners accelerate their public cloud journey.
And as I noted earlier, we have closed coverage gaps with expanded enterprise sales and dedicated
customer acquisition teams to further strengthen our position in the storage market.

Data has always been central to the work we do. And the role of data is more important now than ever
before. The resilience of our society and of our financial, governmental, educational and health care
systems depends on the reliable, safe and flexible access, storage and management of data. That is our
mission. CEOs are prioritizing the ability to deliver services and products remotely to reach customers
through digital means, and to optimize remote operations and collaboration. It is critical to have an
integrated IT architecture, especially for data.

With our Data Fabric strategy, we help customers tackle these challenges by modernizing legacy
infrastructure and simplifying the integration and orchestration of data services, so that they can rapidly
respond to a changing environment and fuel innovation. While we cannot predict when the world will
return to normal, the enduring importance of data is clear. We are confident that the demand for our
products and services will be strong as we emerge from this crisis. The strength and resiliency of our
business model enables us to continue to execute our strategy while navigating a range of demand
environments. We will continue to make prudent decisions in the face of the current reality, focusing
on the priorities that will enable us to return to growth. We will also maintain operational discipline
and ensure that our strong balance sheet will support our ability to create long-term shareholder value
through a wide range of scenarios. We are focusing our resources on the solutions that lead to the highest
returns, storage and cloud data services. We are broadening our reach with a dedicated cloud sales focus,
expanded enterprise sales coverage and dedicated customer acquisition resources.

I'm confident that these actions position NetApp to emerge from the current health crisis stronger than
ever.

We will host an Analyst Day on September 16, where we will share more information on our plans for the
continued evolution of NetApp and a multiyear business outlook. We hope that you'll be able to join us.

Finally, I'm happy to introduce Mike Berry, our new Chief Financial Officer. I'm excited to have Mike and
his deep knowledge of the technology and software industry on the team. He will be a key partner as
we strengthen our leadership position in hybrid cloud data services and deliver long-term shareholder
value. Mike's first day coincided with our local shelter-in-place order. Despite the unique start, he's quickly
integrated into the company and is already making an impact. Mike, welcome.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, George, and thanks for that wonderful introduction. First, I also want to express my sympathy
to all those who have been impacted by the current health crisis and extend my sincere gratitude to
the selfless frontline workers who put themselves in harm's way to help keep us all safe. The COVID-19
pandemic has made for a very interesting first 60 days for me at NetApp. But the unusual circumstances
have only reinforced my initial views of the strong NetApp culture. I have been very impressed with the
quality of the team and the level of collaboration and commitment across the entire organization. From
Day 1, it has been clear that this team is all pulling in the same direction with a high level of transparency
and accountability and a tireless determination to continue serving our customers across the globe. When

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 27, 2020

you couple this with NetApp's business model, loyal customer base, go-to-market engine and product
development, we are positioned to do great things in the future.

Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to George and the entire Board for giving me this
opportunity and to Ron for his help during my unusual onboarding. I am extremely excited about joining
NetApp and look forward to working alongside George and the rest of the talented team as we continue to
drive innovation in data management.

In the current environment, it is important to highlight NetApp's solid liquidity position and business
model. NetApp's healthy balance sheet and considerable free cash flow generation provide us the ability to
make strategic decisions that are best aligned with long-term shareholder value.

This is particularly critical in times of uncertainty. We closed Q4 with $2.9 billion in cash and short-term
investments. As of year-end, we also had approximately $500 million available through our credit facility,
and we are confident we have access to the corporate debt market, if needed.

Our strong liquidity position has allowed us to provide extended credit programs to our channel partners
during the health crisis.

Given this is my first call as NetApp's CFO, I wanted to walk through how I view capital allocation. Our
strong liquidity position and the fact that we generated roughly $1 billion of free cash flow last year, allow
us to remain committed to our dividend, which now carries more than a 4% yield. In fiscal '20, we paid
out nearly 50% of our free cash flow to dividends.

In the current environment, we believe it is prudent to pause our share repurchase program, which we did
in late March until we have a better sense for the timing and magnitude of the broader economic recovery.
Longer term, share repurchases will play a key role in our capital allocation strategy with the goal to have
buybacks at least offset dilution from our equity plans.

Consistent with NetApp's long history of disciplined M&A, our acquisition strategy will remain focused on
bolstering our strategic road map, particularly within our cloud data services business. Of course, all of
these uses of capital will be balanced against reinvesting in the business for future growth.

Before going through our Q4 and fiscal 2020 results, I would like to remind you that I will be referring to
non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Despite the demand weakness, logistical challenges and minor
supply constraints as a result of COVID-19, we delivered strong gross margins, healthy operating leverage
and substantial free cash flow in the fourth quarter.

In Q4, net revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 12% year-over-year, including nearly 1 point of currency
headwind. It is worth highlighting that our 2 key strategic focus areas, our storage business, powered by
our industry-leading file, block and object software and cloud data services, both performed considerably
better than the rest of the business. Our all-flash revenue of $656 million was down 3% year-over-year.
We continue to believe that there is a very healthy runway for all-flash adoption as only 24% of our
installed systems are all-flash.

Cloud data services delivered $111 million in ARR, growing 113% year-over-year and an impressive 34%
sequentially. Cloud data services customer count now exceeds 3,500, more than doubling from Q4 of last
year.

Total product revenue of $793 million decreased approximately 21% year-over-year. ELA revenue in Q4
was less than $10 million. Given that ELAs represent such a small portion of our business, we will not be
breaking out ELA revenue in future quarters. As you know, over the last year, the timing and magnitude of
ELAs has proven extremely difficult to predict. In an effort to have a more predictable forecast, be more
conservative, and reduce confusion, we will not be including ELAs in guidance going forward.

Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $546 million was up nearly 4% year-over-
year. These 2 recurring revenue lines comprise roughly 40% of total net revenue.

Going forward, we will focus a lot more on our high-margin recurring revenue streams, where renewals
play a big role in growth.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 27, 2020

I have been incredibly impressed with the work the team has done around renewals, implementing a
much more rigorous sales motion and simplify quoting system. We ended Q4 with $3.7 billion in deferred
revenue, an increase of 1% year-over-year.

Gross margin of 68% was up nearly 3 points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 56.4%, an
increase of over 1 point year-over-year.

The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by an increase in all-flash product mix. The
combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services continues to be an incredibly
profitable business for us, with gross margin of 83.2%, which was up 1 point year-over-year.

The margin expansion was mainly driven by continued leverage in our support model.

Q4 operating expenses of $629 million decreased approximately 8% year-over-year driven by lower
variable compensation associated with the shortfall in revenue. Operating margin was 23.1%, up more
than 0.5 point from Q4 of last year.

EPS of $1.19 was down 2% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $383 million, and free cash
flow was $359 million, representing 26% of revenue.

During Q4, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $49.50 for a total of $161 million.
As of the end of Q4, we have $478 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization.
Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 222 million, down 27 million shares year-on-year,
representing an 11% decrease.

During the quarter, we paid out $105 million in cash dividends. We will maintain our cash dividend of
$0.48 per share in Q1.

Turning to our full year 2020 results. Net revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 12% year-over-year, including
0.5 point of currency headwind. Gross margin of 67.9% was up nearly 3 points compared to fiscal 2019.
Operating margin of 20.8% decreased nearly 2 points versus fiscal 2019 due to lower-than-anticipated
revenues. EPS of $4.05 decreased 10% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $936 million in
fiscal 2020, which represented 17% of net revenues.

We completed $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $439 million in dividends in the fiscal year. And over
the last 3 years, we have returned $5.4 billion to shareholders.

Now on to guidance. As you all know, demand visibility has been significantly impacted by COVID-19. As
a result, we are not guiding the full year at this time. We will reassess our ability to provide fiscal 2021
guidance after Q1.

With that as a backdrop, we did think it was important to provide boundaries to the demand scenarios we
are seeing in the near term. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.09 billion and $1.24 billion,
which at the midpoint, implies a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year, including 1.5 points of currency
headwind. We expect consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin
to be approximately 10%. Assumed in this guidance are Q1 operating expenses of $660 million to $670
million. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19% and expect earnings per share for
Q1 to range between $0.36 and $0.44 per share.

As a reminder, Q1 has an extra week this year, which adds approximately $30 million to $35 million to
both our recurring revenues and total operating expenses for the quarter. The incremental revenue and
expenses largely offset each other at the operating income level and thus have minimal impact to EPS.

A quick comment on our go-forward expense structure. As George highlighted, we invested in our go-to-
market engine by adding 200 primary sales resources over the last 3 quarters. And we did this without
adding incremental dollars to our operating expense envelope. At this time, we have decided not to make
any significant structural changes to our expense base until we have better visibility into the duration and
magnitude of the current downturn. We continue to closely monitor the situation, which will likely remain
very fluid over the next 2 to 3 quarters.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 27, 2020

As we look forward to fiscal 2021, I did want to highlight 2 key strategic goals for the year. Our cloud
connected all-flash portfolio continues to offer customers a unique architecture that bridges on-prem and
public cloud environments under a singular ONTAP software platform. While the shape of the economic
recovery will largely determine the overall growth rate for the storage industry, our goal for fiscal 2021 is
to reestablish share gains in the storage market.

In the coming year, we will also continue to grow and invest in our cloud data services business. Fiscal
2020 was a foundational year in launching both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Volumes Service across
AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. We also acquired 2 great assets in Talon and CloudJumper, expanding
the breadth of our cloud data services platform and adding nicely to our overall cloud TAM. We remain
confident in cloud data services unique market position. Partner and customer feedback has only
reaffirmed our confidence in the size of the opportunity. But to be prudent, we thought best to reset
expectations around the ARR ramp. So we are removing the fiscal 2021 target for cloud data services ARR
of $400 million to $600 million. We will provide new guidance and trackable metrics for our cloud data
services business at our Analyst Day in September. Fiscal 2021 will serve as a critical growth year for the
cloud data services franchise, which will be aided by a new dedicated cloud data services sales force.

In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their continued support. And a
special thank you to the NetApp employees for stepping up during this global crisis. It is clearly a unique
time to be joining NetApp. I see real opportunity to add value as our business continues to evolve, with
the clear goal of driving significant long-term value for our shareholders.

As George noted, we are planning to host an Analyst Day in September, which will provide a great
overview of our strategic initiatives and include an update to our long-term financial model.

I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?

Kris Newton;VP, Investor Relations
Thanks, Mike. We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just
1 question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.

Bala Raghav Reddy
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

This is Bala Reddy on for Rod. Could you give us some color on demand trends that you are seeing across
different geographies? And maybe color on how the order trends have been in the past 4 weeks in this
month, and I got a follow-up.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think if you look across the geographies, the order trends somewhat followed the impact of COVID
across the world. I think our Asia Pacific business was first impacted by COVID, particularly in the areas
surrounding China. I think we've seen that part of the business come back online. Through the course of
the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, we felt that we were on target until the impact of COVID
started to broaden across the globe and we saw several different things going on. Some customers pulled
forward transactions so that they could deploy and be ready before the shelter-in-place took full impact.
Others clearly either deferred transactions or downsized transactions. Our supply chain performance
was strong, thanks to some really good work done by our supply chain team. And so we were able to
meet most of the orders that customers wanted within the course of their requirements. From a vertical
market perspective, as I said, we cover a broad range of industries. And so there's no single geography or
industry that has a material part of our business. I think that when we look at the results from the quarter,
financial services and health care were strong performers. Automotive, retail, meaning traditional retail
and oil and gas were weaker through the course of the quarter. And similarly, oil dependent economies
were challenged through the course of the quarter.

Bala Raghav Reddy
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Maybe some color on how the trends have been in the past 4 weeks in this month?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think as I said, there were -- we had less visibility into order trajectory in the last 4 weeks than in the
first couple of months, the periods of the couple of months of the quarter. I think as we look into the --
where we are today, there isn't material change from that, which is why we are being cautious about
providing guidance a quarter at a time. I'm trying to be cautious in the commentary around our guidance
itself. Mike, do you want to add anything?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP & CFO

No.

Operator

Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 27, 2020

I wanted to see if maybe you could help bridge the gross margin guidance. And maybe there's a volume
aspect or cost aspect. But I guess, fundamentally, I would believe that we'd see services increasing in
the mix, they have good gross margin, and maybe that's what's throwing me. On-premises, the mix shift
should help gross margin. So I'm wondering what the offset is?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Simon, it's Mike Berry. So if you look year-over-year, that's exactly what you do see.

I would always encourage you because of seasonality to look year-over-year as it relates to gross margin.
So when you look at total -- the slight increase, we -- you get a little benefit in Q1 year-over-year
from the 14th week. So you have to take that into account. But then the higher mix of services at 80%
plus drives the total gross margin up as it relates to year-over-year. And again, seasonality will have
a significant influence, if you look sequentially, and that's just not as applicable as the year-over-year
numbers.

Simon Matthew Leopold
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then just as a follow-up, you did mention financing available for some of your partners. And
I have the perception NetApp has been less vocal on financing for customers than some of the large IT
peers. Just wondering if maybe you could elaborate on how you may be adjusting your financing program
to help customers and not just your channel partners?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

We have a broad range of capabilities to meet customers' needs for OpEx kinds of business models and
cash preservation concerns. They range, of course, from cloud data services which are available on all the
leading public cloud platforms, and we saw several customers take advantage not only of the flexibility
that the cloud data services portfolio had, but also the rapid time to provision. We have introduced a
program called Keystone, which is a subscription offering for enterprise data centers. And we saw some
strong wins in that part of our business as well as a healthy pipeline.

And then clearly, we work with partners through managed service offerings, which are typically on a
monthly basis payment model. And we have third parties we work with around traditional leasing models
for customers. I'm happy to have Mike comment further.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, I think there's 2 parts what George walked through as well as just giving extended terms to some
of our channel partners as they deal with our end users, and our financial flexibility also helps us there,
Simon.

Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I was hoping to talk about the cloud data services a little bit. Numbers do look like some acceleration in
the quarter. Just curious about the kind of the pulling the longer-term guidance. If we could just get some
color around why maybe the uptake has been a little bit slower. It does seem like you've hit most of the
GA targets at the big players and the move to cloud, obviously, is accelerating, as you highlighted in the
quarter. So maybe just give us a little bit of color as to why you think has that been just a more difficult
sell to customers or harder for the sales force? If you can just give us some color on what's affected the
slope of that curve?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

First of all, we feel even more bullish today about the demand for our offerings than we did a year ago.
I think that over the last year, as Mike mentioned, we have added a substantial number of customers
more than doubled our customer base, and there are a lot of net new customers coming to NetApp. We
have, as we mentioned, been a year behind where we needed to be in terms of getting the services to
general availability. And we still have -- we are still working to get through a completely frictionless sales
model together with Microsoft, for example. So there's really good work being done. We are expanding
the number of use cases. We've got more data centers being deployed, but we are about a year behind
where we felt we would be, and that's been our consistent commentary even in the last quarter. I'll let
Mike comment with regard to the guide.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Tim. So as George mentioned, we feel really good about the business. Nice growth in Q4, sequential
growth. So it doesn't reflect us, not our confidence level. As he mentioned, we're a little bit behind where
we were when the original guide was done. And I would like to be able to address that as well as kind of
the long-term model all at once in September. Hence, we didn't want to update it now and not do the rest
of the business. So that's why we said, hey, we will address all of that as it relates to the business when
we get together, hopefully in person or virtually in September.

Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.

Matthew John Sheerin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Just following up on the cloud data services and the fact that you saw a fairly big chunk of new
customers adopting that platform. Is there a cross-selling opportunity in terms of those customers
adopting on-premise hardware and services from you? Or is that a different customer base?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

There's clearly a set of those customers, who have never bought anything from NetApp, some of those
customers are truly digital natives, meaning they don't have the concept of an enterprise data center.
And there, the cross-sell and upsell is for the vast majority of those customers. We have a very narrow
slice today of their total cloud wallet, meaning in terms of workloads, and we can expand there. Many
of the customers also have enterprise data centers and so our discussions with them are, obviously,
"Hey, if you're going to use us on the public cloud, why couldn't you be able to deploy us in your data
center?" I'll give you an example. There's several large global companies who have us as a second vendor,
not the primary vendor in their enterprise data center, but we are their primary shared platform in the
public cloud. They are now giving us a broader range of opportunities in the enterprise data center. So
as the COVID crisis abates and we see enterprise data centers being expanded, we'll see more share of
footprints, at least that's our confident belief.

Next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.

Kathryn Lynn Huberty
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

George, we're obviously in an unprecedented period of disruption at the macro level, but you are
advantaged by a strong balance sheet. So would love to get your thoughts as to whether there's an
opportunity for you to press your advantage and perhaps make some larger investments or do more M&A
than you have in the past that come out of this period stronger?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Katie. I think when we look at the overall profile of our business, we have, as you mentioned,
a really strong margin profile in terms of gross margins, reflecting the rich software contribution to our
business. I think as Mike mentioned in terms of capital allocation, we are going to continue to support the
dividend at the current level going forward. The place where we will have to reevaluate that is if we see
some structural impairment to our free cash flow, which we don't see at the moment. So we're going to
continue to stay with the dividend. We have hit a pause on the buybacks. We've done a lot of buybacks
over the last a couple of years, almost $3.5 billion. And so we're going to pause that until we have better
visibility into the overall landscape. And we are going to be selective, but we continue to see opportunities
to expand our strategic relevance and the portfolio, like you mentioned. So we're going to continue to
balance all of these cases. I would tell you that as we think about the go-forward strategic road map, it's
much more tied to software and cloud services. We're not leaning towards doing horizontal consolidations
for scale. I think that, that would not be a primary focus for us.

Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.

Steven Bryant Fox
Fox Advisors LLC

George, I was wondering if you could just sort of talk about how you're going to approach some of the
vendor incentives you're providing against the backdrop of having so many industries with uncertain
demand. How do you sort of make sure you're deploying that capital correctly without maybe unnaturally
pulling forward revenues?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think we have a good handle on the customer discussions that we are engaged in. As I mentioned, one
of the areas that we invested in without raising the overall operating expense level of the company was to
put primary demand generation account executives facing customers. So we have a good, close dialogue
with these customers. For those that want to be able to take advantage of technology without having to
deploy large amounts of cash, we are uniquely positioned in the market because of our cloud data services
portfolio. They are instantly provisionable. They have the reach and scale of the world's biggest hyperscale
data centers and in many ways, also allow customers to start their journey on the cloud. That will be
our lead offer, right? I think with regard to subscription services and other use cases, we are selective. I
don't think we're trying to say that at this point in time, that we are going to transition our entire business
over to a subscription model. I think we need to have that in our portfolio, and we'll have it, but we are
selective about qualifying which customers we provide subscription offerings to.

George Michael Iwanyc

George, expanding on your comments on the sales additions, can you give us a sense of the 200
additions, how they're ramping the productivity and maybe how trends have been in North America?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I'll tell you that, as we said, we were going to bring on 200 primary demand generation head count,
starting from the beginning of Q2 of FY '20 through the end of Q1 of FY '21, which is the current quarter.
We have accomplished that objective a little bit ahead of plan. We are in the process of enabling those

sales head count. I would tell you that they typically, as we have said before, take 3 to 4 quarters to get
up to full productivity. And we feel good about the work they're doing so far.

I think that we've also said that we would focus them on new customer acquisition, some on cloud, and
clearly on the strongest places in our portfolio, which is our all-flash arrays and our object storage. And
they have seen good results in the second half of this year. So as we have started to deploy and focus
these resources, we are starting to see some good underlying trends in the business.

Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Yes. I wanted to focus on public sector. First, just a clarification and then a question. I'm pretty sure public
sector includes health care, but just to clarify that. And then secondly, what are you seeing in pipeline? I'm
particularly interested health care with regards to elective procedures impacting their budgeting cycles?
And then within SLED, maybe the tentative budgets with higher ed, government revenue issues. Just focus
for a moment, if you would, on the public sector for me.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

Not all of our health care business is categorized as public sector. Certainly, there are pieces of it like
university hospitals that are in public sector, but not the whole business, right? I think if I look at health
care overall, there were -- we had a lot of customer wins because of the strength of our solutions for
digital imaging, the advancements that we are doing with NVIDIA around AI for imaging, and there are
lots of unique technologies in our ONTAP operating system that enables that type of workflow to be really
successful.

The second is with regard to the health care customer base, we've also stepped up our support for them.
I think they are highly stressed at the amount of work. So I don't think there was any sort of budgetary
issue we saw. It was really just the capacity of work they are doing to sustain their patient levels and sort
of the level of work that their sort of patient-facing workforce has. I think that's really about health care.

With regard to the public sector, again, we have a broad book of business covering both federal, state
and local government and education. Within education, we saw several customer wins around the rapid
movement of that part of our world to a remote working, remote education model. And so both our private
cloud solutions and certainly, our public cloud modern workplace solutions benefited from that move. I
would tell you that visibility is -- it's choppy, right? It's across the board. It's a little choppy. I think in our
public sector business, we had a couple of deals that did not close within the quarter just because of the
logistics of being able to try to bring teams together to close the transaction.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

And then as far as the guidance, that's captured in the guidance across all 3 of those?

George Kurian

That's correct.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 27, 2020

George, you mentioned your sales force ramping, which is quite impressive, which is good, ahead of
plan and stuff like that. I'm just wondering, in the COVID-19 environment, which nobody anticipated,
does it make it harder or still the same to regain share and the efforts? I'm thinking about you, you
have all the new persons hims and hers in place. Are they able to start now out there cracking into
some new companies and new market shares? Or does this -- congratulations you're ahead of plan, but
the coronavirus makes it a little harder to keep knocking on doors and getting new design wins. Just
wondering about how will you sort this all out because it seems like you're really ahead of plan now.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think that if you think about the coronavirus as an opportunity to disrupt, you can lean into these
conversations with customers, right? One of the things that we see with the use of remote working tools
is that our sales teams can bring the best of NetApp to any customer anywhere in the globe. Meaning
they can bring the CEO now on any given day to a discussion in Asia, Europe and North America, all
in the course of a single day. That wasn't possible in the old world, right? So we are trying to lean into
the changes. As I said, we feel good about the progress of our acquired districts, which was a key place
that we were targeting some of our head count. Even in Q4, they had good performance. We have been
focused on the cloud business as a place to continue to ramp our success that had good results. And I
think that, as you should expect from us and as we have demonstrated over the past several years, we
are disciplined operators, right? So if we don't see a return on that investment, we'll certainly look to do
something else with it. And so you should expect Mike and I to stay focused on the evolving nature of the
market, and we'll adjust accordingly.

Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Crédit Suisse.

Matthew Normand Cabral
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Given the softer demand environment, I'm wondering if you can talk about if you've seen any changes in
terms of pricing or other competitive behaviors since the middle of March?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

No, I think that the strong gross margin profile of our business is reflective of both the discipline of
our sales force as well as the differentiation of our products. I think we have an extraordinarily good
technology portfolio. As I said, in the storage business, we have the leadership position, not second,
not third, the leadership position in file, block, object technologies, which is the full range. And we have
uniquely differentiated cloud data services. So yes, the market is always competitive. But I think that as
we have demonstrated over several quarters now, product gross margins continue to be an area of focus
for us. We have incented the sales force to stay disciplined around discounting and you saw that through
the quarter, and we're going to take it a quarter at a time and keep staying disciplined around that. Mike,
do you want to add?

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 27, 2020

As you look at how you've been able to get your people to work from home with COVID-19 and you don't
have to be giving guidance here, but do you see any long-term changes that you will make this actually
something more permanent? And then in the long run, would that actually change some of your cost
structure, either for some of your real estate or anything else? Any thoughts here would just be interesting
and helpful.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think, first of all, I want to thank the NetApp team. I'm -- I could never have been more proud than
what I saw from our team this past quarter. Across the board, we started our planning to deal with the
COVID crisis in January when we first saw the impact in China. And as a result, our working from home
has been pretty seamless on everything from engineering deliverables to the incredible work that our
support team and our supply chain teams have done. We have, for the most part, been able to operate
without disruption.

I think the place that we are continuing to focus in on is the ability to engage customers through a digital
medium. And I think that we are new to it just like everybody else, right? But we see opportunity there. I
think with regard to the long-term model, it's a little bit early to tell.

I think we are certainly cautious about returning our workforce to the office. I think we're going to do it
step-wise with the priority being the safety of our employees. And so we see that it will be a hybrid model
with a large percentage of our employees working at home or other flexible locations of their choice. And
we'll factor that over time as it settles into what the new normal looks like. We're certainly going to factor
that in over time into what we can do to best serve our employees and customers.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP & CFO

And on that, Lou, it's Mike. I would just add to George's point, it's all about making sure our employees
are safe in dealing with it now. As you look forward, companies have a lot of areas to look into, be it
real estate, be it travel, marketing events, what does that mean for the sales team. But I think it's way
too early for us to be able to tell that. We need to figure out how this goes over the next, call it, several
months or quarters. And then a lot of companies will be asking those very questions.

Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Two follow-ups. George, with 4 consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline in all-flash array, do you
think the worst is behind us and we should see a rebound? And hopefully, year-over-year growth sooner
than later, and I have a follow-up.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

It's difficult for me to give you specific guidance, given the volatility of COVID. I would tell you that our All
Flash FAS business, which is the predominant part of our all-flash array business, has started to perform
much better as we have driven focus and as we have driven enterprise sales coverage. That doesn't show
the overall all-flash array number yet, but the trends underneath the all-flash array numbers are much
healthier than what the overall number shows. So we're encouraged by that. And I think we're going to
stay focused, as we've said, on exploiting our position there and getting it back to growth.

From an installed base perspective, it is still a small percentage, right? So all-flash installed base is at
24%. So we've got a long way to go. And so we're going to stay focused on using all the levers at our
disposal to gain share.

Sure. Great. And I have a follow-up. It seems to me that certain aspect of work from home is going to be
permanent with us. And in that context, virtualization or VDI is going to be in secular demand. You have
recently made an acquisition here, how should I think about this specific sector and how do you expect
that to grow for you? There has been a lot of emphasis on all-flash array, cloud data services. But I think
you're doing something in VDI, and I want to hear more, and maybe you can quantify it for us.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

Yes. As part of our cloud data services portfolio, what we said consistently is we're going to get the
fundamental infrastructure into all the major hyperscalers, which is our Cloud Volumes platform. We were
then going to add data services on top of that, and we've added several organically built backup and data
protection services.

We've done cloud governance and compliance services. And now what we are doing is we are building
out a modern workplace solution that combines a global file consolidation solution that we acquired in
Q4 called Talon, and a virtual desktop infrastructure and desktop as a service solution provider called
CloudJumper that we acquired in Q1 of FY '21. The combination of cloud volumes Talon and CloudJumper
gives us an extremely strong offering in the market, and it's particularly suited to the broad transition of
virtual desktop services to what we see as Windows Virtual Desktop, which is a new offering created by
Microsoft to enable customers to have much more efficient virtual desktop infrastructures on the Azure
cloud. And so you'll see us tell you more about that in the coming quarters, but we're really excited. And
we saw some significant customer wins. CloudJumper had been a long-standing partner of NetApp, and
we have worked together with them to do many cloud deals before and now that they are integrated into
NetApp, we think that, that should accelerate our business further.

Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Market.

Nehal Sushil Chokshi
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats on what I think is a good quarter given the conditions. On the high end of the guidance, that
appears rather bullish, where product revenue goes from negative 20% in the most recent quarter to
probably around flattish year-over-year. So what are you seeing that underpins this rather strong uptick in
that year-over-year growth profile?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Nehal, this is Mike. So a couple of things on that. Keep in mind that in revenue mix matters a lot.
We do get the 30% to 35% from the extra week that's in the revenue number. So if you look year-over-
year, take that into account. And then in Q1, because the product revenue from a seasonal perspective is
lower. This is where the strength of our recurring revenue comes in as well. So that helps us also on that
range. So that's really how we got to that call it, high end of the guidance range, really driven by the mix,
the strength of recurring revenue and then the benefit from the 14th week.

Nehal Sushil Chokshi
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. So then the follow-on there is on the low end of the guidance. Does that embed a deterioration in
the macro?

Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

On the cloud data services, what sort of incentives do you have for customers that have adopted cloud
data services to increase your NetApp consumption on-prem? And also related to that, I think CDS and
on-prem buyers within the same customer, 2 distinct departments. Can you talk about how and if the
sales cycle of cross-selling on-prem systems to CDS customers is different, if at all?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I don't think -- first of all, some of the CDS customers are acquired through Microsoft. And so incentives
that are provided to those customers are really provided by Microsoft to deploy those workloads on the
Azure cloud, right? I think with regard to cross-selling them to an on-prem environment, it really is
more of a relationship and a customer confidence discussion rather than specific kind of incentives --
commercial incentives. I'll give you an example. We are certified to run SAP on both the Google cloud
as well as the Azure cloud. And many customers use -- are starting to use SAP on those cloud provider
platforms with NetApp, they may not run their entire SAP environment on those clouds. They may run a
portion of it, for example, analytics or business intelligence or something like that. And so we get to go
and tell them, "Listen, you're using SAP on Azure on NetApp, and you like the technology and the benefits,
why wouldn't you use us for your transaction processing environment on-premise?" So it's more of a
relationship and a customer confidence and awareness benefit we get than specific incentives.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. Just if I can sneak one more again, I think it's important. You talked about moving to a frictionless
sales model, especially with Microsoft. Can you please elaborate a little bit on that?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

Today, we have, given the importance of the workloads that we serve, these are production environments
that we support in customers. We have what we call whitelisting requirement with Microsoft. So there's
essentially, the customer has to register with a Microsoft website that then creates a manual provisioning
step where NetApp has to call the customer and make sure that, that customer is ready to go live. I think
as we have scaled the business we are working closely with Microsoft to remove that requirement, so that
we can automatically provision workloads onto NetApp Cloud Volumes. And we're looking forward to that
when that happens. There's still work to be done, but both teams are working actively to remove that
requirement.

We've always been pretty disciplined about the uses of cash. We're going to continue to do that. I think
where we do acquisitions, we are very selective. We spend a lot of time to make sure that both strategic
and cultural fit as well as financial benefits to our shareholders over time. So we're going to continue to
stay disciplined on acquisitions. I think with regard to the cloud portfolio itself, the vast majority of our
cloud revenue today is through organic development.

We feel that we have taken -- unlike anyone else in the industry, taken the world's best storage and data
management operating system, made it cloud-enabled and integrated it into every major data center of
the world's 3 biggest public clouds. And not only that, 2 of the big 3 are actually selling it as their own
service. And that has been the big amount of work we've done. Now that, that foundation is in place and
starting to scale, we are following a pretty disciplined set of chess moves to add capabilities to it. A large
number of those capabilities are organic, and then we'll be selective about inorganic.

approaching your sales force initiatives and your enterprise customer expansion initiative? Would just love
any context around that and how you guys are thinking about that.

We clearly see COVID-19 accelerating a set of transitions in the market. I think the most important one of
those is the digital transformation of our customers. And that digital transformation is highly data-driven,
right?

You cannot be successful in digital transformation without modern data infrastructure, and that creates
opportunity for us. There are a series of market transitions that follow from that, right? There's operating
system transition. There is major database migrations going on. And of course, there are competitive
product transitions, there are technology transitions like the 10K replacement cycle. We're going to
attacking those transitions. So we've been pretty laser-focused on getting our teams to focus on our
strongest product offerings and we are working to attack those market transitions and be as productive as
we can. And we've seen good results from that in Q3 and Q4 net new customer adds, and we're going to
