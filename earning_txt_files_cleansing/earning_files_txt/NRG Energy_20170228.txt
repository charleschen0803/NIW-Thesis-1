Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in NRG
Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer
Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations
Before I turn to our presentation, I would like to acknowledge Howard Cosgrove and Ed Muller for their years of service as directors on the NRG board
I want to thank them for their dedication and wish them well in their next endeavors
Let me also congratulate our current Director, Larry Coben, on his appointment as Chairman of the Board
I'd also like to welcome our two new board members, John Wilder and Barry Smitherman
I look forward to working with both of them on all of the exciting opportunities ahead for NRG
2016 was a pivotal year for our company
Just one year ago, I made a commitment to simplify our business, strengthen our platform and restore confidence in our direction and decision making
We have made significant progress on all fronts
Today, NRG is in a much better place to continue executing on our multiyear strategic plan to solidify our position as the premier integrated power company in the country
Let's move now to slide 3, where I'd like to summarize the key highlights from today's call
First, we delivered on our numbers
Our track record of strong results and execution continued in 2016. We had our second best safety performance year on record and our integrated platform delivered earnings that were even stronger than last year
We grew both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth despite the difficult commodity price environment that reduced our total generation by 14% from 2015. Our Retail business delivered its third consecutive year or EBITDA growth with a record adjusted EBITDA of just over $800 million
NRG's best-in-class platform has again demonstrated its ability to provide strong, stable results despite challenging market conditions
For these reasons, I'm also able to reaffirm our 2017 financial guidance
I want to thank all my colleagues for a job well done on a very successful year
Second, we executed on our priorities
Our focus over the past year in simplifying and streamlining our business resulted in over $0.5 billion in cost reductions
We made progress in repositioning our portfolio by selling assets at value, and executing several capital projects on time and on budget
We strengthened our balance sheet by reducing corporate debt by $1 billion and extending $6 billion of debt maturities well beyond 2020. Last, we reinvigorated our strategic partnership with NRG Yield by putting in place a dedicated management team and expanding our Renewables business and ROFO pipeline
Third, we're not done yet
As we closed out the first phase of deleveraging, cost cutting and business optimization efforts, we now turn to the next phase of our plan
We're in a much better position today to benefit from market opportunities than we were one year ago
But before discussing details of our 2016 results and 2017 plans, I want to remind you of what underpins our continued strong results and sets NRG apart from others in the industry on slide 4. NRG's differentiated business model is simple and focuses on our competitive advantage; the integration of Generation, which includes Renewables and Retail
This integrated platform and the touch points between these primary businesses allow us to capture operational and commercial synergies in a way that makes the whole of our business greater than the sum of its parts
NRG's unique value proposition centers on stability
Our diverse portfolio minimizes our exposure to market and fuel-specific downturns, while our diverse business lines create a stable base of free cash flows, particularly the natural hedge between Retail and Generation
In 2017, we're estimating the three-quarters of our gross margin will come from stable sources, such as retail, contracted assets, including NRG Yield, and capacity revenues
We have built a business that is not dependent on commodity prices to deliver strong results, but that remains well positioned to benefit from upside in a commodity market we cover
As we manage our business for stable, visible free cash flows, we maintain the ability to grow and quickly replenish capital
We achieved these through our strategic partnership with NRG Yield, which serves as another unique differentiator of our business and is an important driver of our ability to participate in the growing Renewable segment
Turning to slide 5, I want to reiterate my belief that the competitive power sector is in a period of unprecedented disruption
Changes in fuel mix, consumer preference, technological innovation and increased distributed generation have put pressure on the traditional IPP model, particularly as commodity markets continue to weaken
While sufficient at the outset of competitive markets, I believe the IPP model is now obsolete and unable to create value over the long term
On our fourth quarter call last year, I highlighted the six elements that I believe are now required to succeed in the competitive power sector
These, starting with excellence in operations and execution; diversification, both in terms of Generation portfolio and business lines; and a scalable platform for growth
NRG was already strong in these three areas and the results achieved throughout the past year further confirm this assessment
So, our focus turned to the remaining three attributes
First, we needed to ensure that we were operating a platform efficiently
This meant simplifying by focusing on our core Generation and Retail businesses and divesting from non-core and underperforming businesses
Furthermore, we focused on reducing costs, taking over $0.5 billion out of NRG's total cost structure
These combined efforts have greatly strengthened our business compared to where we were one year ago
The remaining attributes required implementing a more flexible, transparent approach to capital allocation and achieving a more resilient capital structure given the sustained low commodity price environment
As a result, we refocused a substantial amount of our capital to deleveraging in 2016, freeing up additional capital by adjusting our dividend policy
Importantly, we also changed the way we allocate capital for growth by refocusing on projects that offer high returns and quick paybacks
Going forward, you can expect the same discipline we brought in 2016 to be applied to the next phase of execution
And I will continue with my philosophy of no head scratchers when it comes to understanding how we allocate capital
And with a focus on the new Business Review Committee well aligned with our strategic priorities, we look forward to its role in our review process and the continued execution on the three priorities outlined here
Turning to slide 6, I'd like to provide you more detail around our cost reduction initiatives and the next phase of our plan as we move into 2017. I am very pleased to report that not only have we already achieved our $400 million total cost savings target, we have exceeded it, reducing our total cost by $539 million compared to our 2015 baseline
Reducing our cost was not just the focus of management, but a focus of all employees throughout our organization, and I am very pleased with the progress we have made to date
My promise to you was to not only hit our targeted cost savings, but to report our savings in a way that was more transparent and held us accountable
The left side of the page is a view of our total cost structure, sales and marketing, G&A, O&M and development
As you may recall, last year we combined all of our cost savings initiatives under one comprehensive program, but you can still track individual items in our 10-K disclosures
With our current target met and exceeded ahead of our initial timeframe, we continue on our focus on streamlining and optimizing our business
We are already working on our next round of forNRG cost-cutting initiatives
But given the scope of the Business Review Committee, it is appropriate to delay a public announcement of the new set of targets until later in the year
Now turning to slide 7, as I discussed earlier, the breadth and scale of our platform is a clear competitive advantage
But I also understand that it can complicate the ability to properly unpack our cost structure
The objective today is to help further simplify the investment proposition by enhancing the visibility into our cost structure
While I will discuss the highlights in the slide, the full detail behind these numbers can be found on the appendix of today's presentation and will map to our 2016 10-K disclosures
As I'm sure you're all aware, comparing costs from one company to the next can be challenging
So before I get into detail, let me put more context around this analysis
First, given the business and technology diversity that drives our integrated platform, benchmarking NRG's consolidated cost to those of a pure IPP is simply not correct
So, in our disclosure, we have isolated the cost structures within each of our reported businesses as a means to compare our cost to appropriate peer companies
Second, costs are somewhat fungible between different categories
And even within the small competitive power group, there are notable differences in cost categorization
To account for this difference, it is important to capture these combined costs, both expensed and capitalized, to fully appreciate a company's baseline cost structure
Now, going into the detail on each of our segments
In Generation, I want to remind you that our current Generation business is the result of consolidating four generation companies over the past five years, NRG, RRI, Edison Mission, and Mirant
And during this time, significant cost synergies were realized as part of the integration efforts
This discipline continues today, and on an adjusted basis, our Generation segment carries a total cost of almost $50 per kilowatt, a number that is slightly lower than that of our closest peers
For this business, we focus on $1 per kW metric given that a substantial portion of our fleet in the Northeast is reliability focused, capturing significant capacity and scarcity revenues, while generating a lower number of megawatt hours
In addition, to maintain comparability, we have backed out cost associated with our nuclear unit ownership that NRG is the only competitive power generator with this higher fixed cost, lower fuel cost technology
While our generation cost per kW are in line with our peers, we're continually focused on driving further cost savings by improving upon efficiencies in fleet operations and asset optimization efforts
Next on Retail, with nearly 3 million customers, most of whom are residential customers located in Texas, NRG operates the leading residential retail platform in the country, and the stable margins from Retail are an important driver of our free cash flow each quarter
Our Retail business maintains a relentless focus on meeting evolving customer needs and on continuous improvement, which have driven expansion of both our customer base and earnings
Benchmarking cost in Retail is difficult given the differences in customer, product and regional mix from one company to the next, and because other retailers provide little visibility into the breakdown of their cost structures
Finally, moving to Renewables, as I highlighted earlier, Renewables are a pillar of our growth and portfolio repositioning
Today, NRG, together with NRG Yield, has one of the largest renewable energy platforms in the country, and we're able to leverage our expertise within our other segments to continue to develop and operate this fleet
The operating cost as reported for NRG's Renewables segment is $91 per kW
But important to note, this includes assets such as the Ivanpah concentrated solar thermal facility, which has a higher cost structure given the emerging nature of this technology
The more appropriate metric is that of our combined Renewables segments in NRG and NRG Yield, which captures the full cost structure of our renewables operations across our entire fleet
This combined view cost of $67 per kW, as you can see, is in line with peers, and we continue to improve
Since we reintegrated our Renewables group last year, we have driven further improvement in this area through transitioning large portions of our fleet to sales performance of O&M
Additionally, we are focused on adding simpler mainstream technologies to our fleet with a core focus on utility-scale solar, which can be operated at $20 per kW and utility-scale wind at $50 per kW
As a result of these initiatives, you should expect our Renewable cost structure to step down over time
The goal of the disclosures is to provide you greater visibility into our overall cost structure and the metric that you can compare to peers
But what I want to make clear is that being in line with peers does not mean we're done looking for areas to improve
Assessing and reducing our costs is an ongoing process and we will always aim for increased position
Now, on slide 8, I'd like to provide a summary of the many ways in which we repositioned our portfolio during the past year
As part of our normal course of business, we put our entire portfolio through a rigorous review process
The result can lead to everything from fuel conversions to asset sales, to realigning our portfolio to the most compelling market opportunity
In 2016, we took significant steps to strengthen our generational fleet
We sold four assets at value for $550 million, exceeding our original target by 10%
We modernized our fleet and converted 2.2 gigawatts of coal plants to natural gas, benefiting from lower gas prices and capacity revenues
We brought online our first of a kind carbon capture facility, Petra Nova, on time and on budget
We pursued growth opportunities in both conventional and renewable plants, looking for areas of quick capital replenishment as highlighted by the 1.5 gigawatt renewable portfolio acquisition from SunEdison that we closed last year
For this transaction, we have already recovered 100% of our total utility-scale purchase price, with just the first 265 megawatt dropdown to NRG Yield
This means we have over 1 gigawatt of projects in this portfolio at effectively zero cost
Looking forward, we will continue our rigorous review process, assessing the current market and developing solutions that optimize our fleet and strengthen our platform
I would expect these to include further asset dispositions at value
Turning to slide 9, I want to provide an update on our Capital Allocation Plan
As I laid out on the fourth quarter call of last year, my primary objective for capital allocation was to ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital, and provide our shareholders with greater visibility into our capital allocation decision making
In an effort to begin to better align to the market cycle, the transition in capital allocation mix between 2015 to 2016 reflects the recognition that we needed to focus our efforts more on deleveraging, and leave no doubt on our ability to withstand a prolonged period of low commodity prices
For 2017, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and pay down debt, expanding our current program with an additional $200 million through the end of this year
Approximately 70% of every dollar we allocate will go toward this effort as we aim to maintain a cycle-appropriate level of leverage
This will ensure we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when the market recovers
We will also continue to pursue low-cost options for growth where we have an ability to generate the strong returns in a relatively short period of time, which can be viewed as temporal capital for NRG
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk now for the financial review
And to close on slide 16, I just like to summarize our main priorities as we move into 2017. You may notice similar themes to last year
This is because our focus on continuous improvement and our strategic objectives remain the same
We will continue to work towards perfecting our integrated platform, seizing market opportunities to grow, and demonstrating leadership in the competitive power sector
And we will enhance our business by remaining focused on operational excellence, reducing costs, strengthening the balance sheet, and repositioning our fleet
We continue with the process of seeking a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, where we are in active dialog with bondholders, and expect to provide more clarity next quarter
With a solid foundation put in place this year, we can continue on executing our strategy to drive greater shareholder value in the months and years to come
So with that, operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning, Stephen
Let me turn it to Kirk, specifically
But for 2017, on our guidance, we included the $400 million target that we had on our cost reduction initiatives
Is that what you wanted, Stephen, or what level of specificity you need?
Well, as we move into 2017, I think when you look at the additional disclosures that we have on the, I believe it was, slide 6, for 2016, you should expect that we're going to continue to focus on reducing our cost structure overall
And at the very least, when it comes to SG&A, not only we're going to hold the line, but as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, I think it's difficult given the initiative that we're going to go through in the Business Review Committee to put a specific target as we have done in the past
So, I hope that you all indulge us with holding on to, I guess, the direction that we have provided in terms of our new FORNRG program, our new cost initiatives
But there is a lot that we're going to go through in the next couple of months in revising our entire businesses around the company
I mean, I think it's similar to what we did in 2016. I mean, we went through a very thorough review process on assets that were not necessarily core on specific regions, that were single assets that have been underperforming
But the most important thing to me is, if we can actually monetize assets at value
And that's what we're going to be focusing on, on the next steps of asset dispositions
As I've said in the past, we ended up with a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts of generation through a number of acquisitions, and it is the time now to be pruning around that portfolio and to recalibrate and resize that portfolio
But we will only do that if we can actually monetize assets at value, like we did last year where we set a target of $500 million and we came in a little over $550 million
So, I think that's how you should be thinking about the asset optimization efforts going into 2017. And of course, I mean, now that we have a new framework around the Business Review Committee, we will have a conversation about single assets
But every part of our business and – evaluate that and make a determination in the next couple of months, which I will be in a position to announce to you later in the year
Good
So, the first thing I think it was important to – as we go in through this period of asset rebalancing and asset optimization, I feel it was important to provide you with the total cost reduction on the platform, and not only focusing on one specific category
So, what we attempted to do was provide you with the entire cost platform of the company
Some of the additional cost reductions happened around asset dispositions that we've made
And it is important, as we go in through this asset rebalancing, that we have the transparency to provide you the level that you need to be able to compare where we were before and where we are today
I will also say that a lot of the over-performance happened just across all the different categories; SG&A, O&M, selling and marketing
So, there is not just one area to pinpoint
But I think it was, as I mentioned, completely across the organization
Good morning and, yes, that is correct
I mean, the guidance does not include anything that will come from the review that we're going to undergo in the next couple of months
Yes
So, I mean, let me just start with the capacity, and part of the change is just the result that we had from the New England capacity auction
So, keep in mind that what we have here on page 36, it really reflects the latest data points that we have on capacity prices and available capacity that we sell under that
And with respect to the other small IE, we can follow up with you, because I think it sounds like you have some specific questions about CapEx and small changes
So, we can follow up with you, Greg, after the call
But if you have something specific, we can certainly address it now
Good morning, Steve
Yes, Steve, I think that's the goal
And over the next couple of weeks, we're going to meet as a Committee, start looking at every single one of our business with the benefit now of full information, including non-public information and the strategic plan that I laid out to the board last year
And I think that process, we're going to do it on an expedited basis
And one thing that it was important for me to highlight is, the areas where the Business Review Committee is going to focus is very well in line with the priorities that I laid out in 2016 and that we're continuing in 2017. So, now, we're going to have the benefit of working together with the same set of information, so we can make the best evaluation and make recommendations to the board and communicate that to investors later in the year
So, I think that an assumption that we're going to be communicating to the market before August is a fair assumption
Now, keep in mind that, I want to make sure that as we communicate the decisions to our shareholders and to our investors, we need to make sure that we don't jeopardize the execution of any of those decisions
So, I will make that determination in the next – in the coming weeks and months
But we are on a fast track to make a full evaluation of every single one of our businesses
Well, two things
One, we understand that many of our investors were working with information from 2015 and partial information throughout the year
So, it is important that everybody recognizes the great efforts that we have gone through and the progress that we've made in terms of streamlining the organization and reducing costs
And this is the first step to improving our disclosures to all of you, so you can actually not only be able to benchmark us with our peers, but also hold us accountable on our efforts going forward
I mean, we may be competitive with other peers as we've put it in this additional disclosure
But certainly, that doesn't take us from our focus on continuing streamlining the organization
And irrespective of asset optimization or asset sales, this is part of who we are and this is part of the refocus of the company over the past 12 months
Now, as you can appreciate, and I think I have mentioned already that, as we go through this process, we're certainly changing and recalibrating the makeup of our portfolio, and repositioning in a way that becomes more – that is better prepared to take advantage of the market opportunities as they will present themselves
So, I think it's going to be combination of two things
One is continue streamlining the organization; and then two, repositioning the portfolio that will have an impact on our total cost structure
No, that's a great point, and I'm glad that they didn't – it didn't get unnoticed on my remarks
I will tell you that we're completely focused
We're going to be active and we're going to be vocal in defending the integrity of competitive markets
We have done that already in New York and Illinois
And wherever we see that out-of-market payments for uneconomic generation to really subsidize and slow down the most efficient mix of generation and technologies that consumers need and want, we will be there
And like I said, I mean, today New York, Illinois, and wherever that pops, we're going to be a very vocal and active proponent of competitive markets
Well, great
Thank you, and thank you for your interest in NRG and spending some time with us this morning, and look forward to talk to you in the next earnings call
