BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Ball Corporation 2Q 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, August 6, 2020. I would now like to turn the
conference over to John Hayes, CEO. Please go ahead.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the
company's second quarter 2020 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-
looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or
implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K
and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our second
quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-
GAAP financial measures may also be found in the Notes section of today's earnings release. The release
also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of
comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, the press release
financials include descriptions of new segment reporting for our EMEA and other nonreportable segments.

Now joining me on the call today are Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Fisher,
Senior Vice President and COO of our Global Beverage business. I'll provide some introductory remarks,
Dan will discuss the global beverage packaging performance and trends, Scott will discuss key financial
metrics, and then we'll finish up with comments on our aerosol and aerospace businesses as well as our
outlook for the company.

Second quarter results were strong and candidly, came in stronger than we expected, which is just
another proof point of the long-term resiliency of our various businesses. At a time that the world
experienced the worst economic and social crisis in our lifetimes, our second quarter and year-to-date
comparable diluted earnings per share increased 2% and 12%, respectively, and were driven by our
North and Central American beverage business where improved commercial terms, better manufacturing
performance, increased volumes and the absence of metal scrap headwinds all contributed to a very
strong quarter. Dan Fisher will elaborate more on our other beverage segments in a moment but over the
course of this quarter, sequential monthly improvement in each of our packaging segments improved from
the lows we experienced in late May and early April. North American beverage can demand continues to
outstrip supply and despite the initial pandemic-related demand impact in Europe and South America,
demand in these regions has accelerated meaningfully since these regions began to reopen in mid-May.
And our beverage can business in each region is sold out in advance of new capacity coming online. We
are encouraged by the start-ups of our new lines in Fort Worth, Texas and Rome, Georgia, and the rest of
our growth projects around the world remain in good shape.

During the quarter, global beverage volumes were down 3% with low single-digit growth in North America,
unable to offset weak volumes in April and, to a lesser extent, May, in both South America and EMEA.
However, we did experience much stronger year-over-year growth in the month of June, about which Dan
will elaborate more later.

In our aerospace business, we continue to see strong growth with quarterly year-over-year revenues
up 16% and our won-not-booked backlog up 10% since first quarter 2020. We did experience, however,
a $13 million reserve for the failure of a key subcontractor component and a large classified program
that more than offset an otherwise strong quarter. We expect this to be a onetime event and believe our
supplier and our program team have the issue isolated and under control.

Other highlights in the quarter include: our aluminum aerosol business was down slightly for the
quarter after customers took anticipated downtime and increased demand for sanitizing sprays were
unable to offset lower demand for deodorants. We continue to make progress on our aluminum aerosol

manufacturing plant acquisition in Brazil. We expect this transaction to close in the third quarter.
Construction and hiring for our first dedicated aluminum cups manufacturing facility remains on track.
Despite the current fan attendance restrictions at major sporting, music and other events, our outlook for
2021 is perhaps even a bit stronger than when we began the year as we have accelerated our retail go-to-
market strategy with the signing of a number of various letters of intent executed with both retail partners
as well as venue operators. Starting this fall, consumers will be able to purchase our cups on major online
platforms which will then feed into more presence in the physical stores as our production capabilities
ramp up towards the end of this year. During the quarter, we announced our national partnerships with
Acosta and Blue Ocean, thereby positioning the Ball aluminum cup for retail success.

Across our businesses, year-to-date, we've hired over 1,000 new employees and invested approximately
$450 million in growth projects that we and our investors will enjoy in the years ahead.

Now before I turn it over to Dan and Scott, I do want to give a big shout out to all of our colleagues here
at Ball for caring for one another and for living our culture. Your dedication and hard work to support our
customers, our communities and the global economies where we operate is second to none. In true Ball
fashion, throughout this crisis, our company and employees have provided millions of dollars of financial
support to over 300 organizations in the local communities in which we live and operate. At the same
time, these same people were able to continue to execute successfully our strategy, grow our business,
control the things we can control and invest in our future. So a big thank you.

In summary, all has adapted well to this new environment. Despite contractions in some of our markets
early in the quarter, we exit the quarter with good momentum and are excited to bring additional capacity
online as quickly and safely as possible and continue to believe that the overall strength of our businesses
will allow us to grow operating earnings in the second half of this year and beyond. We also want to
extend our well wishes to everyone, our customers, our suppliers, our first responders, our governments
and indeed, all of our stakeholders who are persevering through all of this, and we wish all of you listening
for your continued safety and good health. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Thanks, John. I also want to thank our employees, customers and supply chain for their collaboration
to maintain our industry's ability to serve consumer demand. In addition, our HR leadership and our
environmental health and safety professionals continue to keep our Ball family safe and vigilant about our
well-being as communities.

Offices and schools begin to open up. Looking forward and given the increasing demand for sustainable
aluminum packaging, it is going to be an exciting beverage can market for the next several years. To
bolster the growing demand for aluminum packaging and true circularity, we recently published our
peer-reviewed life cycle assessments and biennial sustainability report. Visit ball.com/sustainability to
learn more about what ball is doing to advance the circular economy and its operations and across our
industries, while also supporting diversity and inclusion initiatives.

As we discussed on the first quarter call, consumer behavior varies by region. In North America,
consumers are able to access multiple shopping channels, stock up and store bulk packages of our
products. In late March, this led to a surge in beverage can demand as those occasions that occurred in
the on-premise and convenience channels shifted to the at-home or off-premise channels. Following March
volumes being up 12%, April slowed a bit, then returned to single-digit growth in May and June. Demand
has continued to outpace supply and inventory levels are low. In particular, year-to-date through July, we
have seen IRI can demand in the nonalcoholic category growing 11%; domestic beer, up 4%, that includes
up 13% in the second quarter, craft growth of 20% and FMBs up in the range of 80% to 90%.

As we look forward, we are thankful that our new line in Fort Worth started up a couple of weeks ago
and that our new Rome, Georgia beverage can line is on track to start-up next week. In advance of those
lines and our 2 new plants coming online in early 2021 for Glendale, Arizona and in mid-2021 for our
northeastern plant, our global plant network outside of the U.S. will supply additional cans when possible.

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

For the full year, we anticipate North America beverage can growth of at least 4%, with half of that growth
coming from inventory drawdown and imports.

In EMEA, segment volume was down nearly 8% for the quarter as borders remained closed. Tourism was
restricted and shopping hours were limited across many countries through much of the quarter. During the
quarter, strength in the U.K. and Russia were unable to offset softer demand in Southern Europe, Egypt
and Turkey. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends improved late in the quarter, with April volumes
down 11%, May volumes down 16% and then June volumes up 4%. This positive momentum continued
into July with volumes up mid-single digits. Additional capital projects across Europe continue and we
foresee European beverage can volumes up low single digits in 2020.

In South America, after seeing a nearly 60% decrease in Brazilian can shipments in April, due to the
temporary closing of smaller grocery stores, gas stations and convenience stores, our demand rebounded
sharply, up 7% in May, and the progress continued in June with volumes up nearly 40%. Beverage cans
have been very resilient, with store owners leveraging recyclable aluminum cans over other substrates.
Exiting the second quarter, package mix for beer on the shelf was 70% cans versus a rate of 50% at the
end of the first quarter 2020. Following discussions with customers, we anticipate can mix on the shelf
remaining high beyond 2020. And we intend to move forward with previously discussed line additions in
Brazil.

From a segment operating performance perspective, Ball's North American segment earnings were
up 34%. More equitable customer contracts, operational improvements and volume growth benefited
the quarter. Partially offsetting this were higher end costs associated with the new manufacturing lines
ramping up in the second half of 2020 and unfavorable mix associated with certain can sizes sold through
the convenience store channel. Our initial plan is to add 6 billion units of capacity in our North American
business by the end of 2021 have been adjusted upward following recent contract discussions. We proceed
fully scaling out our new facilities in Arizona and the northeastern U.S. sooner rather than later. As of
today, our capital growth projects are on track, and earnings growth is expected to continue across North
America in 2020 and beyond.

In our EMEA segment, negative demand trends resulting from the pandemic, lower absorption and FX
headwinds pressured segment results for the quarter. Our EMEA team's close to the customer approach
and support from our North American business positions the business for strong second half performance.

Turning to South American segment. Second quarter earnings were down primarily driven by the abrupt
contraction in Brazilian demand early in the first half of the quarter, which led to lower absorption over
multiple weeks. Similar to our EMEA segments, our team's close to our customers' approach will bolster
second half results. In our other nonreportable results, the company's Myanmar, Indian and Saudi
beverage can manufacturing results continue to be dampened by production downtime. In addition, other
includes an annual $20 million P&L investment to stand up our aluminum cup business. As John referenced
earlier, we are on track with our aluminum cup plant construction and our push into retail is picking up
steam.

In summary, global beverage can demand was very resilient during the second quarter, and momentum
is building for the third quarter and beyond. Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. 2020
has provided us all with unprecedented challenges, and you've risen to the occasion time and time again.
Your leadership has been nothing short of remarkable. Keep it up and stay safe. With that, I'll turn it over
to Scott.

Scott C. Morrison
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Dan. Comparable second quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share were $0.65 versus $0.64 in
2019. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong North America beverage
segment results, a lower share count and lower corporate costs, offset by lower EMEA, South America and
aerospace results due to the short-term demand and supply chain impacts. Due to the pass-through of
lower aluminum costs and the 2019 sale of the Argentine Steel aerosol business and Chinese beverage can
assets and lower second quarter packaging demand outside of North America, revenues for the second

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

quarter were down. Ball's balance sheet is healthy, and we have focused near-term on maintaining ample
liquidity and flexibility in the current environment. Year-to-date, we experienced our seasonal working
capital build, which was more sizable than typical due largely to the timing of metal payments. As a result
of this timing and ongoing growth initiatives and raw materials supply to support them, we anticipate the
full year 2020 working capital investment to be a use in the range of $300 million, which is slightly higher
than previously anticipated due to accelerating growth conditions.

As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind. Our full year effective tax rate on
comparable earnings will be in the range of 18%; full year interest expense will be in the range of $270
million; and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in Other Nonreportable are now expected
to be in the range of $55 million. Our 2020 cash from operations will continue to be strong. We will be
investing in working capital and even more growth CapEx to expand aerospace facilities, beverage can
production capacity, while also completing construction on our first aluminum cups manufacturing facility.
Contrary to past sizable M&A deals, Ball is embarking on a multiyear phase of internal investments to
serve organic growth for beverage cans and support new contracted volumes. At this point, 2020 CapEx
will likely exceed $900 million, and 2020 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $400 million. Ball
has always been focused on being good stewards of our cash and prudently balancing real-time growth
opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders. Given our strong cash flow, we are
managing the business appropriately for the long term, investing capital with an eye on EVA returns,
managing our balance sheet effectively and consistently returning value to our long-term shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Great. Thanks, Scott. Our aluminum aerosol business saw global volumes in the quarter decline 6%,
driven primarily by flat volumes in North America, single-digit declines in Europe and strong double-
digit declines in India as a result of multi-week country lockdowns and regional fillers downtime. Looking
ahead, we're excited to expand our aluminum aerosol business' geographic reach into South America and
expect the acquisition of the Tubex facility to close in the third quarter.

Our aerospace business reported approximately 16% revenue growth and lower-than-expected segment
earnings due to a supply chain issue on a key fixed price project. Adjustments to testing schedules have
been made and the items necessary from the supplier are forthcoming. The team has done a good job
managing the process with our customers despite difficult circumstances. Looking ahead, the growth
trajectory of this business is even stronger with won-not-booked backlog reaching $5.3 billion.

In addition, our year-to-date aerospace headcount has increased by nearly 450 employees, and we
anticipate hiring an additional 550 employees by year-end. Our HR team has done a great job onboarding
these new employees and running our summer internship program remotely. In this business, we continue
to enhance our infrastructure, build out testing and manufacturing facilities in 2020, and ensure all
projects are on track and on budget. Current indications reflect that the business will be able to grow
profitably in excess of 15% per year over the next several years given the scale and type of recent
contract wins.

In summary, Ball continues to be uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth in global
aluminum packaging and aerospace while delivering significant value to our shareholders. As we sit here
today, our ability to grow comparable diluted earnings per share in 2020 is higher than previously thought.
Our teams will do everything possible to outperform while being keenly focused on working safely and
executing capital investments. Beyond 2020, we look forward to driving our business to deliver long-term
diluted earnings per share growth of at least 10% to 15% and achieve our EVA dollar growth goals of 4%
to 8% per year on our growing invested capital base. Especially during these times, we are thankful for
one another and the opportunities in front of Ball for an even brighter future.
Now lastly, as a reminder, Ball will host its biennial Investor Day on October 6. We look forward to your
attendance at this virtual event. And with that, Kelly, we're ready for questions.

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I think you indicated you're sold out in all your major regions exiting the quarter. And I'm wondering if it's
possible to quantify maybe how much volume you may have left on the table, either in 2Q or potentially
for the year. And then just a related question, is it possible to say what quantity of cans you might export/
import cross-region in 2020?

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Yes. I think it's difficult to answer the -- what it would leave on the table. I think, clearly, in Europe,
negative almost 8% growth, that should have been in the 3% to 5% growth range. So I would steer
you in that direction. And then for South America, again, we should have probably grown in the mid-
to-high single-digits for the quarter. And we were obviously a little shy due to the April decline. We are
probably importing in terms of -- it's all North America support. I would expect for the year, somewhere
in the neighborhood of a couple of billion cans. 1 billion of that is coming from places that typically we
wouldn't be shipping from: Europe, India, Brazil, for instance, and then where we can get some relief, and
we benefited from that in the second quarter, specifically in Mexico, as kind of the brewery industry was
deemed nonessential, we were able to use some of our excess capacity in Mexico to ship up. So that's sort
of how I would frame where those imports are coming from.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. But Anthony -- and how many would we have been able to sell if we had capacity? That's a tough
question to answer. We don't know. We -- Dan pointed out, when you hear some of those IRI statistics.
And just in the second quarter alone, you had carbonated soft drink cans up 14%, you had big beer
cans up 14%, you had total FMBs up nearly 150%. Those are very big categories and very strong. We
obviously are not unable to keep up with that because we had not anticipated that. And so our -- as Dan
had mentioned, our inventories are at all-time lows. We've been importing as many cans as possible. I
know that doesn't answer your question, how many were left on the table because it just -- it's too difficult
to know. What I do believe, though, it underpins many of these longer-term investments because the
growth we're seeing, yes, some of it has to do with the stay-at-home rules but a lot of it still has to do
with sustainability that we've talked about over the past couple of years.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then you talked about some benefits from new contractual terms.
And I'm wondering if it's possible to put any finer point on the contribution from that? Does that roll
through over a number of years if these are multiyear contracts? And understanding you're probably
limited in what you can say, can you give any color in terms of how these terms are different than maybe
conventional or legacy contracts?

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

No. We've -- this has been well described in the past, and I'm not going to say other than what we've
talked about. We normally don't talk about these things, but we did have a number of contracts renew at
the end of 2019 and we had told people that the phase-in on some of these new commercial terms would
probably be multiyear, it's not just 1 year. And so that's about all we can say right now.

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Operator

Our next question comes from Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. You mentioned fully scaling out the North American capacity additions in Arizona and Northeastern
U.S. Can you just give us a sense of how much incremental capacity is expected to be added in North
America versus the 6 billion units that was initially planned? How should we think about the ramp in this
capacity following the start-up of the facilities in mid-2021?

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Yes. It's all going to be dependent on executing contractual negotiations. And we will continue to update
that number for you as those things become more firm. And it's clearly reliant on execution, hiring
employees and ramping up lines, but got to have contracts on the back of it, and some of those contract
negotiations are still ongoing.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. But the 2 new facilities we're building, remember, we're scaling them that they have the capability of
being the biggest in our system.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then we recently saw an announcement that a new entrant coming into U.S.
market. What impact, if any, do you see to market dynamics from the announcement? And what level of
demand growth do you think is necessary over the next several years in the North American market for it
to remain basically balanced given all the new industry capacity that's being brought on?

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Yes. We've talked about this in the past. And the long story short is, let's put this in context. The market is
approximately 100 billion cans. We've been -- realistically, this year, it's been growing well above the 4%
to 6% we talked about. Whether it's been 8 or 10, it's unclear because we have left cans on the table as
we were talking a few minutes ago. So you're talking about upwards of 8 to 10 billion incremental cans in
1 year alone. Now this is a unique year. I get that. But we think as we go forward, that 4% to 6%, based
on what we see, it's trending to the upper part of that range. So that's in the range of approximately
6 billion cans a year. That's why we're accelerating our growth investments. And as we've discussed
previously, this is a growing business. This is a scale business, and this is a business if you run it right,
you can generate decent economic returns. And so I'm not surprised. People have been looking at it, but I
think the overall market is more than -- the growth of the overall market is more than sufficient to absorb
this capacity. And as a result, given our 20-plus plant network, we have many levers that we can pull
relative to any other smaller competitors that just have 1 or 2 levers to pull.

Operator

Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I wanted to piggyback on some of the questions from Neel and from Anthony to extent possible. Again,
recognizing you're not going to be able to really quantify or maybe even enumerate, can you talk to
whether your customers, in North America or anywhere else, given what they're seeing in terms of
demand and your need to supply more capacity, are being willing to accept more creative terms, different

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

terms than maybe what was even put into contracts in '19? Any desire or willingness to maybe share
in some of the risks and costs to make sure that capacity is on the ground when the demand is there?
Anything that you can talk to on that question.

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Yes. I believe that is an accurate depiction of where we are right now. There are a number of categories
and a few customers, George, that are viewing this as a real opportunity to grow for the first time in
years. And those customers and those categories are being aggressive. They want to move quickly. And
yes, we're having any number of much more creative discussions with those folks. It's not everyone,
but certainly, you can imagine in the seltzer categories. And when you see big beer and nonalcoholic
categories growing at this rate, that's a real opportunity for some of our customers to step into some
growth profiles that they haven't seen in a while, and they're using the can and innovative packs to do
that. And yes, different dialogues are certainly happening right now as a result.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, George, just to give you an example, we've talked about this in the past, but historically, at least in
North America, many of these larger contracts were based on requirements that you'd have to fulfill 100%
of the requirements of any given filling location. And over the last couple of years, we've rejiggered that.
Because all the risk was then on us, to the upside and the downside, quite honestly. But so what we've
rejiggered that is, think of it more of a fixed amount, plus or minus, a window. Call it, a 5% window or a
10% window, whatever was agreed to. And if -- and they've got to take those cans. And if they need more
cans, then it's a separate discussion. And so the most important thing we're trying to do, though, is make
sure we can fulfill as much of the can demand that our customers are seeing. And I think all -- because of
COVID, it call everyone off -- offguard a little bit. People knew the growth. We've been talking about this
growth for several years, and there are some customers that were more understanding of it than others.
But I think this overall shift to off-premise has been a great help for us, but it's also pointed out the fact
that making sure that you have your supply chains in good order are important. So we're trying to keep
up with our customers as best we can.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. 2 questions then I'll turn it over. To the extent that the capital spending has continued to move
higher, I mean, we understand the logic why because of the demand that you see that you're trying to
meet. Is there a way to, I don't know, quantify or qualitatively talk about the return you expect to get
on the -- what these incremental spending numbers look like relative to what had been perhaps the base
capital spending a few years ago, whatever, is $500 million, $600 million. And then on aerospace, and
correct my number there, if it's wrong, on what the base number had been. And then on aerospace, if you
could talk a bit further -- I realize it was a project in the black, but can you talk a bit about what the issue
was in terms of the subcontractor, why you believe it's resolved? And should we expect the earnings for
aerospace to continue at what had been the trajectory you were expecting third quarter and beyond?

Scott C. Morrison
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, George, let me take the first part on the returns, and then I'll turn it over to John on the aerospace
one. We are still at, first and foremost, an EVA company. So any capital we'll put into work, we have to get
9% over -- within the first 3 years of putting that capital to work. These projects are better-than-average
because they have -- tend to be a higher percentage of specialty cans than standard containers. So we're
going to like the returns on these projects over the course of the next several years. And so I would say
our return profile has gotten better and compounded with the growth that we're seeing. So I think we're
in a pretty good place. And frankly, spending $900 million, the faster we can get some of these assets up
and running, the faster we can enjoy the returns on them.

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

And George, with respect to aerospace, we had a test failure of a key component from one of our sub-
suppliers. That was late in the program's life. As you know, that you -- when you're building a program
like this, you assemble everything and at the tail end, you test everything. Well, we had a failure of one
of the key components there, which pushed out the delivery date and therefore, cost us money related
to reworking the problem and getting a new part from the supplier as well as our marching army costs, if
you want to call it that, keeping the program team intact and moving it out, in this case, approximately
6 months or so. As I said in the prepared remarks, this was a onetime event. This -- very few times do
things like this happen, but they do happen from time-to-time. But I think our -- both our supplier as well
as our program team have the issue isolated and under control. So even despite that, you would see --
even with that, they had a pretty good quarter. But without that, they had a very good quarter. And we
expect, as I said, as we march forward to have 15% or more earnings growth in that business.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

All right. Good luck in the quarter.

Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. I guess, I just wanted to ask, first off, about Europe. Maybe you can just provide your thoughts on
the business there. Obviously, a slightly different situation as far as the opportunity for pantry loading. So
how are you thinking about kind of Europe global bev -- or Europe bev can volume the second half as well
as next year?

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Yes. Well, we think that -- in the prepared comments, we exited June as borders started to open up,
then as folks were able to get out of their house, can consumption picked up. And we were on a growth
trajectory exiting June year-over-year, and we expect that to continue to build at this rate. Obviously, I
have to preface that with we don't know what's going to happen, second wave of COVID, et cetera. But
right now, we're anticipating to end the year despite being down 8% in the second quarter with slight
growth for the year, and that means that the second half has to be up fairly appreciably in the mid-to-high
single digits.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

It's interesting. This might be helpful for -- these are for the second quarter. In beer, in Europe, this is
across Europe, beer cans grew 10%, but softdrink was down 17%. And softdrink is bigger. And it makes
a lot of sense when you think about it because all the pubs were closed but people will still drink beer, so
they're drinking more beer at home. But much of the softdrink in cans is actually sold in the on-the-go
convenience channels. Whether it's a kiosk, at the beach or somewhere else like that, with all of those
closed, we saw a retrenchment there. And those are the types of things that are now opening up that Dan
was referring to.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's helpful. And I guess, maybe we can just ask a related question here. So have you thought about
anything about changing consumption habits? It seems that as people are returning to on-premise
consumption, looks like bars may be more up to hold bottles and cans rather than kegs, just because
they're not sure what their take rates are going to be. So I guess, does that affect your business? And

then similarly, you had talked a little bit about the new beverages going into cans, moving from 35%
several years ago, maybe to 70% a year ago. Have you seen continued growth in that trajectory? And
maybe you can just offer your thoughts longer term, just on new categories in beverage cans as well as
maybe changing consumption habits amongst customers.

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Sure. Yes. And for the first part, this is when I really wish I had a sociology degree, so I could really
capture the changing behaviors in consumption patterns. But it is clear in conversations with a number of
our customers that they believe that cans will certainly be, at least in the medium term, a beneficiary of
everything that's happening in the -- as it relates to folks working from home more. In those areas and
how you -- and your dining, the food service experience, all of that, tends to lead itself to more packaged
products and more cans. So that -- and from there, we think that there's even potentially some upside
on the growth rates that we shared 6 months ago. That's early indications. I think a lot of our customers
are still working through what all of that means specifically. But at a 30,000-foot level, it certainly lends
itself to more cans and more packaged goods. We are continuing to see -- in your second question, we're
continuing to see cans winning. I referenced what was happening in South America. That was a substantial
increase in pack mix in the beer category, but continue to see growth and movement into cans in North
America, kind of north of that 70% rate. And I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. The innovations
that we're hearing, the brands that are getting pushed into cans, that rate seems to have some teeth to it,
some staying power. And I could see it continuing to tick up modestly here over the next 3 to 5 years.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So John, back to your favorite topic on North American capacity additions. If we sort of total up the
announcements by you and your peer groups over the next couple of years or so, it looks like capacity will
be added in the mid-teens in terms of units, up 100 billion base. And obviously, the industry is seeing very
strong growth at current. But can you just give us a sense for how long the contracts typically are from a
duration standpoint, specific to the new capacity you, as the industry leader are kind of bringing on at this
point?

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, it's -- every customer and every conversation is different. But what I would say is there's a tendency
for us to think more long term about these things and -- because that's what we've always done. You
followed us a very long time, and I reflect back at the things we did in South America when we were
building new plants. That mindset is what -- kind of what we're doing here. And so it's a long ways out.
Also remember that number you cited, that's not going to be all in place at one time. These are all ramp-
ups and they start over time. So I wouldn't disagree with your number, but that's probably over the
next 3 years type of number. And when you see the growth, one of the things I think about is, is that
even enough? I could make a very compelling argument right now, given the growth rates we're seeing,
that, that will be -- create a shortage in the can market in 2022 or 2023 as well. So it's a very dynamic
environment right now, but we're -- and we're very focused on making sure we're doing the right thing for
the long term for our company and our shareholders and our customers.

Ghansham Panjabi
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then second question, on the beverage packaging segment for North America -- north and Central
America, I should say. Can you help us with the operating profit bridge between 2Q of this year versus last
year? Were there any temporary savings that perhaps inflated that margin that could reverse as business
kind of normalizes? Or is that not case?

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Scott C. Morrison
Senior VP & CFO

Well, the absence of the scrap that we had last year, but the business is operating better. The
manufacturing performance is better. We're making every can that we can possibly sell, so absorption is
good. But beyond that, there's nothing that's that unusual kind of year-over-year. I would say that the
scrap is probably the biggest absorption.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Ghansham, remember at the beginning of this year, we talked about the bridge year-over-year, and
we talked about we needed -- we're going to have the commercial terms, the benefit of new commercial
terms. We talked about we needed to execute better. We talked about the absence of scrap. But then
we also talked about headwinds related to the start-up costs of all these new things. All of those, in
general, are happening as we anticipated. The only surprise to the positive, in my mind, is the operating
performance is actually better. We are ahead of our plans for 2020. I think our manufacturing folks are
doing a very good job. They've got a ton on their plate, too. Because given the tightness of the market
and then with all this new capital coming on, they're being spread -- stretched pretty thin. But despite
that, they're performing candidly better than we expected.

Scott C. Morrison
Senior VP & CFO

We'll have more start-up in the back half of the year as these other plans get closer to fruition, too. So I
wouldn't take the second quarter as being kind of a normalized number. It was exceptionally good.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays.

Michael James Leithead
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Two on the imported cans into North America. You mentioned in the release about needing to ship
cans in from Europe, which I can imagine, isn't cheap. So I guess, first, I know contract pricing is annual.
So does that incremental cost fall on Ball or its customers? And second, how do you think this evolves as
we head into '21 versus this year because I assume as you're starting up plants here in the U.S., you can
get cans to customers for cheaper while transferring some of that value, hopefully to your own P&L?

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Yes. The first part of your question is, I mean, essentially, what we're doing is we're allowing the customer
to take the product at the facility and they're basically on the hook for the freight. So we're not exposed
on that. And as John referenced, we're stepping away with an awful lot of our contracts, away from
requirement contracts to more fixed volume. And then as a result of that, you're not on the hook for
getting those cans shipped and absorbing the cost. It's a much more equitable contract and relationship.
And right now, as you can imagine, for the folks that don't have a revenue stream on-premise, they're
trying to buttress their revenue stream with product off-premise, and they are happy to pay for that
additional cost. Moving forward, this is the real challenge for us is when we look at our IRI data. We
believe that the growth that we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date, that still has some teeth
regardless of whether we're in a COVID environment or not. Sustainability continues to drive, new product
launches and cans continue to drive that growth profile. And I think as the previous question was centered
around, a lot of capacity is going to be coming online but as we all know, it's all related to how effectively
you get it put up and how you execute against those start-up curves. And so for the next 2 to 3 years,
long story short, I think there will be a continued reliance on some level of imports. Probably not to the
extent we've seen this year, but 2021 is shaping up to be incredibly tight again. And I think you'll hear
more reference to import cans at least for the next 12 to 18 months. Beyond that, we'll have to see.

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Michael James Leithead
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. That was helpful. And then just one on the aluminum cups, particularly you're shifting it more
into a retail focus right now. Can you talk about the potential price point for your cups relative to, say, a
standard solo cup? And I'm assuming both you and your retail partners have done a bunch of consumer
market analyses as you're preparing for this launch. So can you just talk about what your observation so
far have been and their excitement around the product?

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, why don't I take a first stab and then let Dan chime in. Just -- let me take a step back, too, because
it's important to remember. Our strategy all along was kind of getting the venues first, create awareness
and then follow-up through the retail, because that's where the size of the prize is really on the retail side.
The bad news is, because of COVID, many of those venues were shut down. The good news is we did a
tremendous amount of research and testing, and we realized that the awareness is already there. In fact,
many people, when they have already seen them, are very well versed of its attributes and its positive
attributes. So as we go to the retail channels and sell it, there's 2 observations I'd point out. Observation
number one is we don't have to "sell it" because we can feel the demand being there. And number two,
I don't think it's as much of a relative to a plastic cup as we thought it was. This is a whole new product
with a whole different proposition, and as a result, a whole different price point. And so I'm not going to
get into right now about what the various price points are. You will see them in the near future when you
see them on the shelf, but they are going to be a premium to what's out there today because consumers
have told us they're willing to pay a premium for this product.

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Some of the more specific conversations we've had in and around the cup that may help you, at least on
the retail side is, almost universally, the folks we're talking to view this as innovation. And that, in and of
itself, creates a very different discussion and dialogue in terms of the process to get it in the store, to get
it on the shelf and the price point. And they're leaning -- in many instances, these retailers are leaning
on a lot of the research we've done to look to us to what the appropriate price is. So that's been very
favorable. And the other thing that's been really exciting is some of the larger retailers have a real focus
on reducing their plastic in store, and this is a wonderful opportunity for them to do that. And so those are
the -- those are the learnings, the biggest learnings and the biggest takeaways that might allow you to
have a little perspective on maybe the success we may be having or are gearing up for as it relates to that
product.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

The other thing we're doing, and more and more, and you'll see it as we go through 2020, but particularly
in 2021, it's more on the marketing side as well, creating awareness for this. I give our cups team, Dan
and the rest of his team, a tremendous amount of credit. We're being very creative. Things that, candidly,
we haven't done in the past, but creating awareness for this that's going to actually help maintain the
price position we're aiming for.

Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.

Brian P. Maguire
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just wanted to better understand the raised CapEx outlook. I don't think you were announcing any new
lines or new location for capacity with it. So is it just simply pulling forward some of the investments you
would have otherwise made next year? And then as we think about looking into 2021, should we expect

14

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

CapEx to decline meaningfully? And related to that, the working capital build this year, do you have any
initial thoughts on where working capital might go next year, more investments to support the growth? Or
do we see it flattening out a little bit?

Scott C. Morrison
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think the pace of CapEx is really pulling forward as much as we can because we see the demand
is there now, as Dan talked about -- being in short can. So the faster we can get these assets up and
running, the better. So some of that is pull-forward. I think as you look into next year, I think if these
growth percentages, if they're going to continue at this kind of pace, we'll probably spend more capital
than what we had originally anticipated in 2021, but we're also -- be making a lot more money. On the
working capital front, the growth from where I said previously for this year is due to that acceleration of
the growth. I think next year, it will stabilize somewhat, but I could still see a small use of working capital
next year, but it's too early to tell.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

And Brian, the only thing I'd add to that is, while on one hand, we didn't announce any new capital, in
fact, we did. Because what Dan said was we are going to accelerate the build-out, the ultimate build-out of
our plant in Arizona and Northeast U.S.

Brian P. Maguire
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. So should I interpret that, initially, there were a certain number of lines and then...

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Correct.

Brian P. Maguire
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Potential room to build more lines and now we're going ahead with those second phase kind of plants at
this point?

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

That's correct.

Brian P. Maguire
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Makes sense. Just one additional question, if I could. Was there any impact on the U.S. margins from
mix in the quarter? I know you talked about some shifting maybe to more of the club stores and the
multi-packs. Does that have a material impact on mix? And then any thoughts on restarting the share
repurchase program now that it seems like the macro has kind of lifted a little bit of the fog for your ability
to forecast the business?

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

I'll take the first part of those questions. It wasn't a material impact. But yes, we did have some
dampening of margins because the convenience store channels with the -- a higher specialty mix and
higher price points for our customers, that was down a bit, especially in April and the first part of May. Not
entirely sure that, that's all going to come back. Just depending on return-to-work, at least for the next 6
months. And what folks are going to do in the U.S., the less frequently you're driving, the less frequently

you're stopping in, in a convenience channel, and that was certainly a difference in terms of behavior
pattern that dampened our mix a bit in the second quarter.

Scott C. Morrison
Senior VP & CFO

And on the share buyback front, we're going to continue to return significant value to shareholders with
over $200 million in dividends this year. We've already bought -- we bought some stock early in the year.
And we'll see how the year progresses and are not ruling out buying some shares in the back half of the
year.

Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.

John Robert Dunigan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is actually John Dunigan on for Phil. Congrats on the strong performance. I just had one question, I
guess, related to kind of Dan's comments on packaging mix shift, particularly you had noted the shift in
grocery. I think you said 50% beer within cans in 1Q and that have moved to 70% this quarter. I was just
hoping you could talk about kind of what caused that? Was that mostly driven by people not wanting to
go to the stores and get a reusable glass bottle? And what you think is the actual stickiness in the longer-
term for picking up that share of the shelf? And then you -- in the release that there's also talk about an
acceleration of substrate mix towards cans in EMEA. Maybe you can also discuss what's driving that and
how that is going to be held on to in the longer-term as well?

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Sure. The first part of your question as it relates to South America, there's a couple of things that you
certainly have to pay attention to. One, we've seen for the last, I would say, 3 to 5 years has been the
reluctance by the smaller retailers and it's all throughout South America to carry returnable glass, the
perishable nature of it. They don't have a lot of square footage, buying behavior in those areas is smaller
stores, it's gas stations. It's much more in convenience channel. And those retailers are demanding cans.
And so that has been certainly -- I would continue to see that moving forward. And the other part is in
a lot of these South American markets, there's a dominant returnable glass player. And when they make
a conscious decision or when they're losing share to cans, at some point, in all the markets that we're
participating in, they will make a conscious decision to move into cans. And I think the combination of
those 2 things have happened in Brazil. And I would suspect that, that would continue for the foreseeable
future.

John Robert Dunigan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And here's -- you're saying that it was also accelerated because of the pandemic you -- so don't want to
hold...

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Absolutely.

John Robert Dunigan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

All that extra returnable glass. And that was the big shift, particularly in 1Q outside of, obviously, the
trends that we've been seeing for a while?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Yes. When the on-premise is closed, the incumbent that is relying on returnable glass, they either fight
with cans or they're losing share. And I would suspect that they've made such a conscious effort on that
front. And the retail movement is a lot bigger of an issue, I think, than what a lot of people have discussed
previously. So I think that's sort of here to stay. Whether it's 70% this quarter, 65% next, it's appreciably
going to be higher moving forward.

Yes, in Europe, I think we're seeing, as John referenced, we're seeing, and we will continue to see as pubs
and on-premise is less and less open, there'll be more cans pushed. And typically, I think, because of the
sustainable nature of the package and as folks move into filling those cans and if they have success with
that, I think it will be a boon. To what level and what extent in the medium and long term, that's yet to be
determined. But I would certainly assume that it will be a lift for us moving forward.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Just to put a finer point on that, on the beer side in Europe, that's not the -- it hasn't been the issue
at all. It's really been on the softdrink, the nonalcoholic. And without going into any particular names,
whether it's energy, whether it's soft drink, because those are typically sold in the immediate consumption
channel, that's what's been soft. It's gotten better. But it will continue to be soft just because the tourist
trade in Europe is down year-over-year this summer for the reasons we all know.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I've got just a couple of them real quickly. Can you talk about any bottlenecks that you may be
encountering either from COVID or from just equipment suppliers being stretched as you ramp up because
there are a lot of can projects around the world? The other one, John, we've seen some different numbers
out there for kind of recycling and recovering rates on aluminum beverage cans. And I wondered if you
could just share your perspective on those rates in the different regions around the world.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, first, let me try and quickly take both of them, maybe Dan can chime in. Let me talk about not
only just beverage channel, let me talk to aerospace as well. All of our projects, our folks have done
a herculean job to make sure that they are all on track. There was a couple in Europe that we slowed
down. There was one in particular in Brazil that we consciously slowed down just because of the volatility
of those markets. We've restarted them up. But kudos to our folks here in North America, whether it's
the cups build-out, whether it's Fort Worth, whether it's Rome, whether it's all the building we're doing
up where we are here in aerospace, all of them have been going extremely well, and that requires very
close collaboration and communication with the various supply chain, whether it's equipment suppliers,
whether it's construction companies, et cetera. So no impact on that for us other than the things that
we consciously chose to slow down and have now restarted. Second with your recycling, we could spend
hours on this. What I might refer you to, and we can -- happy to take it offline because we had addressed
this very directly, what -- because it varies by country, it varies by region. And the sols for each of the
countries and regions are different. But if you go to our new sustainability report, at -- I think Dan
mentioned ball.com/sustainability, it will all be laid out there in a very transparent way, and we'd be happy
to engage with anyone on this because I think that's what continued success of the beverage can means.
We have to continue improving the already good recycling rates because from an LCA perspective, it
positions the can even stronger relative to PET and relative to glass.

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Okay. Just one other one for me on the capital spending side. I think Dan mentioned that the practical size
of these 2 new plants maybe bigger than anything else you've got here in the states. I think typically, we
think of kind of 4 lines is about the biggest beverage can plants out there. Is there any kind of practical
limit to the size of a beverage can plant that you would want to put in? I mean, could that number be 6 or
7?

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

It could. But remember, then you got to factor in shipping. And you could make it all in one place and
ship it thousands of miles and lose all that money to the freight company. So there's a balance. But
theoretically, you could build something as big as you want. It just -- you got to look at where you're
supplying.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So what is the practical limit, do you think, John?

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

It depends by region. In the Northeast, for example, Northeast and Southwest, where we're talking about
doing it, is the population, that's where the biggest and/or it's growing the fastest, so it makes sense. If
you were to, say, to do it in Iowa, wouldn't make sense. So it very much depends.

And our follow -- our final question is from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I hope everyone is doing well.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Thank you. You too.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I want to come at the U.S. question from a little bit of a different angle. I know you guys don't typically
talk about utilization rates, but I've heard the term full out from virtually everyone. So I'm assuming that's
somewhere in the upper 90s. And I think maybe safe utilization, you guys have talked about before where
you feel comfortable is something more 95%. And so if I take a differential of 3%, that implies that maybe
you guys have already made 3 billion cans more than you otherwise would from higher utilization rates.
And if you're bringing in as an industry, 2.5 billion units, you're actually short 5.5 billion such that this 15
billion, 16 billion units of capacity coming to the market is actually not that big of a deal. Is that what you
were trying to get at, John, before in terms of building this case?

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, as an industry, I tend to -- don't forget there's been new capacity by some of our competitors over
the last 18 months. So they've been benefiting from that. But you're absolutely right. We are running full
out. And as a result, the way you're thinking about strategically, I think, is the right way to think about it.

BALL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

The only other lever that you didn't indicate is working with our customers on lowering safety stock levels.
So that's the other lever where you can get more volume out.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess transitioning over to Europe. You mentioned in the release that you're adding
multiple lines to support market recovery as well as capacity for the North American market. And I'm
assuming that wasn't the intent necessarily when these lines were planned. So I guess, does that imply
sort of a protracted recovery in Europe? And I'm trying to marry it up, I thought I heard you say, Dan,
kind of mid-to-high single-digit volume growth in the back half of the year. And then as a quick follow-up
to that, as some, I guess, energy during production migrates across different parts of the globe, does that
free up some capacity for you guys next year as that ramps up?

Daniel William Fisher
Senior VP & COO of Global Metal Beverage Packaging

Yes. I think -- yes, the 5% to 8% on the back half of the year in Europe is correct. You heard that right.
The -- it's yet to be determined on the bounce back of energy drink or through the convenience channel.
I think that's more or less where you were headed with that question. Some of those companies will be --
they'll go to where they can sell their products. So you might see more multi-packs, right? You might see
that showing up in retail, different than the convenience store channel there.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. But on your capital side, I just want to clarify, we're not putting capital in Europe to export into the
U.S. This is for the long-term growth in Europe. And whether it's the growth we've seen in the U.K. or in
Russia or parts of Eastern Europe, that's where that's going. And we will -- I think you what were also
referencing in terms of energy, it's not as if certain customers are moving filling from Europe to other
places. They're actually adding in other places and keeping what they have in Europe because they see
the growth opportunity in front of them.

Scott C. Morrison
Senior VP & CFO

Okay. Kelly, do we have any final questions?

Operator

No, we have no further phone questions at this time, sir.

John A. Hayes
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Great. Well, thank you, Kelly, and thank you, everyone, for your participation. Everyone stays safe,
stay well, and we look forward to hopefully seeing many of you or virtually at least on our Investor Day on
October 6. Take care.

Operator
That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and we ask that you
please disconnect your lines.
