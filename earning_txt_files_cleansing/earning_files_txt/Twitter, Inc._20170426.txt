Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 earnings conference call
We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; and COO and CFO, Anthony Noto
We hope you've had a chance to read our shareholder letter which was published on our Investor Relations website just a little while ago
Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions
During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants
Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTR
We would also like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2017 and our operational plans and strategies
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially
Also, the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures
Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website
An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack
