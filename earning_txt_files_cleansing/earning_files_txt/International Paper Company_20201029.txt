INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to today's International Paper Third Quarter 2020
Earnings Day Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Guillermo Gutierrez, Vice President, Investor Relations.

Guillermo Gutierrez
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Maria. Good morning, and thank you for joining International Paper's Third Quarter 2020
Earnings Call. Our speakers this morning are Mark Sutton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim
Nicholls, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

There is important information at the beginning of our presentation on Slide 2, including certain legal
disclaimers. For example, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to
risks and uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19.

We will also present certain non-U.S. GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of those figures to U.S.
GAAP financial measures is available on our website. Our website also contains copies of the third quarter
2020 earnings press release and today's presentation slides.

Relative to the Ilim joint venture and Graphic Packaging investments, Slide 2 also provides context around
the financial information and statistical measures presented on those entities.

I will now turn the call over to Mark Sutton.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Guillermo, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. International
Paper delivered solid results and robust cash flows in a dynamic environment. We've generated $1.6 billion
of free cash flow through the first 3 quarters as we continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience
of our company. We're on track to generate $2 billion in free cash flow this year through our early actions
and strong execution.

Relative to demand, recovery trends continue to vary by business and by end-user consumer segments.
Demand for our corrugated packaging accelerated in the third quarter, and that momentum continues in
the fourth quarter.

In fluff pulp, as expected, we experienced seasonally lower demand and destocking across most regions.
In papers, we're in the early stages of recovery as offices and school activities begin to restart. Against
this backdrop, our commercial, supply chain and manufacturing organizations are executing at a high level
to ensure we meet our customers' changing needs, leveraging the scale and flexibility of our system and
optimizing our costs.

The company's solid performance in the third quarter reinforces our financial strength and commitment to
our capital allocation framework.

Turning now to Slide 4, which shows our third quarter results. Operating earnings were $0.71 per share,
which included an unfavorable Ilim foreign exchange noncash impact of $0.14 in the quarter. Sales
improved sequentially and came ahead of our expectations, driven by strong demand in our North
American packaging business. EBITDA increased by nearly $100 million sequentially, even as planned
maintenance outage expenses stepped up by about $80 million.

As already mentioned, we generated robust free cash flow in the third quarter, which we continue to apply
in a manner consistent with our capital allocation framework. During the third quarter, we reduced debt

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

by about $800 million, bringing year-to-date debt reduction to $1.1 billion. Earlier this month, the Board
of Directors approved the fourth quarter dividend, bringing the full year authorizations for our dividend to
$800 million.

Moving to Slide 5. As I reflect on our performance this year, it reaffirms my admiration and appreciation
for our 50,000 employees worldwide who continue to perform at a high-level by taking care of each other
and our customers. I'm especially great with our frontline teams in manufacturing and converting facilities
around the world.

We remain absolutely committed to our COVID-19 principles, and we'll continue to focus on what we need
to do to further strengthen the company for all of our stakeholders in the short term and in the long term.

Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our fourth quarter outlook. Tim?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Mark. Good morning. Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 6. Third
quarter operating earnings were better than we expected, driven by a strong commercial and operating
performance as well as outstanding cost management. Higher volume contributed to improved fixed
cost absorption in the quarter, which is captured in operations and costs. Third quarter performance also
benefited from onetime items, which favorably impacted operations and costs.

Looking at the bridge, price to mix was essentially flat. Volume was favorable, driven by strong demand
for corrugated packaging in North America and improved demand for Printing Papers across all regions.
Operations and costs benefited from improved fixed cost absorption on higher volume.

The business continue -- the businesses continue to do an excellent job managing costs and delivered
strong operational performance to mitigate the impact of hurricanes in the quarter. As mentioned earlier,
onetime items contribute favorably to operations and costs, adding about $30 million or $0.06 per share,
with each business seeing about $10 million in benefits.

As expected, maintenance outage cost were a drag in the third quarter, which is our highest planned
maintenance outage quarter this year. I'll remind you that in response to COVID-19, we made significant
adjustments to the scope and timing of our maintenance outage plan. We now expect the full year
maintenance outage expense to be $450 million compared to $585 million in the original forecast that we
shared with you at the beginning of the year.

Input costs were favorable, mostly due to lower-recovered fiber cost. We did experience higher energy and
distribution costs as we exited the third quarter, which we see as a positive sign of an improving economy.

Corporate expenses were lower than expected, benefiting from about $20 million in foreign currency
adjustments. Tax expense was lower by $0.07 per share in the third quarter, with an effective tax rate of
19% compared to 26% in the second quarter. Most of this was related to adjustments to our federal tax
provision after finalizing our 2019 tax return.

Equity earnings includes a noncash foreign exchange loss of $0.14 in the third quarter for Ilim as
compared to a $0.09 gain in the second quarter.

Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 7. The business performed well,
driven by strong commercial and operational performance. Across the segment, price and mix was stable.
Volume improved sequentially across all regions with strong demand in North America where demand
accelerated in the third quarter in just about every segment.

We're seeing the benefits of strong at-home consumption, and we're in the early stages of a recovery in
foodservice. We continue to see very strong double-digit growth in e-commerce with increased consumer
reliance on e-commerce as a buying channel.

More recently, we're seeing better performance for industrial and durable goods across a broad spectrum
of the end-use segments, especially that is linked with construction and home improvement. Our export

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

containerboard shipments were lower in the third quarter due to the strong demand in North America and
the impact of weather events.

With that said, underlying demand in our export channels picked up as we entered the seasonally stronger
fourth quarter. Our mills and converting facilities performed well. We managed direct and indirect cost
well, while fixed cost absorption improved on higher volume, all of which helped mitigate the impact of
precautionary downtime related to the hurricanes.

Maintenance outage costs were lower than expected as we descoped and shifted some outage activity to
the fourth quarter to better support customer demand in the third quarter. Input costs were favorable,
driven by lower recovered fiber costs. We did see higher energy and distribution costs as we exited the
third quarter, along with a sharp increase in natural gas costs from the COVID-related lows as economies
reopened.

Lastly, an update on Riverdale 15, the white top linerboard conversion. The ramp-up is progressing
ahead of schedule and qualification activities are advancing rapidly through our box system. As a
reminder, this investment benefits our box customers who value high-impact graphics and strengthens our
containerboard offerings.

Moving to Slide 8, we've often talked about how we're investing to enhance our capabilities. And while
that is often associated with investments we make in our mills and box systems, another important
investment we're making is around innovation and enhancing customer-specific solutions. It comes back
to the fundamental notion that boxes are tailored to meet each of our customer's unique needs.

We're accelerating innovation to further our advantages in faster-growing box segments. We developed
eBOS, a software platform that enables our teams of experts to work with our e-commerce customers to
determine the optimal design and suite of boxes to minimize packaging waste and reduce their freight
costs.

For our Printing customers, we developed a recyclable moisture barrier that allows poultry beef and pork
boxes to compete -- to complete the fiber cycle. For our fresh produce customers, we provide a full-
service machinery platform that's tailored to meet each customer's packaging needs. These are just a
few examples of how we provide value to our customers to ensure they have the right box with the right
support services for each particular application.

If we look at Slide 9, a quick update on the demand outlook for containerboard exports. Demand improved
as we move through the third quarter, and customer inventories are currently normal to the low side.
We're seeing an expected seasonal pick up in the Mediterranean region, with an especially robust citrus
season in Northern Africa and a solid start in Spain.

We're also seeing a nice pick up in demand in China for industrial -- as industrial production recovers.
And in Latin America, favorable weather conditions are supportive to continued solid demand for our
banana and pineapple boxes. Our export containerboard channels provide good insight to box demand
expectations across key regions, given a typical 60-day lead time.

If we turn to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 10, price to mix was favorable on price flow through. Volume
was stable with a mix of about 75% fluff and specialty pulp. Operations and costs were impacted by
unabsorbed fixed costs, which was partially offset by about $10 million of favorable onetime items,
including higher seasonal electricity sales.

Maintenance outage costs increased as planned, and input costs increased on higher wood and energy
costs. Taking a closer look at fluff pulp demand in the quarter, we experienced seasonally weaker demand
and destocking across most regions. This follows a rather strong pull-forward in demand during the first
half of the year. Overall, demand is stable going into the fourth quarter with improved fluff demand offset
by weak demand for printing and writing grades. Tissue demand remains healthy.

If we turn to Slide 11 and look at Printing Papers, demand improved in just about every region from
COVID restriction lows in the second quarter, but remain well-below prior year levels. Across the segment,
price and mix decreased primarily due to lower export pricing in Latin America and lower pricing in Europe.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Volume improved across all regions, with year-over-year demand improving from about minus 30% in the
second quarter to about minus 15% in the third quarter in our key regions.

Operations and costs benefited from improved fixed cost absorption as economic downtime decreased by
225,000 tons sequentially across all regions. We also benefited from about $10 million in onetime items,
primarily related to COVID subsidies and green energy credits in Europe.

The business continues to generate meaningful cash flows by focusing on cost management and working
capital. We exited the quarter with our inventories at our target range based on the current demand
environment. As we think about recovery, we saw a meaningful improvement in demand in the third
quarter. We know uncertainty remains while COVID restrictions persist. However, we do expect the
recovery to accelerate as economies fully reopen.

Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 12. We had an equity loss of $33 million in the quarter. This includes a
noncash foreign exchange loss on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt, of which IP's after-tax portion
was $55 million or $0.14 a share. Volume improved sequentially and year-over-year, driven by higher
softwood pulp exports to China.

However, price and mix decreased on lower pulp pricing. Operations were solid, and maintenance outages
were well executed. The third quarter was Ilim's highest maintenance outage quarter in 2020.

Turning to Slide 13, we'll cover the outlook. We continue to operate in a dynamic environment with
demand trend varying by business and end-use customer segments. As mentioned, demand for
corrugated packaging accelerated in the third quarter, and that momentum continues in the fourth quarter.

Demand for fluff pulp is normalizing following the inventory destocking which occurred in the third quarter.
In Printing Papers we're seeing a modest recovery, although demand challenges persist.

Taking a closer look at Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to
decrease by $5 million, with strong box demand mostly offsetting the impact of 3 less shipping days in
the fourth quarter. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $15 million, including the non-
repeat of onetime benefits in the third quarter. Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage
expense is expected to decrease by $45 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $20 million,
mostly due to higher energy and transportation costs.

In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to decrease by $5 million. Volume is expected to be stable.
Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings by $20 million, which again includes the non-repeat
of favorable items in the third quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $4 million,
and input costs are expected to be stable.

Turning to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to improve $20
million on higher seasonal demand in Latin America. Operations and costs are expected to lower earnings
by $25 million, mostly due to the non-repeat of onetime benefits in the third quarter and higher seasonal
energy costs. Maintenance outages expense is expected to decrease by $16 million and input costs are
expected to increase by $5 million. Lastly, under equity earnings, you will see our outlook for the Ilim joint
venture.

Turning to Slide 14. As Mark said in his opening remarks, we're on track to generate $2 billion in free cash
flow in 2020. In our first quarter earnings call, we highlighted the company's financial flexibility and some
of the cash levers we had available to enhance our cash generation in what has been undoubtedly one of
the most uncertain environments we've faced. Given the economic uncertainty at the time, we chose to
pull some of these levers, including capital spending. In addition, COVID-19 changed the way we worked
in 2020, and choices were made around our planned maintenance outages and other spending priorities,
which we expect will contribute about 15% of our free cash flow this year. Our early actions and strong
execution across the company are enabling us to deliver another year of strong free cash flow generation,
reflecting the resilience of International Paper.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Turning to Slide 15. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation choices in the third
quarter. Debt repayment is a priority. During the third quarter, we reduced debt by nearly $800 million,
which brings debt reduction to $1.1 billion through the third quarter.

We've essentially eliminated all bond maturities through the end of 2021 and improved our maturity
profile over the next decade. I'd also note that we've reduced annual interest expense by nearly $60
million on debt reduction activity through the third quarter. You can expect additional debt reduction in the
fourth quarter with an expected debt-to-EBITDA of around 3x at year-end on a Moody's basis.

Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. Our Board of
Directors authorized the fourth quarter dividend earlier this month. With this decision, we will have
returned about $800 million to shareholders through the fourth quarter.

Looking at investments, we're on track with our $800 million capital spending target in 2020, which
includes the Riverdale conversion as well as other funding priorities to ensure we have the right
capabilities in our U.S. box business.

With regard to our investment in Graphic Packaging, we received $250 million in cash in the third quarter
related to the second transaction. This is the maximum amount permitted for each period under the
agreement. Our ownership position is now approximately 14.8%.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Tim, for all the detail. Look, this is our third earnings call under the realities of COVID-19. And
as I've said from the outset, International Paper entered this crisis in a position of strength. It really starts
with the talent and commitment of our employees. That strong position is reinforced by our capabilities
to provide the best solutions for our customers and by our customers themselves. We are partnered with
many of the winning customers in multiple segments across our 3 businesses.

And our strong position is supported by our world-class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities, all of
which contributed once again to our solid performance and strong cash generation in the quarter.

I'm pleased with our performance and really excited about our strong outlook for the fourth quarter, and
the momentum we're generating, especially in our packaging business.
And with that, we're ready to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo Securities.

Gabrial Shane Hajde
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

First question, Mark, has to do with the Global Cellulose Fibers business. And from my perspective, quite
frankly, I don't think you guys are getting much credit for it. So I recognize that where you guys play, this
is somewhat of a subsegment of a larger pulp complex. So I'm curious if there's something unique about
kind of this cycle outside of the obvious COVID impact that we're seeing in printing tissue and towel that is
negatively impacting kind of the supply/demand dynamics globally.

And then, relatedly, I think you guys made a management change here. And given Mr. Hamic's
background would seemingly imply more of the fixes might be commercial. But I'm curious if there's
anything on the operational side that might be contemplated. We didn't see much in the way of footprint
consolidation post-Weyerhaeuser.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

No, those are 3 really good questions about our Global Cellulose Fibers business. First one, on the cycle,
I think there's nothing unique about this particular cycle. If you think about '18, it was at the peak of
pricing, the peak of demand. '19 was a somewhat normal reset. And then as we were turning the corner,
in the beginning at '20, prices were moving up, volume was moving up, COVID hit. Temporarily, that was a
benefit.

But now with the demand decline in Printing Papers, a certain amount of softwood pulp is stranded. So
there's a supply issue that's unique to this cycle, but it's really COVID-related and it's related to the
demand decline in Printing Papers. Some of that softwood pulp is finding its way into absorbent products
at the margins, and that's creating, what I believe, is a temporary structural issue.

On the operations, I've talked before about what the business needs to be successful post the combination
of IP and Weyerhaeuser, and that is moving the mix to about 85% absorbent products, so fluff and
specialties; minimal position, but a small position in market pulp to balance the system. And then having
the cost structure of the best mills, which tended to be some of the ones we acquired, be the cost
structure of most of the mills. And some of that is going to take some investment. We've developed some
of the projects, and now it's a matter of timing those investments. So improving the mix, improving the
cost structure -- the manufacturing cost structure, and then operating commercially in an excellent way
through the normal cyclicality.

As far as the management change, you mentioned, Tom Hamick. His background suits what the business
needs right now very well. He's had tremendous success commercially in different businesses in the
company. And after we did the integration and we put the teams together, which was done very well, he
does have the right skill set for where we're going forward. So we're excited about the role he'll play in
that business.

And we believe in the business long term. We made this investment. If I take you back to the end of 2016,
in order to position IP in another fiber-advantage, growth-oriented market, albeit small market, it was a
play for the longer term. And I think as you think about the demand drivers for diapers, adult incontinence
and the other absorbent products, it's got good fundamental demand dynamics around the world. We have
to level-set and improve our supply position, mainly in the ways that I described.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

I'll try to be brief here with the follow-up as it relates to the Industrial Packaging segment. Obviously,
demand has been somewhat episodic with the COVID impact. But I'm curious kind of if you can share
anything on what you're hearing from your customers in terms of inventory levels. We're hearing that
things are pretty well depleted. And really, we're just seeing the benefits of sell-through right now. But
just curious if you have any insight there.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

It is, by segment, really, Gabe, a story by segment. And we are seeing some very positive trends in areas
that were hurt a little bit. And part of it is, I think, inventory depletion. So the center -- processed foods
center of the grocery store has picked up very nicely.

We talked a lot about e-commerce. That's up a lot, and it's staying up a lot. We began to see some
improvement as restaurants opened. We have to see what that looks like as we head into the fall and
winter, predictable case load of COVID moving up and what different governments do to deal with that.
But really encouraging news across the board sequentially. But even on the year-over-year basis, the e-
commerce channel is an order of magnitude different than it has been. We think some of that will stay.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

You highlighted some of the investments for customer-tailored solutions for e-commerce and protein.
I'm just wondering, from a big-picture perspective, if you can talk about the kind of returns you get from
those investments. And then for the products themselves, if there's a margin differential or just how you
get paid for those solutions when you're on the ground with a customer?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

So on the examples that Tim shared are just a few examples of addressing the needs of our box
customers, and then that flows back through our value chain, all the way to type of substrates and
containerboard that we would make to make those boxes.

And if it's a capital investment, we're always looking at north of 20% returns. But some of them are not
capital investments, they're design investments. And that's what we tried to highlight in this particular
earnings call that the talent level of our go-to-market strategy and our designers is coming up with unique
products and unique services that can run on our equipment that we have, so the capital investment is
small.

Where we see the payoff is 2 ways. Usually, there's a margin benefit if, in fact, it's a total cost of
ownership, meaning it lowers the customer's cost; and two, it positions us in a differentiated way in a very
competitive market to where we grow our position with a certain customer because we have an offering
that's just enough different from the competitive set that it helps us to grow our position.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. And then just sticking with Industrial Packaging, there's a containerboard price hike
that's been announced. I'm just wondering, to the extent that you can, if you could talk about sort of the
typical timing of price increases on boxes, how much, maybe using history as a guide, might show up in
4Q versus 1Q versus 2Q next year?

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Yes. Anthony, its Tim. So we see it following a normal path. For us, we might pick up a little bit in the
fourth quarter, but it's very minimal. Every contract is different. But most of our contracts allow for 1
quarter lag, and so we start seeing the real benefits in the first quarter and then continuing on in the
second next year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

About packaging, obviously, demand really seems to be picking up a lot. If we could get your quarter-to-
date box shipments, that would be helpful. And maybe even more importantly, what do you think is going
on, assuming that you have seen some of this really strong pick up lately that we're hearing from others
as well? And how sustainable is it?

Do you think folks are rebuilding inventories that got very low? And so to a certain extent, our -- what we
saw before was understated or is it more potentially buyers getting ahead of the price increase? Any color
you could give would be helpful.

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Mark, its Tim. I don't think it's getting ahead of the price increase. People just don't warehouse
boxes. They take up too much space. I think of something what Mark said earlier, there is some
replenishing of supply chains that's going on. But there's also the continued opening of economies as well.
And so we've seen pick ups in the third quarter. August was better than July. September was better than
August. It's continuing in October.

Right now, nearing the end of the month, we're looking at about a 6% increase on a daily basis in our box
system. But it's really strong e-commerce. That continues to grow. And I think that some of these other
segments starting to come back. One thing that we see a little bit of a shift just on durable goods, it looks
like people are substituting travel for durable goods purchases or maybe making other trade-offs like that.
So we've seen an acceleration as we've come in from the third into the fourth. If you look at the market
overall on a daily basis, the market is up a little bit over 1 point year-to-date. So in an upset condition,
pretty good growth. And I think like Mark said, it'll vary by segment as we go through the fourth quarter
and into next year.

Mark Adam Weintraub
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Okay. Super. And just you made that comment that export market is looking strong and general demand
picking up. And one area, China, you mentioned industrial getting a bit better. I guess one of the big
questions is, how is China going to be dealing with their fiber issues with no OCC going in potentially next
year?

And as you look at it, could China become an increasingly important buyer of kraftliner from North
America? And how important a factor could this be in the global equation?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Well, so we -- our base case is we take them at their word. And we think all imports of OCC will end, like
they say it will. It will be a fiber-balanced equation, as you suggest. I think some of it will get satisfied
by market pulp for certain end uses. And yes, I think there could be a step-up in not only kraftliner
purchases, but probably recycled pulp purchases as well. That may take a little bit of time to fully play out.
And as to where it comes from, I think it's going to come from a lot of different places.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Chairman & CEO

I would just add, Mark, that the highest-quality recovered fiber in the world comes from the U.S. market
because of the high concentration of kraftliner boxes. And while China may not take any as OCC, it will
probably take some of that feedstock as a version of recycled pulp or processed onetime before it goes
into China. And in the region, there are some people doing that.

And I think there'll be some people doing that from the U.S. with high-quality recovered fiber, minimal
cost input to clean it up, roll it, and then I think it probably qualifies as input fiber to China. But we'll see
how that plays out. No one knows exactly how, but the simple math says that there's a tremendous fiber
need for the growing Chinese economy that will have to come from somewhere.

Our next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar of Morgan Stanley.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

With the Riverdale project, you mentioned the start-up being ahead of schedule. I was just wondering if
you could just talk about your plans for ramping volume, particularly with a stronger near-term demand
backdrop. And are you seeing any significant differences in the supply and demand dynamics of white top
versus traditional linerboard?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

I think, on Riverdale, we're really pleased with the ramp-up once we started up. So the ramp-up of the
start-up is ahead of schedule. The project itself, obviously, was impacted in the final stages by trying to
finish a large construction project during a pandemic, but it's running well. The quality is really, really
good; in some cases, exceeding our design expectations.

And we will adjust that product, as we've said before, that white top liner, into our system in place of some
lower-quality white top we were making, and then we'll just balance the brown and white. But we don't
see any significant demand shifts right now and the need for white top other than the growth drivers we
saw when we approved the project. So we're excited about it. It's going to help our box customers. It's
going to help some of our open market customers who make their own boxes. Some of this product goes
into the premium segments, premium wines, premium beverages. And there's a pretty strong demand for
some of that. And probably, some of it's related to the way people are confined to home.

Neel Kumar
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's helpful. And then there's also an article recently about Amazon, again, looking to reduce the
amount of packaging it uses and some shifting towards padded mailers rather than boxes. E-commerce
demand has obviously been very strong this year. But I was curious if you were seeing any evidence of
mailers taking share from boxes. And in general, how are you thinking about the efficiency of packaging in
the e-commerce channel over time and the impact on these type of initiatives?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

So we try to look at the solution that the customer needs, whether it's a box or a mailer. We try to
obviously steer customers towards a sustainable choice, which is fiber-based, and we see growth in both.
Mailers are used for certain type of items where it's the better solution. Maybe some of those items were
in boxes before mailers became more effective. But we see growth in the box segment. We see growth in
the mailer segment. We participate a bit on the kraft paper side of that.

And when Tim talked about this eBOS technology, we are proactively helping all of our e-commerce
customers optimize their packaging suite. So the right-sized box -- if it's a box; and in many cases, a

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

box is definitely the right solution given the supply chain it's got to travel through -- but if it's a piece of
clothing, maybe a mailer works fine. But we are actively working proactively to get the waste down, to
make the packaging experience for our customers cost effective, and for the consumer to know that they
are doing something that's sustainable. If they recycle that box, and 92% of them are recycled, but that
goes back in the stream, and it's just a good overall solution to commerce. And so we're actively involved
in that, Neel, and view it as a positive, not a negative.

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Mark, just one question on the free sheet business. You took a good bit of downtime in your North
American papers business this quarter as you did last quarter. If you assume that current demand levels
stay roughly where they are, how much oversupply would you say you have? And after having just
converted Riverdale, are you more inclined to potentially convert another paper machine to containerboard
or to shut a machine if you eventually decide that you need to take more capacity actions in that
business?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Adam, that's a lot of hypotheticals in terms -- we don't -- well, first of all, we don't think paper demand
will stay at the level it's at. It will recover, probably not 100% of what the COVID impact did to it, but
some of it will recover as schools and offices open to some degree more than they are now.

You're right, we took Riverdale out, not knowing that this was coming, but it actually was a benefit
because it reduced our supply in the face of a real big demand decline.

I've said this before, and it will continue to be our guiding principle on containerboard conversions, we'll
only make investments in containerboard production, whether it's a conversion or a greenfield or anything
else based on the box and containerboard market. We won't do that based on the issues in another
product line like uncoated freesheet in this question.

Sometimes the timing doesn't matchup perfectly, and you don't want to make a bad decision with an
asset. But that's really what would drive it. So right now, we've got the ability -- we haven't done it in
a while because we typically run uncoated free sheet relatively full. But we have the ability to throttle
that business with the same techniques we use in our containerboard business, so that we can adjust our
output to the demand we have.

And obviously, if you never thought the demand was coming back, you would make some more permanent
decisions than carrying the cost of economic downtime as we call it. But we'll cross that bridge when we
come to it. But what you need to know, though, is the principle for making more containerboard is about
making more boxes, not about another asset that needs something to do.

Adam Jesse Josephson
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Sure. And I appreciate that, Mark. And just one on the box business. So you have a slide in your
presentation in which you compare economic indicators to box demand. Obviously, the tightest correlation
is with nondurable industrial production. And as you know, CPG volumes this year have been extraordinary
because of COVID. I think P&G had 16% U.S. sales growth, which is almost unheard of. And we've seen
that all year.

So I'm just wondering, what you would extrapolate from this year's experience in terms of box demand, if
anything? I mean obviously, consumers' behavior has been so unusual in so many ways that I find it hard
to extrapolate much, if anything, into future years unless we continue to be stuck at home for years to
come. What are you extrapolating into next year from this year's experience?

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, a couple of things on the nondurables. I think correlation still holds. I believe box performance is
outperforming nondurables because so much of the nondurable collection of market segments is not
box-intensive. So some of those nondurable items are actually down, and the box-intensive portions of
nondurable goods is up a lot.

So I think the correlation is going to hold. I hope and I think we're not going to be locked in our homes.
So some of this demand and channel movement will settle out. A couple of takeaways, though, just
sitting here today. I do think we've been at this long enough, and some of our customers are saying this,
that some consumer behavior changes will be pretty sticky. I think people are going to eat and go out a
little different. So I think some of the demand and shifts in the food channel are going to stay with us,
maybe not 100%. And then secondly, you have a lot of first-time new adopters to doing business in an e-
commerce kind of way. And I think those people have had good experiences, largely.

And some of the retail channel we'll continue to be in an e-commerce kind of channel. And for us, for IP,
given the investments we've made and the position we have, we believe that's a positive. The rest of it's
tough to call. Probably, it settles out to something like we had before. But given this wasn't a 1-month or
2-month issue, I think behaviors and habits are beginning to change and they'll probably last a while.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

My first question was -- is kind of a tag on to Adam's question. What we've been trying to push companies
on during earnings season so far is what change in behavior has occurred that will be sticky, to use your
term, Mark, on a going-forward basis, specific to e-commerce because of COVID. And so I don't know that
you're in a position at this juncture, 6 months into this, to determine what the incremental pickup might
be from this changed behavior. But if you had any initial goalposts that your customers are sharing with
you, or again, if you could affirm where you think this increase in demand will be most likely to stay at this
new normal level, that would be great. And then I had a quick question on operations.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, as -- George, as Tim said, when you take everything into account, box demand in a bit of a crazy
year, is up 1%. If the year wasn't so crazy, maybe the normal correlations are there and box demand is up
about the same amount or 0.5% or 1.5%, the range we've seen in the last couple of years. I think if some
of this e-commerce activity does remain, and we believe it will because of what I said about first adopters
and people buying things they never bought before, that tends to drive some incremental purchases in
some cases.

I think the big unknown is how fast, if ever, do people fully return to the way they spent money before
and the things they spent money on: fuel, heavy travel, the service industry. That discretionary income
tends to be now flowing into consuming goods, whether it's home improvement goods, luxury items or
basic necessities of food and supplies for your home. And that is a much more box-intensive way to spend
money from our perspective. And we believe that better level of that will continue well beyond when the
all-clear is sounded.

George Leon Staphos
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Understood. We'll keep evaluating. You mentioned some of the things that you're investing in earlier in
the presentation. Are there areas that you can share at this juncture, capabilities that you need to further
invest in to continue to participate and lead in this new world relative to corrugated? Again, maybe it's
additional print capability, maybe it's more -- I don't know how the small box initiative worked on e-

14

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

commerce, but maybe it's more investments like that. Is there anything that you feel from a platform
standpoint from -- and really more in converting that you need to invest in?

And then on the mill side, we've seen a dramatic drop-off in demand and then a dramatic resurgence
in demand. You're not alone. Other companies have also pulled in some of their maintenance probably
because you can't get people to facilities because of COVID. What are you doing now to make sure that,
especially on the mill side, you keep the reliability, you avoid unplanned outages because this is a lot of
stress on a very, very capital-intensive and important portion of your business?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

So George, those are 2 great questions. Let me hit the investment opportunity. You basically said it, it's
almost all in converting. It has a lot to do with small box and e-commerce configured plants that the
physical profile of an e-commerce blank for a box is smaller. So most efficiently run on the right-sized
machines. So we've actually evolved to a percentage of our several hundred box plants are becoming e-
commerce-oriented plants. And they look different.

And if we ever build a new one from the ground up, which I think we probably will, it'll look different
physically as well. Building size, and you'll have more of those located right near the fulfillment centers.
And that's where our investment opportunity is. There's always an opportunity, and we continue to see
it, to improve printing capability, and we're investing in that. And then sometimes, it's just pure capacity.
We don't have enough box making capacity in a certain region of the country. And we have to add it
organically or inorganically. And you've seen us do it both ways.

With respect to the investment question in the mills, we are blessed to have 16 containerboard mills,
now 16.5, if you take half of Riverdale. We have a big system that's flexible. It is going to be wide open
sometimes like 2018, and it will be less than that like it was in 2019. We're always going to try to keep
that balance right. So we're going to look at it over a several year period and decide whether we have too
much or not enough capacity. Investing in the reliability, you set aside the recycled mills, which don't have
the complexity of a pulp mill and a power generation unit; those are pretty easy to manage your reliability
spending. It's mostly about reliability in the paper machine, and we do that through largely noncapital
investments.

On the integrated mills that take in wood, make their own energy and pulp the wood, that's where the
big maintenance capital is and that's where the risk management is. So we have a hierarchy process
where we -- when we cut back on maintenance, we don't cut back on the maintenance that could result
in multiple days down. Usually, that's in power generation or in pulping. And so we would do that work
and we would forgo some work that's in the paper machine area that even if it failed, our teams can get
it back up and running with a repair, albeit maybe costly, but a repair within 24 hours or so. So that's how
we approach that, so that we just have a risk management framework that doesn't leave our mills subject
to major large outages.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover of D.A. Davidson.

Steven Pierre Chercover
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

It's similar to what Gabe led off with. So you guys used to talk a lot about industry structure and behavior
in the context of containerboard. And I think the results demonstrate how important that is in generating
good returns.

And I would also think that the structure in fluff pulp or absorbent fibers is equally compelling. So when
you hit your 85-15 target mix, do you think the returns in Cellulose will be similar to what you're doing in
Industrial Packaging?

Mark Stephan Sutton

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Steve, I think our goal is to get the Cellulose Fibers business to the cost of capital. But the Industrial
Packaging business has probably got higher returns and probably always will. There's a couple of
differences, though. The marketing in Industrial Packaging is a lot bigger. Fluff pulp is a smaller market.
So it's residing in a very large pulp ecosystem of softwood market pulp, hardwood pulp, and then
specialties at the top and pure commodities at the bottom. So it's got a lot of activity around it.

So inside of that segment, the structure looks really good. But outside of the segment, there's a lot of
activity. And that will play out over time. But our goal is to get solidly to the cost of capital through a cycle
that's part on our margin on the revenue and profit side on the top, and that's part on just reducing our
cost. And then finally, the right mix, as you mentioned, on the 85-15. We see a path to getting it there.
That will correspond to some level of EBITDA. There's opportunities for us to work on the footprint, as I
think Gabe asked as well, and we have plans to do all of that.

Steven Pierre Chercover
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Well, I thought that IP had evolved to the point where earning your cost of capital wasn't enough. You had
to be generating in excess for it to be compelling.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Yes, that's correct. We believe the best value creation, if you look at S&P 500 companies that perform the
best and have first quartile TSR, they tend to have a 200 basis point spread from their cost of capital. So
we did that with the entire company. If you followed us for a while, International Paper, as a whole, wasn't
at its cost of capital. So the first goal is get it there, and then you build the spread, and we fully expect to
be able to do that.

And by the way, we have a spread to our cost of capital in the entire company now, and that's our goal
in each component of the company. But it won't be democratic and linear. There'll be some parts of the
company that have a 5- or 10-year run well above cost of capital, and there'll be others that are right at
cost of capital. But you've seen us take action on businesses and parts of businesses that we've concluded
we don't think we're the right owner to get it there.

Steven Pierre Chercover
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Sure. And then switching to containerboard, I was just wondering if you could quantify the financial
impacts. And I know that they're already calibrated to the guidance, but how much of those hurricanes
and that direct show in Iowa hurt you in the second quarter -- sorry, in Q3? How would you characterize
your inventories? And finally, to follow-up on containerboard, are you -- would you say that you're growing
faster than the market or are you still walking away from some suboptimal business?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So on inventories, we're pretty low at the moment. And I think we referenced that in some of the
prepared remarks, just in terms of how we manage the channels during the quarter. Where we had to,
we pulled back in some areas around export because we had such strong demand in North America. And
now we've given the flexibility of the system and the ability to recover, we're on a better footing. And so
we're increasing volume to the export channels in the fourth quarter, which is good because it's seasonally
stronger anyway.

On the first part of your question, just in terms of the storms, through all of our operations and everything
and being able to flex back and forth and move outages around, we feel like we offset most of the impact.
So on a net-net basis, not much.

And the final question was, were you walking away for some business that's just not lucrative enough?

We always manage our mix. We don't talk about how we handle segments or customers, but yes, we're
always trying to improve the quality of our mix across all of our businesses.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Mark, Tim, I wondered, could either of you just help us in kind of unbundling sort of what the activity in
your box business has been by different markets this year? And in particular, I guess, how much that e-
commerce business has grown for IP year-to-date?

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Well, Mark, we don't give absolute numbers on that. But if you remember what I said last quarter, it was
a cumbersome way to say it, but I think I said, orders of magnitude double-digit growth. So we were
growing in double-digit percentages with one in front of it before 2020, and we are significantly higher
than that in growth. And that number or that range that I talked about in the second quarter -- on the
second quarter call continues to be in the same range and a little bit stronger. So this is a significant
uptick from, let's say, '19 and '18 and '17 where we were at double-digit levels, and it's just several times
that.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And then just on supply in both containerboard and boxes, can you talk about how you're managing
particularly that Newport, Indiana mill? Because I think I had heard that you might be shifting that out of
containerboard and back to gypsum facing paper. And then also just where you're at on the box capacity.
Because I'm getting some reports from people who say IP is so full right now that they're farming out
business to independent converters.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

Why don't I ask Tim to cover some of that detail? Yes, it's a pretty dynamic environment. Your memory is
pretty good on Newport. So Tim, why don't you take us through that?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Mark. Mark, Newport was a facility that produced not only white top liner, recycled white
top liner, but also gypsum facing board. So if you remember, when we decided to make the investment in
Riverdale, not only did we get a better sheet, a virgin sheet, better brightness, color and smoothness, but
it frees up the Newport facility to, over time, be dedicated to the gypsum product fully. And we like that
market. We really appreciate the customers we have in it, and we think it's good business for us.

Mark Stephan Sutton
Chairman & CEO

On your question about the box business, we -- as you know, Mark, we provide containerboard primarily
to our own box system, but also to the open market where we have long-term partners, whether they're
making sheets and then feeding the sheet plant network. And so if that's what you're forming outcome
makes, that's not new for us. We have partners in every type of channel that ultimately gets to a box. And

I would say, all of those channels are very busy and very strong right now for us. So that may be what
you're picking up, I'm not sure.

Mark William Wilde
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Last one for me, Mark, just to help us with modeling. As we think about this price increase, is it
reasonable to assume that all your corrugated volume has some links to the Pulp & Paper Week indexes?
And if not, what percent of the business might be on other mechanisms?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. No, there's a big part of it, Mark, that is linked to our references. It's not direct, but references
movement in the published price list or index. But we don't talk publicly about what those percentages
are. We have a variety of customers where prices, it's set on a time increment basis. And contracts are
written around those types of price mechanisms. So not 100%, it varies by customer and sometimes by
segment as well.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, our last question comes from the last line of Mark Connelly of Stephens.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I'll try to keep these quick. You mentioned the higher wood and energy costs in the pulp segment. Was the
wood cost mostly weather-related or was there something else there?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

No. I think it was mostly weather, Mark.

Mark William Connelly
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then just very last question. I'm just trying to do a little bit of math. In North
America, did your containerboard system run full if you exclude the impacts you had with hurricane and
maintenance?

Timothy S. Nicholls
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I mean we're -- like I said, inventories are on the low side right now. And we're working hard to cover
our customer commitments, and we even pulled back and redirected from the export channel where we
could. So yes, we're running as hard as we can right now.

And ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Chairman and
CEO, Mark Sutton, for closing remarks.
