Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Sylvia and I'll be your operator for today's
call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you may begin.

Alicia A. Charity
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Sylvia, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's first quarter earnings call. On the
call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer.
Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.

Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will
see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to
various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations.
Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials
and on our website at www.ir.ameriprise.com.

Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's
expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking
statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of
factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements
can be found in our first quarter 2021 earnings release, our 2020 annual report to shareholders, our 2020
10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.

On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the first quarter. Below that,
you see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our
business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful
trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted
operating results.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Good morning. Thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. As you saw in yesterday's release,
Ameriprise is off to a strong start in 2021. We're continuing the positive momentum from the past several
quarters, as you can see in our first quarter metrics and financial results.

Regarding the environment, equity markets continue to rally in the first quarter as vaccinations increased
and activity accelerated with the U.S. beginning to open back up. The economy is gaining strength with
the further fiscal stimulus as well as better employment data.

With this backdrop, key for us is that we remain focused on serving our clients. Engagement is high,
activity is strong, and we're bringing in record client flows across the business. We ended the quarter
with assets under management and administration of 36% to $1.14 trillion, a new high. In addition, we
recently announced the strategic acquisition of the BMO EMEA Asset Management business.

Taking a step back, and looking at Ameriprise overall, I feel really good. We're executing well and
delivering on our strategy for growth that we discussed with you. We continue to transform Ameriprise
with Wealth Management and Asset Management now representing over 75% of operating earnings.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

You've seen the financials. Revenues are up 10% to over $3 billion. Earnings per share also increased
nicely in the quarter of 27% ex the NOL benefit a year ago, even with low short-term interest rates this
year versus last year's quarter, and ROE remains very strong at 30%.

While we continue to invest strongly in the business, we are managing expenses thoughtfully. With
our strong financial foundation and free cash flow generation, we returned more than $490 million to
shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our ongoing repurchase program, which is comparable
to the last few quarters. Yesterday, we announced another 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, our 17th
increase since becoming public 16 years ago.

Let's discuss Advice & Wealth Management, where we've been executing well and driving growth. We're
benefiting from the strategic investments we've been making to deliver a differentiated client/adviser
experience built on advice. We've been on a multiyear journey to take our client experience to the next
level.

A big part of that is the training and support we provide advisers and ensuring that the new digital
tools and capabilities are fully integrated within their technology ecosystem. One of our more significant
investments, our CRM platform, is increasingly serving as the hub for advisers allowing them to
collaborate with clients while driving efficiencies. And we've seen good uptake as advisers integrate these
capabilities into their practices.

This strong engagement is helping to drive good client activity, excellent flows and new client acquisition
as we continue to build on our momentum from last year. Our total client net flows was strong at $9.3
billion in the quarter, with total client assets of 36% to $762 billion. Our investment advisory business
continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were more than $10 billion, up 55% over last
year. This is another record for us and reinforces our excellent client adviser engagement and focus on
organic growth.

Transactional activity continued gaining strength in the first quarter, picking up 12% over last year, with
good volume across a range of product solutions. Even with clients putting more of the cash back to work,
client cash balances remain elevated at more than $40 billion. And adviser productivity was strong, up
8%, adjusting for interest rates.

And we're bringing on new advisers. Our virtual recruiting program is driving good results with 93 advisers
joining us in the quarter. Advisers recognize what we have to offer in terms of our culture, technology and
high level of support. And as more states reopen their businesses and economies, we're looking forward to
connecting with more advisers in person as we move through the balance of the year.

We also continue to build out the Ameriprise Bank, where total assets grew to $8.8 billion in the quarter.
As we discussed, we plan to move additional deposits to the bank over the course of this year. Pledge and
margin loan volumes increased nicely in the quarter as our advisers engage with their clients with our
lending solutions from a liquidity perspective. Wrapping up AWM, even with interest rates at all-time lows,
AWM margin increased 90 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at a strong 20.7%.

Turning to our Retirement and Protection Solutions business, we're off to a good start and continue to
adapt to the low interest rate environment. We have been very proactive in this climate as we serve client
needs and prudently manage the business. Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 33%, driven by our
success of structured product, as well as our annuities without living benefits. As a result, the percentage
of VA sales without living benefits grew to 64% of total sales in the quarter.

With regard to insurance, our focus has been on our flagship VUL product rather than IUL. In fact, VUL
sales were up 76%. We're focused on making sure we have the right product for this rate environment
while maintaining strong underwriting. Overall, I feel good about how the Retirement Protection Solutions
business is performing in this challenging environment. As part of this strategy, we are actively pursuing a
reinsurance transaction for the remaining closed block of fixed annuities, and we feel we can execute it in
the near term.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Turning to Asset Management, we're generating strong results. Our team is engaged, serving clients'
evolving needs well and driving profitable growth. I'll speak to the strength of the quarter and then
comment on BMO's EMEA acquisition.

With the continuation of positive flows in markets, assets under management were up significantly,
increasing 32% to $564 billion. We're investing in the business, including in transforming how we
use data. This is both within investments in terms of our use of data and our research as well as in
distribution. In addition, and also key, is the thought leadership we provide and how we are targeting the
right advisers to drive meaningful engagement.

Regarding investment performance, our teams consistently generate strong performance for our clients.
It's across all categories: equities, fixed income and asset allocation strategies. As an active manager, our
research expertise is a key differentiator.

I'd highlight that Columbia Threadneedle ranked in the top 10 and over the 1-, 5- and 10-year time
frames in the recent Barron's Best Fund Family ranking, 1 of only 2 firms that ranked in the top 10 across
all-time periods. We also won 7 Lipper Awards in the U.S. this year and over 22 awards in EMEA over the
last year. This level of performance bodes very well in terms of earning future flows.

At quarter end, Columbia Threadneedle had 103 4- and 5-star Morningstar rated funds globally, which
represent the close to 70% of our assets. This shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup.
So with this type of investment performance and the strong execution of our plan, you saw that flows
continue to be quite strong.

In the quarter, we had net inflows of $4.9 billion, an improvement of $7.3 billion from a year ago.
Excluding legacy insurance partner outflows, net inflows were $6.2 billion. Global retail net inflows were
$4.6 billion, largely driven by the traction we've seen in North America. We're driving high engagement
with clients and intermediaries, including with the larger broker-dealers and independents.

Sales and flows traction is broad, and we're working hard to maintain that. In the quarter, we had 9 funds
that generated over $250 million in net inflows, including 5 equity and 4 fixed income funds.

In EMEA, we've seen good flows in Continental Europe in a number of key markets. In the U.K., we
remained in outflows. However, we saw improvement in the quarter as the economy started to reopen
there more fully, and we're hopeful that investor sentiment will strengthen.

In terms of Global Institutional, we had net inflows of $1.6 billion ex legacy partner outflows, driven by
our results in EMEA. We've made considerable progress in strengthening our consultant relations and client
service globally. Consultants have increased their ratings on a number of key strategies in recent quarters.
This is important in terms of our ability to gain additional mandates from existing clients and grow our
sales pipeline.

As you saw earlier this month, we announced our strategic acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management
business. The acquisition is right in line with our strategy that we consistently discuss with you. It will add
complementary capabilities and solutions with their established strengths in responsible investing, liability-
driven investing, fiduciary outsource management and European real estate. It will also expand our scale
in other traditional asset classes, especially in European fixed income, and recent flow trends in their EMEA
business have been favorable.

In addition, post close, BMO's North American Wealth Management clients will have the opportunity
to access a broad range of Columbia Threadneedle investment management solutions. From an asset
management perspective, we gained important geographic diversity. Upon close, EMEA's AUM will increase
significantly to 40% of total AUM at Columbia Threadneedle, which provides a good balance to the U.S.
business.

We've always been a disciplined acquirer, and we expect this transaction will add to our strategic growth
and generate a good return over time. Importantly, as we executed, the team will remain focused on
maintaining our strong business momentum.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

So, for Ameriprise overall, we're in an excellent position. The business is performing really well and
delivering strong results. Based on the current environment, we feel comfortable that we'll continue to
generate strong returns with a strong balance sheet and substantial free cash flow.

With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business
metrics, which are a direct result of our continued execution of the strategic priorities. We continue to
demonstrate strong performance in our core growth businesses of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset
Management, driven by ongoing organic growth and expense discipline.

At the core, we remain focused on accelerating our mix shift through specific actions. For example, our
recently announced strategic acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business will expand key
capabilities in attractive and growing market segments, while also adding to traditional asset classes. This
provides a larger combined capability to meet client needs.

We have high confidence in the financial benefits from the acquisition as well. It will be accretive on a cash
and operating basis by 2023, generating a 20%-plus IRR and have a payback period consistent with the
Columbia acquisition of 8 years. In addition, we have established a strong partnership with BMO in North
America, which we expect to generate strong profits.

We are actively engaged in a fixed annuity reinsurance process and anticipate finalizing the transaction
shortly. Lastly, we continue to effectively manage our risk profile and continued profit mix shift to lower
risk and higher-margin retirement and protection solution offerings.

Our diversified model continues to generate robust-free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals.
We remain on track to return approximately 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in 2021.

Let's turn to Slide 6. Ameriprise's strong underlying business performance and activity levels in our core
growth businesses continue to neutralize headwinds from short-term interest rates. As a reminder, this will
be the last quarter where we have a reduction in short rates, sorting the year-over-year comparison.

Excluding the impact from interest, Ameriprise adjusted net operating revenue grew 13%. Advice &
Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses' profitability continues to increase, with adjusted
pretax operating earnings up 35%. General and administrative expenses continue to be well managed.
Excluding the impact of share price appreciation on compensation, G&A expenses were up 2% as we
remain disciplined executing reengineering initiatives. In total, we delivered excellent underlying EPS
growth of 27%, excluding the net operating loss tax benefit and very strong margins in the quarter.

Turning to Slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth Management continued to deliver excellent organic
growth during the quarter, with total client assets up 36% to $762 billion. In response to the request from
many of you, we are now disclosing total client flows, which increased 21% to $9.3 billion.

From a product perspective, we had a terrific growth in our wrap flows, up 55% to $10.4 billion. Cash
balances remain elevated at $40.4 billion, with a substantial opportunity for clients to put cash back to
work in the future.

On Page 8, financial results in Advice & Wealth Management were strong, with underlying adjusted
operating earnings up 30% to $389 million after the $78 million interest rate headwind. Adjusted
operating net revenues were up 16% to $1.9 billion, driven by client flows, improved transaction activity
and higher market levels. On a sequential basis, revenues increased 6% from strong performance despite
fewer fee days in the current quarter.

Expenses remain well managed and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline. G&A expense
increased only 2% including higher volume-related expenses, bank expansion, investments for future
growth and elevated share-based compensation. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 20.7%. Adjusting

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

for interest rates, the margin would have been 215 basis points higher. On a sequential basis, pretax
operating earnings increased 11% and pretax adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points.

Turning to Page 9. The significant growth in asset management was due to our investment engine that is
driving revenue growth through consistent investment performance and compelling thought leadership
leading to increased client engagement. Net inflows in the quarter was $6.2 billion, excluding legacy
insurance partners, an $8 billion improvement from a year ago. Adjusted operating revenues increased
21% to $828 million, reflecting cumulative benefit of inflows, favorable mix shift toward equity strategies
and market appreciation. The prior year quarter included an unfavorable impact from a performance fee
adjustment.

General and administrative expenses grew 12% from higher compensation expense related to strong
performance, Ameriprise share appreciation, as well as the costs associated with increased activity levels.
Adjusted for compensation-related expense, G&A increased a more moderate 5%. Putting this together,
pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 45% with a 43.9% margin. We continue to be very encouraged
by the continuation of positive flow trends and strong profitability.

Let's turn to Page 10. Retirement and Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in
this market and rate environment. While we have a strong book of business from a risk perspective, we
continue to execute our strategy to improve it further. In the quarter, 64% of retirement product sales did
not have living benefit guarantees. This sales shift is already having an impact on our in-force block, with
the account value of living benefit riders down from 65% to 63%.

In protection, sales were flat, as we continue to see a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a
significant decline in index universal life. These mix shifts are expected to continue going forward.

Financial results continue to be in line with expectations. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased
10% to $183 million. We had a steep drop-off in claims following January's high level, and we were
approaching pre-COVID levels of claims by the end of March. This business is very well managed. Net
amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry, and our hedging remains very effective.

Let's turn to Page 11. In total, the corporate and other segment had a $21 million loss in the quarter,
which was a $29 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding closed blocks, the loss in the
corporate segment was $63 million, which included a $15 million investment gain, largely offset by $11
million of higher share-based compensation expense. The year ago quarter had $11 million benefit from
Ameriprise share price depreciation.

Long-term care had $46 million of earnings in the quarter. The high COVID-related mortality and
terminations that we saw in January declined in February and March and were approaching pre-COVID
levels by the end of March. This benefit was partially offset by the COVID claims level on life insurance.

Fixed annuities had a $4 million loss related to the low interest rate environment. As I mentioned, we are
making good progress on our fixed annuity reinsurance transaction.

Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely
strong. Including our liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital
of $2 billion, 96% hedge effectiveness in the quarter and a defensively positioned investment portfolio.
Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 30%.

We returned $491 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback. We just
announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, and we are on track with our commitment to return
90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders this year.
With that, we'll take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. So Jim and Walter was hoping to start maybe with some trends you guys have seen in Advice &
Wealth Management. Obviously, another really strong quarter. Particularly in the wrap account flows, as
you pointed out, over $10 billion, and thanks for the new disclosure on the $9 billion for total.

I guess the first question is there, just kind of around sustainability, particularly in the wrap flows. And
maybe we can tackle it from a perspective of kind of giving us a breakdown of how much of this is coming
from existing clients sort of reengaging, given the fact that market backdrop is better versus new assets
coming from either recruiting or same-store sales?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Alex, this is Jim. So I think we're seeing good growth coming from all of the areas you've mentioned. We
see a good additional flow coming from current clients as we're deepening through the advice relationship
that we've been really -- having our advisers really engage with clients on and the deepening. But we also
see good new organic growth from client acquisition coming in as well from our advisers.

And as a complement from recruits that we've added over the last year, as they transfer their book,
they're bringing over some of the clients. But I would say it's a lot coming from the organic growth from
our core base, both for new clients that our advisers are bringing in as well as current clients, where
they're deepening the relationship and bringing in more of those flows as well.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's great to hear. Shifting gears, maybe we can touch on the BMO acquisition. I was hoping to
get a little more details on that property. So it sounds like the flows there are positive. Maybe you can
talk to, sort of, the sources of growth and kind of what products are driving flows in that asset? And I
guess, more importantly, are you thinking about any risks from attrition as we can typically see in an asset
management acquisition.

And then from a financial perspective, I guess, Walter that one's for you. I think I heard you say accretion
to operating earnings by 2023. I think you guys are paying for this with cash. So I guess, why is the deal
not immediately accretive? And I guess, within the same lines, maybe kind of help us with a jumping off
point for revenues and pretax income, pre- and post synergies for that asset. A bunch of things in there,
but strategic and financial highlights would be helpful.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Okay. So what I can say really is that we know right now that the EMEA BMO area is in inflows for the
last number of months through the first quarter. They're seeing it in some of their core programs and
initiatives. The ones that we sort of laid out to you are the strategic capabilities that we think that will
really enhance and strengthen our areas to really get a more formal presence on the continent there, but
also that we could leverage globally.

We feel like as we go through this transaction, since we're not really, what I would call, meshing together,
both investment process or distribution capabilities in some of those areas, they're more of an add-on to
us, that we shouldn't suffer, as you mentioned, a bit more of a attrition going through that process.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

We feel very comfortable that we're adding their people, we're adding their capabilities. And what we're
spending more time integrating will be more of the back and middle offices. Adding our capabilities, which
are much more state of the art much more current in what we can provide them technology-wise and
support wise. And so we feel like it could be a win-win.

We always factor in, when we do a transaction, there is always some breakage. You can't really determine
how much it is, but we always factor in that in thinking about a deal. But we're hoping that, that would
be one that will not be significant based on what we're looking to do here, which is very different than
merging and integrating front offices and people from that standpoint.

We like their capabilities. We think that those capabilities with our added distribution globally can actually
enhance their flow picture as well. But we didn't count on the revenue flows when we did the deal to make
it like a make or break. We really look at this from having the cost synergies from the back and middle
office, plus what they think they can grow, plus what we can add in. And then we complement that with
our distribution as a plus.

And so we feel like this is really good strategic. It's exactly what we were looking for as a complement.
It is one that we can easily handle through the excess cash and balance sheet that we have, and it
doesn't take away from the organic growth that we want our people to continue to focus on in the asset
management business.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes. So Alex, it's Walter. So obviously, the BMO is generating EBITDA. But again, it's a division of a large
corporation. So commenting on that number would be a little problematic. We certainly have done our
analysis of it. But the big reason, obviously, for the accretion in '23 is the substantial amount of onetime
expense that we will be absorbing between now and that time frame. We feel very comfortable, and
that's why we gave you the bookends as it relates to the IRR on it. And the -- certainly, the elements of
payback.

So we are working through right now. And certainly, we'll keep you abreast as we go through this and get
additional information as we feel good about the fundamentals of it.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got you. And as we find with a typical kind of M&A transaction, are these integration charges going to be
backed out of your operating reported results? Or are you guys going to leave those in, as you think about
'22?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

No. As we normally do, Alex, we will back them out like most other firms do.

Operator

Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

I wanted to start with asset management and the very strong margin that you guys reported in the
quarter. The 43.9%, well above your 34% to 39% target. So was there anything unusual in there that we
should think about perhaps normalizing in the balance of the year?

And relatedly, what kind of gets you back down into the range? Is there an expectation that maybe
investment spending will increase in the back half? Just want to get a sense of the trajectory of the
margin.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

So Walter, why don't you handle the first part and I'll handle the second.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes. There's nothing unusual in this quarter. Indeed, what we do, gain the benefit of deleveraging and the
fact that we do not have a wind in our face as it relates to the outflows. So it's really from that standpoint.
It's solid performance on the inflows. And we feel the expenses will remain well-managed as we go
forward. But it is really the benefit of the inflows and the market. There's nothing unusual.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

And when we look at going forward longer term, I mean, in the current period, if markets hold, we don't
see that reverting back to in the 30s at this point in time. I think longer term, it's hard for us because
there's a business mix, as we said, even adding the BMO transaction, which is largely institutional, there
will be some differences there just on fee, not that they don't have -- they have good fees, but on a
relative, compared to our retail side. So there are those various things.

And as you know, there's always a mix change that occurs over the longer term based on markets and a
number of other factors. But from a cost perspective, we do not see anything that would cause a problem.
And from revenue, you can see that our fee basis has been holding pretty well based on new assets that
we're adding versus anything that are trading.

So it's nothing in the near term. It's just longer term, it's hard to predict. We'll have to do some further
work depending on what happens over the course of the year.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Got it. And then on the retail flows, can you give us a sense of how much of that activity is coming from
A&WM versus the third party channels?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

No. I would say, overall, we're getting very strong flows from our third-party channel. Ameriprise has
picked up a bit. But in totality, it's really coming from the third party channels.

And so I would say we feel really good. We've actually grown our share in 7 of the top 8 distributors in the
U.S. We're getting it from a number of different disciplines, the broker dealers, the independents, RIAs, et
cetera. So we feel very good.

And we have a broader lineup that is actually selling pretty well. This is actually a time when even fixed
income kicked in for us where we were more equity. Now we're a combination of getting good equity and
fixed income has picked up as well. So we really feel good about the broadening there.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath

Got it. And then just the last one for me, if I could. Just on M&A more broadly, obviously, the BMO
transaction is what you're focused on. But anything that you guys are still needing to or desiring to have
from an M&A perspective? Or do you pretty much have what you need post BMO in-house?

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Yes. We actually feel like the BMO was one of the primary areas that we wanted to really complement,
which is growing a bit more and balancing out for more of the solutions-oriented business, a little more
institutional business, a little more weight for our distribution, particularly in that area for EMEA.

So we feel like that was our primary focus in what we're looking to do if we did an incremental acquisition
right now, and we want to concentrate on getting that integrated well.

We feel like we got good momentum in the core of the businesses, both in the U.S. as well as what we
think we could expand internationally with some of our capabilities now institutional as well with the
product set we have. We've got some very good consultant approvals and ratings, which we think will
expand our platform capabilities to -- for distribution.

So we're feeling pretty good about that. That was one of the things that we wanted to focus on in the near
term, and we think that this deal gives us some of that ability here.

Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Thanks, actually, for the total client flow disclosure, the net new assets across the Wealth Management
business. Certainly, that helps to show the strength of the business.

Was curious if it's possible to get a longer historical time series for that data? And maybe for right now,
how indicative is the roughly 5% total organic growth rate that is reflected in the 3 quarters that you
disclosed? Like how does that compare over time to the sort of organic growth rate implied by the total
client flows over a period of a few years?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So I think I'll have Walter respond a little. What I can say is that, and we've always sort of
mentioned, we feel like the numbers -- and I think Walter's team is trying to reconcile going back based
on the definitions being utilized, which is, I think, the ones being utilized in the industry a little more
today.

Our client flows, we think, are pretty close to sort of our wrap flows. There may have been a period just
after the -- sort of the discussion on the DOL, et cetera, where there was more of a shift from some
brokerage activity to the wrap, that we saw some blips in some of those initial quarters.

But I think if you go back over the last number of quarters, you'll probably see more of a client flow close
to, again, the wrap flows. There may be some timing issues quarter-to-quarter, et cetera. But I think
that's along the lines, Walter, but I -- you know more.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes. So right now, we're working on that. And so we will follow-up and get you to 2020. But what Jim is
saying, I believe, is a good representation of it. So if you give us a chance, we'll get that out. As we look
at the new definitions and other things as of the data, okay?

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. Great. Much appreciated. And then -- and helpful to have the high level indication. So for my follow-
up, another question on AWM. It was really good to see adviser headcount pick up here this quarter.

So why not get a little bit more aggressive on the recruiting front or bolt-on M&A to try to grow that
headcount more rapidly? Effectively, when we look across a lot of the wealth management peers, to

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

get the best valuation and the stock tend to have solid growth in net new assets and in advisers. And
obviously, churn is an impact.

And so what steps do you think you can take to continue to kind of grind down churn? And then -- and
is maybe picking up on the aggression for recruiting something that you think is compelling at this point,
given where the market is for advisers?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So good question. I think the way I'd probably answer that would be that we will continue to look at
bringing in good advisers to the firm, and we could probably -- a bit more there, and we're reviewing it.

But very important for us, we want to bring in the right advisers that fit the brand, the culture, the
compliance, understand what their focus on growth. We don't want to just pay advisers to join us or be
part of a network and process for them.

We want to have advisers join us that we can help grow their productivity, grow their client relationships,
have great client satisfaction, be with us a long time. That really builds on the culture and the brand.

We think we have a great value proposition for advisers once they join us, both from how we onboard
them, how we give them support, the leadership, the technology, the capabilities. We just don't want to
roll up a bunch of firms or independents and just associate and process for them per se.

So that's very important to us. I think we could probably -- maybe we could be more aggressive out there.
And -- but we also think it's very important for the long term.

The other thing we really spend a lot of time different than other competitors about just rolling up advisers
is that we focus on our 10,000 advisers growing their productivity, having strong client satisfaction. And I
think when you compare us, the last time we did that analysis which we update, we were more than 2.5x
any independent on annual productivity growth on a compounded basis for a long period of time. And the
same thing against the wirehouses.

So that's where we put a lot more of our energy. But to your point, we complement that with having good
recruits and having good retention. And we'll continue to look at whether we could step that up or there
may be some other firms, smaller firms suited to our cultural mix. But that's what we've been focused on,
and we've been successful with it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Crédit Suisse.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Wanted to go back to the Advice & Wealth and that $10.4 billion in net wrap flows, just a phenomenal
number. And I'm kind of thinking back to pre-COVID, and it seems like a normalized range and a very
good range would have been $4 billion to $5 billion, and it's kind of gradually jumped up. And now I'm
looking at the deposit base of $40.4 billion.

And so my question is, what's the right strike zone for wrap net flows? Is it $10 billion? Is it $6 billion to
$8 billion? Where do you think the normalized number is? And given $40.4 billion in deposits, what can we
look toward in the near term?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

So Andrew, I think it was a very good question. You or someone else or some people had asked from the
fourth quarter on a similar basis when we had good pickup in flows and client activity as well.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

What we've been seeing is -- and it's probably a combination of factors. I mean, we have a reopening of
the economy. I think people are starting to feel a bit more comfortable. I think the markets have done
well. So there's a little bit of that where people feel a little more comfortable in what they are doing right
now.

And so I think that's part of it, because of the positive nature of the reopening and the vaccine, rolling out,
et cetera. But I also feel a part of it is a level of engagement that our advisers are also having with their
clients. We've really rolled out our whole foundational advice in complement to our comprehensive advice.

We have over 0.5 million of our clients already have [ goals ] online that they're very active with. We have
been rolling out our integrated technology in the way our advisers can continue to connect with clients and
understand the nature of what conversations they should be having. We'll be rolling out more tools along
those lines.

So we feel like we've stepped up our level of having the advisers engage with the clients and giving them
a lot more of the tools and capabilities to do that more seamlessly in an integrated fashion. And I think
that's having some effect.

I mean, it's hard for me not knowing the market cycle and some of the things popping up around. But I
feel good that we're going to continue to -- at least continue to gain those type of flows. I can't predict
whether it's 9, 10, 8, 6 or whatever. But I feel like we're in a good spot right now, and we're very focused
on helping that to continue.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. So good -- very good momentum. And then thinking about the long-term care block, which earned
$46 million versus what one would normally expect to be breakeven, and I suspect there were some
COVID effects that caused that uptick in earnings. Where do you see earnings going over the near and
intermediate-term in that line item?

And then secondly, given that rates have come up a bit a lot in the last 12 months. Do you think that
there's a stronger possibility that you could divest of that block? Is there interest?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Walter, up with you.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Okay. So Andrew, on the $46 million, that is the realization of, unfortunately, the mortality and lower,
basically, new entrants into nursing homes, so -- the frequency. So as we indicated, that is starting to slow
off, or slow down in March. It basically dropped to around $5 million.

So we're seeing -- we're gauging it. And certainly, we've gotten the benefit of the situation with COVID.
And we're -- but we have our programs that are working. As we indicated, our benefit of programs, our
price increases and other things and the claims are being well-managed and staying within expectations.

So we -- I can't say, but certainly, by the trend, it's slowing down now as it relates to the situation with
COVID.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And just interest in the block itself from acquirers?

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

We -- again, certainly, the interest will -- interest rates certainly affect that. And we will evaluate any,
certainly, bids coming in. And -- but then we are open to evaluate elements within that. But again, we feel
we have this -- the LTC under control. But certainly, we would look at opportunities to reinsure that.

Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And maybe if I could just sneak one quick one in at the end. Just G&A overall was up 2% ex the effect
of the stock and so forth. So as we look forward, and hopefully, the market opens up, could you give any
insight into what we could expect would be the overall growth in G&A, given that travel and entertainment
might pick up. Do you think we could see a real sharp pickup in G&A? Or do you have a way to just kind of
keep it under control as we move forward?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

It's more of the latter. I think that we -- as you noted, we are managing our expenses well. And even
with the return to more T&E and other things of that nature, we believe we will stay in a more controlled
situation with that. And as normally, we get questions on AWM, the range on that is -- you saw 2%. And
we think it's going to be in the 3%, 4% range. So well-managed as we go forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

A few follow-ups on AWM. Yes, I appreciate that new disclosure on total enterprise flows as well. I guess
if we split those 2 businesses, Walter, how did the revenue yields and margins compare between wrap and
non-wrap businesses for you? Because clearly, your flows are being driven by wrap. Are our presumption
has been wrap has much higher margins and fee yield, but just curious if you can quantify that.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Well, listen, we had very strong transactional activity in this quarter. And so obviously, that drove good
profitability for us. And as we look at the margins and the profitability of these programs, it's -- they are
both very good. There's timing.

As you know, in wrap, you get your fee as it relates to it. On the transactional, you'll take it upfront,
and will spread it back-loaded. So the profitabilities of these are certainly with -- from AWM standpoint,
extremely good. And distinguishing between them, they're just different and they fit into the confident
retirement approach that we take. So they're necessary for our clients, but they all generate good
acceptable returns to us.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And Walter, just to follow-up on that. So from your perspective, there's not, meaningfully, better
margins if you, I guess, normalize and spread them out over the life of the business between wrap and
non-wrap. Would that be a fair characterization? Or are they just different?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

They're different and they both generate good returns for us. They really do. Seriously, they are different,
and different characterizations to meet different needs. But -- and timing of profitability, but they both
really do generate acceptable and good returns.

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then just a question on the weighted average gross fee yield for the cash type deposits you
break out. Last quarter, it was 69 basis points. This quarter, it was 65. The rate of change is clearly
slowing.

Given what interest rates have done recently, do you think we're near a bottom? Assuming their clients
continue to maintain these high balances in these accounts. Do you think we're closer to a bottom or
levelizing? Or do you think there -- we might still see a little downward pressure on the margins?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

I don't see downward pressure on the margins. I do see, obviously, we're evaluating from our standpoint
of investment and opportunities that we have for that product and certainly looking now at duration versus
credit. But I would say it certainly has slowed, as you noted, but I can't say whether it's bottomed, but it's
certainly slowed, and we're evaluating now, looking at both the asset side of it, and then we'll see what
happens on the short end.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then one final one. Just the fixed annuity transaction. I think the expectation was it would
garner approximately $700 million, I believe. Interest rates had changed meaningfully though. I don't
know whether that would meaningfully impact your execution price on that or not.

And then also just to confirm, are you guys really, at this point, just focused on an isolated fixed annuity
deal? Or how do you consider broadening out whether that's, to Andrew's question, long-term care or
variable annuities or life insurance? Or at this point, it's really just fixed annuities?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Right now, we're focused on fixed annuities. As Jim and I have indicated, we are working on that to bring
that to closure. And yes, interest rates do affect it, but we -- the range that you're talking about should be
certainly achieved from that standpoint.

And as I indicated to Andrew, we do get constant request for evaluation of different offers, and we
evaluate them. But right now, we're focusing on the fixed annuity.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.

Ryan Joel Krueger
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

On the transactional activity in AWM, can you give us any sense of if it's remained elevated as you've gone
through April?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes, I believe it is continuing. Again, this is preliminary information coming in. But yes, we're seeing still
continuing trends.

Ryan Joel Krueger
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And then on the fixed annuity reinsurance, do you view that as providing additional capacity for buybacks
above and beyond the 90% that you target? Or should we think about that more as replenishing capital
that you'll use for the BMO transaction?

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Well, again, we are sitting in strong capital position now, as we indicated, our excess capital is $2 billion.
Certainly, we're going to generate strong capital -- free cash flow. And going forward, this transaction will
replenish.

You can look at it that way, the BMO transaction. And then we make our decisions looking
opportunistically, what's the best way to deploy that. But at this stage, we're sitting in a very good
position. And certainly, the fixed annuity transaction will certainly offset the BMO substantially.

Ryan Joel Krueger
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And then just to confirm that the 90% capital return target is just buybacks and dividends and excludes
the M&A, is that right?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

That's right. We've been -- yes, our 90% is buyback and dividends. Right.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC.

Kenneth S. Lee
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Wondering if you could just remind us how sensitive Ameriprise's earnings and specifically within the
Advice & Wealth Management, how sensitive the earnings could be to any potential Fed funds rate
increase. And more specifically, just wondering whether you could potentially see a benefit immediately.

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes. The answer is you will see a benefit on -- if you're talking about AWM on the Fed funds. And so if
you look at, say, $25 billion looking at just concentrating on sweep accounts, it's $250 million over a year
period on 1% increase, right. That's the dimensions of it.

And then it's a matter of gauging how we return that to the client. But normally, you have a differential
between when the Fed fund changes, and then we evaluate the competitive situation. That's trying to
dimension it from that standpoint. It makes sense, okay?

Kenneth S. Lee
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Great. That's very helpful. And just one follow-up, if I may. Wondering within the asset
management side, wonder if you could just talk about some of the contribution that you're seeing from
any solutions-based mandates. And wonder if you could also just share with us how this could potentially
change once the BMO EMEA asset management acquisition is integrated?

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

So institutionally and even from a retail, we've been getting, sort of, mandates a little more that are
solutions-oriented. And we also, as you also know, have a U.K. real estate property business, and we
have a smaller U.S. business as well. So this would complement it nicely and bring some of that advanced
capability in Europe to bear.

We know ESG is very big, and they're a leader in ESG as well. And we've been ramping up our activities in
ESG in the U.K. for European activity and U.K. activity. So overall, we feel like it will help us hit the ground

17

AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 27, 2021

running further in Europe, but we're also looking to further use that solution capability, complementing
what we're already doing in the U.S. for the U.S. And we think that, that will give us a greater ability to
bring in more solutions-oriented business for the longer term.

So I don't know if that answers your question. But we had invested in solutions. We do have some of the
different strategies already coming to bear for some of what we're doing internationally and domestically,
but this would advance us further.

Operator

Our final question comes from Erik Bass at Autonomous Research.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Just hoping you can provide some more color on the potential opportunity from the BMO Wealth
Management relationship in the U.S. and how meaningful could this be in terms of incremental flows or
AUM.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So in the U.S., we're looking to first provide our platform capabilities to BMO Wealth Management.
But in addition, we'll be looking to convert some of their activities over to us on the retail side for us to
actually manage those activities for them.

And we're working with BMO now. We've crafted a relationship and an arrangement on that. We're not
purchasing their U.S. business, but we're working on, sort of, an agreement, a revenue-type agreement as
well as a distribution agreement to take up a level of their activities there.

I don't have more detailed information right now. Walter, I don't know if you have it?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

No, not at this moment. Though I think we are just working from that standpoint to transfer clients over,
and we're discussing with them, just as Jim has indicated. And anything we've talked about before as
related to the financials, that does not include that aspect of it.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Got it. So this would all be potential upside in terms of kind of revenue synergies as well as, obviously, you
don't have the assets. So there's no attrition. It would all be wins that would kind of be incremental flows
in the U.S. to the extent they emerge?

Walter S. Berman
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Risk Officer

Yes.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Perfect. And do you have a sense of what their total AUM is in the U.S. kind of asset management
business that could be up for grabs?
