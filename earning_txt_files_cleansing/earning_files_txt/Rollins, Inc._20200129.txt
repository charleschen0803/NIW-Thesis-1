Gary W. Rollins
Vice Chairman & CEO

Yes, Marilynn. Thank you, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our fourth quarter
2019 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we'll begin.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements.
These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call,
excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ
materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings,
including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for more
information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ.

Gary W. Rollins
Vice Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Eddie. Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 13.8% to $506 million compared to $444.6
million for the same quarter in 2018. Net income was approximately $50.8 million or $0.16 per diluted
share compared to $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues
for the first -- full year increased 10.6% to $2.015 billion compared to $1.822 billion for 2018. We're all
pleased that we broke the $2 billion milestone.

Net income for the full year was $203.3 million with earnings per share of $0.62. This compared to
net income of $231.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share last year. Net income this year was negatively
impacted by a $50 million onetime charge for closing down our pension plan and a casualty reserve
increase. Eddie will address these charges further in a few minutes.

We continued to experience good solid growth in all of our business lines for the quarter, with residential
up 16.5%; commercial, excluding fumigation, rose 9.8%; and termite and ancillary services grew 16.1%.

ROLLINS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

During the fourth quarter, a question that we heard on a regular basis from investors was, what's your
exposure to termite damage claims. I thought this might be a good time to provide some history and
background on our termite claims and the service initiatives that were implemented over many years of
treating and protecting structures from termite infestation to damage.

As background, chlordane was used as a pesticide in the United States from 1948 to 1988, 40 years.
Among its numerous uses, chlordane was a very effective termiticide to control against termite
infestations in homes and other structures. In fact, from 1983 to 1988, chlordane's use was narrowed to
only termite -- excuse me, only control termites. In 1988, all approved uses of chlordane in the United
States were canceled. Orkin had stopped treating with chlordane a year before. It's noteworthy that
prior to this action, our company negotiated an agreement between the Velsicol Chemical Company, the
manufacturer, and the EPA for Velsicol to voluntarily stop manufacturing chlordane and that it not be
banned. They both agreed. This helped Orkin and the industry to avoid a potential lawsuit stampede like
the asbestos situation.

By the mid-'90s, the state of the post-chlordane termite world was daunting. The replacement chemicals
didn't work as well as chlordane. However, the new termiticide that had been so positively promoted
by the manufacturers and endorsed by the EPA, failed miserably. This failure happened within a very
short period of time. Termites returned to our customers' home as well as other pest control companies
customers' homes with vengeance. Orkin, which at one time led the industry with its lifetime repair
guarantees, was suddenly faced with a major business challenge. There were millions of dollars in repair
costs now appearing due to termite damage along with corresponding retreatment obligations.

In 1996, Orkin took a very important step and began a proactive retreatment program with a better new
product targeting all the homes that had previously been treated with the ineffective termite product.
Simply, we wanted to curtail the termite damage before it occurred and provide our customers the
protection they deserve. We put our customers first at the cost of more than $100 million. Our lifetime
guarantees were replaced to 3 to 5 retreatment guarantees depending on the area of country and the type
of home construction.

Our 1996 P&L resulted -- reflected Orkin's retreatment efforts and Orkin's revenues increased 1%, while
operating income and profit margins decreased 50%. The increase in termite revenues, termite claims and
retreatment expense negatively impacted our financial results. Incidentally, we're all proud to work for a
company that made this forward-looking investment to protect our customers, our brand and reputation.

1997, the following year, we set up a $117 million reserve fund to cover the escalating cost of termite
claims. We knew we had to make these extra efforts and made the conscious decision to provide free
retreatments and promptly pay for any termite damage repairs that occur. While the short-term costs
were extremely painful, they appropriately protected our reputation and balance sheet. This turning
point always caused us -- also caused us to make further enhancements in termite treating training, the
utilization of flowmeters to measure the volume of termiticide applied and the use of foam as a chemical
carrying agent in difficult-to-treat structures. We created a national termite swarm school that service
technicians attended annually before each termite treating season. We created a termite quality audit and
compliance team to visit our branches to ensure our treating specs and procedures were being followed.
We also required our managers to do a quality inspection on all completed termite treatments. All of these
actions still exist today.

I could go on and on with more than a dozen other initiatives that we took over the following years to
ensure we provided the industry's best termite treatments. All of these actions have reduced our termite
reserve and other related costs tremendously.

I'll now turn the call over to John for more insight on our termite war and other areas of business.

John F. Wilson
President, COO & Director

Thank you, Gary. As Gary just noted, by the mid-'90s, it was clear the replacement chemicals didn't work
as well as chlordane in the treatment of termites. In the 3 years prior to 1995, Orkin's termite damage

ROLLINS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

claims averaged around $3 million per year. Over the next couple of years, the claims expense multiplied
in dramatic fashion. By 1997, and for several years thereafter, termite damage claims exceeded $20
million a year. Decisions were made by our leadership team to improve process, training and treatment
protocols. These new processes were then developed by our technical services group, led by industry
Icon Paul Hardy and many other members of our team. This approach allowed our operations to focus
on meeting all obligations to their customers. The company-wide quality assurance program Orkin put
into place during that time concentrated solely on termite issues and helped us to get out in front of this
accelerating termite issue. We also addressed the Formosan termite at that time, which has made recent
headlines as they were already a growing concern.

In other words, our quality assurance team as well as many other actions taken served over time to de-
risk our termite service business. As a result of these many actions and activities, we have seen a steady
decline in claims and retreatments from year-to-year. It is easy to put your finger on the many things
mentioned that we changed. What is not so easy to put a finger on is the cultural change that had to
occur with our field teams. It was painful, it was hard and it was costly from both the financial and human
capital standpoint, and it also took a long time, but it was worth it in the long run.

In more recent years, as we have continued to work on this issue, we have experienced further reductions
in termite damage claims. The average amount of each claim has fallen from the highest seen in the
early to middle part of the 2000s. For 2019, Rollins experienced historically low termite claim volumes,
and termite claims expenses were below 1% of termite revenues for the full year. This is the direct
result of the many quality control programs leadership initiated. We certainly appreciate your concerns
around termite damage claims, and we never take anything for granted. We take our responsibility to our
termite customer seriously and hope that we have now given you enough information to understand our
experience better.

So let's turn the page on that topic and talk about something else for a minute. As most of you know,
we got off to a slow start last year. We are certainly prepared to do everything we can to not repeat that
performance. Pursuant to that, in early January, we concluded a week long regional manager leadership
meeting in Atlanta. We had over 100 of our leaders in from around the world for this event. This meeting
focused on, among several priorities, improving our safety culture and practices, the customer experience,
et cetera. But maybe most important of all, we were focused on lessons learned from a year ago and what
not to do to repeat those mistakes. It is said that the best learned lessons are the hardest and after this
last year, I believe that to be true. We came away from this meeting energized that our teams were ready
and up to the challenge and pretty darn glad to put 2019 behind them.

Thank you, and I will now turn the call back over to Eddie.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, John. Before I begin my review of the financial numbers for the quarter, I want to recognize
the solid results that our operations produced during the second half of the year. After Mother Nature
deviated from her normal path in Q1 and Q2, the weather pattern turned more normal and the results
of our operations produced record revenue growth in the quarter, strong double-digit EBITDA growth
and continued improvements in both employee and customer retention. Specifically, our Orkin employee
retention increased 1.8 percentage points and our commercial service line improved the most of all 3
service lines for retention year-over-year. Consistency and experience management matters. I also hope
that the details that both Gary and John shared related to our termite service will put to rest any concerns
that you have about the recent termite discussions in our industry.

For the quarter, we had strong revenue growth and items that impacted the quarter were rising accident
and insurance expense that reduced the Q4 results by $0.01; depreciation increase related to the final
stages of the BOSS rollout in Canada; and a very successful pilot of the next phase of routing and
scheduling journey. In addition to reporting our Q4 and full year numbers, my focus today will be to share
the nonoperational events that impacted our Q4 results, specifically casualty and insurance related to
accidents and injuries. Lastly, I'll give you some insight on some items that have 2020 already off to a
great start.

ROLLINS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

First, I'll go through the results. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $506 million was
an increase of 13.8% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $444.6 million. Income before income
taxes was $72 million or 0.8% above 2018. Net income was $50.8 million, down 0.4% compared to 2018,
and impacted by a higher tax rate in the quarter due to the pension adjustment in Q3.

Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 per diluted share and EBITDA was $97.1 million and rose 10.5%
compared to 2018. When looking at the full year 2019 numbers, keep in mind that the almost $50 million
pension adjustment that was made in Q3 to transition our pension off of our Rollins' books. For the year,
we're calling out the pension adjustment, Clark acquisition expense and currency for our non-GAAP
results. For the full year, revenue was $2.015 billion, an increase of 10.6% over the prior year's 12-month
revenue of $1.822 billion. Income before income taxes decreased 16% to $261.2 million from $310.7
million in 2018.

Net income fell 12.2% to $203.3 million and earnings per share were $0.62, down 12.7% from 2018
numbers of $0.71. EBITDA was $349.2 million, down 7.5% compared to 2018.

Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax was up 0.1% to $311.1 million
compared to $310.7 million in 2018. Our net income was down 0.8% to $229.9 million. And earnings per
share were $0.70 per diluted share, down from $0.71 per diluted share in 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA, including our Q3 pension loss, was $399.1 million, up 5.8%.

Our company-wide focus on personal safety since 2016 has created reductions in our casualty reserve in
the last few years. However, the combination of additional Clark vehicles and properties and substantially
higher premium rates experienced within the industries caused our casualty reserve for accidents and
injuries to increase over 5% in 2019 and impacted the quarter by roughly $0.01. As John shared with you
earlier, we reviewed these opportunities extensively at our recent annual leadership kickoff meeting and
have good initiatives to reduce the frequency and severity of our automotive and workers' compensation
claims. As we continue to refresh our automotive fleet, a growing percentage of our vehicles have
enhanced safety features, and when coupled with our enhanced training will result in better injury and
accident outcomes moving forward. Safety is becoming an ingrained value at Rollins, and we will see the
benefits of this as we move forward in 2020. We will share more of this journey in future quarters.

As we discussed last quarter, our operational efficiency and customer experience continued to improve
with ongoing updates to our routing and scheduling. I am pleased to share some details with regards to
the next step in our journey.

First, beginning back in 2015, we rolled out our branch operating system, or CRM, called BOSS, and in
stages, improved our technicians' routing and scheduling. At the time, we stated that we would see a 200
to 300 basis points margin improvement with these changes. And as you probably know, we exceeded
that amount over the next several years. We have successfully piloted our next phase of routing and
scheduling, which will include the level customer loading of the pest control technicians jobs based on
customer demand, but keeping in mind customer needs. On top of the over 4 million miles that we have
reduced in the last few years, we will see accelerating mileage reduction which will equate to margin
improvement of another 150 to 250 basis points over the next 2 to 3 years. This step is Phase 2 of a
robust 4-phase routing and scheduling initiative that will drive improved efficiency for years to come.

Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue
increase of 13.8% included 8.1% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.7% was from
pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up
16.5%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 9.8%; and
termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.1%. Again,
total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.7%. From that, residential was up 6%, commercial ex fumigation
increased 3.6% and termite and ancillary grew by 8.7%.

There are 2 items that I would like to note. First, the continued growth of our mosquito program at over
30% rate has more than offset the slowdown in our onetime bed bug business and helped our residential

ROLLINS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

product with continued strong growth. And second, we experienced the fastest termite and ancillary
growth in the past 6 years.

In total, gross margin reduced to 49.7% from 50.2% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced
expense increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries,
administrative salaries and personnel related for our 401(k) match. Additionally, insurance and claims
were up substantially, as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved to
50.6% in 2019, compared to 50.2% in 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $6 million to $22.6 million, an increase
of 35.8%. Depreciation increased $2.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned
earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.3 million due to the amortization of customer
contracts from several large acquisitions.

Our depreciation in Q1 of 2020 will be slightly higher as we finalize the BOSS rollout in Canada and move
to the next phase of our routing and scheduling journey, as discussed earlier.

Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $19 million or 14% to $154.8
million or 30.6% of revenues, up 0.1 percentage point from $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues for the
fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to insurance and claims
and acquisitions, particularly advertising spend per Clark that was not in our 2018 number.

Before I review our cash position, I want to update the state of our current cash flow. As I mentioned on
the Q3 call, we have accelerated our free cash flow by over $40 million for the year, which compares to an
average of around $20 million over the past 5 years. Not only do we see benefits to our cash flow related
to the acquisition of Clark Pest Control, but we'll also see some residual improvements from our pension
transition. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2019, we spent $430.6 million on
acquisitions compared to $76.8 million the same period last year. We paid $153.8 million on dividends and
had $27.1 million of CapEx, which were both flat to 2018. We ended the period with $94.3 million in cash,
of which $74.1 million is held by foreign subsidiaries.

Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.12 per share that will be paid on
March 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2020. The cash dividend
is a 14.3% increase over the prior year's quarterly dividend. This marks the 18th consecutive year the
Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.

Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you.

Gary W. Rollins
Vice Chairman & CEO
Well, thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I think -- I just wanted to get a sense for what the current multiples you're seeing in the M&A market?
I think a larger competitor of yours is not going to be doing deals for a while and -- or at least they're
going to be less aggressive on what they're going to be paying. I just wanted to see if that's impacting
your planning for 2020. And if multiples do remain off-peak in 2020, should we expect another outsized
year, maybe not a year as large as 2019, but could 2020 be another above-average type of year?

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So Mario, I'll just say that, yes, I mean, there's no question that within the industry -- that several
within the industry have paid above historic rates. We did have the largest acquisition in our company's
history, which obviously from a multiple perspective was a little bit higher than what we've paid
historically. But we have not deviated from the average acquisition that we have. We have not deviated
from our normal history, which has been somewhere between 1.25x and 1.75x annual revenue. And it
really comes down to that selection of that seller and then making the decision on what it is that they're
trying to accomplish. If that seller is just trying to get the largest dollar that they can out there, there are
competitors in the market that, as you stated, have paid higher multiples. We've been very diligent with
that, and I think we've made some great selections. And John is really more involved in that on a day-to-
day basis. And I don't know if you have something else you like to add to that?

John F. Wilson
President, COO & Director

Yes, I don't know that I have much, I would say, 2019 would be really rather hard to top. And I can only
think that they'll go down from there. I don't know. It's anybody's guess as to how much. But we want
to maintain discipline in our approach and -- but then be willing to go a little extra mile when it's a really
solid company.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just a quick question on your connected technology. And just wondering if you can give
us a sense of how many of your customers are using technology, how many locations connect -- sorry,
connected technology is already at? And I guess, where that fits into your technology road map overall? I
just didn't know how big or how fast you wanted that to be longer term.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, we've been testing connected technology for several years now. We have our technology -- our IT
group as well as our technical support group are constantly testing all the technology. And of course, as
I'm sure you can assume, it's changing rapidly. We have test customers that are using different products.
At this point in time, we're not in a position to make any sort of material change to what we're doing
today. We feel very prepared that if and when there is an industry shift or change or customer need, we're
ready to be able to respond to that. But I think at this point in time, we're just continuing doing what
we're doing from a service perspective and we would supplement it as appropriate from there.

ROLLINS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Eddie, I'd like to add, one advantage, I think, we have is that several of our brands are using different
software. So we're really in a position to monitor the successes and the features that exist and, of course,
as always, to use the best product. We'll be converting BOSS in Western next year. At this point, it's
certainly the superior of everything that's out there, but I think it's worthwhile that we can watch carefully
what other products are available.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

And every time -- and to add to that, every time we do that, it gives us the ability to be able to link in
any connected technology in a more efficient manner. But I think we have some really smart people on
our team that are looking at this, both from the technology and the technical support side, and I feel very
confident where we are at this point.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jamie Clement of Buckingham Research.

James Martin Clement
The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated

Guys, although it's early in earnings season, it seems like some of the industries out there that advertise
heavily, and I've got sort of restaurant chains in mind, have discussed with investors on their calls that
with elections in front of us that there might be a little bit of margin pressure from increasing in --
increases in advertising and marketing costs. I don't recall that being called out as much 4 years ago. Is
that something that you have your eyes on? Or did it impact you 4 years ago? Or can you just tweak your
mix and really have it not be that much of an issue?

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Kevin Smith is our CMO, and he's been up against this hurdle, not specifically the one you're talking about
with the election, but he's been up against this hurdle with potential for rising cost in this area for the
last several years. Digital marketing, we shifted to digital marketing tremendously over the -- now the
last 6 years, and as everyone knows, the cost in those areas continue to escalate. But Kevin's budget for
advertising has not changed over that time period as far as a percent to revenue. So he and his team
have done a tremendous job, just figuring out how do we still create the number of leads that we need by
the different service lines using the different opportunities that are out there. Some of that's going to be
things like advertising on billboards, some of it is going to be commercial advertising, some of it is going
to be through digital. But he uses that total bucket and goes through and figures out a way to be able to
create that demand that we need in order to be able to grow our business. And I don't see this 2020 year
being any different for the results that he'll be able to go through and create.

James Martin Clement
The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated

Okay, great, Eddie. And just one final thing. The strong termite numbers that you reported for the quarter
and, obviously, they've been very good for the last couple of years. During the quarter and kind of
bigger picture looking back over the last year or 2, has there been a disproportionate level of growth
internationally in your termite reported segment versus domestically or are they both pretty consistent?
And I'm just thinking about climate differences in places like Australia and that kind of thing.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, we don't break things out by geographic areas, but I'll just tell you, in general, we've not seen any
sort of specific area that's been tremendously different. We've -- our folks have done a great job growing
this product across all of our markets. Within the U.S., we've done a tremendous job using our closing
tools that we have. Our in-house financing has been a big push and a big piece of that. Our sales folks
have done a tremendous job. And we camped out on this for a while with Gary and John talking about the

quality of the service. And people talk. And when the quality of the service is what it is and we have great
outcomes, then we get an opportunity to have word of mouth and we get a chance to continue to cross-
sell. Knowing we had the largest residential set of customers that are out there, we get a chance to cross-
sell our pest control or our termite into our pest control customers.

Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Gary, thank you for the great history lesson on the termite business. That was very informative. And John,
for the termite damage claims, you said claims expenses were below 1% of revenue for the full year. Is
that 1% of total revenue or 1% of termite revenue?

John F. Wilson
President, COO & Director

No, it's 1% of termite revenue.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

All right. I just wanted to make sure. That's what I thought, but I wanted to make sure. And John, while
I got you, can you also just talk about what you plan to do differently this year to prepare for the spring
pest season? What were the primary takeaways from your recent meeting with business leaders or at least
some that you can share with us publicly?

John F. Wilson
President, COO & Director

Yes, I think the single biggest thing would be to delay our stub staffing for the seasonality of our business
to more of a just-in-time approach. That's a tricky tight rope to walk in a tough labor market, but that's
what our field operators are really focused on doing this year.

Our next question comes from Brian Butler of Stifel.

Brian Joseph Butler
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I was hoping, could you give a little bit of color maybe on organic growth heading into 2020? I mean it
was strong in the back half of '19. Is that a pace sustainable? Or is there some things out there that could
put some pressure on that?

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

We don't know of anything right now that would put pressure on it. I mean it's early in the year to be
celebrating. January has been a much better month than it was a year ago. But you never know what
Mother Nature is going to do as we move forward in time. You never know what storms might look like.
In 2017, we had 2 back-to-back storms, the 2 largest storms in our country's history that negatively
impacted things. So there are a lot of variables that will come into play. But given everything that we
know today, we believe that we're off to a good start, and we have no reason to believe that we won't
have a really good year from an organic growth perspective.

With the growth of our mosquito product now for the third year, as I mentioned during my prepared
remarks, we continue to see great opportunity with that particular product as a cross-sell opportunity. We
talked about our termite being able to grow. As far as the cross-sell opportunity, we've been able to do

that. So I think there are a lot of very positive things that are going on. Pricing is still very rational, and
we're able to see price increase. So we feel very good about 2020 from an organic growth perspective.

Gary W. Rollins
Vice Chairman & CEO

And I think it's important to share that this was the most disappointing year we've had for 22 years. So we
think that it was an anomaly. I've never seen so many onetime charges in my experience, Eddie.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

I noticed that.

Gary W. Rollins
Vice Chairman & CEO

But seriously, I mean, we've learned from this past year. I think John hit it on the head. I think we got too
ambitious too soon. You can't make the season. And we had some disappointments due to Mother Nature.
But I'm a believer of taking our mistakes and learning from them and benefiting from them. And we had a
very powerful leaders conference. Our people are optimistic. And with the technology that we're enlisting,
we think we're going to have a good year.

Brian Joseph Butler
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And then one last one. On the costs, you had pointed out higher cost around
Clark and the service salaries. Is that limited to 2019? Or should we think about those costs really kind of
continuing forward into 2020?

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Well, the purchase was closed May 1. So by May 1, we will be lapping at that point in time. But it will be
new until then.

Operator

Our next question comes from Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just following up on that last question. Just to make sure I'm understanding this, the insurance claims
issue, does that continue to be an overhang in next year? Or is this kind of -- do you feel like you've
isolated it here in the fourth quarter? Does that become -- until you install the new technology on the new
vehicles, better training and whatnot, do you expect to see this elevated level into next year? Sorry for the
clarification.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, I appreciate you asking that question. We do not continue to see an issue as we move forward. We
believe that this was a little bit of an anomaly from the 2 items that I pointed out. The industry for the
first time in several years, insurance rates increased dramatically. Some commercial groups would have
strong double digits that they would talk about. Our increase in our casualty in total was about 5%. And
I think a piece of that was managing our automotive claims year-over-year. But we feel as though with
the enhancements that we're going to have from a technology perspective, with the vehicles as well as
the continual training, that we will see positive results that come from that. When you take a look at our
total claims in the automotive side, again, those are down. So we know that, that will pay dividends as we
move forward in time.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And is it possible to splice out how much that impacted gross margin in the quarter on the -- just
the insurance portion of that?

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

I don't know that number off the top of my head. I'm sure that we have that in our -- in our breakout, but
I don't know that number off the top of my head.

It was worth $0.01 to us in total for our earnings. So you can get kind of a rough idea from that
perspective.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then just when you talked about the expected, I think it was 150 to 200 basis points of
additional margin improvement over the next several years from some of the new initiatives and things. I
guess, is that off of a kind of the current level or is that off of the pre-Clark margin? I just want to make
sure I understand what the baseline is for that compare.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Well, once Clark laps, we'll have less of a negative comparison from that. So you could really look at it
from the pre-Clark levels and say, this is going to enhance our overall operations as we're moving forward,
about 150 to 250 basis points.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And sorry, what was the timing on that?

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Next 2 to 3 years.

[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Eddie, I saw that you guys used cash to pay down debt a little bit more in the fourth quarter. Can you
remind me what your capital allocation plans are for 2020 with respect to debt paydown? I'm trying to get
a handle on how much cash you'd have left over after that for M&A and dividend.

Paul Edward Northen
Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer

Well, that's our #1 priority, and it's -- the fact that we have some debt right now will not keep us out
of the market, if the right opportunity comes and the right valuation. But we will keep that as our #1
priority to find and acquire good quality pest control companies. If they come about, then we will continue
to use our cash to be able to move forward with that. #2 priority, we just announced that we were able
to increase our dividend. And then from there, we will pay down our debt. So if there are good quality
opportunities that come to market, and it makes sense to us, we're going to continue to move forward,
just like we have over the last several years. If that were to slow down some, then we'll be a little bit
more aggressive paying that debt down. So that's kind of where we stand with that.
