Thanks, Andrew
We're pleased with the performance of our business through the second quarter, which added strong digital growth to the dependable results we expect from our sports titles
In particular, we saw a notable shift to digital purchases in our sports titles, and strong growth in our Ultimate Team of event-driven live services
I'll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business
To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model
EA's net revenue was $959 million compared to $898 million a year ago and above our guidance by $4 million
Operating expenses were $611 million, $27 million lower than our guidance, driven by the phasing of our marketing investment
GAAP operating loss was $41 million compared to an operating loss of $49 million a year ago and resulted in a loss per share of $0.07, $0.11 better than our guidance
Note that given our GAAP share results were a loss, our share count was 309 million shares
Had we reported a profit, the diluted share count would have been 312 million shares
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $52 million, down $70 million from last year
The decrease was driven by timing of collections
In contrast, operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.082 billion, our strongest ever performance measured at the end of a second quarter, and $479 million above last year's
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $30 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $22 million
Remember that the FASB rules associated regarding the treatment of stock-based comp have changed and this affects how we classify our cash flow
However, all these comparisons are made on a like-for-like basis
See our earnings slides for further cash flow information
During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of $153 million, leaving $928 million in our two-year $1.2 billion buyback program we began in May
Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.4 billion, with 35% of this balance held onshore
Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter
Net bookings for the quarter were $1.179 billion, up $81 million on the prior year and $19 million above our guidance
Exchange rates have improved over the last 12 months, but this tailwind is offset by the effect of our hedging program, resulting in a net FX headwind of $10 million compared to the year-ago quarter
Performance over guidance was primarily driven by our mobile live services, The Sims 4 and by Ultimate Team
Digital net bookings were $579 million, up 19% on the year ago period and a new record for the second quarter
The main drivers of the increase were Battlefield 1, Ultimate Team and Madden NFL 18 full game downloads
Digital net bookings now represent 63% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, compared to 57% in the prior year
Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net bookings in turn
First, live service net bookings were up 22% year-on-year to $310 million
This increase was driven by strong growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team and in Battlefield 1, FIFA Online 3 in Asia and The Sims 4. In addition, our EA Access and Origin Access services continue to see rapid growth
Mobile delivered net bookings of $150 million, up 9% year-on-year
This was a Q2 record and also drove the trailing 12-month net bookings to a new high
Growth was primarily from Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and Madden Mobile
Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $119 million, 28% higher than last year, driven by Madden NFL and Battlefield 1. 36% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months
This compares to just 30% a year ago
FIFA 18 launched just days before the end of the quarter, but based on the first three weeks of sales, it was about 25% digital, up from 16% in the comparable period to FIFA 17. The digital portion of Madden sales also increased 9 percentage points year-on-year to 34%
Turning to guidance
Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue remains $5.075 billion
However, we're raising our earnings per share guidance for the full year to $3.63. We're raising our operating cash flow guidance from $1.575 billion to $1.6 billion
We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $120 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.48 billion
Although our expectations for net revenue are unchanged, we are raising our guidance for net bookings from $5.1 billion to $5.15 billion, driven by the strength in Ultimate Team
The difference between GAAP net revenue and net bookings guidance is driven by revenue deferrals
For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.135 billion, cost of revenue to be $521 million and operating expenses to be $690 million
OpEx is up year-on-year primarily due to continued investment in existing and new genres and in existing and new live services
This results in a loss per share of $0.21 for the third quarter
Note that this is calculated using the basic share count of 309 million
Should we report a profit, the diluted share count of 313 million will be used
We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $2 billion
This is down 3% year-on-year with growth in live services offset by the effect of different product launches
Looking further ahead, our growth priorities continue to be the expansion of our live services, including the integration of our esports business across many other titles, the addition of new genres such as action, new business models like our subscription business and to continue to deliver profitable growth in our mobile business
The core of our fiscal 2019 is in a full slate of sports titles and their associated live services, plus new live services from Star Wars Battlefront II
We will add the next Battlefield game and moved into the action genre with Anthem
We expect our subscriber base to continue to grow and our new mobile titles to benefit from players looking for deeper experiences with higher production values
As you start to build your fiscal 2019 models, remember that our event-driven live services continue to be the bedrock of our business
Live services, including mobile live services, were nearly half of our next bookings over the last 12 months
Including our recurring sports titles and catalog sales in the calculation takes us to a total of over 75% of our annual net bookings, leaving less than a quarter of net bookings delivered through the sale of our remaining frontline titles
In addition, our live services are growing strongly
We forecast 10% to 15% growth in fiscal 2018 and we're tracking well ahead of that
We're excited by the progress we're making and the impact it will have on fiscal 2019, particularly given the success we are already seeing in esports driving Ultimate Team revenues and next year's FIFA World Cup in Russia, which is sure to drive interest in soccer around the globe
In conclusion, our sports titles have once again shown their value in delivering a stable and dependable performance
In addition, this quarter demonstrates how they can also drive the digital transformation within our business, both with regards to downloads and to highly enjoyable event-driven live services
As such, they offer a window into how all our games will evolve over the months and years to come
Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew
Hey, Chris, this is Blake
I'll address the digital download piece, then I'll have Andrew do the Star Wars piece
We were very pleased and a bit surprised at the strength of digital downloads, both for FIFA and Madden
FIFA, in particular, since it's such a global game and sold in many markets where digital is not as strong as it is in some of the more mature markets
So it's great to see the movement towards digital
And we attribute that to some digital-only promotions that we did, some special digital packages, as well as the continued involvement of everyone with Ultimate Team, which is 100% digital, and I think that's driving the adoption
Overall, we're continuing to see the 5% number look conservative
It did last year
And it's on track to look conservative again this year
So to us, that signals that we're certainly not slowing in digital
And we might be meeting a inflection point where our consumers are starting to just pick up that pace
So we're very optimistic about where it's going
You clearly can see that in the gross margin differences as you look at our business year-over-year
And we'll continue to do everything we can to push the digital business
This is Blake, again
I'll start on the Ultimate Team one, and then Andrew can address Visceral
Ultimate Team, the number one driver continues to be bringing more people into the base game
And we believe the single player added to Madden this year as well as the single player last year and this year in FIFA were big drivers in bringing people in and introducing them to how to play the game as well as how to play Ultimate Team
And we found the flow of people starting to play Ultimate Team has continued to grow and then people who realize that spending some money in Ultimate Team is actually a lot of fun, and that continued to grow
And overall, that's been across all of the Ultimate Team sports but it's been most prevalent in both FIFA and Madden
I think the other thing to remember is we're getting better and better each year at the live events that we design and run, and those events are more and more fun and bring in more people
And that, plus the fact that we build all of our esports around Ultimate Team has allowed us to continue to drive the business, as everyone who is interested in esports and playing in an esports tournament, either online or in person, has to practice as well and build their Ultimate Team for the esports business and that's what helped drive it as well
Yeah, so I'll talk about the first part and then I'll let Andrew get the The Sims piece
Clearly, The Sims is an exciting addition to the mobile business and for us and we'll see that some time in the coming spring
We also have some unannounced titles that we're working on and so you'll see those
I think all of those will help drive the growth over the next few years, if not longer
A couple of things, I mean, yes the drag from some of the older titles have slowed, but the reality is some of those titles have just stayed around for a long time because they still do great business for us
The key to our mobile business, and I think different than some other people in the industry is, we drive our business just like our console and PC business to be profitable
So we hold up high standards on profitability
We invest around marketing expenses, around a profitable model, so we don't simply try to build the mobile business in an unprofitable way like we've seen some of the people do in this market
And that's something that's not going to change
And we're not going to try to drive top line growth simply with zero profitability
That doesn't do anything for the shareholders
And so you'll see us continue to have steady growth
We've got great products coming down the path in the future
We're very excited about The Sims
I'll let Andrew talk about that
And just since we're on The Sims, I'll just throw in one more, is that as you can see or hear from the prepared text, we mentioned The Sims a couple of times, The Sims 4 as a major driver in the growth in the quarter
We're continue to be very pleased with how The Sims 4 and all the extra content has performed and we're very excited about the Sims 4 console version that will be out later this quarter
And I think that bodes well for the overall Sims franchise both in console, PC, or all, console, PC and mobile
Okay, so first on mobile
We've been doing advertising in some of our mobile games for a long time, many years
And that total advertising number is under $100 million
It is a good business
We operate on a simple principle, which we will not do other mobile game advertising outside of our own games
That is different than what other companies do
Our goal is to keep people inside our network of mobile games
And so if we're going to do mobile game advertising, we would do that simply to steer people to other games inside our network, and that's not going to be advertising dollars for us
It just minimizes our outside marketing costs
But we do do some mobile games
We have some games that we don't do advertising in, and we're continuing to look at opportunities to grow that
But the biggest challenge is most people play mobile games anonymously and anonymous advertising is at very low CPMs versus very structured advertising that you might see out of a Google or a Facebook, where they have strong intent information on the consumer
There maybe some data that we can build that
We're thinking about it in a lot of ways
But right now it's still at a fairly base level
On the guidance, a couple of things to just look at
One is I encourage people to go back and look over the last five years
I think coming out of Q2, we've always been fairly conservative on our guidance going into our largest quarter of the year, Q3. And I don't think we've had any different behavior in how we've given guidance over those last periods of time
And so I don't think there's any messaging whatsoever
I think raising our guidance by $0.10 on the bottom line is a pretty powerful raise and $50 million on the top line
And I think it's consistent with how we've operated historically and signals the positive view we have on the back half of the year
And the split between Q2 and Q3, I challenge you guys on the phone to start doing your models a little more finely and listening to us a little closer on what we tell people
We phase our revenue for you every quarter, and I think we're getting much more – we have a much better ability to predict our revenue because of the large component of live services
And so we're probably going to be better at our guidance over time
So I'd just keep that challenge there to you
Next question
Yeah, Justin
I think most people know that Battlefront, or excuse me, Battlefield 1 last year was a smash success for us and we had a huge Q3 because of that
We also had Titanfall, which while it didn't meet our original expectation, still sold very well
And so with Star Wars Battlefront II and Need for Speed and Sims 4 console, you just can't comp against the strength of Battlefield 1 last year
It's obviously a big quarter for us
Guiding net bookings to $2 billion is huge and the fact that it's only down 3% year-on-year with the strength of Battlefield 1 last year, I think is a huge positive
And live services obviously continue to grow
We're seeing strength across the board there
But we still have some unknowns
We don't yet know how the Battlefront II live service will monetize
We'll find that out over the next quarter
We'll be able to give people a better sense of that in Q4 or Q3 when we talk
But that's part of the unknown
And The Sims 4 on console, while people are very excited about it, we'll just need to see how well that sells
So those are probably the unknowns in the mix versus last year as well as the scale differences
So Eric, I'll address the packaged mix and then Andrew can address the mobile piece
So on packaged mix, obviously Christmas or the holidays is always going to skew towards more physical
People want to have a gift to give someone
But we do know that while Star Wars Battlefront I skewed more heavily than we typically see, we think Battlefront II may not skew quite as much, because the breadth of the game
It addresses some of the interests that the hardcore players wanted
It's got more
It's got space battles
Many of the things that the hardcore and the traditional first-person shooter audience played were not as strong in the first Battlefront, where this there's more of it
So we might see a skew that helps bring that up a little bit, but we don't know for certain yet
We do know there were a lot of people that were both hardcore and the younger audience playing in the beta, so our sense is that we could see a slight skew
We haven't assumed a big number, skew difference in our guidance, but our hope is, is that could ultimately help the margins a little bit in the quarter
I think the other thing to remember is we're trying to build a mobile game that has deep and long engagement
If you look at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, we know that people play for a long time and they play almost every day
And it's driven by the events that we put into the game every few weeks
That's the key to the game model versus a model in which you have to feed the beast all the time with new people to keep the core users engaged
These are games that are really built around a much more engaging loop that people could play over a long period of time
Go ahead
I was just going to say, let me try to answer it
And then I'll let you say or ask your next question and even a third question, if you want
So we're giving guidance on units once a year at the start of the year to help people size things
We're finding units are becoming less and less meaningful to us, because obviously there's a difference between a digital unit and a physical unit
Obviously, we've been surprised on the growth of digital units
And it's all about the live service at the end of the day as well
And so assume that any change in our unit guidance for any game, including Battlefront II, is built into our annual or quarterly guidance changes that we've put in place
And so focus on the revenue guidance and not unit guidance
So now let me let you ask your next question
And I'll stay quiet until I hear it
I would say all of the above
Clearly, all of those are important to us
We're actively working on the extra content piece
You can see that in the numbers that we've put up over the last few years
And where, as Andrew talked about in the call and in his question-and-answer component around Star Wars, we spent a lot of time trying to build out a live service model for Star Wars Battlefront
And we'll see how that plays out
And you can imagine we're thinking and working on live service models on many of our other games
It's critical, because that's how the consumer wants to play the games
And that's why we're driving them that way
Subscription obviously is very important to us
We've been doing a lot of work on Origin Access and EA Access
And as Andrew mentioned, you'll most likely see those on other platforms
And you'll most likely see additional content coming into those subscriptions and some exciting things to come there
But we believe that's a very important way for more consumers to enjoy more games over time at a very reasonable price
And then streaming, ultimately there's a lot of opportunity there
It may be a few years down the road still
But that, plus things like subscription or live services, go together very well
And you can imagine that we are spending a great amount of time, both in our technology world and in our games development on how games would operate in that kind of an environment
So more to come on all that
But I think all of those together, plus the base business that we have today, bodes extremely well for our business and the industry in general
But we're very focused on how do we evolve this model over time to be as profitable as possible and as consistent and repeatable as possible
We think that's what investors want
And we think that delivers the best game services to the consumer
And I think to the point on triple the size, I'm not going to give you a forecast there
But what I would say is soccer is truly a global game and growing in places like China, where we may never have a console market and where PC free-to-play is not growing as fast as it once was, but mobile is continuing to grow very fast
So there's a scenario that says FIFA on mobile could be much larger than 3x Madden
And our hope is that between current FIFA on console, current FIFA on the online market in Korea, Japan and China and Southeast Asia plus mobile would be a huge market for us
And on discounting, let me just make it really clear right now so all you guys don't have anything to write about on Black Friday
We bring the game out right before Black Friday so you will most likely not have discounts at Black Friday that we pay for
That doesn't mean that you might not see some stores choose to discount games on Black Friday out of their own pocket
We will most likely discount the game like we did last time around the movie launch, and maybe you'll even see some selective discounts around the holidays, either Thanksgiving or Christmas
That's the way the games business always has worked
And so if you see the title on discount, don't read anything into that other than the fact that that's the way you sell games in the holidays
In terms of the live service, I can't break out the actual forecast, but I would say it's not large for Battlefront II
Partially in the quarter, because we'll just get it going in the quarter and it will really start to drive the live events coming out of the quarter into the fourth quarter
So we really won't have a good sense of how well it's doing or how large it can be until probably at the tail end of the third quarter and really the tail end of the fourth quarter
But we'll keep you going
But it's not in a position that it's a large component of the fiscal forecast or the quarter forecast
The marketing piece, it's all timing shift
I think we talked about in last quarter
We're doing marketing, a broader marketing and different types of marketing all during the year
And so it's less concentrated around launch time
I think overall, we brought our marketing spend down
You've seen that over the last few years, but don't assume that it's going to be down across the board in the back half of the year
So some of it might not be spent, but most of it is phasing, so
So let me hit the first one really quick
It really varies
In some titles, you'd have a 10% to 25% uplift off of the core, so $60 plus 25% of that
In some titles, they're going to be 125% or 150%
It also varies dramatically by region or geography because you have different spend capabilities around the world
So it's kind of hard to pare it down
Obviously, Ultimate Team is at the high end of the spectrum because it's so engaging and we're running so many events that it just keeps people coming back
So yes, it's hard to generalize
But it's really, we think about it really as how do we keep engaging players
And if they're engaged, they'll probably spend some money along the way and we want to make sure we've got people deeply engaged in something that they love
I'll let Andrew touch the second one really quickly and then we'll do one more question
So one last question, so I can go trick-or-treating
Thanks
Yeah, I mean, we don't formally delay it
We have a digital cut off that's a few days before the end of the actual end of the quarter, and that's just the way we work with our first parties
And so most of the FIFA digital revenue will come in Q3. The bulk of the revenue would either be people who pre-ordered a digital title or purchased digitally two or three days early because they were in EA Access
But almost all the regular digital purchases both for FIFA and for Ultimate Team are in Q3.
I mean, despite the fact that we've talked a lot about digital, it's an important part of our business, we still want to have great relationships with our physical retail partners out there and we think we do around the world
I can't comment on GameStop's intentions relative to their new program
I don't even really have the details about it yet
But we're obviously, we're very cautious of how we ship into all retailers
We've always been that way
We don't want the channel to be overly full, which would create discounting or could ultimately create financial problems for smaller retailers
So we've always watched that closely and we'll be careful again this year
The beauty of digital, as I think you were indicating, is we can be pretty fast and reactive
We can do one-day sales
We can do special promos in certain regions or countries
We can do a lot with digital in a short term that you can't necessarily do with long term
Most of our long-term plans for retailers are locked up six to 12 months ahead of time
And because you've got point-of-sale materials, you've got promotional flyers that go into newspapers, all of those things have to be prepared
And so we set those up well in advance and work with the retailers very carefully on those
So with that, I'll call it quits so everyone can enjoy their Halloween and I appreciate everyone coming on the call this time
We'll talk to you in late January
