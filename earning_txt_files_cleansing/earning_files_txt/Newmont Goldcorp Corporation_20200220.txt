Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to
Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Jessica Largent
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2019
Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call today are Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive
Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be
available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team.

Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our
SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now I'll turn it over to Tom on Slide
3.

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Jess. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. Newmont has a track record of
superior operating and financial performance, and we are continuing to build on this proven record by
exceeding the commitments we made early last year. As we enter our centenary year, I'm excited about
the opportunities we have in front of us to safely deliver superior value for all of our stakeholders.

Turning to Slide 4 for a recap of our major achievements. In 2019, we continued to lead in environmental,
social and governance stewardship by achieving our public targets and being recognized as the gold
industry leader for our performance. Last year, we completed 2 historic transactions, creating the most
balanced portfolio of long-life assets with the ability to generate robust free cash flow for decades to come.
We produced 6.9 million gold equivalent ounces, including 6.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining
costs of $966 an ounce, in line with our full year guidance.

We generated $3.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA and have realized significant value from the Goldcorp
acquisition, exceeding our targets. We also reported the largest reserves in company history, with an
industry-leading 100 million ounces of gold reserves. We drove improvement across our portfolio and
have now delivered $2.7 billion in value through our Full Potential Program since 2013. We also delivered
4 projects on 4 continents on time and within budget, and approved full funds for our next expansion at
Tanami.

We reached agreement to divest Red Lake, KCGM and our holdings in Continental to generate more than
$1.4 billion in cash proceeds. And we returned an unprecedented $1.4 billion to shareholders last year,
with $900 million in dividends and $500 million in share buybacks. This is unmatched in the gold industry.
Our 2019 performance is evidence that we continue to deliver on our commitments.

Turning to Slide 5. We are making excellent progress and exceeding our commitments for value delivery
from our 5 new operations. At the start of last year, we made a commitment to deliver $365 million
of run rate improvements per annum by the end of 2021. I'm very pleased that we are on track to
exceed that commitment by nearly 40%, realizing more than $500 million of cash flow improvements in
2021 through accelerating G&A and exploration synergies along with higher-than-planned Full Potential
improvements at Peñasquito and Cerro Negro. This year alone, we expect to achieve $340 million in cash
flow improvements, representing over 90% of the commitment we made for value delivery from this
transaction. Each of our accomplishments were grounded in the safety of our people and the sustainability
of our operations.

NEWMONT CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Turning to Slide 6. Improving safety remains a relentless focus for all of us here at Newmont. Ensuring
that everyone working in our business can return home safely to their family and friends is paramount.
Through our visible, caring leadership and the integrated systems we put into place to manage risk
consistently across our global operations, we are working to significantly and sustainably improve our
safety performance. My expectation is that everyone who works in our business understands, first and
foremost, the fatality risks associated with their work and are ensuring that the critical controls that are
required to manage them are in place at all times.

A robust safety culture is one that is constantly reinforcing systems, behaviors and actively sharing
lessons learned from serious incidents. This is fundamental to the well-being of our people and underpins
our operating performance. Our sustainability performance is also about consistent application of sound
governance practices across our global business, coupled with the quality of our engagement and the
relationships with key stakeholders. As a measure of our industry-leading performance, we were honored
to be recognized as the top gold mining company by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth year
in a row.

Turning to a look at our global portfolio on Slide 7. Our world-class assets are located in the most balanced
and favorable jurisdictions. We have the industry's largest gold reserves at 100 million ounces, with
nearly 90% located in the Americas and Australia. This offers Newmont shareholders exposure to 124
gold reserve ounces per 1,000 shares. Our reserve base also provides significant exposure to copper,
silver, zinc and lead, representing an additional 63 million gold equivalent ounces. Across our 12 operated
mines and 2 nonoperated joint ventures, we have an average reserve life greater than 10 years, with
mine lives at our largest assets: Boddington, Tanami, Peñasquito and Ahafo extending well into the 2030s,
underpinning the strongest and most sustainable portfolio in the industry.

Turning to Slide 8. We will produce a steady 6.2 million to 6.7 million ounces of gold per year through
2024. In addition, we'll generate $1.5 billion in revenue each year from producing between 1.2 million to
1.4 million gold equivalent ounces with silver, zinc and lead from Peñasquito and copper from Boddington.
Combined, we deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year, the most of any company in our
industry.

Turning to Slide 9. Even during a year involving the closing of 2 historic transactions, our Full Potential
program remained as strong as ever, delivering $430 million of value in 2019. Looking forward, all-in
sustaining costs are expected to improve from $975 an ounce in 2020 to $850 an ounce in 2023 through
the delivery of our Full Potential Program and ongoing investment in profitable projects. Over this time, we
will maintain our capital discipline through investing approximately $1 billion of sustaining capital per year
to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development.

With that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, on Slide 10 to review our
operational performance.

Robert D. Atkinson
Executive VP & COO

Thanks, Tom, and I'll start with an update on Australia's performance on Slide 11. In 2019, Australia
produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $908 per ounce. At Tanami,
we delivered a record year for production and costs with 500,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost
of less than $725 per ounce. Through our Full Potential program, we delivered significant value from
improvements at the pace plant and with greater pace fill reliability, the site can continue to sustainably
increase mine productivity.

Successful delivery of the first Tanami Expansion project in 2017 and the Tanami Power Project in early
2019 have enabled this performance and established a foundation for us to continue expanding this terrific
asset. Our next phase of investment in Tanami Expansion 2 has the potential to extend the life beyond
2040, will reduce operating cost by over 10% and will provide a platform for us to further explore a prolific
mineral endowment in the Tanami district.

NEWMONT CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

At Boddington, we produced approximately 850,000 gold equivalent ounces in 2019 as Full Potential
programs in mining and processing led to improvements in truck and shovel productivities as well as
increased gold recovery. Our planned stripping campaign in the South Pit is progressing very well. In fact,
full potential improvements to truck and shovel productivities has accelerated the time when we will reach
higher grades to earlier in 2021.

And at KCGM, we completed the sale of our 50% ownership in early January. We are supporting Northern
Star and Saracen by providing transitional services through the second quarter. The Australia region has
consistently exceeded conversion targets by more than offsetting depletion. During 2019, Tanami added
1.5 million ounces of gold reserves, and over the last 7 years, reserves have grown by more than 250%
and resources have also increased by nearly 200%. Lastly, Boddington's autonomous haulage system was
approved by our Board of Directors earlier this week, and this world-class asset is positioned to realize
improved productivity and significant value over a 14-year reserve life.

Turning to a bit more detail in Boddington's autonomous haulage system on Slide 12. Over the last several
years, Boddington has delivered a step-change improvement in operational performance, which has
increased mine and mill productivities, added 4.2 million ounces of gold reserves and extended mine life
well into the 2030s. These successes have now positioned the operation to make its next step-change
improvement, the full automation of its haulage fleet. Boddington will invest $150 million to purchase 29
new Cat 793 haul trucks. It will retrofit 7 existing trucks at the site and install the Caterpillar Command
autonomous haulage system. This investment will enhance safety by removing people from the line of fire
and reduce the potential for vehicle-to-vehicle interactions.

These systems will also improve productivity and create a more controlled, predictable and efficient
haulage operation and ultimately, lower Boddington's mining cost per tonne, generating an internal rate
of return of more than 35%. With the improved costs, mine life has extended by at least 2 years from
additional lead banks in the north pit. The support we will receive from Cat will be essential to the success
of this work. And we have a very strong working relationship with them, which has been formed over
many years.

And we are also uniquely positioned to support effective implementation and operation of the fleet, thanks
to the technical capabilities and previous experience of leaders throughout our business. The adoption of
autonomous haulage has true replication potential and will inform our approach to implementing these
systems at other Newmont operations and projects.

Now to our Africa operations on Slide 13. 2019 was a record year for the Africa region with 1.1 million
ounces of attributable gold production at all-in sustaining costs of less than $800 per ounce on the back
of successfully completing Ahafo's expansion projects. We declared commercial production at the Ahafo
Mill Expansion, which will maximize value from higher-grade underground ore, efficiently process ore from
existing open pits and stockpiles, allowing us to deliver stable production well beyond 2030.

Akyem delivered yet another solid quarter and offset lower grade as a site team worked closely with the
process control team at our operations support hub in Perth to drive sustainable Sag Mill throughput
improvements. This is just 1 example of how Newmont is leveraging its global capability to consistently
drive improved performance and productivity right across our portfolio of operations and projects. Looking
forward, as previously highlighted in our guidance, the region will step down to 850,000 ounces in 2020
as Ahafo progresses its stripping campaign for Phase 4 Subika open pit and advances underground
development for the updated mining method at Subika Underground. With the transition to a more
productive underground mining method, Ahafo has increased its reserve and resource base, collectively
adding 1 million ounces in 2019.

Now to discuss our North America operations on Slide 14. North America produced more than 1 million
ounces of gold in 2019, with a strong fourth quarter as expected. At Porcupine, we successfully ramped
up the Borden underground mine, providing additional higher-grade ore. At CC&V, we recovered ounces
from the VLF1 leach pad that had been deferred from prior quarters. And at Éléonore, we delivered a
strong fourth quarter with higher grades at Horizon 5 but expect a softer Q1 as a result of main sequence
changes. Éléonore is a complex ore body when taking into account stope sequencing, backfill requirements
and grade presentation. Our technical services and exploration teams are strongly supporting the

operation to integrate our geology and geotechnical models to optimize a life of mine plan that will safely
and sustainably mine our reserves and extend the life of this ore body.

At Musselwhite, rehabilitation work is nearing completion, and our contract to cementation is progressing
well with the construction and installation of the conveyor. We are on track to have the conveying system
fully commissioned and the Main back at full production by the start of October at the latest. Over the last
6 months, we've been mining ore and building a stockpile ready to feed the mill. This stockpile currently
contains approximately 50,000 ounces of gold. Commissioning of the mill is progressing very well, and in
fact, we just processed first ore from our stockpiles through the mill this week.

At Peñasquito, our work to sustainably improve the cost base offers the potential to build upon an already
exceptional reserve and resource base, similar to what we have achieved at Boddington. In 2019, we
declared gold equivalent reserves of more than 24 million ounces, underpinning a current reserve life of 12
years. And operationally, we delivered a strong finish to the year, which we expect to continue into 2020
as we reach higher grades in the main Peñasco pit.

Turning to Slide 15 for more detail. In 2019, we delivered more than $50 million in cash flow
improvements from quick win initiatives at Peñasquito, exceeding our market commitment for Full
Potential delivery at that operation. When we launched Full Potential at site, our team quickly identified
that the crushing circuit at the front end of the mill, what we call the augmented feed circuit, was the key
bottleneck in the processing plant. And that working this bottleneck to sustainably increase throughput
and improve the quality of crushed ore provided to the Sag Mills would lift the overall performance of the
processing plant. Early quick wins in the augmented feed circuit came at the secondary crusher and high-
pressure grinding rollers, where we replicated our success at Boddington and did a direct lift and shift of
control logic to immediately improve the quality and quantity of feed.

Taken together, these initiatives delivered record crushing throughput and record metal production for
silver, zinc and lead in November. In 2020, we will continue to work this bottleneck hard. And for those
coming to Peñasquito next week, I'm very much looking forward to taking you through more detail on this
and other important work we are doing to deliver more than $100 million of further cost and productivity
improvements at Peñasquito by 2021.

Rounding out the regions with South America on Slide 16. South America produced nearly 1.3 million
ounces of gold and delivered all-in sustaining costs of approximately $815 per ounce in 2019. At Merian,
we delivered better-than-expected fourth quarter performance and have transitioned into mining harder
ore at the Merian 2 Pit. Fresh rock will present higher grade and improve mine productivity, which helps to
offset reduced mill throughput rates.

Yanacocha continues stripping the Quecher Main pit as we move out of higher-grade ore in the Tapado
Oeste pit, and we are now placing Quecher Main ore on the new Carachugo leach pad, and we expect to
see recovery of these ounces during 2020. At Cerro Negro, we mined higher grades as expected from
Eureka and Mariana Norte and worked to develop out Emilia is progressing well as production begins to
ramp up from this new mining area later in 2020.

And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 17.

Nancy K. Buese
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 18 for the financial highlights. I'm pleased to report strong fourth quarter
and 2019 results. During the fourth quarter, Newmont delivered revenue of nearly $3 billion, an increase
of 45% over the prior year quarter, with the additional sales from our new operations and higher gold
prices. Adjusted net income of $410 million or $0.50 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3
billion, an increase of 70% from the prior year quarter.

Cash from continuing operations was $1.2 billion driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow of over
$775 million, an increase of more than $300 million from the prior year quarter. With a solid finish to the
year, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.7 billion and free cash flow of more than $1.4
billion or $1.92 per share, of which we paid an annual dividend of $0.56 per share. We also paid out an

NEWMONT CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

additional $470 million in 2019 in the form of a special dividend. Finally, in association with the $1 billion
share buyback we announced in December 2019, we have already repurchased $500 million worth of
shares.

Turning to Slide 19 for a review of earnings per share in more detail. Fourth quarter GAAP net income from
continuing operations was $537 million or $0.66 per share. Adjustments included $0.11 related to this
change in fair value of investments, $0.10 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance and $0.05
of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income
of $0.50 per diluted share.

Turning to Slide 20. At Newmont, we build our annual business plan based on conservative assumptions,
including a $1,200 gold price and a disciplined approach through which mine plans are developed based
on reserves and the best demonstrated performance of plants and equipment. Our base plan at $1,200
gold price allows us to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet with a focus on our maturity profile,
to maintain our infrastructure and invest in mine development through a steady $1 billion of sustaining
capital.

We continue investing in organic growth, including approximately $600 million to $700 million of
development capital expenditures and another $250 million of exploration and $150 million of advanced
project investment per annum, and returned cash to shareholders through an industry-leading annual
dividend. In January, we announced a plan to increase our annual dividend by 79% to $1 per share,
reflecting the confidence we have in our business to deliver substantial cash flows well into the future. The
increased dividend will be effective upon approval and declaration of our first quarter 2020 dividend in
April.

Turning to Slide 21. We expect to generate significant free cash flow through this cycle. At current gold
prices, our portfolio will generate more than $10 billion of free cash flow over the next 5 years. And even
using our more conservative $1,200 gold price base, free cash flow would still total $5 billion over that
same period. As shown on this slide, for every $100 per ounce increase in gold prices above our base
assumption, we'll deliver approximately $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year.
Excess free cash will be used towards debt reduction and further shareholder returns.

Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue a trajectory of industry-leading financial performance
by executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long-term value creation.

And now I'll hand it over to Tom to wrap up on Slide 22.

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Nancy. Turning to Slide 23. We continue to build momentum and are taking the necessary steps
to position our business for long-term success. We remain focused on the 5 foundational principles of
our strategy: keeping our people safe with our relentless commitment to our safety culture and systems;
growing margins through the application of our operating, technical and exploration discipline; leveraging
our exploration program and unmatched portfolio to grow reserves and resources; optimizing our world-
class project pipeline; and maintaining discipline around capital allocation.
Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Murphy of Barclays.

Matthew Murphy
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I had some questions on some of the former Goldcorp asset reserves. I mean if we start with Éléonore,
you're getting down there in reserve life now, and I'm just wondering what your confidence is to extend
that back out. And what are the key factors? Is it exploration or is it more about getting cost down so you
can bring in more economic ounces?

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'll start off, Matt, and I've got my Chief Technology Officer, Dean Gehring, with me here and might
have a few comments as well. But the story for me at Éléonore is a parallel to the story you'll have seen
us follow at Leeville. We've got a complex ore body where you need to make sure that geology model and
your geotechnical model are well aligned and integrated to form your life of mine plan, and you're taking
into consideration stope sequencing and backfill and the like. That is a key focus for us at that operation,
so we've applied our Newmont discipline to how we determine reserves and resources.

We actually have the same people that worked through the very good work we did at Leeville several
years ago, Kate Williams and Dave Thornton. The very same people are working on the ground with the
team at Éléonore to build those integrated plans. And if you look at Leeville today and look at the life that
it has in front of it, it's a great deal of credit can be put in the hands of Dave and Kate for that work. So
we're getting those basic models and plans in place and then combining that with an exploration program
combined with Full Potential bringing costs down to look to extend the life with reserves and resources
that meet the Newmont standard. Dean, was there anything you want to add to that?

Dean R. Gehring
Executive VP & CTO

Yes. Thanks, Tom. Matthew, one of the things -- a couple of things I'd like to add to that. One is, as you
probably know, at Newmont, we provide and apply very high standards to how we determine our reserves
and resources. And let me provide a little bit of background and also get and lead up to some specifics
around your question on Éléonore. So our standard for our study requirements in our drill spacing far
exceeds any regulatory agencies and current codes like JORC, SEC or 43-101. And I would also say we
don't apologize for having those high standards because it has resulted in us -- that disciplined approach,
it results in us being very consistent delivering against our plan.

But to illustrate the point of how that plays through in our reserves and resource calculations, we can look
at a mine like Cerro Negro as a starting point. And so as we applied our standards to that site, we end up
reclassifying about 1.5 million ounces, but it went from reserves to resources. And because of -- it's still a
highly prospective area, we're confident that those resources are going to come right back into reserves,
just as we do a little bit more work.

And just quickly to illustrate the point further, if we look at Peñasquito, we see that the reserves there
maintained what they were before. But through our work, we actually added an additional 3 million ounces
on the resource side. But switching to Éléonore, specifically your question, if we go back to what Rob
mentioned earlier, Éléonore is a complex ore body. And when we apply our demonstrated performance to
the mining wits and the dilutions, we ended up revising about 1 million ounces out of there. And the rest
of the revisions really came from geologic model update similar to what Tom mentioned earlier.

So the net of all those revisions resulted in resources remaining about the same at 1 million ounces, but
those resources that we have there are at a much higher level of confidence than they were before. But I

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

NEWMONT CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

think what's important to recognize out of all this is that we know how to mine deposits like Éléonore. To
Tom's point, we have a strong technical team that allows us to deploy the resources where they're needed.
And it allows us to take full advantage of our Full Potential program and also to rapidly replicate our best
practices. So I'm fully confident that we're going to continue to extend the mine life there and that we're
not looking at a short mine life.

Matthew Murphy
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And you touched on Cerro Negro, so I'll leave it there.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank.

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

The first one is just around the autonomous opportunity that you've mentioned at Boddington. Just
wondering if you can give a bit more color on the actual savings on a per tonne of mining. And also, just
as a follow-up, will you likely wait until seeing how that goes at Boddington? Or are you looking at other
sites between now and 2021 in advance of that?

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Chris. I'll take the second part of your question, and Rob, just pulling out he can give you the
answer to the second part. If not, we can go off-line and get those numbers to you. Very important part
of autonomous haulage is to bed it down and improve the operation of that technology in our gold mining
environment and to manage through the change, management process associated with that. So very
important part of Boddington achieving the level of performance that it has, and through that level of
performance, extending its mine life to underpin the replacement of a mining fleet with an autonomous
mining fleet is an excellent opportunity for us to bring autonomous into our business.

We'd be looking, first and foremost, at using that technology to prove up the base case for some of the
key projects that we have in our project pipeline. So it's been a very large gold-copper deposits that we've
got a pre-feasibility study. So proving up Boddington and having that inform those pre-feasibility studies
would be the first. And then if there were opportunities around our business to either replace fleet or
convert fleet, we would consider that. You need to have the mine life in front of you in order to be able to
justify the replacement of a mining fleet. So those opportunities may present, but the -- it's more about
presenting the base case for those very important studies we have at pre-feasibility stage. Rob?

Robert D. Atkinson
Executive VP & COO

Chris, thanks very much for the question. And we're conservatively estimating that we're going to get
a 20% improvement in productivity with the trucks in terms of the material that they can move. And
that will obviously transfer to a lower cost per tonne. The key areas that we'll be focusing on most of all
are around the shift changes. Obviously, that disappears, the maintenance requirements, the increased
speed and also the ability to get greater payloads. So all in all, where we're sitting is about a 20% initial
estimate. But obviously, we're going to be hoping to push that very, very hard, and we've certainly seen
some great performance in other mining companies. And we certainly believe we can do that and some --
moving forward.

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And then just in terms of the operations, thinking about the 2020 progression. Just wondered if you could
highlight just sort of the quarter-to-quarter and half-to-half split. I noticed you mentioned Éléonore weak

NEWMONT CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

in the first quarter, obviously, Musselwhite, second half weighted. You've gone through a couple of the
other assets, but I just wondered if you could make some comments on that.

Robert D. Atkinson
Executive VP & COO

Sorry. Just, Chris, is there an operation in particular you want to talk about?

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just wondering, in general, as you go through your yearly guidance, just thinking about it maybe first half
versus second half or just items to look for on a quarterly progression, just overall. I know you don't guide
specifically to the quarter but just things that we should look out for as the year goes on.

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

So Chris, Tom here. You are going to see a little bit softer first half to second half. You're looking at a
maybe softer, I mean, like 48% versus 52% half-to-half. So at -- in my world, that's a pretty even year.
Mine sequence, certainly at Éléonore, has you seeing some lower gold ounces, particularly in the first
quarter. Musselwhite, you're going to obviously see a lower first half to second half as we start to feed ore
in -- we're already feeding ore. In fact, Rob's being a little bit conservative. We actually produced our first
gold this week from Musselwhite, and we'll ramp up that plant in the second half of the year.

Just looking down at the list of mine sites, you're going to see in Africa, weighted to the second half of
the year, particularly at Ahafo as we start to get in some high-grade ore at Subika. You're going to be
weighted to the second half of the year at Akyem as we get in some higher-grade ore in their open pit.
Pretty even year through Tanami. Boddington, you're going to start to see them get into some high-
grade in the second half of the year, so there's a weighting to the second half for Boddington. Pretty even
through Pueblo Viejo, Cerro Negro pretty even.

Merian, you'll start to see them softer in the second half as we start to get into more of the high grade
but harder ore and then start to price that through the primary crusher, you lose mill productivities.
Yanacocha, as we get into the Quecher Main stripping campaign, you'll see a bit lower in the second half
to the first. Peñasquito, you'll start to see us move into higher grade ores in the second half. So a bit
stronger in the second half. Éléonore, I talked about. Peñasquito, pretty even year. And CC&V, we'll start
to see some higher leach ounces coming through in the second half of the year. Does that give you some
flavor?

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes, yes, that's great. That's very helpful. It's exactly what I was after. And then the -- sorry.

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

One other, Chris, to keep in mind as you're looking at cash flow, we'll start to ramp up our spend on
development capital as we start to ramp up our work at Tanami 2. So you will see that in the second half
as well.

Christopher Michael Terry
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, great. And the last one for me. I mean you've obviously done the main divestments, Kalgoorlie,
Red Lake, where the portfolio stands today. Is there anything that's noncore? I don't think so, but I just
wanted to check.

NEWMONT CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 20, 2020

Chris, there are 12 operations that we're going to drive value from, so you're going to see us absolutely
focused on delivering and exceeding our commitments from those 12 operations. There are a couple of
areas that we're working on that aren't part of our core operations. One is that we have a power business
in Kalgoorlie that we're working through. If you remember from the announcement with Northern Star,
they've got first rights to make an offer for that. But that's material in terms of the value of that power
business.

And the other area we're doing is cleaning up our equity portfolio, so we're actively working that. And
you might see the order through the combination of all of those things up to $300 million of proceeds,
$200 million to $300 million of proceeds that may come from that. So I'd call that sweeping up, but it's a
material number as we work to clean house in the first half of this year.

Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities.

Greg Barnes
TD Securities Equity Research

A question for Rob Atkinson on Peñasquito. Just curious on the work you're doing on the front end of the
plant and how that debottlenecking is improving the throughput versus when you acquired the asset to
where you think you can get it to.

Robert D. Atkinson
Executive VP & COO

Thanks very much, Greg, and very, very clear. That's where the bottleneck is that we're sitting at a rate of
37 million tonne throughput for the year. We're looking at getting that up to 39 million very quickly. Now
that certainly isn't the end to it. But as you balance the different products between the gold and the zinc
and the lead and the silver, you do have to balance the back end of the plant with the front end, but we've
certainly been able to choke-feed through that front end and we're looking at 39 million tonne throughput.

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Greg, are you coming to Peñasquito next week? Because we're going to go into some detail with the folks
that are visiting.

Greg Barnes
TD Securities Equity Research

Yes, I am absolutely coming. And just wanted to jump the gun a little bit, Tom. On Full Potential, have you
fully deployed that across all of the Goldcorp operations now?

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Rob, you want to...

Robert D. Atkinson
Executive VP & COO

Not quite yet, but we've -- Éléonore is very well advanced. Obviously, Peñasquito is fully advanced. That
Porcupine is ramping up. And given where Musselwhite is at with the conveyor, that's going to be the last
one to ramp up. But on the whole, we're making very, very good progress. And even though Full Potential
isn't ramped up fully at Porcupine and Musselwhite, the level of engagement between our technical teams
and our operational teams is very significant. So we're making very good progress.

Greg Barnes
TD Securities Equity Research

And how about at Cerro Negro, Rob?

Robert D. Atkinson
Executive VP & COO

Beg your pardon. Cerro Negro is -- was one of the first to kick off, that's proceeding well. And again, we
have a terrific SME support down there. And we're focusing on some key things down there. Just a handful
of things which will make a difference. And the big one is improving, the development rates there and the
productivity of the equipment in general, and we're certainly seeing some good early wins there.

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Greg, both Peñasquito and Cerro Negro through the diagnosis and design phases and firmly into their
delivery phases. That's -- so we're through that and we're into the 18 month-delivery. Éléonore is now
in there. They've been through the diagnosis and then now into the design phase. So the 2 assets that
deliver significant value in Peñasquito delivers huge value with firmly in the deliver phase.

Greg Barnes
TD Securities Equity Research

Yes, it looks like you could see that in the Q4 results.

Our next question comes from Josh Wolfson of RBC.

Joshua Mark Wolfson
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just switching over to the capital allocation side of things. With the buyback, I guess, half complete within
a pretty short time frame, if and when that's ultimately exhausted, I guess, prior to the full sort of time
lines, how do you see that program going forward? And I guess, what's the motivation to look at allocating
funds towards that versus dividend?

Nancy K. Buese
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. So on the buybacks, I think they would consider that really tied to our
asset sales. And so between that and an opportunity to buy back shares at a very, very attractive share
price, we feel like that was the right thing to do, and so we will continue that program through the end of
2020. And we will also consider, at these gold prices, when we think about capital allocation, we'll continue
to manage the balance sheet, and we'll think about other shareholder-friendly actions. Certainly, a key
one of those will be to determine our appropriate level of dividend on a go-forward and sustainable basis.
So that's something that we will continue to evaluate. And truly, to remember that the dividend at $1 is
sustainable at a $1,200 gold price so at a more robust pricing going forward, that's something we will be
definitely continuing to revisit.

Joshua Mark Wolfson
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. So it's safe to say, I guess, the approach seems to be windfall of cash flow is attributed to the
buyback and business sustainability is the focus for the dividend?

Nancy K. Buese
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, that's correct.

CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just looking at Porcupine, can you just talk about the changes to the reserve there? I know you moved
Dome from -- or you said you were going to move Dome from reserves into resources. But to me, it looks
like you've taken 8 million ounces out -- totally out of the global inventory. Is that correct?

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Probably need to go off-line with you on that one, Anita. We certainly moved some Century out of reserve
into resource and we certainly kept some reserve in where we could still mine those ounces. So that might
be one that we can quickly get Jess and Dan to -- and Dean to jump off the line and take you through.

Anita Soni
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Right. And then when you were -- you talked about -- or Rob talked about applying your more rigorous
drill density requirements. Did you also take a look at -- and this is to the overall Goldcorp, all of the
assets. Did you also take a look at Goldcorp's cost assumptions at this stage or is that still to come?

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

I'll get Dean to comment on that one for you, Anita.

Dean R. Gehring
Executive VP & CTO

Yes, Anita, we looked at the whole suite of variables that go into calculating the reserves so we looked
at the cost assumptions. And also, as Nancy mentioned during her part of the presentation, we also
consider best demonstrated performance. So we don't build in stretch or upside into any of our reserves or
resource determinations.

Anita Soni
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Right. And so given that Musselwhite perhaps won't be looking to grow as it previously did, you're okay
with the cost structure that's supporting the current reserves right now?

Dean R. Gehring
Executive VP & CTO

Yes. And then we also took a look at that, too, in terms of its best demonstrated performance.

Anita Soni
CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division

All right. And then just in terms of areas where we saw declines at other assets that you own, so -- that
were within your portfolio. Can you talk about -- so you had some wins at Tanami and you talked a bit
about that. But could you just talk about what was happening at Ahafo South as well as at -- sorry, at
Merian?

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Again, Anita, we can probably go off-line on that detail. But I mean, Ahafo South, there's ounces coming
in with the change in mining method. And Merian, we've got ounces coming in as we continue to drill out
around there. Terrific story at Tanami, the story here as talking more about is the Oberon deposit with the
first ounces coming into resource. That's going to be a terrific addition to the Tanami story. But more than
happy to maybe jump off-line and go through asset-by-asset and take you through that detail.

Our next question comes from Mike Jalonen of Bank of America.

Michael Jalonen
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just had a question, we haven't really heard much of Nevada Gold Mines. I know Mark Bristow spoke
about it. But on Page 5, your synergy value chart. Mark spoke about another $60 million of synergies in
Nevada, lowering the cutoff grade on his call last week. Just wondered, do any -- do those fit on Page 5
anywhere? Or is that just Newmont?

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Mark, terrific to get a question from you. Slide 5 is just the Goldcorp synergies, so we have built into our
guidance for Nevada Gold Mines, the synergies that Barrick have provided publicly. So that's built into our
plan. But in the $500 million of cash flow that we will deliver in 2021, in the $340 million of cash flow that
we will deliver this year, all of that comes from the 5 new operations that came into our business from
Goldcorp.

Operator

Our next question comes from Adam Graf of B. Riley.

Adam Philip Graf
B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division

Just a quick question. Just thinking down the line a bit longer term. You guys have some big projects
that are JV-ed with some base metal producers who have their own projects and their own balance sheet
capacity. And I was just curious if you maybe could give us some color on how you're coordinating longer
term with your JV partners in regards to the development and the timing of those projects, considering
their own -- they're not benefiting from the higher gold price.

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

Yes, thanks, Adam. So one of the beauties of our portfolio is it's some -- as it's now positioned, is that we
have, across those 12 operations and the ore bodies that sit underneath them and the 3 projects that we
have in either definitive feasibility study or execution. So Tanami 2, Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides,
the ability to sequence those projects in. And they are the 3 projects that underpin the 6 million to 7
million ounces of steady development capital spend over the better part of this decade that Nancy was
talking about.

Those 3 projects, plus the exploration potential of our existing assets and the opportunity to improve the
performance of our existing assets, give us a steady profile north of 6 million ounces for this decade at
least. So we'll talk more about that in the weeks ahead. But what that allows us to do with those 3 big
projects, Norte Abierto, Nueva Unión and Galore Creek that I see sitting in pre-feasibility study is for us
to work with our joint venture partners to apply some of our key strategic mine planning methodology
that we have within Newmont, understand those ore bodies, to optimize those ore bodies, to establish
a competition for capital and see which of those come forward first because we'll only implement those
in series, which of those will come first towards the latter part of this decade, if not the start of the next
decade, for implementation. And I think that sits pretty consistently with our joint venture partners are
thinking about those projects.

So I think we're aligned. And the beauty of our portfolio is that we have plenty of time to really optimize
those projects and bring them on. And we will get from each of those projects, along with Yanacocha
Sulfides, an excellent exposure to copper as the globe goes through the energy transition. So I'm very
excited about our organic pipeline, and I think we can work well with our JV partners to bring them on
when they're ready to come on.

Our next question comes from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research.

John Charles Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

With the interruptions at Musselwhite and Peñasquito and declassifications at Éléonore, and the Yukon and
Dome and the Red Lake sale, all in all, are you still happy with the Goldcorp purchase? You appeared to
buy it almost at the bottom and at about 30% of what Goldcorp had spent on its assets.

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

John, in a word, yes, it's a fantastic acquisition. Those assets are terrific ore bodies. There are -- there's
excellent infrastructure and they're in very good hands, and we're going to deliver huge value from them.
So it was a fantastic acquisition. And I think we're demonstrating what those assets can really do when
they're in the hands of an operating company like Newmont.

John Charles Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

Is it a reasonable hope or expectation for the Éléonore resources to come back to reserves? And also the
Coffee, Yukon and Dome, Century resources? Or should we limit that optimism just to Éléonore?

Thomas Ronald Palmer
President, CEO & Director

But yes, you should be optimistic about Éléonore and the upside potential as we apply Newmont
exploration skills to that asset. For Coffee, we've put that study back where it should be in pre-feasibility
study. And it's one of the deposits that our head of exploration is very excited about, and we want at least
2 seasons of drilling to prove out that ore body. And what we're looking at with the Century project is
understanding what that mixed life, that -- what that mixed layback is at Porcupine. So we're actively
working that project at the right level to look to see what we can do to bring those ounces into that
business. And we're working and we'll continue to work bloody hard at Porcupine to get their productivities
up and improve their cost, which will further enhance the ability to bring -- essentially what will be a
layback, back into that mine.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom
