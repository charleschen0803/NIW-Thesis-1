Presentation

Operator

Welcome to Franklin Resources Earnings Conference Call for the quarter and fiscal year ended September
30, 2021. Hello, my name is April, and I will be your call operator today. As a reminder, this conference is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Head of Investor Relations for
Franklin Resources. Thank you. You may begin.

Selene Oh
Head of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarterly and fiscal year results. Please
note that the financial results to be presented in this commentary are preliminary.

Statements made on this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical
facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results

important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A section, of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and
10-Q filings.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Executive Officer.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Selene. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's
results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're also very excited to announce the acquisition of
Lexington Partners, and I am delighted to extend our warmest welcome to such a talented team.

Lexington's business provides us the exposure to a critical growth area in the alternative asset business,
and we cannot be happier with this new partnership. We'll cover more on this transaction in a few
minutes.

Matthew Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are on the call with me
today. We're also joined by Tom Gann, Head of Franklin Templeton Alternatives and Will Warren, President
of Lexington Partners, who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.

I'll start by reviewing this year's milestones, then Matt will go through our financial results for the quarter
and the fiscal year as well as spend some time discussing today's important transaction in greater detail.

Throughout Franklin Templeton's history, we have invested in our business to build a truly diversified
and resilient organization that performs across market cycles with a commitment to serving our clients,
employees and shareholders. The results that we announced today represent the first full fiscal year
since we closed the Legg Mason acquisition, a transformational transaction that created a more balanced
business across asset classes, client mix and geographies.

We are pleased to report that the strategic and financial benefits from our acquisition of Legg Mason
exceeded our goals, and we have added important growth opportunities. Over the course of the year, we
have created a management team consisting of key representation from Franklin Templeton, Legg Mason
and our specialist investment managers. We have maintained our culture while invigorating collaboration
and innovation across the firm.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

Through the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've successfully brought 2 firms together to
maximize our collective potential, one that successfully combines the attributes of global strength with
boutique specialization. We've made strong progress and yet in so many ways, we're just getting started.

Turning to investment performance. There's been an improvement in performance across a broad
base of investment strategies. Through September, 71%, 69%, 72% and 77% of strategy composites
outperformed their respective benchmarks across the 4 key time periods. This quarter, we had 53% of
mutual fund AUM in funds with 4- or 5-star ratings by Morningstar compared to 43% a year ago.

During the year, we focused on updating our global distribution efforts by enhancing our generalist
specialist model, reshaping client coverage and deepening relationships in each sales region, particularly
with the largest global financial institutions.

Fiscal year long-term inflows doubled to $365 billion from the prior year, notably the U.S., which is our
largest sales region with over $1.1 trillion in AUM was net flow positive for the year. In terms of notable
organic growth, we saw positive net flows in our core growth areas, including alternatives, SMAs, wealth
management and ESG-specific strategies. We executed important acquisitions to further grow and
diversify our business in alternative assets, customization and distribution of investment strategies.

In terms of other accomplishments, our alternative asset strategies, an important area of focus for us,
generated positive net flows in each quarter during the year and grew by 19% from the prior year to $145
billion in AUM with contributions from a diverse group of strategies, including real estate, infrastructure,
private debt and hedge funds.

Several years ago, we announced our intention to create a full suite of alternative strategies, and we
have been very deliberate in building our capabilities. In 2018, the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners
brought us a leading alternative credit manager. In 2020, we added a world-class real estate manager
with Clarion Partners. This focus on alternatives led us to today's announcement of the acquisition of
Lexington Partners, a leader in secondary private equity and co-investments. We now have top-tier
specialist investment managers in all of the key alternative categories with Benefit Street Partners, Clarion
Partners, Franklin Venture Partners, K2 and now Lexington Partners.

Specifically with the Lexington Partners transaction, I'm excited that Franklin Templeton will be partnering
with such an outstanding firm that is led by an experienced and talented team immediately bringing us
scale and capabilities in an attractive and growing global market. There will be no changes to the team
or its independent investment management product, and they will continue to operate autonomously as
Lexington partners.

Upon the close of this transaction, we expect our alternative AUM to approach approximately $200 billion
and over $1 billion in revenue, excluding performance fees, Matt will review the additional details of the
transaction shortly.

Another core growth area is our separately managed account business. We are a top 3 provider in SMAs
with $125 billion in assets under management, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in retail. Our
SMA business grew by 23% in AUM year-over-year and generated positive net flows in each quarter during
the fiscal year.

Our recently announced acquisition of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management and its custom indexing
platform, Canvas, will take our existing strengths in SMAs to the next level enhancing our tax
management factor-based and ESG customization capabilities. Canvas was launched in late 2019 and
has seen strong growth since its inception and now represents $1.9 billion of the firm's total AUM of
$6.3 billion as of September 30. The transaction will bring compelling benefits to the clients that both
companies serve across multiple channels.

There's no question that investors are more focused on ESG goals than ever before. Increasingly, there
are 3 dimensions to ESG that investors consider: ESG factors, as understood risks in a portfolio; how ESG
contributes to overall returns and the overall impact of ESG considerations to society and the environment.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

As an active manager, approximately 95% of our AUM represents strategies that consider ESG factors as
part of the investment process and ESG-specific strategies representing over $200 billion in AUM were net
flow positive in each quarter this fiscal year.

All this being said, none of our accomplishments this past year would be possible, if it weren't for our
employees. We are extremely fortunate to have such dedicated colleagues who are focused on achieving
investment excellence, fostering enduring relationships and delivering superior service to our broad range
of investors around the globe.

Now I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Matt Nicholls, who will review our financial results from the fourth
quarter and fiscal year as well as take you through the specifics of the Lexington transaction. Matt?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jenny. Fourth quarter long-term net outflows were $9.9 million (sic) [ $9.9 billion ], which
were partially offset by the acquisition of Diamond Hill's high-yield focused U.S. corporate credit mutual
funds, which added $3.5 billion in AUM and closed in July.

This quarter included the previously disclosed $5.4 billion 529 plan redemption, which included $4.7 billion
of long-term assets, a $2 billion fixed income institutional redemption that had minimal impact to revenue
and $800 million of fixed income outflows from the nonmanagement fee earning India credit funds that
are in the process of liquidation.

Reinvested dividends were $2.3 billion this quarter, 1% higher average assets under management of
$1.55 trillion compared to the prior quarter plus $69 million of performance fees generated $1.66 billion in
adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter. Investment management fees, excluding performance fees, were
[ 3% ] higher compared to the prior quarter.

Adjusted operating expenses of $1.01 billion for the quarter were 3% lower due to lower compensation
and lower G&A as a result of last quarter's upfront closed-end fund expenses. This led to an 8% increase
in adjusted operating income of $647 million and an adjusted operating margin of 39%.

Fourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $645
million or $1.26 per share. These results include favorable discrete tax items of $155 million or $0.30 per
share for the quarter.

Turning to 2021 fiscal year financial results, which benefited from favorable market conditions and a full
year of Legg Mason versus 2 months last year. For the full year, adjusted revenues were $6.32 billion and
adjusted operating expenses were $3.94 billion, an increase of 63% and 65%, respectively. This led to
fiscal year adjusted operating income of $2.38 billion, which was 60% higher compared to the prior year.
Our adjusted operating margin was 37.7%.

Compared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income increased 46% to $1.92 billion and adjusted
diluted earnings per share increased 43% to $3.74 per share, which included the impact of favorable
discrete tax items of $175 million or $0.34 per share for the full year.

As planned, we have achieved a run rate of 85% of our targeted merger-related cost synergies of $300
million this year. We anticipate that 100% of these synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year
2022. As a reminder, none of these cost efficiencies involved our specialist investment managers or
investment teams.

Moving on to capital management. We believe our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with
financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business. For the fiscal year ended September 30, we
returned $782 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the year, we also
prefinanced a large portion of legacy Legg Mason debt with lower cost of debt, reflecting our credit profile.

Specifically, we issued $850 million of 1.6% senior notes due 2030 and $350 million, 2.95% notes due
2051. We redeemed $250 million 6.38% Legg Mason junior subordinated notes due 2056 on March 15,
2021, and $500 million of 5.45% Legg Mason junior subordinated notes due 2056 on September 15, 2021.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

We ended the quarter with $6.93 billion of cash and investments. We will continue to prioritize our
dividend and intend to repurchase enough shares to at least offset our employee equity grants. The
remainder of our capacity will focus on continued investments in our business and acquisitions to further
diversify and increase our sources of cash flow while positioning our -- and new growth opportunities
as the industry continues to evolve. Consistent with this, we are excited to share the specifics on the
acquisition of Lexington Partners that we announced this morning.

As outlined in the transaction summary document, Lexington Partners is a global leader in secondary
private equity and co-investments with current fee-based AUM of $34 billion. Since its founding in 1994,
Lexington has raised over $55 billion in aggregate capital commitments and currently has a team of 135
(sic) [ 139 ] employees across 8 global offices. It is expected to generate revenue of approximately $350
million and EBITDA of approximately $150 million in 2022.

With this acquisition, we now have strong and complementary capabilities in alternative credit, real estate,
hedge fund solutions and PE-related activities. Given the overall size and growth of private equity and the
likelihood of further private market expansion, having a specialist investment manager tied to this sector
of alternative assets is a logical step in the diversification of our business.

Furthermore, providing access diversified versions of higher returning investments will continue to
increase in importance to meet savings and retirement goals of our broad group of clients. This could
also be important in both our multi-asset solutions business and the continued development of our
customization capabilities.

As Jenny mentioned earlier, this transaction takes us one important step further in creating a larger and
more diversified alternative asset business and will result in pro forma fiscal year 2022 alternative asset
AUM of approximately $200 million (sic) [ $200 billion ], producing approximately $1 billion in annual
management fee revenue excluding performance fees at a margin of approximately 40%.

We intend to continue adding complementary business in both wealth management and asset
management, including asset class and geographic expansion. This will be both organic investment
through allocating capital into our existing specialist investment managers and fire acquisitions.

Given our global reach, financial flexibility, business model and experience in execution, we're able to
attract highly talented teams and partnerships looking for a combination of independence, support and
collaboration on a global and local scale to create new growth opportunities in what is a very large and
expanding segment of the asset management industry.

Turning to financial terms of the transaction. We're acquiring 100% Lexington Partners for $1 billion in
cash at closing plus a further $750 million in cash over the next 3 years. We have also structured this
transaction to ensure continuity and strong alignment of interest with Lexington's clients, partners and
employees over the long term.

Consistent with this, we will be simultaneously issuing grants equal to 25% of Lexington to employees
of Lexington, subject to 5 years vesting and establishing a performance-based cash retention pool of
$338 million to be paid over the next 5 years. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our fiscal
second quarter subject to customary approvals.
And now we would like to open the call up to your questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So I like that you're using the cash to buy into good businesses. I think everything is accretive when
you're earning nothing on cash. So I'm a big fan of that. If I took all the purchase price pieces and we
can't see it all, it looks to me in the range of high teens to 20x EBITDA. I'm just curious if that's about
right? And what kind of ROI that kind of comes out to?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

[Technical Difficulty]

whether you take the $1.75 billion or whether you take the $1.75 billion plus in $338 million of additional
and deferred compensation.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And maybe the 25% of the company also, right?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So yes, of course. Yes. Well, yes, I mean, the multiples we just referred to assume 75% of the
EBITDA numbers that we just announced. So pretty simple just take 150x 75% divided by the amount
we're paying.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And I'm curious on -- you are piecing as you went through, you're piecing together a bunch
of interesting pieces of the alternative pie. So between Benefit Street, Lexington, Clarion and K2, what's
the thought process on how you do or do not integrate? I noticed that you're forming and funding a
specialist distribution team, but the historical Legg Mason never really integrated their boutiques. So
curious on how you're approaching the integration of all your alternative pieces?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

I'll start and then have Tommy add to it. So obviously, one of the differences when you acquire alternative
managers is there's a lot of things that traditional asset managers can be shared across investment teams
that isn't the case. For example, an alternatives manager may want their own legal expertise as they're
doing deals and things. And so there's a lot more of it sits within the independent specialized investment
team in the alternatives world.

And in one of the changes that we've made with the acquisition of Legg Mason is having more institutional
salespeople within the investment groups. So that's already part of an alternatives manager. And what
we are working hard to build as we believe the opportunity to democratize alternative assets in the more
retail channel is that global distribution of alternatives. I don't know, Tom, do you want to add anything to
that?

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

No. Yes. I mean, I think that's exactly it. I mean I think we see opportunities in alternatives broadly
defined, and you expect that to continue to grow at a really strong rate. And it's really sort of bringing the
power of the platform to bear on the distribution alternatives, both institutional and retail. And the joint
venture that we've effectively created is first focusing on retail and then we'll look to expand it. But given
the $200 billion now in AUM, we can afford to invest more in these types of products and services, which I
think is going to be good for everybody.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

And Glenn, just one other point. As we have tried to fill out our product breadth, we really believe the
opportunity of multi-asset solutions. That's where it gets knitted together as well, and that's kind of a
-- requires the teams to be communicating, you're going to look at risk factors across as you're building
additional products around that.

Operator

Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So maybe just building a little bit more on Lexington and kind of what that business looks like. I guess,
first, pretty impressive growth in their funds over the last couple of vintages. Maybe give us a sense what
you are assuming in terms of growth for Lexington into '22 and '23 and what their earnouts are going to
be based on?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

let Will take that answer.

Wilson S. Warren
Lexington Partners L.P.

Thanks. Yes, we've been able to raise significant capital in our areas of focus in secondaries, both our
flagship funds, our middle market funds and then our co-investment business. So there's some structural
drivers in each of those businesses that we think expand the market opportunity as we look forward. So
we're excited to go after it with our new partners, and that's really it.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And I think, Alex, in terms of the -- what needs to be achieved to get to the hurdles on the various
contingent consideration, we cannot talk about future fundraising on this call. But if you look at the past
history, as the company and the timing around some of these things, we do have some growth built in,
but I wouldn't say particularly aggressive growth for the future given the potential that we think we have
together.

One of the very attractive things about Lexington Partners is, frankly, they're very successful on their
own. So the forward-looking growth of Lexington standalone is very attractive to us. And then when you
apply the additional growth potential through adding our resources with broader client base across high
net worth and other distribution globally, we think it could actually add more to the numbers that we've
highlighted today.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. And my follow-up just around the balance sheet dynamics and pro forma for the deal. The deck
as you guys have about $6 billion of cash and investments on a pro forma basis after the deal. Can you
give us a sense how much of the $6 billion is ultimately kind of unrestricted cash? If you wanted to do

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

something when they're paying out tomorrow, what would that look like? And then how much of future
funds do you expect Ben's balance sheet to participate in? So in other words, like the co-investment or
seed capital or whatnot, is it going to be 100% based on Franklin's balance sheet? And how much of sort
of resources do you think that's going to take on future fund raises?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Okay. Thanks, Alex. So a couple of things there. In terms of the sort of unrestricted cash that's
available to do other things at the time that we close this transaction and we're assuming that we can
close this transaction at the end of March, that number will probably be something like $1 billion. So that's
question 1.

Question 2 on the GP commitment, there is very strong demand for the GP commitment from partners
and employees, both at Lexington. And I know that Franklin Templeton senior executives and other folks
are looking forward to being part of that also. But you're right to highlight the fact that Franklin Templeton
also, from a balance sheet perspective, be committing capital to support the GP level. So yes, we have a
commitment to that. We obviously can't say what the amount is because it depends on future fundraising.

Operator

Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.

Michael J. Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congratulations on the deal announcement. Matt, just a question for you just around the carry economics.
So I was hoping maybe you could just elaborate on that? I don't think I heard that. I apologize if I missed
it. And then just on the equity that's granted to employees in Lexington, just curious the thought process
around why not grant equity and shares of the parent and Franklin Templeton?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So what was the first question again?

Michael J. Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Carry economics...

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So carry, we're going to share in something like 20% of carry going forward. The focus for us -- and
then we haven't acquired any past carry either from previous funds. The focus on us in this transaction
was the very attractive management fee stream at a much higher fee rate than our average rate and the
growth potential of that.

We think, and I think investors believe and certainly collection partners, the alignment of interest through
allocating the majority of carry to the producers in the company is very important. So that's what we
focused on in terms of structuring the transaction, as you say. What was the second question?

Michael J. Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

The second part was just around the equity ownership. Why not...

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

Good question. So firstly, it may not surprise you to hear us say that we believe that Banc shares are
quite undervalued. So we don't really like to dilute our shares. We don't need to. But the more important
answer to the question is that we think that the alignment of interest through providing equity in the
actual business that the folks are operating in, you can't get a whole lot better than that.

We've got plenty of incentives across the firm to make sure people collaborate and coordinate to create
more value. The more that happens and that we create more revenue and EBITDA, the more Lexington
will be worth in this case and the more Franklin will be worth. So we think that the 2 things align very well
in this regard. And frankly, it's probably better shareholder value for Franklin investors.

Michael J. Cyprys
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And a follow-up question, if I could, just more bigger picture. I think there was reference in the
deck about opportunities to extend the Lexington business into private credit and into real estate. I was
just hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the opportunity set there? How that might be accomplished?
What sort of hurdles there might be with putting through that sort of extension in growth? And just more
broadly on the retail opportunity set, if you could talk a little bit about that because clearly, Franklin has
strong retail distribution.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Tommy, why don't you or will take that question.

Unknown Attendee

Well, look, I think that we have tremendous growth opportunities in each of the verticals, and we'll
continue to look for opportunities to expand products organically as well as inorganically. With respect to
potential fundraising activity targeted at secondary real estate or private credit, I'd sort of push that back
to Will.

Wilson S. Warren
Lexington Partners L.P.

Yes. So as I said earlier, we see structural growth in our core products that exist today, but there are also
secondary markets developing in the areas you mentioned in private credit and certainly in real estate.
So as the alternatives universe grows, one of the interesting things about this transaction is the ability
to consider raising dedicated capital in those areas. So that will be something that we'll look at over the
medium term, I'd say.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So Franklin operates increasingly as a multi-brand and arguably the multi-boutique asset manager model,
and you highlighted your intent to continue to acquire more. I guess, other publicly traded multi-brand
asset manager models command at discount. So some questions on this. So how does Franklin not get
perpetually trapped into trading at a conglomerate or a multi-brand discount, particularly as you acquire
more brands?

And then to Glenn's question in your response about solutions being the point of differentiation and
knitting together the various products. Can you flesh out more how you're thinking about solution-
based products and services on the alt side? It looks like, for example, the bigger alternatives are buying
insurance companies to leverage their diverse product offerings and create a solutions-based offering set.
So more color, if you could, on the solutions road map.

Jennifer M. Johnson

11

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Yes. So first of all, we look at it and say that, frankly, large asset managers with the broad capability that
we have, we think, should be selling at a premium amount of discount because the some of the parts -- if
the some of the parts isn't greater than the discrete parts than we failed, so why is that? If you look at --
starting with just our large partners clients, they are consolidating the number of firms to do business with
and you have to have a broad breadth of capability to be able to make those lists.

Number two, if you think about just what's happening today with technology and technology disruption,
and I'll just start out with -- we talk about as an active manager. If you're not really good at leveraging
data science and data analytics, ultimately, you're going to have a hard time competing in active
management. And data is expensive. Our approach is at the center. We've created, for example, an
investment data lake and our individual teams have data scientists in there so they can leverage that
at their opt-in choice. But we can negotiate large vendor contracts and gain independent access to
unique raw sources of data. Those types of advantages, if executed well at the core, become a massive
opportunity.

And then there are things back to that kind of partner point, when you have a broad breadth of assets,
you can do things like we have the Franklin Templeton Academy, which we built for emerging markets
and find that partners in the developed markets want access to that kind of capability to do training of
their teams. Thought leadership with the institution or the institute -- the Franklin Templeton institute is
something that's sought after by our large partners. And then, of course, just a massive global distribution
footprint that no individual manager could ever support, that kind of capability. And so we think that, that
brings a strong premium.

On your point on solutions, yes, I mean you see what's happening in the insurance business. It's probably
that model will continue. You'll see more of those kind of deals. So there's a limited number. Yes, if you
have a good solutions team that can bring together and customize, that's an opportunity. And we look at
where we can continue to grow that, but we also see it as an opportunity with our existing partners. And I
know, Matt dying to add something here.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

I would just say, kind of the highest level, we don't really see ourselves as a multi-affiliate asset
management company from a model perspective. I wouldn't confuse the autonomy and independence
of our teams with being a multi-affiliate asset management company. The brand strategy is because a
number of our specialist investment managers are known very well for exactly what they do, and we
don't want to dilute that in any way and that seems to resonate in the marketplace, both institutional and
through other big distribution channels. That's number one.

And number two, while the coordination and collaboration across the firm and some of the things that
Jenny mentioned do not in any way dilute the independence autonomy of our specialized investment
management companies, it is really good, the collaboration across the firm. And we're definitely seeing
increased opportunities by that collaboration. And it's opt-in collaboration. We don't force it across the
firm. And you're seeing in an increasingly capacitive environment across the industry that it's really
energizing for the company and our specialist investment managers.

One thing we will have in common is we all want to grow, and we want to compete and we want to win
and we're finding that this is a good strategy for us to be. It doesn't mean that other models don't work
really well. Also, we have tremendous respect for our colleagues that have slightly different versions of our
model. In our opinion, we think of ourselves almost like as a hybrid of a model that you've referred to.

And in terms of the insurance piece, we study these things pretty carefully. We have a pretty meaningful
insurance angle ourselves, but it's an area that we're very interested in also. So it's one thing at a time,
obviously, as we continue to build new opportunities for the company.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I know there's a lot of moving parts as we think about expenses for here. But maybe, Matt, if you could
give us a framework to think about fiscal '22 in terms of either ex the transactions maybe on a core basis
or we can think about expense growth or if you want to talk about them together, that would be helpful.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure. So including Lexington, assuming that we closed March 31 or around that date, April 1, say,
I would just take the numbers we provided and the margin we provided and just divide it by 2 -- sorry,
the margin won't be divided by 2, the revenue and EBITDA will be divided by 2. Just assume that to add
it in. So putting that aside, on a standalone basis for the first quarter first -- obviously, we're very early
to give guidance for the year. But for the first quarter, excluding performance fees, we would expect our
revenue to be approximately flat for the quarter and expenses to be down in the low single digits, let's
say. Because as you know, we do have some run rate expenses rolling through from last year from the
merger-related synergies. So we've got that happening.

So I think I would say that all else remaining equal, if markets remain stable, we expect our adjusted
operating level to remain at current levels and adjusted operating expenses to be down low single digits
compared to the fourth quarter. This is all excluding performance fees. As you know, we have had elevated
performance fees for the last 2 quarters with $102 million in the third quarter and $69 million in the fourth
quarter, obviously, that does vary.

I would -- in terms of modeling on that one, I think there's been a little bit of confusion around how to
think of that. I would just think of half of that being and the other half being not comp -- the other half
coming to the parent. That's helpful.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That is. And just to clarify the -- when you say that's percentage down for expenses quarter-over-quarter
or...

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sorry, low single-digit percentages.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then just in terms of the core business and gross sales and momentum in the prepared
remarks, you talked about onboarding a wide range of product offerings with your largest global financial
partners. So could you maybe expand upon -- I think you talked about Edward Jones last quarter, but
maybe some other tangible examples of what products or channels are seeing that? And then also maybe
if there are -- you've had some one-off redemptions that you've called out before, if there was anything to
note for the fourth -- or I'm sorry, your fiscal first quarter that we should be aware of as well?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Adam, do you want to take that?

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive Vice President of Global Advisory Services

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

Sure. So let's talk about the onboarding and I'll go back to what we said about the merger over a year
ago and how complementary the 2 firms were. And if you think about the U.S. legacy, Franklin so much
stronger in the regional and independent channel make stronger in the wires outside of the U.S., Franklin
much stronger in retail banking in markets like Germany, Italy with Legg Mason having a better presence
in private banking. Each of those business segments really operate separate platforms. So Legg had its
product on one set of platforms, Franklin on the other. Often, it takes a little bit of effort and work and
sometimes formal agreements to be able to participate on those platforms.

Since we had the platforms, we were able, over this year, to execute a strategy where we brought on
Legacy Franklin product on the Legg Mason platforms and vice versa. That means that we have far more
funds in the U.S. than outside of the U.S. now available for sale. That process took several quarters to
execute, and we're now in a position where we think we can sell significantly more next year because we
are able to do that.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

And I guess, Adam, in terms of the lumpy lumpiness, if you will, numbers going into the fourth quarter.
We -- there are a couple of potential large increases because one of the things we haven't talked about
since the announcement publicly is the AsianInvestor Asset Management acquisition, which was a very
important acquisition in terms of customization capabilities and that's a tremendous team, and we're really
excited about what that could bring for us. That may close in our first quarter and that will add almost $7
billion under management.

And then we also announced publicly, obviously, the acquisition of a team, a new team within fixed income
in the LDI space that is expected to raise fairly quickly. Again, it could be first quarter, second quarter, but
that could be a few billion dollars that we will call out specifically at that time.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

And just to kind of put an exclamation mark on it, I mean, I think in the past, there are times where we
were very concentrated on a few products. Today, our top 10 funds represent only 19% of our AUM and 14
out of the top 20 funds by flows are not our largest funds. I mean we are really not only diversifying our
client base but also very much diversifying our product base.

And in the case of something like we're excited about direct indexing, but we're also excited about the
capabilities of that being a to deliver just our core active strategies as well down the road really enhancing
the SMA portion of that.

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive Vice President of Global Advisory Services

And Jenny, I would say that the diversification is equally true on the institutional side where we look at our
pipeline there where no strategy, I think, is our kind of asset classes more than 17% of our pipeline at this
point. So really diversified on the institutional side as well.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just a couple of follow-ups on the $150 million of EBITDA. So Matthew, you said to just divide it by 2 for
the 6 months, so I'm guessing that, that means there's no carry in that $150 million?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then does that also mean that the 25% interest will sort of move with the vesting
schedule? So 5 percentage points of interest going to that team per annum?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

No, that will be immediate. So that will run through -- we'll go through the -- we're obviously going to
work through the best way to account for the transaction in the process of doing that. But I would look at
it on a sort of an adjusted basis, you can expect to see 75% -- the impact will be 75% of those numbers
that we've highlighted running through our P&L, basically, and then I would just apply our average tax
rate to the EBITDA to get to a rough contribution level in terms of net income. We expect it to be probably
mid to a little bit better single digits accretion immediately on an annualized basis.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. And then when we think about the -- I know there's a [indiscernible] of performance have
performance metrics tied to them. But are there any other performance or retention components to the
25%? In other words, is that transferable? Are there any performance pieces connected? How else is that
linked in with Franklin over the long term?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And that's a really important question. It's something that obviously Will was very focused on as well
as us and the team, and we -- that 25% test over a 5-year period and there are nonsolicit, noncompete all
the things that you would expect around how you retain and incentivize senior employees that are equity
holders in the company. So we have all those things and it vests ratably over the 5 years. And at the end
of that 5-year period, there are basically options around who can acquire the equity. Franklin obviously is
one that could acquire, but there's a lot -- there's going to be a lot of demand for that equity internally at
Lexington, including through their own bonus pool. So that's something that Will maybe want to comment
on also in terms of the dialogue that we had, and then I'll go back to the contingent piece in a minute.
Will?

Wilson S. Warren
Lexington Partners L.P.

Yes. Thanks, Matt. I mean the opportunity to own a significant portion of our own business is something
that we understand. The business has grown considerably since it was formed in 1994, and the
opportunity through this partnership and structure with Franklin to broaden that ownership is really
exciting for our employees. So I think this is -- for us the chance to have a really powerful and exceptional
new partner and at the same time, really bet on ourselves and our ability to continue to perform for our
LPs.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Will. And then in terms of the performance-based cash awards, Brennan, that you talked --
that you asked about, they don't begin until the second year -- end of the second year and they run all
the way through to the fifth year and they're tied to a number of revenue and AUM-based metrics that we
anticipate over that period of time.

And then there is time-based payments on this also that we were very pleased to work on with the team.
So we have $1 billion at closing, and we referenced $750 million over 3 years and that $750 million is split
$250 million in the first year, $400 million at the end of the second year and $100 million at the end of
the third year. And then the $338 million is pretty much even. It's a little bit different numbers, but very

15

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

evenly split between the second year right through to the fifth year. So it's quite well balanced between 3
and 5 years.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

That's really helpful. Just one clarifying point, is that

[Technical Difficulty]

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Sorry, Brennan, you're cutting in and out. We can't hear you.

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we can't hear you.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Sorry, that's better now?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So the -- the 25% after 5 years. Does that have a chance to actually increase and employees participate
in more, therefore, diluting frankly? Is that what you had said? I just want to make sure I understood
that.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

No, I meant within the 25%. So within the 25%, it will either circulate within Lexington. It will never go
outside of Lexington, other than to Franklin. So it later within Lexington or Franklin will acquire more, but
we expect it to stay within Lexington for the extended period.

And I guess, just to complete the picture, even if -- in theory, even if Lexington partners decide to sell
some of their equity to Franklin, there is a minimum amount of equity that needs to be held by the
partners when they're actively employed with the company and it takes a number of years to sell down
the equity. And that's why we're confident at the circulation point.

Operator

Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

First, maybe just sticking with some of the payout or earn-outs, is the -- I want to make sure I understand
this, is the $750 million that you start paying, I guess, in years 1 through 3, is that subject to like an
earn-out or performance? Or is that just kind of delayed payments and not really, I'll call it, performance
based?

Matthew Nicholls

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

They're just time-based payments.

Wilson S. Warren
Lexington Partners L.P.

They're just time-based.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just stepping back a second and maybe philosophically, the Lexington, I mean,
certainly, there's huge value in having them own a piece of their business over time, Clarion, I believe,
employees, partners there still own a piece of their business. And I know something that legacy Legg
struggled with was how to get more -- maybe move away somewhat from a revenue share, more towards
having employees in Western and other affiliates own equity. I mean, does this kind of create any, I don't
know, internal pressure or whatnot? Whether it's Benefit Street or the other specialist sales to kind of
revamp or reshape their structure and how much -- how they have equity versus revenue share?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Well, so first of all, the nature of which individual investment team structure is often is related to some
historical acquisition and the beauty of the alternatives business is because there's the carry in there,
often itself is a great retention tool. And so that's built into all of our alternatives businesses.

And then when we did the acquisition, I mean, there were things that we were able to do in the acquisition
of Legg Mason to ensure that incentives are aligned with the parent company and that everybody
is rowing the boat in the same direction. And as we talked about earlier, we've created an opt-in
environment where we think there are some really good upsides to the teams by leveraging the core part
of the business. And what we've seen is a real desire.

We had recently a CIO forum where the heads of all of our different investment teams got together, and
I got to tell you, the engagement was outstanding. Everybody really appreciated it and the conversations
were very, very good. And so I think people recognized the benefit of being part of a greater organization.

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

And also, Rob, just to add to Jenny's point, if you think of our alternative asset specialist investment
managers, they all either have like Clarion's, for example, owns 18% parent. That's the same sort of
partnership structures we have with Lexington. And Benefit Street Partners, we have basically the accrual
to growth units. It's not equity, but it's very close to equity.

So in each -- and then in many other businesses, we have the same thing where you're basically, as Jenny
mentioned, we're aligning interest. It doesn't always have to be with equity, it can be a combination of
equity and cash in terms of how it relates to certain specific growth objectives for that particular business
-- growth targets for that business. So it's really a combination of things that works well for the specific
teams, what we work on with them and what works for the parent company to make sure we get the right
growth going.

Robert Andrew Lee
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Great. And maybe if I could squeeze in one quick follow-up. I mean the $34 billion of fee-paying AUM and
fundraising was very good, I guess, last cycle. But is there a certain amount of dry powder that's not yet
earning fees, I mean maybe some of those funds are drawdown structures? So is there kind of -- as we
look for is some kind of built-in fee growth already just from what they already have committed?

So Will, why don't we have you take that.

Wilson S. Warren
Lexington Partners L.P.

Happy to take it. The answer is no on existing products. These are commitment fee-paying products.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Most of have been asked and answered. Just a couple of clarifications on the deal first and then a longer-
term question. The AUM, the $200 billion pro forma includes the $55 billion from Lexington, but on the $1
billion of fees on that, should we be thinking of it on the fee-paying AUM contribution to more like $180
billion?

Then just to clarify on the $338 million, I think, Matt, you said that starts in the second year. So that
would not impact fiscal year '22 whatsoever and the adjusted tax rate going forward that you're using?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So a couple of things there. Firstly, the -- could you just repeat your first question? I didn't fully follow
what you said.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes. the $200 billion AUM is 145...

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. So firstly, that actually doesn't include $55 billion. $55 billion is the amount that's being raised in
terms of capital, since inception at Lexington, it only includes the $34 billion with an assumption of some
modest growth. But we've been growing 20% organically across other alternative asset So it includes
some growth in those also. So it doesn't add just the $55 billion. It adds to $34 billion and then the
assumption of growth. So that's how you get to the $200 billion. We feel good about that. What was the
second question?

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And that $200 billion at the end of March, basically -- just a couple on the second part of the question is
the $338 million, I think that starts after fiscal year '22 and the go-forward tax rate that you're using?

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

So the first contingent payment it starts in 2024, actually. So that's that. And then the other question you
asked, sorry, question. The billion -- you asked -- well, I'll get to tax in a second. You asked about the $1
billion of management fees, and yes, that's tied to the $200 billion, frankly, is quite conservative probably.
And that's only management fee revenue. It's not anything to carry or performance fees or anything
like that. We think that's fairly conservative because already at Franklin standalone, we're probably at
something like $700 million of management fees for 2021, for example and then plus the performance got
us already quite close to $1 billion at that 40% margin that I mentioned to you.

In terms of the tax rate, I would continue to use the 23% to 24% effective tax rate guidance on all of this.
We realized that this quarter was unusual in terms of the reserve that we're able to release. So we do not

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

18

FRANKLIN RESOURCES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 01, 2021

expect any additional large reserves like that to happen, although I should point out on taxes that we've
probably been able to benefit from about $150 million of the approximately $600 million of tax benefits
obtained through the acquisition of Legg Mason, and we should be get a benefit from about another $200
billion in favorable tax attributes over the next 2 years and then the rest will be over probably 7 years at
that point, 6 or 7 years, something like that.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And that's the cash tax rate as opposed to the 23% to 24%...

Matthew Nicholls
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. That's right. Exactly.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That's great. And then maybe just one on ESG, Jenny. You mentioned, obviously, now you're up to
about $200 billion. Maybe just classifying that between what you would consider like pure sustainable
investments versus exclusionary products? I think before you said you sort of modeled it after Articles 8
and 9 in terms of classification. So I just wanted to verify if that $200 billion is linked to Article 8 or 9 of
Europe? And maybe just what your view is of maybe potentially reclassifying changing prospectus, if you
will, to in terms of the strategy of even raising that $200 billion?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

Well, so yes, it's Articles 8, 9. So that's the first part. And if you look at the flows in Europe, I mean, we
saw something that says there's $2.2 trillion in AUM in 2020, and that's going to get up to $53 trillion
by 2025. I mean there's some Article 6 selling, but I got to tell you, the demand is Article 8, 9. So that's
where the growth is.

We've got very good products there. I think we were very disciplined. Nobody is claiming greenwashing.
On our part, we were very disciplined and have a rigorous compliance group reviewing any products
before we declare them that way. We have more in the queue that are being reviewed internally, and we
think that what's happening in Europe, it's going to happen in Asia and the U.S. as well. Adam, you want
to add to that?

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive Vice President of Global Advisory Services

I was just going to add that if you look at our pipeline, it's pretty incredible. About 20% of our flows are
coming from 8 and 9 products in Europe, and it's about 40% of our pipeline. So while we've got a decent
business there, it's just growing and growing more quickly than anything else we do.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That is super helpful. Just if you're able to break it apart between sustainable and exclusionary, I don't
know if that's possible?

Jennifer M. Johnson
President, CEO & Director

I don't have it at my fingertips. Adam, I don't know if you do.

Adam Benjamin Spector
Executive Vice President of Global Advisory Services

I can tell you that. Why don't we get back to you with those exact numbers.
