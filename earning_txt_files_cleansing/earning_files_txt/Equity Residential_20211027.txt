EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir.

Martin J. McKenna
First Vice President of Investor & Public Relations

Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Third Quarter 2021 results. Our
featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating
Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer,
are here with us as well for the Q&A.

Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted
in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that one of our peers is hosting their
call at 1 p.m. Central, and so we want to be conscious of everyone's time, and we'll look to finish the call
in 1 hour.

Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-
looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements
are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or
supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.

Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell.

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Thanks, Marty, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I'll give some brief remarks on a terrific pace
of our operating recovery and our robust investment activity, then Michael Manelis will follow with some
top-level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see next year playing out, and
then we'll take your questions.

We have talked about 2021 being a year of recovery for our company, and we are very pleased to report
that our operating metrics continue to recover at a faster rate than we assumed back in July with quarter-
over-quarter same-store revenues turning positive for the first time since the pandemic began.

Strong demand across our markets drove us to achieve physical occupancy of 96.6% in the third quarter,
which allowed us to continue to push rental rates. We also benefited from governmental rental relief
payments made on behalf of our tenants.

As a result of these strong continued operating metrics, we have raised our annual same-store revenue,
net operating income and normalized FFO guidance again this quarter. We now expect our same-store
revenues to decline 3.7%, our expenses to increase 3.25% and NOI to decline 7% for the full year of
2021. We expect to produce normalized FFO per share of between $2.95 and $2.97, a 2% increase at the
midpoint.

All of this leaves us very well positioned going into 2022. While we won't provide guidance for next
year until our next earnings release in February, in our management presentation, you can find the
building blocks that point to our business being set up for an extended period of higher-than-trend growth
beginning in 2022, as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong
demand and growing incomes resulting from a very strong job market.

We expect same-store revenue growth in 2022 to exceed the historical mid-single-digit range that has
characterized past recoveries, leading to some of the best same-store revenue numbers we have ever

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

seen. These expectations assume that the economic backdrop remains constructive and the pandemic
remains controlled.

Please also note that while we expect to do very well next year, we will not be able to make up our
entire mark-to-market on our rent roll and regain our entire loss to lease in a single year for a variety of
marketing and regulatory reasons that Michael will describe in a moment.

Beyond 2022, we see a continuing bright future for our business as the large emerging Gen Z cohort
starts their careers and joins the renter population. Also, the more diverse portfolio we are creating should
improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward.

Switching to the transaction side of the business. The positive story on fundamentals has not gone
unnoticed by the investment community as the overall theme continues to be enormous amounts of
capital pursuing all types of apartment investment, driving cap rates to new lows. This has caused the
convergence in nominal cap rates in the 3.5% or so range for many markets and has created a positive
climate for our strategic repositioning efforts.

We continue to aggressively sell our older and less desirable properties at these low cap rates and at
prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates, acquiring much newer assets in our expansion
markets of Dallas Fort Worth, Austin, Atlanta and Denver and the select suburbs of our established
markets at approximately equal cap rates.

All of the assets we are acquiring share the common characteristic of being recently built, having no or
minimal retail and being attractive to our target affluent renter demographic. We like that these trades
are not dilutive to current earnings while adding properties to the portfolio that we believe will have
better long-term cash flow growth, lower capital needs and diversification benefits. Year-to-date, we have
purchased more than $1 billion of properties and expect to close another $400 million or so in acquisitions,
mostly in our expansion markets, a good number of which are in various states of advanced negotiation
already, all by year-end.

We have funded these buys with an approximately equal amount of dispositions of older and less desirable
assets, which we sold at an average premium of 10% to our pre-pandemic estimates of value. Included in
these sales are approximately $900 million of California assets. Currently, approximately 42% of our total
assets are in California. As we seek to have more balance in our portfolio, you should expect our California
exposure to decline over time, but to remain meaningful.

Turning to development. We had a lot of great news in the quarter. It all starts with the apartment
development joint venture with Toll Brothers, the public homebuilder that we announced in August. We
have known and respected the team at Toll for many years and have successfully partnered with them
before. They built terrific properties and have a large team spread across our expansion markets and
select of our other markets that we expect to leverage in this joint venture to create quality properties for
equity residential to own long term. The venture is off to a quick start as we closed already in this fourth
quarter on 1 Toll land opportunity and are working with them on many others.

We also have a strong internal development team in our company that continues to create opportunities.
In this quarter, that team completed the development of our Edge property in Bethesda, Maryland. This
high-end asset is adjacent to an existing EQR asset and located very near a metro station as well as the
large amount of new office space that has recently been built in downtown Bethesda. They also sourced
and structured the 3 new joint venture development deals in Washington, D.C., Denver and suburban New
York that began construction this quarter. Each of these joint venture development deals is with a different
partner and is not related to the Toll venture.

Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties
across the country. You're doing an exceptional job during what was a particularly busy leasing season,
and we are all very proud and grateful.

Go ahead, Michael.

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Executive VP & COO

Thanks, Mark. The entire peak leasing season delivered consistent high levels of demand that allowed
us to continue to grow occupancy as well as rates at a pace that exceeded our expectations. In both
the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key
performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that
position this portfolio well for 2022. Occupancy is 96.9% today, which is 60 basis points higher than 2019
and 260 basis points higher than the same week in 2020. At this point, we expect to maintain strong
occupancy through the balance of the year.

Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions, grew throughout the entire peak leasing season
and is now 28% higher than it was on January 1. The pandemic caused our net effective pricing to decline
by $520 from March to December of 2020. And from January 2021 to today, that same pricing trend has
grown $637, which demonstrates a V-shaped recovery and shows that we have more than fully recovered
what we had lost in price.

Concession use, which has been a main topic of discussion for the last 18 months, is now being used on a
very limited basis and in line with pre-pandemic levels, with less than 1% of our applications in September
and October receiving an average concession amount of less than 2 weeks.

New lease change was up 10.1% in the third quarter and is on track to be just over 11% in October. We
have seen signs of seasonal softening, both in terms of pricing power and application volume but these
trends are normal to slightly better than typical seasonality patterns. And more importantly, the volume of
traffic in applications currently is more than sufficient given the low levels of available inventory we have
in the portfolio.

Renewals were a major focus for the quarter given the rapid improvement in market pricing from a year
ago as well as the fact that we have slightly more expirations in the back half of 2021 than normal. We
have been centralizing negotiations for the San Francisco, New York and Boston markets and our offsite
call center group as pricing in these markets were the most impacted by the pandemic and conversations
in these markets have become more and more difficult as we are dealing with residents who receive large
concessions and much lower rates this time last year.

The good news is that the results have been great across all of our markets. We renewed 62% of residents
in September, and October is on track to be just below 65%, which is much better than the 55% historical
norm that we thought we were going to stabilize at.

At the same time, renewal rate achieved has continued to improve with September at 7.7% and October
on track to be 9%. We expect continued growth despite what will likely be challenging negotiations.
Perhaps our biggest positive from these negotiations is that so far, we are not seeing any material
difference in renewal behaviors from the deal seekers who received very discounted rents last year
versus our more tenured residents. Overall, they are renewing at similar paces. This is something we will
continue watching very closely.

Before providing color on a couple of markets, let me touch on our positioning for 2022. As we think about
same-store revenue growth, we have some key drivers that should work in our favor. First, our existing
leases are at a material loss to lease. What I mean by that is if we snapshot all of our leases in place
today and compare them to current market prices, 86% of our residents are paying on average rents that
are significantly below current market prices.

The result of this is a net effective loss to lease of 13.6%. This provides us with a significant opportunity
to increase our revenue as we move these leases to market rates. That, of course, does not mean that
we will capture the full 13% in 2022, largely because leases expire throughout the year, not on January
1, and we currently are subject to renewal restrictions in some jurisdictions, which means the change is
very dependent upon who actually moves out. Regardless, this is definitely the highest loss to lease we
have ever seen with such a large majority of leases below market, and the teams are hyper-focused to
recapture as much of the loss to lease as possible.

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Second, we expect that the significant demand and favorable fundamentals in our business will drive
additional revenue growth opportunities in all of our markets in 2022. Remember, we have seen
unprecedented demand even with only modest return-to-office activity. So the backdrop for intra-period
rent growth expectations in 2022 is strong.

Third, we expect to get a nice lift from occupancy in the first half of the year as we were at 95% in the
first quarter and 96.2% in the second quarter of this year. We are currently running above 96.5% and
would expect to maintain this level or better in 2022.

And finally, we have regulatory restrictions that are beginning to expire. This presents an opportunity to
recapture revenue through the reduction of bad debt and increased collection of late fees in 2022. All of
these factors combined put us in a position to deliver very strong revenue growth next year, assuming
regulatory conditions continue to improve and the general economic conditions remain supportive.

Moving to a couple of quick market comments. Starting on the East Coast, the New York market not only
has fully rebounded, but it continues to have strong demand for our product despite the broader delays in
return to office. At this point, New York is positioned to outperform seasonal trends in the fourth quarter.
Boston and D.C. are performing as expected, with great demand and strong occupancy with normal
seasonality.

On the West Coast, Southern California has been and continues to be very strong. San Francisco and
Seattle appear to be the 2 markets most impacted by the delay in return to office in terms of overall
demand levels, but so far appear to be following normal seasonality trends. San Francisco, while
demonstrating a good recovery remains the only market that has not yet fully recovered from a pricing
standpoint. Occupancy has been improving in San Francisco over the past month or so. And today, we are
96.5% and should be well positioned to capture demand and pricing power once the tech companies begin
to provide more clarity around return-to-office plans.

Seattle has been a little more volatile than expected. Current occupancy is 95.6%. And while the overall
demand level is holding up, the announcement from Amazon a few weeks ago regarding office return
decisions has impacted our leasing velocity. Our on-site teams in Seattle mentioned that prospects
definitely have a lack of urgency to lease, but are very interested in options for later this year or early
next year.

Moving on to expenses. Mark mentioned our same-store expense guidance at 3.25% for the full year. We
are seeing increased costs across all utility categories. However, about 65% of these costs are ultimately
passed back to residents through the utility reimbursements that run through the revenue line.

We are also seeing pressure on wages in this very tight labor market, but have been successful in
mitigating growth in our on-site payroll numbers by realizing staffing efficiencies. These efficiencies have
been achieved through the numerous innovation initiatives that we have rolled out over the past year or
so. This includes moving to self-guided tours, online leasing and utilizing our artificial intelligent leasing
agent named Ella.

On the service side, we also leverage our service mobility platform and new technology to deliver the
experience and service that our customers require, which is evident by the all-time high online reputation
Google rating of 4.2, all while also reducing the expense pressures. We expect these efficiencies and
opportunities to accelerate into 2022 as we continue to harness technology to deliver the customer
experience that our residents require.

Finally, I will end on an update on the rent relief recoveries. Fortunately, our affluent resident was less
impacted by the pandemic as they kept their jobs and continue to pay rent. For those that were impacted,
we have continued to work with them, including assisting them in applying for rent relief. We have
received $18.3 million September year-to-date in this rent relief with the majority of that coming to us in
the third quarter. This exceeds our prior expectations of $15 million recovered in the full year.

Even with some of the eviction moratoriums expiring, our goal will be to continue working with residents
to gain access to the additional rent relief funds. We continue to have good traction in this process and
now expect the full year rental relief recoveries of between $25 million and $30 million in 2021.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I'm hoping you can dive into a little more of your 2022 expectations. I know you said the same-store
revenue should be among the best in history. How much of that is locked in today in terms of the earn-in?
And then you talked a little about trying to capture some of that loss to lease. It won't all come in through
2022, but how are you thinking about getting to that comment about being among the best in the history?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Nick, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. We're not giving '22 guidance, but as you said, we did try to lay
out how we're thinking about things, what the building blocks are, what the team is trying to figure out as
we look towards '22. When we made the comment both in the release and in my prepared remarks that
it's setting up to be the best year in the company's history, I want to -- for same-store revenue growth, I
do want to give a little context.

So a normal, and I'll say, a normal meaning the last couple of recessions for us, have consisted of 2
years or so of negative same-store revenue growth, and we've certainly had that this time. A year or
so where same-store revenue growth was right around 0, slightly positive, slightly negative, kind of a
transition year. And then a couple of years where we compounded 5%, mid-5% same-store revenue
growth numbers for high 4s, those kinds of things.

Given the earn-in, given this loss to lease that we see, we think we're going to skip that transition year,
and that's a comment I made on the last call as well. We're going to skip right over that 0 and head
right into a year that's likely to be a fair bit higher than the 5.5% or so number you would think of as a
normal second year recovery. The recovery is V-shaped, just like the decline was V-shaped. And so I think
what you see here is the confidence the team has given the demand and the occupancy numbers, that's
subject to some regulatory flak here and there, we're going to regain a great deal of that loss to lease, but
certainly not all of it. And I think a bit of it is going to end up in 2023.

And there's just customer relations issues. There's regulatory issues with some of these increases in the
size of them. And Michael has done a great job with the team of retaining our residents, giving them great
service. So hopefully, that helps. In terms of locked in, I can't give you a locked-in number. The team is
going to need to work the whole year to do that. But it feels like that 5.5% is a bit of a floor in terms of
next year's same-store revenue number.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful. And then you mentioned the compounding in some of those past cycles, and maybe
we can tie to development. It seems like you're getting at least more active on development. You
mentioned the Toll JV and some of the other opportunities. I mean how are you thinking about the
beginning of this cycle and getting more into development as you try to model out some of those out
years where you'll actually be delivering?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. Great question. It's Mark again. In terms of the compounding, the compounding is going to start
with the operations, with the NOI from the same-store portfolio. If you look at '22 when we've given you
some color. And certainly, it's hard to look much further in our business. But we do look at '23 and see less

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

supply. There were a lot of deals that were delayed the starts due to the pandemic. And while supply is
likely to pick up in '24, our look at proximity of supply and other things makes us feel like we got at least
a couple of years here, pretty good numbers coming at us on the same-store NOI. And that will always be
the big engine at EQR.

Development to us is just a great complement to our efforts to acquire assets, especially in these newer
markets, these suburban markets. So -- and we feel like right now, our shareholders are getting paid
to take that risk with our ability to underwrite development yields at around 5% on current rents and
all of these acquisitions we're looking at being in the mid-3s. We're trying to be very thoughtful. This
is an inflationary climate, and construction costs are far from immune to that. But I think you're going
to see growth both from the same-store portfolio and from actual net growth of the company through
development that we're likely to fund with a combination of incremental debt; net cash flow, which we'll
have more of starting next year; and occasional asset sale and a little bit of equity like we did this quarter.

Operator

We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Thanks for all the details on the revenue components. I actually have a few questions on the cost
structure of the business. Bob, could you give us -- could you -- the expense pressures hitting some other
property types in the REIT world. Could you give us a sense on how bracket a reasonable worst-case and
best-case scenario for same-store expense growth over the next 12 months?

Robert A. Garechana
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean I'm not going to probably give specifics in terms of a range because we're not providing
guidance yet, but maybe a little bit to think about the components that are running through and where
they're positioned as we go into 2022 if that helps, John.

So if you think about the big 4 categories, real estate taxes, we've had a good amount of success. That's
40% of expenses. We've had a good amount of success so far on appeals. I think we're not seeing a ton
of pressure from the municipalities, and I think that could carry over into another pretty good year into
2022, right? So pretty good year means in my mind kind of sub that 3-ish or 3.5% kind of regular run
rate, inclusive of 421as and other things.

On the payroll side, we've done an excellent, excellent job, I think, of managing what has been an
inflationary kind of pressure over time. We're going on our third year of payroll that is sub 1% in terms
of growth. So what Michael is doing sometimes quietly on the side in terms of managing innovation
and doing new implementation is really offsetting what I think is something that every company is
experiencing, which is payroll pressure, and we've been really good at it thus far, and I don't think there's
anything that's likely to change in a significant way. It means that we feel the pressure. We're just doing
things in a different way and innovating in a way to really offset that pressure.

The last 2 categories, which are R&M and utilities, I think, are the ones that we're most focused on outside
of like the payroll side. Utilities are -- a big chunk of them can be passed back to the residents, but we're
certainly all seeing commodity pressures. You saw what nat gas has done kind of recently, and that's the
one that I think is where you see higher single digits. But put it all into the blender, and I don't think that
2022 is that outsized relative to what we've seen historically in this business over time.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That certainly helps. Maybe Michael, 1 quick one. Just in terms of the posture on renewals. Could
you share the renewal rate increases you're sending out today?

Michael L. Manelis

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Executive VP & COO

Yes, sure. Let me -- so this is Michael, and I'll tell you that for November, our net effective quotes were
coming in -- going out at 12.8%. And the December quotes are 13.2% on a net effective basis. And you
could see that number is going to continue to grow, and it's going to widen because concession use was
really ramping up this time last year. So you're coming up against more and more of those residents that
had concessions. About 25% of all the offers that went out for November and December went to residents
that had concessions. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, so far, the deal-seeking residents
that we took in last year, they've been renewing at the same pace as compared to those that didn't have
concessions. So we're really excited about kind of working our way through the renewal performance for
the balance of the year.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower of Evercore.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a quick follow-up on development. So you started 3 new projects. Last quarter, you delivered 1 of
them. Obviously, the Toll joint venture is earmark for several of your expansion markets. So how easy is it
to crank up the development machine internally? And what volume of starts do you think that we can sort
of expect over the next few years in that regard? And then if you had to peg a mix between on balance
sheet or I should say, in-house versus the Toll joint venture, how would you see that breaking out?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start -- pardon me, and then I'm going to give it over to Alec. So in terms of
how big it can get, it will take a little while to ramp up. Our expectation is this could get to $1 billion to
$1.2 billion a year of starts in a year or so and maybe $700 million of that is Toll and the rest of it is other
JVs and the stuff that we create internally. I think that, that will be funded in a way that will make that a
pretty accretive thing. But most importantly for us, it's creating and giving us product, again, in markets
and submarkets, we just don't have enough exposure.

So I think Alec can speak a little bit to things the internal team is doing because they're very active.
They're doing a lot of good stuff. We got some great densification deals we haven't talked a lot about. So
I'm going to let him speak to that. And hopefully, that gives you the color you need.

Alexander Brackenridge
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Thanks, Mark. Rich, this is Alec. Yes, so we look at a lot of deals. We are a selective developer. And
whether it's through the Toll JV, which has been off to a great start. They have a great pipeline, and
we're actively engaged with them on each project and assessing whether it fits for us. And then as Mark
mentioned, we have these densifications throughout our portfolio, largely in California, but in other
markets as well. And we have a great internal expertise on how to assess and execute on. So we're
excited about that. And then as we've mentioned in the release, we're continually looking at other joint
venture opportunities outside of Toll. So we have a broad range of projects that we look at and are very
selective on the ones we pick.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Great. I appreciate the color, guys. And 1 quick follow-up. Just in terms of the recent acquisitions
in the expansion markets, can you give us a sense of where you're acquiring those properties versus
replacement cost in addition to the yield which you have provided.

Yes. So it's a range, depending a lot on the project. And this concept of replacement cost is an important
metric. It's something we look at but it's not an absolute thing. It's actually a little bit more challenging to
calculate than you might think because you don't always find an apples-to-apples and may be a location
that's really almost impossible to find similar product to build -- some of the location to build the same
kind of product.

Parking is another variable. Surface parked, you may have an existing project that has surface parked, but
the municipality won't allow you to do that or the project -- the site is too dense. So then maybe you go
to a structured parking, which is more expensive, or you go underground, which is yet more expensive,
on top of which there are code changes that can generally make things more expensive and inclusionary
housing requirements. So we look at it as a metric we look at, but we assess all of those things on a
project-by-project basis and determine whether or not we think it fits based on that and the other -- the
typical yield parameters that we assess.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. So it's hard to sort of peg a percentage discount or premium given everything you just mentioned?

Alexander Brackenridge
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

There's no absolute number.

We'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.

Chandni Luthra
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So I just want to follow up on those -- 1 of those questions that were just asked around your new
development projects that you started this quarter through your internal platform. Could you perhaps talk
about what are the markets where you will focus your internal development versus the focus coming in
from the Toll Brothers JV?

Alexander Brackenridge
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. So we have -- Chandni, this is Alec. We have specific markets that we've designated through the Toll
project -- through the Toll program that we're going to focus on. And for example, Atlanta is a market that
we're very focused on with them. Dallas is another one. There are other markets where they don't have a
presence or they're not part of the venture. And -- so those are areas where we'd be more likely to invest
on our own or with another joint venture partner.

Chandni Luthra
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And talking about supply a little bit into next year and perhaps 2023, what are the markets that
you're feeling a little better about versus where do you see there could be more crowding, especially as
you are sort of foraying into all these newer markets? If perhaps you could give some color on that, that
would be great.

Michael L. Manelis
Executive VP & COO

Chandni, this is Michael. Let me just start. I'll give a little bit of kind of the takeaway from 2021, a little bit
about what we're seeing from an operations impact in '22, and then I'll let anybody else kind of pick up on
some of the newer markets that we just entered.

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

So I think I would start by saying that the tagline for 2021 on supply would be that strong demand greatly
aided the absorption of new supply in our markets. D.C. produced record levels of Class A absorption
and the South Bay, which we talked about on previous calls in San Francisco, that submarket at 4,000
new units being delivered, it continues on its path of recovery with strong occupancy and very limited
concessions like in the stabilized portfolio.

And I think we've talked about this before that we are really focused when we think about supply, on the
concentration of the supply and the proximity of that new supply relative to our stable assets on top of
when are the first units going to actually begin leasing. So for 2021, the overall supply numbers were
elevated in our markets. But we said earlier on the calls that the overall level of competitiveness against
our portfolio was expected to be less.

When we look forward, the data for the expected starts in 2022, so relative to this proximity of within 1
and 2 miles of our locations is less, which is a great indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure
in the next year or so from the new supply being delivered right on top of us.

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Just to add a little...

Michael L. Manelis
Executive VP & COO

Yes. No, that's fine.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.

Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Securities, Research Division

My first question, Mark, I guess, what held you back from providing '22 guidance at this point?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

I guess, 17 years of experience doing this job and the CFO job. I mean a lot -- this is a pretty variable
world. A lot's going on. Certainly, the actions of the Fed on the taper are super relevant to how the
economy recovers. So I would say there's just enough variability here.

We told you sort of what we know, Jeff, which is this sort of earn-in, this loss to lease. We gave you, I
think, some pretty specific parameters on where things like bad debt might be able to go. And then the big
mysteries really are regulatory pressures, how the intra-period growth feels next year. And then where we
end this year? I mean we're going to spend the next 2 months continuing, hopefully, to close some of that
loss to lease by writing terrific new leases with happy customers and locking in revenues for next year. So
there's just enough variables. So any guidance I'd give you would be too wide to be meaningful on same-
store revenue. And I think the conversation in February will be much higher quality.

Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Securities, Research Division

That's fair. And then second, I know you touched on supply. I don't think I heard the answer on '23, and
we're hearing potentially on the coast, a significant decrease in supply in '23. Any -- and I'm sorry, again,
if I missed this, any early thoughts on '23 supply in your markets?

President, CEO & Trustee

13

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

All right. It's Mark. Thanks for that, Jeff. So what we see is a pretty significant decline in '23. A lot --
and this is again in deliveries, just to be clear. And that's really as a result of delays in starts or delays
in completions of product that was underway during the pandemic. And so we're going to get a break
-- more of a break in New York, for example, but even that is a little bit by area. There'll be a fair bit
delivered in Brooklyn. There'll be a fair bit delivered in the Jersey Coast, but in Manhattan, almost nothing.
D.C. will kind of continue doing what D.C. does and deliver a lot, but we're going to feel a lot better about
places like San Francisco and Los Angeles and Seattle. So we feel like we're walking into a pretty good
setup.

When you start thinking about what might deliver in '24, and those are things that are starting now, there
is a lot of development activity. The space is in great demand. The investment community has not seen
the strong recovery and the stability of the sector. And so we think there'll be a good amount of demand --
or excuse me, a good amount of supply, but probably more spread out.

The market that's most on the watch list of our new markets for supply is certainly Austin. Austin has a
lot. We're being very thoughtful about adding exposure there. You may see us slow that down and add it
a little bit later. There's just going to be 30,000 units for some number of years there. Atlanta feels pretty
good to us on supply. Dallas has supply, but it's spread out and it's a big demand market. So I guess
that's the color we'd give you. Denver has a lot of supply too, more downtown than otherwise. But again,
we have a portfolio we're building that in Denver will be a pretty diversified portfolio when we're done.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to come back to talk about the disclosure that you provided on rental assistance, which was
really helpful. If I'm looking at the numbers correctly, does it imply that another $10 million to $12 million
of rental recovery is going to come in 4Q?

Robert A. Garechana
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Rich, it's Bob. That's probably a little bit on the high end of the range. But yes, I think that's -- you're
in the ballpark. So we think, as Michael said, for the full year, we'll be at $25 million to $30 million, and
we're already at $18 million so far through 9/30.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Helpful. And so as you think about 2022, do you think that's going to be a clean year? Or will it also
have some rental assistance in it meaning is the same-store revenue number going to be -- will it benefit
maybe even to the upside from additional rental assistance?

Robert A. Garechana
Executive VP & CFO

So I think that it probably will benefit from some of the rental assistance and '22 will likely be kind of a
transition year. But it also is going to experience this elevated write-off too, right, because you still have
-- that is unlike like '19, similar to what we've seen in '21 and '20, right? So you're going to -- there's 2
things that will drive bad debt. One is the rental assistance payments; and two, is just the ability to start
collecting on the units that haven't been collected. And that's a small number for us. And it's been a small
number given the high-quality renter base that we have. But those are the 2 driving factors that I think
are going to make 2022 as kind of bad debt number, a tweener between what you would have seen in '19
and what we saw in maybe 2021.

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Got it. And would you be willing to maybe frame how much of a headwind that might be?

Robert A. Garechana
Executive VP & CFO

I think that we'll have a better idea as we get to kind of providing guidance in general. But just to be
clear, I don't think it's a headwind. I think it's a benefit to revenue. I think we'll have -- I think we kind of
alluded to that. I think we should be in a better position in '22 than we were in '21. There's opportunity
there.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. I understand. That makes perfect sense. I figured I'd ask -- I thought it would be a long shot, but I
figured I'd ask. I appreciate it.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

So when you think about the surprising pace of demand improvements, obviously, the economy turning
on after shutting down so rapidly is a big part of it. But related is the opening up of offices, of course, and
universities and people rushing to get back to be close, so they can be present when the time comes that
they have to be in the office.

So assuming you agree with that, won't it be true that as things settle and you kind of have this -- all this
stuff be a wash in terms of year-over-year comps, that the cadence of 2022 would be super strong year-
over-year growth in the first half but a return to earth in the second half. I'm not looking for a guidance
question here just sort of speaking out of logic.

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

So Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start and maybe others will contribute. So the rushing back to the office
thing, I'd point out, a lot of people are coming back because the city is reopened. They're not sure when
their employers are coming back to full time. But they want to be back because they love the lifestyle
in West L.A. and they love living in Downtown Seattle, and they want to go back to their favorite coffee
shops. And you and I have had this discussion before. I think it's a little bit about return to office, but it's
also about just energized cities attracting our kind of residents.

In terms of the shape of the curve, I don't think you're wrong about that. I think the numbers early have
to be extraordinary because the comp period is so poor in '21 that that's exactly what will probably occur.
But what else will be going in the other direction is the normalized FFO by quarter number because as
Michael's team writes better and better leases, as Bob does his accounting work and roll those numbers
up, you're likely to see the earnings power of the firm in the middle part of the year revert back to what it
was in 2019.

So again, the quarter-over-quarter numbers are going to be exceptional early and they're going to be
merely very strong late in the year. But I think what you're going to see besides those operating statistics,
Rich, is that quarterly normalized FFO number get better, I think, every quarter of next year.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Yes, we should be focused on FFO anyway, I think, but that's just me. And then second question on
-- is hybrid office like a perfect setup for multifamily? And the reason I say that is people will be more
inclined to choose a nicer place to live with amenities and other conveniences just because they're going
to be spending perhaps more time there in the hybrid model. Do you agree that hybrid office would be a

particularly good thing in the sense you might get more fee income. And with that in mind, why avoid then
retail at the ground floor and your new acquisitions? I guess I understand why, but I'd figure I just throw
that question at you, too, on this topic.

Alexander Brackenridge
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Rich, this is Alec. And I think San Francisco is an example where people aren't back in the office, but they
still want to be in the cities. To your first part of your question, yes, I think the hybrid model does work
well because it enables you to do both, enjoy the city and also be close enough to work to get in when
you have to go in. So we're seeing the impact of that. And we are working on making our amenities more
suited to that. So we've increased a lot of our co-working space within our amenities. And we haven't said
no to retail. We like ground floor retail. We like activated streets. We just would like to have a relatively
small amount of it compared to the apartment business that we love.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So I have 2 questions here. First, I don't think anyone asked about the ATM. You guys are not historically
an equity issuer, no offense. But $140 million is almost a pocket change for you guys. So curious on your
decision to issue equity, especially as it doesn't settle for another 1.5 years, given that you guys are good
asset sellers, you're getting cap rates that are commensurate with where you're buying. So just trying to
understand how this ATM fits in and should we expect more of it.

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. Alex, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. So we thought it was prudent to dust off the old ATM as you
put it and put it to some use here. And it's really about this increase in development spending. So our
typical development spending needs the last 3, 4 years have been $300 million to $500 million. And here,
I'm talking about spending, not start. So of course, they correspond. And we were funding that out of free
cash flow and a little incremental debt that didn't change our ratios because you had the new development
assets on your books creating income after they were stabilized.

Going forward with the idea that we're likely to start $1 billion to $1.2 billion a year after a ramp-up
period, you need to be very thoughtful about how you match fund that. And when you look at 2023, we
have a pretty significant amount of debt maturities in that year as well. And that's probably the first year
we're going to reach this run rate of starts. And so it seemed prudent to us after consulting with the Board
to take a little equity into the mix. I think you're right that it will predominantly be funded with free cash
flow, and we expect to have that again next year and hopefully in some good abundance, incremental
debt, occasional asset sales as long as we can stay within our taxable income kind of caps. And then we
will -- I think we will be issuing a smattering of equity here and there given the size of the development
expectations for the company in the next few years.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. But still that's -- Mark, it's a pretty big shift. So is that the recent addition of new Board members?
Or -- I'm just curious because, historically, you guys really haven't been equity issuers. So it does sort of
represent a shift in your financing strategy.

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

I guess I don't view it as a shift. It's the same group of people, maybe in different chairs, but it's the same
conversations. I mean, we don't want to dilute our current investors. That's an important priority. But we

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

do think that when you're creating new assets, having a little equity foundationally makes sense. We know
what the cash needs are to fund the development pipeline.

So the conversation with the Board was very easy on this point. They felt that if you were $300 million,
$400 million, $500 million a year spender of development, that was 1 thing. If you're going to double it,
that was a whole another thing. And so that was the real thing that changed, Alex. It's just this magnitude
of what the management team is suggesting development can be.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then the second question, and you probably could guess it. Local New York press is
talking about how Governor Hochul is trying to fend off challenges for her reelection from the left. And
good cause rent eviction seems to be back, and it seems to almost be a [ gimmick ] for Albany. Your
view, if that goes through is does that change your plans as far as selling down New York more? Or does
that make it say like, hey, New York almost becomes like a stable rent foundation market? Or does this
mean like, hey, we could actually see our property taxes go down because if they're going to limit rent
increases, then it's hard for them to raise property tax? So just sort of curious how -- because it does look
like there's a pretty good chance good cause does pass this time.

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. A lot of parts to that question. So I'll try -- I'm going to start though with the policy part. Does good
cause eviction is just rent control by another name? It's bad policy. New York has had rent control, and
you know, you live there for -- since World War II and the housing situation in New York has not improved.
This is just going to cause less housing to be built and more disinvestment in existing housing. And there's
a lot of better ideas like SB 9 in California and 40 B in Massachusetts and some of these zoning reforms in
Minneapolis that should have been thought about.

So we're disappointed if it indeed is the direction it's going, and we'll work through our association to
suggest other better alternatives. But let's assume it does go. It was our intention to lighten the load in
New York. I think New York is going to have extraordinary revenue growth next year as a result of just
going back to where it was in '19, frankly. And so the idea of putting good cause eviction in where it's
going to affect landlords who have been beaten up by the pandemic have property taxes to pay and all
the rest seems like particularly bad timing and is going to particularly discourage production. It doesn't
make us want to own more in New York City. That's for sure. And in New York State. So I guess I'd say it's
a negative to investment in the city and in the state.

In terms of lower property taxes, I love that idea. They did come with lower taxes than we expected for
the most part this year in general. We'll see. I don't know many municipalities that like to keep their
property taxes low if they can raise them. So I'm guessing they won't lower them for us enough, Alex,
to kind of reimburse us for what's about to happen if good cause comes through. But again, it's just a
bad policy idea, putting aside the impact on EQR and we can respond to it. We'll lighten the load in New
York, and that's unfortunate. And a lot of other people will do the same thing and there'll be less capital
for housing in New York.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

You talked a little bit about the Bay Area already, but I was wondering if you could put some more color
around your expectations as to how the recovery plays out over time. I'm just thinking about it in the
context of in New York, you saw occupancy and pricing come back at basically the same time. But in
the Bay, occupancy has come back but pricing really hasn't. So is it as simple as just people with higher
incomes needing to come back to work at their tech jobs? Or is there something else going on?

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Michael L. Manelis
Executive VP & COO

Brad, this is Michael. So I think you have a little bit of everything going on. I think right now, as I said
in the prepared remarks, we're pretty well positioned in San Francisco. There is demand, right, coming
back to our product. It's just the pricing power wasn't quite where it needed to be to kind of recapture
everything that was lost through the pandemic. So I think right now, when you look at the portfolio and
you look at how it's positioned, as there's some, I guess, additional clarity around what return to office
looks like, the tech companies have been all over the place in that market. So just a little bit more clarity,
probably bring some incremental demand, and that most likely will happen after we get into the New Year.
And the portfolio that we own right now is very well positioned to capture that demand and recapture
some of that rate.

When you look at it from a submarket basis, I said a little bit on the deliveries in the South Bay, we
thought we were going to have pressure in the South Bay because of the new supply being delivered.
We're really holding up really well there. Now the rate hasn't fully recovered, but the rate recovery in the
South Bay is better than the rate recovery in Downtown San Francisco. So I think we need a few more
months to just see how some of this ambiguity kind of flushes out, and then we'll have a better feel as to
what that means for next year.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then on bad debt, you have on the slide some of the potential there, but you also
said you don't expect it to really -- fully get recovered in 2022. Can you just talk about what some of the
impediments are there? I mean is it strictly just eviction restrictions? Or what else would keep it from --
what else would make it play out over a longer period of time?

Robert A. Garechana
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think it's -- it's Bob, Brad. I think it starts with just getting to the point where these residents that
haven't been able to pay, start making different housing choices or are in a position to start paying, right?
And so that can come in a few forms. It can come in the form of some of the eviction restrictions being
lifted. It can come in the form of residents now being employed again because the economy is in a much
better spot and they can start paying again.

But there's a process that we're all going to have to go through of kind of unwinding this or moving back
to kind of a market level, and that's going to take a little bit of time, right? That's unlikely to be a light
switch like activity, especially as we work with residents kind of figuring that out. And so as a result, I
think '22 is going to be that transition year I alluded to. That's probably the biggest thing. And then to add
a little bit of -- to the financial statements, to add a little bit more noise associated with it or make the
forecasting harder, as I like to say around here, you're going to have the trickle down of the government
rental assistance payments because those programs eventually will come to an end as well. So it's really
the unwind, but of that, that's likely to occur in 2022.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer of Baird.

Amanda Morgan Sweitzer
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

By looking the loss to lease, are you able to provide that number by region? And then can you also
quantify how much of your NOI is subject to those regulatory restrictions you mentioned that would
constrain your ability to fully realize that loss to lease next year?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

18

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Amanda, this is Michael. So maybe rather than going by every market, I'll just start by saying that the
majority of our markets, so Boston, D.C., Seattle, Southern California, and Denver, all fall within a range of
a net effective loss to lease between 11% and 15% with about 80% plus of the residents in those markets
being below market prices. Not surprising, San Francisco has the lowest with a 5.7% net effective loss to
lease with 67% of residents paying below current market prices, and New York is the highest with 21%
loss to lease with 93% of the residents paying below the current market.

And as I stated in my prepared remarks, the loss to lease is a snapshot of today, and it never has
translated into full year revenue growth because you have to work your way through those expirations.
And I guess I'll just stop and just say that all of that being said, this is the best position the portfolio has
ever been in for the ability to capture it. But I think you need several months into next year to really
understand how you're going to translate that into revenue growth and how much of that is going to roll
into 2023.

And in regards to kind of thinking about the restrictions or the governors, I guess I would say it's really
hard to understand because it's so subject to who is actually going to renew, who's going to move out and
what your abilities are and what the caps are in place. And there really are so many different programs
out there. So it's really difficult to try to quantify that for you.

Amanda Morgan Sweitzer
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful and makes sense. And then just given the scale of the Toll Brothers JV, are you able
to talk more about how the potential buyout would be structured in terms of the implied acquisition yield
versus that 5-plus percent stabilized development yield that you cited?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Amanda, it's Mark. I'm going to start and Alec may have something. But we're underwriting these deals
and generally for Toll to bring them to us as we've said they need to be in that 5% yield range on current
rents or better. And so right now, Alec and his team are buying at a 3.5% or so cap rate on existing
assets. So that's at 3.5% to 5% difference, that 150 basis points or so of margin that, again, we think is
compensating us for the risk. So when we buy the asset, we will be paying Toll of promote presumably.
And so we'll be buying it at a slightly lower cap rate than that 5% in my example, assuming no intra-
period rent growth. But again, because of the way the promote is structured and all of that, it's not that
meaningful a difference. I mean we're 75% of the capital in the deal or the equity capital in the deal. So is
that helpful to you?

Amanda Morgan Sweitzer
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

It is. Appreciate the color.

Operator

We'll take our next question from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about cap rate conversions to around 3.5% across your
markets. And I realize multifamily is a very hot asset class. But with rates rising and now 20% rental
growth achieved in many of the submarkets, are you seeing any upward pressure in cap rates in your
markets?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

19

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

I'm going to let Alec give you detail in a second because I have been a little shift here and there, but it's --
interest rates matter, but fund flows matter more. And fund flows right now are highly favorable into the
space because of the performance matters you mentioned because though there were significant declines
in urban apartments, they came back pretty quick. And because the GSEs existing as a financing option
that no other sector has.

So I think when we look back at our research, there was generally a 200 basis point difference between
whatever cap rate we thought we were underwriting on acquisition, whatever the 10-year spot treasury
rate was. Right near the 10-year spot treasury rate is 1.5%, a lot of what Alec buying is very much close
to that 3.7%. So it might be a little lower, but it's not a lot lower. And so I think -- I don't feel like we're
that far out of whack. And I do feel like, generally speaking, when we look at the whole sort of situation,
it generally seems to make sense to me. And I don't think that interest rates rising alone as long as cash
flows increase will drive values down. But Alec, I don't know if you want to talk about the bidding trends
you're seeing.

Alexander Brackenridge
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. So John, this is Alec. There are, in some cases, slightly fewer bidders showing up at the auction.
That's kind of the feedback we get from brokers. But I'll tell you, the pricing hasn't gone down. In fact, it's
continued to edge up. So there are some participants who have kind of stepped back and said, "Well, I'm
not going to win anyway. So I'm not going to spend my time underwriting this, but there's still enough, as
Mark says, funds flowing in to make it for a very competitive bid to be able to prevail.

On our end, what we're trying and are doing is matching up the timing of our dispositions and our
acquisitions. So we're effectively making a neutral bet. We're not going out on a limb. So that's protecting
us.

And in the sort of spirit of full disclosure on this, a lot of our buyers are leveraged buyers of our assets.
So if the Fed raises floating rates, but if they stay still relatively low compared to the cap rates, these are
good leverage buys. So that's one of the other thing that continues to force capital into our space.

Got it. that's great color. In your presentation, you talked about maintaining occupancy at high levels
for the remainder of the year. And then Michael talked about sending renewals out at 13% in November,
December. Are you basically saying that you're not seeing much resistance to this level of renewal increase
and you're not expecting turnover to increase?

Michael L. Manelis
Executive VP & COO

Yes, we're -- this is Michael. So I would tell you, our expectations are the continued success that we've
seen in retention will balance out the rest of the year and probably even next year, right? We're in the
mid-60s right now for October, even the trends for November are very promising. The increases are
getting more significant. We're having more conversations around negotiations, but just feel really positive
about the ability to deliver results from that process.

We'll take our last question from Rob Stevenson of Janney.

Robert Chapman Stevenson

Given Prop 13, as you continue to trade $1 billion of California assets for $1 billion of Sunbelt, how much
is that going to push property taxes up? And are we going to be at same -- elevated same-store expense
level because of that going forward? Presumably, you'll have higher revenues to offset that. But is same-
store expenses just going to be higher just simply by trading California for elsewhere?

EQUITY RESIDENTIAL FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

And so it's Mark. Just to clarify that, Rob. You mean that in California because of some of these Prop
13 limits, property taxes can't grow as much going forward. I mean in our -- as maybe in Atlanta, they
wouldn't be bounded by that.

Well, I guess I'd say a couple of things. First, for example, in Texas, there's a whole bunch of property tax
limitations that are coming into place on both commercial real estate, residential real estate. Alec and his
team underwrite these increases. So if cash flow isn't going up net-net, then those assets aren't going to
be appealing to us.

So I'm not sure what you said is certain because when you say same-store expenses, maybe property
taxes go up more, but I'll tell you, California minimum wage is a lot higher. California -- all the other
compliance costs that go with owning in California are much higher. So I think if you're talking about
holistic same-store expenses, I'm not sure I believe, at least for the first 10 years or so of owning a
California asset that there's going to be that much of a difference in same-store expense growth. But Alec,
do you have a...

Alexander Brackenridge
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Well, the other thing I'd add, Rob, this is Alec, is that we're buying properties that are on average 2 years
old and selling properties that are 30 years old and that expense load on the older properties tends to
accumulate over time. And so there is a very significant trade-off there.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then the other 1 for me. I don't -- I mean it doesn't sound like that you have an exact number,
but what are you sort of figuring out as a percentage of revenue that you're still losing today as your loss
to regulation, executive orders, eviction restrictions? How material in general is that? Is that 1% of your
sort of, call it, $625 million of quarterly revenues? Is that 2%? Is that 0.5%? In terms of ballpark, how big
is that, that you're having that you're either foregoing or you're incurring additional expenses to comply
with, et cetera? How material is that? Or is that an immaterial amount that we should be focused on?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

It's Mark. I'm going to start and if Bob or Michael have anything, they'll add. But I'm on 12 -- Page 12 of
our press release, we give you a bunch of disclosure about residential bad debt and maybe this will bound
this up for you.

In 2019, our write-offs, so that would be a direct negative against residential revenues were about 40
basis points. That's a good run rate of delinquency in our portfolio rents we never receive and that burden
same-store revenue. When you look at what happened last year in '20, where there were no recoveries
and the pandemic was 3 quarters of the year and this year, you see on the bottom of 12, we're talking
about numbers that are in the 2%, 2.5% range is a headwind.

Now the problem we're having is forecasting for you where between 40 basis points and 2.5% does next
year fall. And that depends on how quickly the courts process evictions; our success in continuing to work
with our residents, which is always our first goal; whether government revenue -- or government rent
relief programs kind of leak, Robert, into next year or mostly are covered this year. So that -- hopefully,
that gives you a boundary, but that's what we have to be a little general about because there just isn't
certainty in our mind and across so many court systems and so many jurisdictions for us to know how all
that stuff plays out.

And part of that is also the remainder of the rental assistance, the other sort of $8 million to $10 million
that you guys expect in the fourth quarter?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

Very much so, and you can see what it did to our Q3 number. It went down to 70 basis points. So we can
have a -- but yet, we told you that we continue to collect all but 2.5% or so of our rents. So when we're --
that changed a little. It's getting a little better collections are every month from what is still a very good
collection level already. But this government money is definitely hard to predict and then when we can
start working with people more directly and getting them into a housing situation that's stable for them
long term, I don't know when that is exactly, but we think it's coming up.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Is there anything of any material substance to you that's expiring either at year-end or over the next 3 or
4 months without renewal by either a governor or legislature?

Mark J. Parrell
President, CEO & Trustee

So the New York Eviction moratorium, we understand, expires in the middle of January '22, both
commercial and residential. California's statewide eviction moratorium has expired, but there are
some City of Los Angeles rules out there still. Boston instituted an eviction moratorium that has no set
expiration date. They have an election in a week and then after that, we'll see. Seattle has an expiry of
their commercial and residential eviction moratorium in the middle of January of '22 as well. So you could
see I'm giving you a hodgepodge of dates, there's local overlay. There's a lot going on here. So that's why
you're getting a range from us and not the precision that we usually try and give you.

Well, I think that's the end of the call. We're appreciative for everyone's time and attention on the call
today. Have a good day.

Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.
