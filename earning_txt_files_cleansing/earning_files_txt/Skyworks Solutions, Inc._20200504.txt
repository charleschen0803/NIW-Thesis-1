SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to Skyworks Solutions Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. This
call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks.
Mr. Haws, please go ahead.

Mitchell J. Haws
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Cheryl. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Skyworks Second Fiscal Quarter 2020
Conference Call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and
Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating
to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please
refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K, for
information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any
forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include
non-GAAP financial measures, consistent with past practice. Please refer to our press release within the
Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.

With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. Before we begin the overview of the business and our Q2
results, I wanted to provide an update on the COVID-19 outbreak impacting individuals, companies,
governments and markets across the globe. Our thoughts are with the millions who have suffered the
effects of this global pandemic. At Skyworks, we are deeply engaged with our own employees, a team of
more than 9,000 deployed across the globe. Since the crisis began, we have taken early and aggressive
actions to protect our people. We've implemented multiple safety protocols, including social distancing,
daily temperature testing and heightened sanitation standards. In addition, we initiated rotating shifts
at our global manufacturing sites. The implementation of these protective measures has collectively
allowed Skyworks to better safeguard employee health while simultaneously supporting our business and
manufacturing sites worldwide.

Finally, an update on the temporary suspension of activity in our Mexicali facility. After working in close
collaboration with state and local officials in Mexico, we were given permission to resume operations last
week. Assuming no further interruptions, we do not expect the temporary suspension to have a significant
impact on our business going forward.

Now looking at the second quarter in more detail. We reported revenue of $766 million, in line with
our revised guidance. We produced gross margin of 50.2% and operating margin of 32.5%. We posted
earnings per share of $1.34, and we generated strong operating cash flow totaling $280 million in the
quarter.

Further, our design win momentum reflects our execution across a rapidly evolving business environment,
one in which our wireless technologies are playing an essential and critical role. We are enabling markets
from telemedicine to emergency response, remote work, online education, real-time security, streaming
entertainment and safe store-to-door food delivery. Our mission of connecting everyone and everything
all the time has never been more relevant. During this time of social distancing and decreased travel, the
technology Skyworks provides have become a primary means of connecting people all over the world. The
rollout and adoption of 5G and other advanced wireless technologies, such as WiFi 6 and enhanced GPS,

SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

have become the pillars in support of the vast connected economy. Skyworks is proud to play an integral
role in making these vital technologies and essential connections a reality.

During the March quarter, we expanded our engagement with leading customers, securing key design wins
across numerous applications from the mobile phone to wireless infrastructure, IoT, automotive, machine-
to-machine and medical applications. In mobile, we are leveraging our Sky5 platform across multiple
flagship 5G launches, including Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and other Tier 1 players, and expanding our
technology reach across our customized Diversity Receive platforms with new 5G-centric solutions driving
sharp gains in design win count. In IoT, we are supporting high-performance 5G and WiFi-enabled tablets
specifically developed for health, safety and telemedicine applications. Across mobile operators, we are
powering 5G hotspots with Verizon and AT&T, supporting the expanding work-from-home trend. We're
extending our market leadership in WiFi 6 with home and enterprise gateways at Cisco. We're enabling
home security applications at Honeywell and ramping remote patient monitoring systems with GE. We're
also launching asset tracking and fleet management solutions with Juniper and Blackberry. Moving to
the infrastructure space, we're supporting 5G Massive MIMO and small cell base station deployments
across the U.S., Europe and Japan. And in automotive, we're accelerating connectivity content with leading
brands, including Volkswagen, Renault, Hyundai and Nissan. These highlights demonstrate our technology
leadership underpinned by a diverse and growing set of critical product categories, resolving increasingly
complex architectures and preparing our customers for the performance gains demanded in 5G.

In these unprecedented times, our existing technologies and connectivity protocols are processing
extraordinarily high data traffic. This explosion in data consumption is taxing networks with real-time
video, high-speed processing, streaming content and a long list of critical services, all dependent upon
seamless, reliable and ubiquitous connectivity. To illustrate how the pressure on the network capacity is
intensifying, just over the last few months, we've seen visits to Amazon website rise more than 30% year-
over-year; Zoom video conferencing passing a milestone of 300 million daily participants; Microsoft Teams
platform logging a single day record of 2.7 billion minutes. And now with 5G just beginning to launch, the
average user today is still working with legacy technologies, showing system weakness in this high data
demand environment. Clearly, more than ever, always-on connectivity is paramount. Skyworks and our
partners in the mobile and wireless ecosystems are anticipating and accelerating the development and
delivery of much needed cutting-edge technologies led by 5G, WiFi 6, enhanced GPS and other networking
protocols.

As Skyworks and the world navigate this challenging environment, our focus will continue to ensure
streamlined high-speed connectivity, delivering a path for reliable, constant and safe communication,
reaching all of our customers and their varied applications.

With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of Q2 and our outlook for Q3.

Kris Sennesael
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Liam. Skyworks revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2020 was $766 million, in line with
the March 4 updated outlook where we reduced our revenue guidance for the COVID-19 impact by
approximately $45 million. At $766 million, revenue is down 5% year-over-year. However, excluding
Huawei-related revenue in both Q2 of fiscal '19 and fiscal '20, revenue is up 4% year-over-year despite
the negative impact from COVID-19. Gross profit in the second quarter was $384 million, resulting in
a gross margin of 50.2%. Operating expenses were $135 million, flat year-over-year as we continue
to prudently manage OpEx while making the necessary investments to accelerate future growth of the
business. We generated $249 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 32.5%.
Other income was $4.5 million, and our effective tax rate was 9.4%, driving net income of $230 million or
$1.34 of diluted earnings per share.

Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Second fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $280
million and capital expenditures were $60 million, resulting in $220 million of free cash flow on $766
million of revenue, translating into a strong free cash flow margin of 29%. We paid $75 million in
dividends and repurchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock for a total of $284 million. During
the last 12 months, we have returned 92% of the free cash flow back to the shareholders through

SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We ended the second fiscal quarter with cash and
investments of $1.1 billion, and we have no debt.

Now let's move on to our outlook for Q3 of fiscal 2020. Given the supply chain and demand disruptions
associated with COVID-19, visibility is limited for the June quarter, resulting in a wider revenue range
compared to prior quarters. For the third fiscal quarter of 2020, we anticipate revenue to be between
$670 million and $710 million. We expect gross margin to be approximately 50%, and operating expenses
flat with Q2 at approximately $135.5 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $2.5 million in other
income and a tax rate of 9.5%. We expect our diluted share count to further reduce to approximately 170
million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per
share of $1.13. Lastly, I would like to highlight that the company declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per
share for Q3, and we intend to continue with our share repurchase program.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Despite the macro headwinds, Skyworks remains uniquely positioned as a market leader in the most
important sectors in technology, capitalizing on our strengths in 5G and other advanced wireless protocols.
We have made the critical investments in human capital, intellectual property and manufacturing
scale to usher in a new era of ubiquitous connectivity. Our relentless focus on solving our customers'
most challenging problems positions our partners to win by resolving complexity and advancing user
experience. Skyworks' customer-first philosophy drives our product road maps, where we leverage
unique, customized system-based solutions, purpose-built to offer interoperability, unprecedented levels
of performance. Powered by the strength of our balance sheet and our cash generation capabilities, we
are funding the investments that drive sustainable growth, differentiating Skyworks as both the leading
technology innovator and a strong provider of consistent cash returns to our shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Vivek, your line is open.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I actually had 2. One on the June quarter and then second on the calendar second half expectations.
So Liam, on the June quarter, I was hoping you could give us some more color. I know it's a little
early, visibility is limited. But how have bookings played out so far? If you could give us some color
by geography and mobile versus broad markets. And there are some glimmers that China might be
recovering. Have you seen that in your business? Just some more color around what you have seen so far
in your June quarter.

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Vivek. Absolutely. What we have seen coming through the March period and then moving into April,
we are starting to see some improvement in the demand profile. So obviously, we weathered some very
bumpy seas here in the early part of the year, the whole industry. But our ability to continue to drive
design wins, and some of the design wins that we consummated earlier and at the end of 2019 started to
pick up a bit. So we were seeing a pretty rough period here coming through the end of March, but things
have gotten -- improved, I would say, quite a bit as we've gotten into the first month of our June quarter.
And we do expect -- again, there's some visibility issues out there, but we feel very confident about the
range we put out on the June quarter, and we feel very good about the bottom end of that range and we
certainly feel like there's a potential for us to go much higher.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And then, Liam, on the second half, how are you thinking about the seasonal ramps? Because what
we have heard from some of your peers in the mobile supply chain is that overall phone volumes are
lower, but the 5G unit expectations are kind of hanging in there around the 170 million to 200 million unit
number for this calendar year. Is that consistent with what you're hearing? Just in general, how should we
think about your seasonal ramp going into September, right, which tends to be your strongest sequential
growth quarter.

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Great question. So a couple of things. We have high conviction and are really happy with the design
win position we have going into the second half of the year. It is really about timing, Vivek. It really is. We
think the appetite from the consumer is very, very high. There were supply chain issues earlier in the year
for everybody. And I think once those supply chain issues resolve, and they are resolving, the consumer
then has an opportunity to capture that demand with high-end products. So we have very good position
with the leading players both in the U.S. and abroad, and we do believe that the second half calendar year
and Q4 for us are going to be much stronger than what you see in Q3.

Operator

Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Kris and Liam, I just wanted to get a better sense for your operating plan. How are you modifying it in
light of what we're seeing in COVID? And specifically, how should we be thinking about OpEx beyond the

quarter, CapEx as well as cap allocation? Are you going to continue with your share buyback? So just
wanted more color on those. And I have a follow-up.

Kris Sennesael
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Ambrish. So we are not changing our operating plan. And of course, we're going to continue to drive
the top line growth. And as Liam just pointed out, we see a lot of strength especially in -- or we expect
a lot of strength, especially in the second half of the calendar year. We are holding our margins above
50%. And as the business starts growing, we will see back improvements from a gross margin point of
view. From an OpEx point of view, as you know, we are running a very lean ship. We will continue to do
so. We will continue to manage that. There is some discretionary spending reductions that we are putting
in place. But at the same time, we will continue to make the necessary investments in R&D and sales and
marketing to support our customers and to support the growth in the second half there as well. From a
capital allocation, very similar, we will continue with our CapEx plan. We will continue to manage that.
So where we can see and possibly make some reductions, we will not hesitate to do that. But keep in
mind that most of the CapEx is driven by technology, new technology in filter, BAW filter, very complex
assembly and test new technologies. And we will make those investments to support 5G ramps and so on.
And then last but not least, as we indicated, we will return most of our cash -- free cash flow back to the
shareholder, combination of our dividend program as well as continue to execute on our share buyback
program.

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Sounds good. It sounds like you're very confident about these things that you can control in light
of what we're seeing. I had a very quick follow-up on the inventory days. Days went up a lot. We were
expecting March in absolute dollars to go up. Is there a risk of obsolescence here on the inventories side?

Kris Sennesael
Senior VP & CFO

No. So from an inventory point of view, we are running slightly higher than normal. We actually increased
inventory in the March quarter with $44 million and days of inventory is now at 155 days, which is slightly
higher than normal, but it is by design, right? We have increased our buffer stocks. We have increased
even finished goods inventory. We kept loading in our factories. Again, it's all in support of the ramp in the
second half and we want to make sure we continue to deliver on time to our customers. It actually came
in pretty handy. As you know, we had a temporary suspension in our Mexicali factory. We were able to
continue to deliver products to our customers. Luckily, that situation now has been resolved. While we are
building this inventory, there is very few or little risk from an E&O point of view. And despite all of that, we
continue to deliver a very strong free cash flow.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Caso of Raymond James.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

For first question, can you break down the revenue from the various segments? And specifically with the
broad market business, if you could talk about the near-term trends that you're seeing in that business as
you go into June.

Kris Sennesael
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Chris. So in the March quarter, mobile was approximately 70% of total revenue, which was down mid-
teens on a sequential basis, which is somewhat in line with normal seasonality. And it was flat on a year-
over-year basis. Of course, that includes the reduction in Huawei. Because if I exclude Huawei in Q2 of
fiscal '19 and Q2 of fiscal '20, the mobile revenue was actually up 9%, almost 10% on a year-over-year

8

SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

basis, driven by content gains as well as the early 5G ramp with our Chinese customers. So our broad
markets business was approximately 30% of total revenue in the March quarter. It was down mid-single
digits sequentially, but we do expect it to be up sequentially in the June quarter, in part driven by the
work-from-home, learn-from-home trend that results in strength in PC, tablets, wearables, WiFi hotspots,
the adoption of WiFi 6 and other wireless protocols.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. As a follow-up, perhaps you can give us a little more color on the China business. And in
particular, I think it's helpful to separate perhaps some of the production issues some of your customers
may have had in the March quarter when some of their facilities shut in. Obviously, it would have gotten
better from there. But perhaps what you get -- to the extent you have visibility in what's happening within
demand and how those customers are selling through phones as they get to at least some degree of
what's going to be the new normal particularly within China.

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Chris. Yes. What we're seeing is the Chinese account is actually recovering faster than some of the
other players in the U.S. I think they were the first to be hit by the virus and they're the first to come out
of it. So we are benefiting from some of the key brands, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, even some new growth now
coming up with 5G with Samsung. And that portfolio right now is actually -- it's not quite where it was a
year ago, but it's starting to move. The 5G penetration is strong and the velocity is picking up. So I think
the unit growth is starting to pick up, but the content within the units is really important to us. So we're
seeing very meaningful content improvement in 5G in China. And again, we've talked about it before, but
you have to have that backward compatibility for 3G, 4G then 5G. So there's a really nice incremental
move for us. There's also a great deal of complexity for the customer. And our job is to resolve that and
lever the integrated solutions like Sky5 to make it really easy for the client. So we are starting to see that.
And the Chinese brands today are really starting to move. There's still a lot of upside there from our base
today, but they are starting to show some real good progress.

Operator

Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley.

Craig Matthew Hettenbach
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Just following up on the broad markets business. Any additional context you have in terms of
supply versus demand? Certainly, there's been some demand impact here but also customers kind
of looking to secure supply. So just curious to how you're seeing that play out in your broad markets
business.

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Craig, and you're right. I mean there was definitely a period of time and it's still being resolved
with some imbalances in supply and demand. There's been quite a bit of demand in broad markets
for technologies like WiFi, WiFi 6, even some of the GPS technologies, and we deliver those. So we,
fortunately, do the lion's share of our business in-house, right, under our watch and our own factory.
So we've been able to be more active, more agile in executing to those demands. And a lot of those
demands, as Kris mentioned, were driven by new applications, work-from-home. Again, all of the
services that are starting to create the opportunity, right, we're seeing today, whether it's safer home and
entertainment, whatever it may be, the technologies that we make, not just 5G but the WiFi and GPS,
are really moving fast. So we're getting to a point where the supply and demand intersection is closing.
But we do see a meaningful change in user appetite for the technologies, right? I think you're going to
see more and more folks now truly adopt telemedicine or truly adopt video conferencing, some of these
things that were kind of nascent and really hadn't been played out. So we're looking forward to that. And

SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

the WiFi 6 technologies, as I said, are probably the leader in broad market. But we're also generating
new wins with very, very important customers globally that 3 or 4 years ago really weren't on our list,
names like GE, names like Honeywell, Raytheon, to continue to really broaden that reach in that side of
the market.

Craig Matthew Hettenbach
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And then just, Liam, just for a follow-up for the flagship phones in the back half of this year. Can
you talk about just kind of year-to-year, how you're feeling about kind of the content?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Sure, sure. Well, as I said, we've got some pretty important players launching 5G, and the 5G story is all
about incremental content, also incremental complexity. And I think it will be revealed that our solutions
fare very, very well, and our content opportunity was meaningful and we executed on that. So some of
that stuff hasn't hit the market yet. But we know what we're winning and where we're headed, and it's a
positive move. We'll start to see that into Q4 and into our fiscal Q1, which would be the December quarter.
So Q4, September through December, you're going to see a lot of that traction launch.

Operator

Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays.

Blayne Peter Curtis
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Liam, just curious, you went through your own factory shutdown, but the handset OEMs went through that
issue in Q1. You had an up quarter. It's hard to disseminate because you're obviously, I think, coming off
a very low level and maybe gaining some share. But I'm just kind of curious to your perspective on the
Android market. Was there any inventory that was built in Q1? And did that rectify itself in Q2 with this
guidance?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think it feels like we're normalizing right now, Blayne, and starting to get to a point where there's
real acceleration in supply chain. As you noted, throughout this period, getting from February to now,
there's been a tremendous amount of supply chain breakdowns everywhere. We're fortunate that we
have our own facilities and we can manage our house pretty well, but it's very challenging for the
overall industry with some locations and some factories just not being able to get employees, right, for
obvious reasons, for health reasons. But I feel like that's starting to abate now, and we're seeing more
improvement. If you look at the Android cycle, we have really good print position with MediaTek, as an
example, and they've been a real strong feeder for Asia and other emerging markets. Also, we're seeing
some really good things, as I mentioned, with the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi names as we go forward. And the
supply chains today, again, are getting cleaned up pretty quickly, specifically in China and other Asian
markets. So we feel like that could pick up.

And it's another thing that the overall theme here is that we've got a great technology in 5G globally,
the industry, and the consumer has not had a chance to get there, right? We had supply chain issues.
We had some shocks -- supply chain shocks in some cases where the technology wasn't there. We have
people staying at home. They're not going to the stores. This is all going to abate, and the demand and
the consumption for the technology is going to be there. And I think wireless, in this period of time that
we've all been dealing with here, stay-at-home period, we recognize that the wireless devices that we
have really are the bread and butter of our communication, our ability to work, our ability to communicate
with family. It's really important, and I think the appetite for the technology is going to only increase and
the opportunity for companies like Skyworks, we're happy to play a role in advancing those technologies
into the future.

SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Blayne Peter Curtis
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And I just want to ask you on your BAW efforts and Qualcomm has been very vocal about their confidence
in their SAW technology. You saw this Broadcom asset, I guess, ultimately not get sold. Can you point out
anything in terms of what you're shipping today for BAW? And then as you look out in the back half of
next year in terms of shipping into mid-, high-band module, where do you see that for Skyworks down the
road?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Sure. The story is getting better and better, Blayne, with respect to BAW. So we have some meaningful
design wins that have been shipping, but the quantity of the device count now is going way up. So we're
broadening the set of customers. And then some of the very strategic customers, the volumes and units,
they are picking up. So we actually -- I'm going to give you like a highlight real stat here. We crossed 100
million units of BAW-enabled devices about 2 weeks ago since we launched the BAW technology. So we're
really pleased at the launch. It's taken a little time, but we're accelerating. We have opportunities across
the board with new customers. We have design wins with strategic customers today, and we're going to
continue to advance that technology. And all of that stuff is being done in-house with our engineering
teams, our fabs, our IP and just driving a technology solution that customers really want.

Operator

Your next question comes from Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research.

Edward Francis Snyder
Charter Equity Research

Liam, you mentioned the sharp gain in DRx modules content or design wins based on 5G content. Is any
of that due to finally getting a transmit function in the DRx modules to support MIMO or CA or Diversity?
Or is it still all on the receive side? And are you in production on the BAW duplexer yet?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean it's a great question. So the DRx category, as you know, has really been an incredible
performer in mobile device, capitalizing on downlink. And there are so many variants, Ed, for us. We have
a really wide portfolio in that technology. And we are starting to see greater usage across the board. There
are so many different versions, whether it's DRx, DSM, ultra-high-band, mid-band. You can go across the
board, and we're able to play in each one of those categories. And it's a technology that requires very
strong, very powerful filtering, the ability to work collectively with potentially LNAs and other technologies
and then integrate in a way that works for the customer. So we're doing really well there. And we do want
to continue on the BAW side to advance the technology into higher and higher bands and capture more
and more of that pie. And I think we have some important customers and accounts that work with us
that collaboratively we're trying to get to that solution together. But along the way, the DRx solutions
are gaining a lot of share, a lot of traction. They're extremely valuable to the customer. It's a high-end
solution at very fair pricing and allows the customer to get a great end solution. So it's -- that technology
continues to move. The bulk acoustic wave technologies, again, continue to move up. We've demonstrated
some volume now, but we still have a lot of room to move from here, I mean by no means have we
captured all the businesses, a lot out there for us to go after.

And then on ultra-high-band, if I could. The sub-6 bands in China requiring both 77 and 79 and T-Mo have
to use Sprint's Band 41 for 5G, I mean we're seeing up to 5 new transmit-receive chains being added to
some of the high-end phones. How many of your customers are putting more of a premium on size, so say
favoring your dual-band solution versus flexibility on selecting individual bands that more of the kind of

approach that China has taken? I'm trying to get a feel for, one, what solution is being favored. And two,
are you seeing a lot of people opting for the kind of the fuller-end, high-end solutions that would require
more integration?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. No. It's a great question. So you're right. I mean n77, n79 are really important right now in the 5G
landscape. And you're also -- you hit another point that I didn't make. The integration is so vital. We don't
-- the integration for us isn't just kind of a cool thing to package. It is really about densifying the product.
And Kris mentioned some of our capital investments are really around packaging advancements. We, of
course, are developing filters and trying to raise the bar on frequency with our filtering technology, but
you also have to have incredible technology on the packaging side to create that miniaturization. And
with more and more technology squeezed in, you've got 3G, 4G and 5G incremental, you've got transmit,
you've got receive, it's very, very complex architecturally. So those technologies that we have are critical.
And customers do want to integrate it. I mean there's an appetite, in some cases, for discretes, but that's
really moving in the rearview mirror. And the new technology, specifically in 5G, are going to be around
densification, packaging and then bringing all of those elements to the customer in an easy, easy form
factor.

Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

My first one was on your exposure in China. Kris, I think last quarter, you guys were kind enough to
size your business with the non-Huawei, the OVX camp at around $100 million in the December quarter.
Curious how big those guys were in the March quarter and what the outlook was into June. And related to
that, we're getting quite a few headlines related to the U.S.-China trade relationship. Any of this kind of
potentially impact you guys down the line? Then I have a quick follow-up.

Kris Sennesael
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Our China business remains on or about 20% of total revenue. And we definitely see strength with
Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi as they ramp their 5G phones with strong Skyworks content in it. Unfortunately,
the business with Huawei remains at a much lower level than it was historically although we are able to
continue to ship under the ban, which is still effective right now.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then a quick follow-up on gross margins. I was positively surprised to see gross margins in
the quarter essentially come in line with guidance despite lower revenue. And I guess similarly into June,
you're guiding to essentially flat gross margins with a reduced revenue outlook. So I guess I was curious,
what were some of the offsets in the March quarter? Kris, you spoke to maintaining factory loading. So
maybe that's the explanation. But were there any positives that sort of materialized in March? And what
are some of the potential offsets into June?

Kris Sennesael
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. No. I mean we continue to work really hard to improve gross margins. And as I've talked about that
before, one of the most important things is -- of course, is advancing the technology, higher complexity,
more value-add new products, especially with 5G, WiFi 6 that we bring to market. And typically, those
higher complex type of products demand a higher gross margin. And so as we bring those new products
to market, you will see a boost from that. Unfortunately, yes, there is some disruption in the supply chain
and some inefficiencies as a result of COVID-19. And so that's why we're not at 53% gross margin today.

SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

But we hope that once all those disruption gets out of the supply chain and we start ramping the business,
we will see some nice further improvements on the gross margins.

Your next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley FBR.

Craig Andrew Ellis
B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the financial performance and, Liam, on the internal BAW milestone. That's a big one for the
company given your support there.

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Craig.

Craig Andrew Ellis
B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division

Yes. You're welcome. What I wanted to do with the first question is just to make sure I'm looking at what
you're seeing with integrated mobile correctly over the -- say, the 12-, the 18-month time period. So
we have been shipping Sky5. We continue to do that and it sounds like broadened our OEM base in the
quarter and so that sets up well for the back half. You've got 5G Diversity Receive. And I wasn't clear if
you were saying that was going to ship in volume in the second half or really for next year. But in the
second half, our 5G units should at least double half-on-half per industry just given the projections that
are out there from some of the big guys. And then next year, hopefully, we don't have a situation where
we lose 10% of our sales days due to a virus crisis. So help me, one, understand if the timing for some
of the new products is somewhat as I outlined in terms of their impact on financials. And what does that
mean for next year's growth? Are we solidly back in double-digit growth next year for integrated mobile?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Great. Great questions and lots of ways to think about it. So I'll tell you what we see now, Craig, and
how it plays out into the future. We really are feeling good about the design consummation that we've
made here. And those products, a lot of those products have not yet shipped. And you hit a couple of
key points. Sky5, great traction, a lot of room. Diversity Receive, we're delivering that in low-band, mid-
band and high-band on the receive side with some great technologies, all of that new. Then we start to
get into the broad markets. We're seeing more and more -- I mean Kris touched on some of it, but we're
seeing a real nice run-up in some of the WiFi technologies, WiFi 6, and those are not low-end products.
Those are very, very high-performing data drivers. And in this work-in-home environment and some of the
new applications that have been stimulated through this are not going to go away. The appetite is there.
So when you get to the macro view of how do the numbers come together, it's really about timing. The
magnitude of the dollars will be up. We know that and we know -- we believe that with great conviction.
We're coming off of a low point as well. I mean this is our pivot -- Q3 is our pivot quarter. This is our pivot
quarter. We're going to be up and to the right from here. And it's just about the rate of change or the rate
of revenue and the timing, right? I mean the world really doesn't care about 90-day quarters. It's just
about the actual growth and consummation of the demand.

So we feel really good about it. And there's a reason for it. The products are better. The 5G technologies
are much faster. They're more reliable, better latency. You can move it into IoT. There's just a lot to
do. And unfortunately, this COVID-19 thing showed up. No one expected it and it put the brakes on the
business. And now we're starting to recover, but we still feel really good about the outcome and where
we're headed. Our factories are positioned well. We're in extremely close communication with every one
of our customers, working hand in hand to consummate and intersect their supply, our demand, their
demand, our supply working together. So it's a great opportunity for companies like Skyworks to shine.
We have our own facilities. We develop at a chip level then integrate at a systems level. We can create

flexibility for whatever market the customers want to roam in, what their size constraints may be, what
their current consumption may be and weave that all together for a solution. But we feel really good about
the macro theme here. It's been delayed, unfortunately, but we see that starting to come back by the end
of this quarter and certainly into our Q4 in the second half calendar.

Craig Andrew Ellis
B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just on broad markets, and one of the comments from your
recent remarks and earlier. As you went through some of the applications for which broad markets is
seeing good demand and has some runway, whether it'd be auto or others, one of the things I don't think
I've heard previously but was on today's call was telemedicine. And so the question is in the world that
we're now in, beyond telemedicine, are there other application areas that are coming in to the broad
markets portfolio as new incremental TAM for you? And if so, what would they be?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think the video conferencing dynamic is incredible. I'm sure everybody that's on this call has been
using that recently. And even the best technology out there today is still not good enough, in my opinion.
And I think the appetite for that is really going to create some interesting dynamics for us. I think that's
one really important one. I think the service community is going to be a big deal right now. I mean people
are -- you're seeing how the world has evolved. We talked about some stats, about whether it's Microsoft
Teams or Zoom or stay-at-home, food delivery. These are things that I don't think they're going to go
away. Even when the COVID-19 pandemic is done, I think there's going to be some lasting behavior. And
some of that's very good behavior for our business, where the consumer is going to rely more and more
on wireless technologies and remote technologies to live their life. And whether it's education, whether it's
health care, whether it's entertainment, all of those services are provided and can be provided through
wireless technologies that we bring to market.

Your next question is from Bill Peterson of JPMorgan.

William Chapman Peterson
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I guess the first question as it relates to COVID-19 impacts, in this case, on the supply chain, it's good
to see, obviously, Mexicali coming back. But there's obviously a lot of talk that there could be multiple
phases of this virus. I'm wondering -- I guess what percentage is coming from Mexicali? What are the
opportunities? Or have you considered outsourcing? And what are the contingency plans? And I guess
how conceivable is it if you did need to bring up a secondary or a third party to manufacture some of your
products?

Kris Sennesael
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So Bill, so approximately 70%, 75% of the revenue is being generated out of the back-end facility
in Mexicali. Now before this whole COVID-19 pandemic started, we were already building a more diverse
supply chain. And so we have already started to shift part of our supply chain with third-party assembly
and test houses out there, mostly in Asia. And so that's obviously a trend that we will continue to do so.

William Chapman Peterson
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And I know you guys constantly talk about crafting solutions, working side by side with customers. I
guess with a lot of the lockdowns in place globally, how has that impacted your design activities? I mean,
I presume, obviously, your second half design wins are well locked and loaded. But as we think about next
year, how are you working with your customers to craft these solutions?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean we are doing that, but it's not -- it has been far less of face-to-face, hand-to-hand kind of
communication, right? So we're not shoulder to shoulder the way we used to be. And we will be again, but
in the meantime, we've got really clever engineers with customers that are very smart, and we're using
the technologies we talked about. We're doing video conferencing, Microsoft Teams, a lot of conference
calls, a lot of sharing of PowerPoint and openness as we go through this. So it is a different dynamic. I
think most of us prefer the in-person contact, but it's one of the things that may change, right? I think the
world may change as a result. There could be more and more distance-based communication. And again,
that's more of a wireless play. But in the meantime, we're staying extremely close with our customers.
We're taking care of our people. We're being good citizens in that regard, and we're hoping that we can all
get through this together and look forward to better days.

Your last question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.

Harsh V. Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So Liam or Kris, a question for you. In the last 6 months, revenues are down roughly, call it, $200 million,
but your margins are within a band of basically 30 -- 20, 30 basis points. So the question is how -- I mean
what have you guys done here to basically keep your margins up despite the fact that your utilization,
I assume, is down quite a bit despite the fact that you might have built a little bit of inventory? I'm just
curious.

Kris Sennesael
Senior VP & CFO

No. Harsh, I mean this is, as I indicated before, a lot of hard work from the team and there's multiple
elements that come into play, right? There is more complex, higher value-add products that we bring to
the market. That's very important. We continue to execute well. Secondly, of course, it's driving down
the cost in our factories and our third-party suppliers, building a very efficient operations. And then, of
course, we do have a little bit of a tailwind from a mix point of view as broad markets is growing and
has some higher margins compared to the mobile business. As you know, our target model is 53%. If it
wasn't for the headwinds that you just indicated, we would have been there already. But unfortunately, we
have to deal with those headwinds and we're dealing with it. And so as I indicated before, in second half
2020 and beyond, when those headwinds become tailwinds, we will see some nice further gross margin
improvements.

Harsh V. Kumar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

But it's pretty impressive, guys. I just wanted to ask if there was anything going on. And then secondly,
we've heard a lot -- you guys have called out China, particularly the new 5G phones, Oppo, Vivo, et
cetera, in the last few calls. And I was curious if you guys are actually -- you think you're actually gaining
a lot of share or is it just a situation where China as a country is going to 5G and you're just getting your
fair share there?

Liam K. Griffin
CEO, President & Director

No. The way we see it, and we have really good intel on this, is that we are gaining a lot of share, and
part of it is the ability to do that integration and make it easy for the customers. So there's a great deal
of interest and appetite and demand in China for a 5G product. And what we're doing is we're bringing in
a highly complex, configured customer by customer, Sky5 platform so that those customers don't have
to deal with all the complexity and burden of laying out 40, 50 different discrete devices to create a 5G
engine. We're going to do it for them. And so that's been really the play for us. And it's worked out great.
