KEYCORP FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder,
this conference is being recorded.

I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Chris Gorman. Please go ahead, sir.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, thank you for joining us for KeyCorp's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on
the call today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.

On Slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosures and non-GAAP financial measures. It
covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.

I'm now moving to Slide 3. We delivered another strong quarter with earnings per share of $0.72. This is
an increase of 18% from the first quarter and up significantly from the year ago period. Our results reflect
our success in acquiring and deepening relationships across our franchise, further improvement in credit
quality and contributions from targeted investments. We generated positive operating leverage on a year-
to-date basis and remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year.

We generated record second quarter revenue, driven by an 8% year-over-year increase in noninterest
income. In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in new households in the first 6 months.
In every one of our markets and in every age group, importantly, some of our strongest growth has come
from younger clients in the western part of our franchise. Our new client growth over the past 6 months
exceeds our growth in any full year period over the last decade.

Additionally, our consumer business generated over $4 billion in loan originations for the quarter. Mortgage
originations reached another all-time high and we expect to exceed last year's record level of $8.3 billion
for the full year.

Laurel Road also had another strong quarter despite the federal student loan holiday. Since the launch of
our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for Doctors, we have added over 2,500 new doctors and dentists.
The launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together several critical
elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, health care and primacy.

Moving to our commercial businesses. We had another strong quarter. Our investment banking business
generated fees of $217 million, a record second quarter level and the second highest quarterly level in our
history. We experienced growth across the entire platform. We have grown this business consistently over
the past decade, and we expect to grow it again in 2021. Importantly, this is a business driven primarily
by repeat clients. Our pipelines are currently at record levels, supporting our strong growth outlook for the
business. This quarter, we raised $21 billion for our clients, of which we retained approximately 20% on
our balance sheet.

Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to
make across our franchise, in digital, in analytics and in our teammates. Let me highlight just a few of
these investments. I've already mentioned Laurel Road and the launch of our National Digital Bank. Not
only have we accelerated client acquisition, but our new clients are doing more with us with approximately
half of our new doctor and dentists using multiple products. We also continued to build out our analytic
capabilities, including our recent acquisition of AQN Strategies, we have doubled the size of our analytics
team.

Year-to-date, we have increased our senior bankers by 5% in our targeted growth areas. This has resulted
in a 21% increase in client pitches on a year-to-date basis. We also consolidated 54 branches this quarter

KEYCORP FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2021

with an additional 14 planned for next quarter. These consolidations will drive future cost savings and
support our ongoing investments.

Shifting to credit quality. Our trends remained positive this quarter. Nonperforming loans, net charge-offs
and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net charge-offs to average loans were 9 basis
points.

We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue
to position the company to perform well through all business cycles. Finally, we have maintained our
strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our common equity Tier 1
ratio ended the quarter at 9.9%, which is above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. Our strong capital
position enables us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, namely organic growth,
dividends and share repurchases.

Combining our share repurchases and dividends paid this quarter, we have returned capital representing
$0.50 a share for an annualized return of capital of approximately 11% at our current valuation. Earlier
this month, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion
beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of 2022. The Board will
also evaluate an increase to our common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Overall, I was very pleased with the quarter, which reflects the hard work and dedication of our team. We
grew our top line, and we made targeted investments to position the company for continued growth. As
always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and our commitment to
return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

I will now turn the call over to Don, who will provide more details on the results of the quarter. Don?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on Slide 5. As Chris said, it was a strong quarter with net income from continuing
operations of $0.72 per common share, up 18% from the prior quarter and 4x from the year ago period.
The quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses. The reserve release was largely
driven by our strong credit metrics and expected improvement in the economic environment. Importantly,
we generated record second quarter revenue, driven by strength in our fee-based businesses. Our
reported return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 22.3%. Adjusting for the reserve release,
our ROTCE was 16% within our targeted range of 16% to 19%. I will cover the other items on this slide
later in my presentation.

Turning to Slide 6. Total average loans were $101 billion, down 7% from the second quarter of last year.
C&I loans were down $9 billion, reflecting decreased utilization levels. Consumer loans were up 9%,
benefiting from continued growth from Laurel Road and, as Chris mentioned, record performance from our
consumer mortgage business. Combined, we had over $4 billion of originations this quarter between our
residential mortgage and Laurel Road production. The investments we've made in these areas continue to
drive results and, importantly, add high-quality loans and relationships.

Linked quarter average loan balances were relatively flat as commercial loans declined due to the
commercial utilization rates, partly offset by growth in PPP loans. Consumer loans grew 2%, again related
to the continued strength from our consumer mortgage and Laurel Road.

PPP average balances were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up from $7 billion in the first quarter. The PPP
balances ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, reflecting $2.8 billion of forgiveness and $900 million of new
production.

Continuing on to Slide 7. Average deposits totaled $144 billion for the second quarter of 2021, up $16
billion or 13% compared to the year ago period. and up 5% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter
and year ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited
from government stimulus. The growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time
deposits. Total interest-bearing costs came down another 2 basis points from the first quarter, following a

KEYCORP FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2021

3 basis point decline last quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer
deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix.

Turning to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.023 billion for the second quarter of
2021, compared to $1.025 billion a year ago and $1.012 billion from the prior quarter. Our net interest
margin was 2.52% for the second quarter compared to 2.76% from the same period last year and 2.61%
for the prior quarter. Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by
the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period. The larger balance sheet
benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in
liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased
$11 million and the margin declined 9 basis points. Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and higher loan
fees from PPP forgiveness were offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels.
For the quarter, PPP loan fees, including the impact of forgiveness, totaled $50 million, up $2 million from
the prior quarter.

The significant build in liquidity continues to be the largest driver of our net interest margin. We are
maintaining around $20 billion in excess cash. Cumulatively, excess liquidity has negatively impacted
our net interest margin by about 35 basis points with 7 basis points of incremental impact for the second
quarter.

Moving to Slide 9. We've continued to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have
benefited from the investments we've made. Noninterest income was $750 million for the second quarter
of 2021, compared to $692 million for the year ago period and $738 million in the first quarter. Compared
to the year ago period, noninterest income increased 8%. We had a record second quarter for investment
banking and debt placement fees, which reached $217 million driven by a broad-based growth across the
platform, including strong M&A fees. Commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $32 million. Cards
and payments income also increased $22 million related to broad-based growth across product categories,
including debit, credit and merchant products. This growth was offset by lower consumer mortgage fees
resulting from lower gains on sale margin and also the impact of MSR valuation changes. Lower operating
lease income resulted from leverage lease gains in the year ago period.

Compared to the first quarter, noninterest income increased by $12 million. The largest driver of the
quarterly increase was a record second quarter and the second highest ever quarter for investment
banking and debt placement fees. Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial mortgage
servicing income also showed strength versus the prior quarter. These were partially offset by lower
other income due to positive market-related valuation adjustments in the prior period, offset by negative
adjustments in the current quarter.

I'm now on Slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.076 billion compared to $1.013
billion last year and $1.071 billion in the prior quarter. Our expense levels reflect production-related
incentives and the investments we've made to drive future growth. We have highlighted some of the
significant investments on the lower left of this slide. We continue to invest in Laurel Road, including the
launch of the National Digital Bank, including spend in marketing and technology. We also grew senior
relationship bankers by 5% year-to-date in our targeted focus areas, including renewables team that we
added in May.

We've also continued to invest in our digital capabilities as well as analytics. Our analytics team has grown
by 2.5x, including our recent acquisition of AQN. The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel
expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation and an increase in our stock price.
Employee benefit costs also increased $16 million as health care-related costs were low in the second
quarter of last year.

Computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the
platform. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense was relatively stable. Higher incentive and
stock-based compensation was offset by seasonally lower employee benefit cost. Marketing costs were up
$5 million, primarily related to the launch of the Laurel Road for Doctors.

KEYCORP FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2021

I'm now on Slide 11. Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. For the second quarter,
net charge-offs were $22 million or 9 basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses was a
net benefit of $222 million. This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as
our outlook for the overall economy. Nonperforming loans were $694 million this quarter or 69 basis points
of period-end loans, a decline of $34 million from the prior quarter. Additionally, criticized loans declined
and the over 90-day delinquencies improved quarter-over-quarter.

Now on to Slide 12. Key's capital position remains an area of strength. We ended the second quarter
with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.9%, which places us above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%.
This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs
and return capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in
accordance with our capital priorities. We repurchased $300 million of common shares during the quarter,
and our Board of Directors authorized a second quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share. As Chris
mentioned, combined, this return of capital represents $0.50 a share this quarter, an annualized return of
11% of our current valuation.

Earlier this month, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5
billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of 2022. The
Board will also evaluate and increase the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021.

On Slide 13, we provide our updated full year 2021 outlook, which we have adjusted to reflect our outlook
for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating
leverage this year. Average loans are still expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum
in our consumer areas, the impact of the PPP program and a pickup in commercial loan growth later this
year. We expect deposits to be up high single digits, reflecting the continued outperformance we have
seen to date. We will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base.

Net interest income is now expected to be relatively stable, reflecting the low rate environment as well as
the slightly lower-than-expected loan balances. Our net interest margin will continue to reflect the impact
of excess liquidity on our balance sheet. Noninterest income should be now up in the high single digit
to low double-digit range, reflecting the broad-based growth in most of our core fee-based businesses,
including what is expected to be another record year for our investment banking business.

Given the stronger revenue outlook, we now expect noninterest expense to be up low single digits, with
the primary driver being higher production-related incentives. As we identified on our expense side, we
are also continuing to invest in areas that will drive future growth, namely teammates, technology and
also rolling out new capabilities such as Laurel Road. Does not change our focus on core expenses and
driving further efficiencies, including our commitment to generate positive operating leverage for the year.

Moving to credit quality. We have reduced our net charge-off guidance once again, which is now expected
to be in the 20 to 30 basis point range for the year. This reflects the quality of our portfolio, our current
outlook and performance to date. And our guidance for the GAAP tax rate has increased to 20% for the
full year, reflecting the higher expected earnings for this year.

Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect
to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our
productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was another strong quarter, and we remain
confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

First question is on sort of C&I utilization and the outlook for improving trends in the second half. So
definitely understand the rationale for it. But just curious sort of what's giving you that confidence? And
I guess, maybe more specifically, are you seeing any pickup in utilization? Or did you see any throughout
the course of the second quarter? Just maybe any color there would be quite helpful.

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, Scott. So kind of as you think about -- we always look at revolver utilization in the C&I space. And
-- so typically, for us, it's been mid-30s for a long time. It would have peaked last year at 40 when people
were drawing on their lines, like that and then it has been a steady grind down to 27 where we are now.
Now the good news is that it has stabilized at 27. And as we look at kind of some of the metrics, we think
we've stabilized at 27.

The other part of your question about what gives us comfort that we'll be able to have C&I growth in
the back half. And you're right. We're guiding to relatively stable loans throughout 2021. Our consumer
business will be the growth engine. But kind of the green shoot, so to speak, that we see in C&I are sort of
as follows: Leasing, which we think is a leading indicator, our pipelines are up 35% year-over-year. And for
us, Scott, as you know, that's typically around renewables, technology and health care, which are some of
our focus areas.

Other things that I think will help us is our focus on both technology and health care and also our
subspecialties in renewables and affordable housing. And then lastly, the only other thing I would add is
our M&A pipeline is at record levels, and that generally pulls through financings as well. That's kind of how
we're thinking about it.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. That's perfect. And I definitely appreciate that. And then Don, I was hoping I could ask you about
that, I guess, it's on Page 18 of the release, we've got the securities yields. Can you go into -- and I
apologize if I missed it in my remarks, but just that pretty substantial increase in the securities available
for sale yield. What's going on there?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I would say that as far as the actual yield, I'm trying to go back to the page you're referring to, I
apologize, but...

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes, sorry. More specifically, it's the 3.13 yield on securities available for sale versus like 1.76 in the first
quarter.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

KEYCORP FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2021

We'll have to get back to you on that, Scott, because I would say that if we look at the total portfolio
overall, that we would see a yield closer to the 2.30 range overall. I would say that part of the first quarter
of 2021 might be the impact of the short-term treasuries and would have had a change there. But we'll
follow up with you on that overall because if you look at the net interest income for the first quarter of
2021 versus the second quarter, it's only changed by about $3 million. So we'll clarify that for you, so I
apologize.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Perfect. I just want to make sure there wasn't some accounting change or something that was
obviously I wasn't aware of. So...

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

Can you remind us what kind of rate environment is necessary to achieve the long-term targets,
particularly the efficiency and ROTCE targets that you guys have on the bottom of Slide 13?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Well, we would believe that rates will help achieving each of those. I would say that just from the return
on tangible common equity, though, that we had highlighted that, we acknowledge that the reported isn't
sustainable at a 22-plus percent range. But if you back up the reserve release, that gets us to 16%. And
even if you normalize the current quarter for normalized credit cost of, say, $80 million to $90 million
a quarter, we're in that 15% range. And then if you adjust for our outsized capital position, that still
brings us back close to that 16% kind of return on tangible common equity level based on the current
year's performance. And so as far as the efficiency ratio, we are down to the 59% -- 59.9%. We also
have some unusual activity in there related to certain government support programs, but if those would
normalize, we'd be towards the 59% range and it would allow us to continue to make progress as we see
enhancements in our operating results to drive that down closer to that 54% to 56% range long term.

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's helpful. And Chris and Don, can you expand on your Laurel Road comments, how far through
their medical school journey as a typical customer before they're acquired? What's the secret sauce that
differentiates Laurel Road from other lenders? And at the end of their medical school journey, what are the
wealth management opportunities, just those types of -- if you could just paint the picture for us?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So the typical point of capture for our customers at Laurel Road is when they begin their fellowships.
So think about somebody that is accredited, that's a doctor that is -- wouldn't be unusual for them to
have $200,000 of debt and have a FICO score of like 770. And it's a great time for us to bring a new
customer onto the platform because typically, they're being placed through the matching process. And
at that point, not only do they refinance their debt, but thankfully for us, they do a lot of other things.
They -- a lot of times, they buy their first house and get a mortgage. We also have -- now have the ability
to savings, payments. So we can offer a digital-based kind of full relationship. And what that does for us
is not only does it enable us to capture these customers, it gets us out of the 15 state footprint because
we can target these customers throughout the country. So far, we've targeted the 1.5 -- I'm sorry, 1.1
million doctors and dentists. We'll build that out in concentric circles. The next build-out will be nurses that
number about 4.4 million. Is that helpful?

Bill Carcache
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's very helpful.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate the color you gave on the commercial loan growth outlook. On the consumer side, can you
maybe elaborate a little bit more, maybe unpack the expectation, the growth expectation, as you look at
the different portfolios? I know you're constructive on your -- on the Laurel Road progress there. Maybe if
you could help us size up the growth expectation on balance sheet? And then separately, in terms of -- on
the mortgage side, I'm interested in what type of balance sheet retention you expect coming out of your
production there?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So let me start with the mortgage and give you kind of a flavor for that. Our mortgage business,
which obviously has enjoyed a lot of growth. We generate about 55% on the purchase side, 45% is
actually sold. About 70 -- I'm sorry, 55% is purchased, 45% is refinanced. 70% is on balance sheet. And
interestingly, as it ties into the discussion we were just having, about 20% of that is to doctors, just as
a point. So we're expecting that business to continue to grow. I said we originated $8.3 billion last year,
and we will exceed that this year. Laurel Road continues. And as I mentioned, in spite of the loan -- federal
loan holiday, they continue to generate good numbers. This quarter, they generated about $400 million of
new loans, and we would expect that to continue to grow as well.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of your excess liquidity, I know you're sitting at about $20 billion.
If you could just maybe help us in terms of your thoughts on what options you have there as you look at
the bond portfolio, which is understandably tougher right now as well as incremental swaps? If you could
just talk about the potential opportunity to redeploy?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Sure that -- you're right, we're sitting at about $20 billion of cash. We also have about $5 billion worth
of short-dated treasuries in our bond portfolio as well. And so -- we do have plenty of excess liquidity.
We would typically target, say, between $1 billion and $2 billion of liquidity from that perspective. And so
even if we turned around and invest it in today's rate environment, it would be a meaningful lift. In the
second quarter, we bought about $2.2 billion worth of securities that had an average yield of 1.41. Today's
market environment would still have in that, say, 1.25, 1.30 range for the same type of securities. And --
so if you look at $20 billion of excess liquidity and apply that kind of a yield to it, it would be a lift of over
$200 million, probably close to $250 million as far as the added revenues compared to where we would be
today. And so that is meaningful.

That being said, we're still looking for opportunities to when we start to invest. We've been more holding
water as far as replacing some of the runoff with new purchases. But we do expect rates over the next
several quarters to start picking up again and giving us some opportunities to buy there.

On the hedge or swap portfolio that you might have seen in the slide deck, we actually terminated swaps
that were maturing throughout 2021. And so the value of the swap -- the notional value of the swap book
has actually declined. We're not looking to add additional swaps there, but we'll continue to assess that
and just assessing the overall asset sensitivity. Right now, we don't have a whole lot of downside risk

KEYCORP FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2021

because if rates -- even if they do go below 0, we have a lot of floors in place in some of our commercial
portfolios. And so we're protected on the downside. And so we're again looking for more opportunities to
start to deploy some of that excess cash.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Can you talk about the outlook for the cards and payments business between the core growth and maybe
some slowdown in the prepaid activity from the government stimulus and just the impact on the expense
from that?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So you kind of have to bifurcate the 2 of them. We've seen strong growth kind of across the board
in cards and payments. The spend, both credit and debit is up about 25%, Peter, year-over-year. Now as
it relates specifically to prepaid, and keep in mind, our prepaid assumed that our revenues and expenses
about equal each other, we would expect prepaid to wind down, but we would still expect to see growth in
cards and payments based on the underlying growth of the other pieces and parts of the business.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

And Peter, just to provide a little more clarity there as well that the prepaid revenues and expenses were
both about $37 million are the fee income and the expenses in the current quarter. And so we would
expect to start seeing that wind down throughout the second half of the year.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then, Don, if I could just ask maybe if you can give some color maybe about
what the margin outlook for the second half of the year?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Well, I would say there's a number of factors that are going to impact that. One is liquidity levels, and
that's been the biggest determinant as far as the overall margin. And this last quarter, we saw that 7 of
the 9 basis point decline was related to the impact of higher levels of liquidity. But our outlook would not
assume that liquidity position build from here. And so we shouldn't see that kind of pressure given the
overall loan balances and deposit outlook. We'll also see some impact from PPP. But as I mentioned earlier
on the call that we had about $50 million in fee income coming through from the PPP loan balances for
forgiveness and other fee recognition. We would expect to see that decline as well. And so we'd see some
modest decline on the NIM from the core impact of lower rates in the PPP program, but should not see the
same pressure for liquidity going forward.

And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Don, can you talk a little bit about credit quality in the sense that in the net charge-off number that was
about 9 basis points, were there any material recoveries that help drive that number down? And then
second, when you show your data on Slide 21, it's obviously very strong and even stronger than first
quarter of '20 when the day 1 -- while the day 1 reserves were obviously established at the beginning at

'20. But with the outlook for the economy arguably being stronger today than it was on the day 1 number,
what's the likelihood that your reserves today, which I think, what, 160-some-odd basis points versus
what they were in the day 1, I think, at 122 basis points of your reserve levels to loans coming down
closer to the day 1 or maybe even surpassing that number?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Good question, Gerard. I would say as far as the recoveries, we did have recoveries of about $20 million
that were unusual. And even adjusting for that, our net charge-offs would have been 17 basis points for
the quarter. So still very low absent that one recovery.

If you look at the CECL reserves that we have, that I think your math is pretty close to where we
would see it as well is that while the economic outlook is probably stronger on a relative basis as far as
improvements from here, I would say that if you look at the underlying nature of the portfolio, we still
have a little bit higher level of criticized classified loans today than what we did as of January 1 of last
year. And so it would suggest that we should have a higher level of reserve.

That being said, we've continued to increase our qualitative component to the reserve. And so if you
look at the qualitative component along with certain model overlays, it's about 25% of the total reserve.
So it's higher than what we would have expected in a CECL world to deploy. And it's just given some
of the uncertainty as to how things will continue to evolve from here, and could allow the opportunity
to see some further reserve releases. Now I don't want to set the expectation that we're going to have
another $220 million negative provision expense or reserve recapture in the near quarter -- near-term
quarters, but we do expect to see that reserve level probably continue to trend down from here to reflect
the current status of our loan quality and the economic outlook that we're seeing in front of us.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Very good. And then maybe, Chris, you guys talked about the strength that you saw in the quarter in
investment banking. And you also pointed to that as a result of that, the production-related incentive
expenses were higher and you guided a little higher for the remainder of the year. Can you frame out for
us, because we've heard this from a few of your peers about the production-related incentives as "being
a good expense," what's the relationship for the dollar of revenue that this expense represents? For every
dollar of this expense, that you get an incremental $1.5 of revenue. Is there any way of framing that out
for us?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And it's -- first of all, it's a great question, and it's one we look at all the time. Clearly, that business
does have operating leverage. You can think about half of -- about $0.50 on the dollar falling to the
bottom line just as a rule of thumb. It obviously depends if they're M&A revenues, if they're financing
revenues, it's fairly complex. The other thing that is in there, Gerard, that is part of the equation is we
continue to invest heavily in new bankers. And typically, new bankers, you have to pay a little bit of money
upfront. And we always think it takes about 18 months on our very intricate platform to be really, really
productive. So part of what you're seeing is a lag that's part of the hiring that we've done around in the
business as well.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just a follow-up on the pipeline on the Laurel Road side. Now how fast do you expect the new digital bank
to be able to -- to be able to ramp up? And how quickly could we see that layer into the production levels
as you go forward?

KEYCORP FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2021

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, Ken. Well, thanks for the question. Just to give you kind of a starting point, right now, the nice
thing about that business is we already have a fair amount of critical mass. We've got about 46,000, we
call it members -- customers. And we have -- since Legal Day 1, we've funded about $5.3 million -- $5.3
billion. I think what you'll see and what we're going to do as we go forward is to lay out sort of the path
for growth for Laurel Road. But what you'll see is we'll continue to capture a lot of clients, and we will see
it being a material contributor to key as we go forward.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And any updates in terms of the types of yields that you're seeing now in that marketplace? And does the
new business look any different than that in terms of what you can get on those loans?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

I would say that when we look at the new originations, we're looking for something with a spread
compared to the cost of funds that we assigned to about 240 basis points, which is up from when we
originally started at about 220 a couple of years ago. So pricing has held up well, and it's something that
we'll continue to manage going forward.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And last follow-up. Don, any update in terms of like the pacing of the indirect portfolio runoff? And
how quickly you expect that to dissipate?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes, we've got a little over $3.5 billion left of that. And I would say that it runs off somewhere close to
$400 million to $500 million a quarter would be a general range.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.

Sun Young Lee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

This is Janet Lee on for Steve. First of all, I would like to make sure that I understand your NIM outlook
correctly. I understand that there are many pieces and factors that come into play here. But are you
saying that the net interest margin looking out into the back half of 2021 may see some pressure,
assuming you deploy around $1 billion to $2 billion of cash into securities or assuming liquidity level stays
sort of the same at $20 billion? And also, should we expect loan and securities sales to grind down from
here?

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

Yes. A couple of things. One, what we've said is that most of the pressure we've seen in NIM has been
because of liquidity and our outlook for the rest of the year would have liquidity levels, in other words, the
cash position remaining relatively stable from here. And so we shouldn't see that kind of pressure as far as
overall impact from liquidity. I would say that the impact of rates, and we've shown on the current slide,
other than liquidity, we had about 2 basis points of margin compression this quarter, and that was mainly
because of lower rates. And then another component that will impact us is the PPP forgiveness, which had
elevated levels here in the second quarter, and would expect to see that come down in future quarters.

KEYCORP FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 20, 2021

As far as the impact for both security purchases and also for fixed rate loans that an example would be
in the second quarter, we had about $2.2 billion of runoff, and it had an average rate on that of 2.26 and
the average purchase yield for the same $2.2 billion we bought during the quarter was 1.4. So about 80
basis points of compression on that specific asset class. We would also expect to see fixed rate loans,
which isn't as large for us as it probably is for other peers have somewhere in that 60 to 80 basis points of
compression there as well for the rollover of those assets as well.

Sun Young Lee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's very helpful. On Laurel Road for Doctors, you commented about $5.3 billion of loans from there.
As it relates to 2Q growth, can you comment on how much of the $400 million in Laurel Road originations
volumes came from Laurel Road for Doctors? And how much deposit growth did it contribute in the second
quarter?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

I don't have the deposit numbers in front of me. I know that half of our new customers, which we said
were 2,500 were multiple product customers. But you should assume that the $400 million that we
originated in the second quarter relates to Laurel Road for Doctors.

Sun Young Lee
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And just last follow-up. On commercial mortgage servicing fees, can you talk about what led to a
fairly significant jump in the second quarter and whether this level is sustainable?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So that's a really interesting business for us, Janet. We are servicing -- and these are loans that are
[indiscernible] loans. We're servicing $500 billion worth of loans. $330 billion were the primary servicer. So
think about real estate, principal interest, taxes, insurance. The other $170 billion were the named special
servicer. So when things go into workout, we're basically the workout agent. And as you can imagine, at
this point in the cycle, there's a lot of activity. You might find it interesting that the percentage of things
that are in active special servicing, 72% of that, which is an active special servicing is in the retail sector
and another 13% is in lodging. So it's an episodic business. It's not a business that you can count on kind
of a straight line. But you can imagine at this point in the cycle, particularly in areas like retail, that there's
going to continue to be a fair amount of activity.

Donald R. Kimble
CFO & Chief Administrative Officer

And just to follow up on that, too. As far as the linked quarter, that truly was activity-related fees that
drove the change. And if you look at the year ago for that line item, we did have some impairments that
came through that category. And so the second quarter of 2020 was artificially low.

Operator

And our next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Chris, in your opening comments, you mentioned record levels of new accounts or new customers. I was
just wondering if you could elaborate on that. Is it on the commercial consumer side or just across the
firm? And then which specific products are kind of drivers there? Is that lines and deposits? Or just a little
color on it because it was a pretty interesting stat.

Chairman, President & CEO

Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. The comment I was making pertained to new households. And what I
said is that we generated more new households in the first half of this year than we have in any complete
year in the last -- in the last decade. So it was really focused exclusively on consumer and specifically new
household growth.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And is that being mostly driven by deposit accounts or also some acceleration because of Laurel Road and
everything? Or maybe just a little bit on the product mix there?

Christopher Marrott Gorman
Chairman, President & CEO

Most of it. We focus a lot on primacy. So the preponderance of it is on capture of checking accounts.

And at this time, we have no further questions.
