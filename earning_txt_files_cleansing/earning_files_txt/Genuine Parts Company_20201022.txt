Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
We appreciate you joining us today and hope you are staying safe and well. During the quarter, we remain
focused on our top priorities, which include ensuring the continued health and safety of our employees,
customers, suppliers and communities in which we operate. Execution of our strategic initiatives and
cost actions for our global automotive and industrial segments to deliver customer value, operational
efficiencies and strong financial results. Management of our working capital to drive strong free cash flow
and pay down debt to further strengthen our financial position and enhanced liquidity. Effective capital
deployment, including strategic reinvestments in the business, paying a consistent system dividend to our
shareholders and the repayment of debt as appropriate. And finally, we also advanced our ESG initiatives
with the release of our 2020 corporate sustainability report.

Carol and I look forward to covering our progress in each of these areas today and then taking your
questions. Our teams continue to execute with agility through the third quarter, aggressively managing
each of our operations through the challenges of COVID-19. We are proud of their hard work and
commitment to operational excellence, which has required effective measures to maintain a safe work
environment while also providing first-class customer service. Through the quarter, we engaged with our
teams at every level and resumed field visits to connect with our employees, customers and suppliers.

We can tell you firsthand that through the adaptability and successful execution of our passionate and
talented associates, we are fully operational and prepared with comprehensive readiness plans should
a second wave begin to materially affect our businesses. So a big thank you to our 50,000-plus team
members across our global footprint.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Upon the divestiture of our Business Products Group in June, we entered the third quarter focused on
driving profitable growth and productivity initiatives for our streamlined portfolio of our automotive and
industrial business segment. As you may recall, exiting non-core operations is one of several key steps
in the transformation of the company. In addition, we are also investing in higher-return businesses to
further expand and strengthen our core.

Moving on to our financial results. We achieved a strong financial performance in the third quarter that
reflects the resiliency of our businesses and the benefits of our strategic growth initiatives and cost actions
taken across our operations. Total sales for the third quarter were $4.4 billion, up 1%, excluding the
impact of divestitures. This was a significant improvement from the 10% sales decline in the second
quarter due to the impact of COVID-19.

Total operating margin was 9%, a 100 basis point improvement from last year, achieved through solid
progress in both gross margin and SG&A, driving margin expansion in each of our automotive and
industrial businesses. Adjusted net income was $237 million and adjusted earnings per share was $1.63,
up 17%. Our cost savings plan announced in October of 2019 has generated significant savings across the
organization in 2020. Through the first 9 months, we have already achieved our $100 million cost savings
target for the full year.

In addition, cost actions and response to COVID-19 further boosted our operating results. Looking ahead,
we remain focused on finding additional cost savings to further improve our cost structure and long-term
profitability.

Let me mention one example of the many initiatives to improve our operational efficiencies and customer
service levels. We were excited to open our newest U.S. automotive distribution center in Nashville,
Tennessee, just last month. Nashville is a 325,000 square foot distribution center equipped with systems
and efficiencies to enable high productivity and the service of over 300-plus NAPA stores. By bringing
this facility online, we'll be able to close or consolidate smaller, less productive DCs in the NAPA network.
The opening of Nashville and consolidation of these operations has gone smoothly despite the impact of
COVID-19.

We would like to thank our operations team for their great work on this important project. We will continue
to make additional supply chain investments in the years to come. We also improved our working capital,
enhanced our liquidity while generating another quarter of substantial cash flows.

Turning to our business segments. Automotive represented 68% of total sales in the third quarter, and
industrial was 32% of total sales. By geography, 76% of revenues are attributable to North America, with
14% to Europe and 10% to Australasia. Total sales for the global automotive group were $3 billion, a 6%
increase from last year and improved sequentially from the 10% decrease in the second quarter. Comp
sales also turned positive, up 2.2% compared to a 12.6% decrease in Q2. A solid automotive recovery on
the top line with a consistent growth pattern in each month through the quarter helped us deliver a 100
basis point improvement in operating margin.

In North America, our U.S. automotive sales were down approximately 1%, which has significantly
improved from the 12% decrease in the second quarter. Comp sales were down 2.8% and much improved
from the 13.8% decrease in Q2. In addition, we were encouraged by an impressive 60 basis point increase
in operating margin for U.S. automotive.

In Canada, sales for the third quarter were up 2.6% and improved from a 13% decrease in Q2. Comp
sales increased by 0.5% and operating margin was up a strong 200 basis points. So a solid quarter for
our Canadian team. Also in North America, sales to our retail customers continue to outperform, up low
double digits for the third quarter. While retail sales peaked in July, this customer segment remained solid
through the quarter as the persistence of COVID continued to drive outsized DIY growth, although we
believe this surge in demand is gradually moderating. We continue to strengthen our retail positioning
through ongoing initiatives such as store refreshes, NAPA Rewards programs, targeted promotions and
enhanced merchandising and inventories.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

In addition, our growing omnichannel capabilities, including the recent addition of 35,000 new SKUs
and direct-to-customer shipping from select suppliers, continue to drive exceptional value for the retail
customer. This has led to online retail sales at double our 2019 volume. And we expect continued strong
omnichannel growth at NAPA in the fourth quarter and beyond.

Moving on to our DIFM business. Sales to commercial accounts were down low single digits in the third
quarter, which is much improved from last quarter and an encouraging indicator that consumers are
becoming more mobile and getting back out on the road. As miles driven continued their slow recovery,
sales trends across each of our customer channels strengthened relative to Q2, with our independent
unaffiliated professional repair accounts leading the way and posting positive sales growth.

Looking forward, we expect this customer segment as well as our fleet and government accounts, national
accounts and NAPA AutoCare centers to strengthen further in the months ahead. Among these customers,
our fleet and government segment remains the most pressured as many of these operations are running
at less than capacity due to slower business conditions and/or budgetary constraints. This is especially
true for our customers in the energy and airline industries, which have been significantly impacted by the
pandemic.

To counter these and other commercial headwinds, our teams are executing on a number of recovery
plans designed to optimize NAPA's customer value proposition, sell more parts and gain market share.
These plans focus on maximizing the effectiveness of our new sales structure, improvements to key
programs such as NAPA AutoCare, enhanced systems and digital capabilities as well as strategic pricing
initiatives and improved inventory availability. While our teams made significant progress in the quarter,
we expect our focus in these areas and favorable fundamentals to drive meaningful results in the period
ahead. Those favorable fundamentals include the growing number of vehicles in the 6- to 12-year
aftermarket sweet spot and the recent spike in used car sales, low gas prices and continued improvement
in miles driven.

In Europe, aftermarket sales trends had a strong rebound in the third quarter. And our team did a
tremendous job of capitalizing on that. Total sales were up an impressive 16%, which has improved
from a 3% sales decrease in the second quarter, and comp sales were up a strong 12% compared to
last quarter's mid-teen decline. Importantly, this quarter's sales growth, combined with our ongoing cost
savings initiatives, drove 140 basis point margin improvement, marking a significant step forward for this
group.

In breaking down our overall European performance, we are very pleased that operations in each country
recovered with positive sales comps, driven by the broad surge in demand for deferred maintenance
and repairs. In addition, the powerful NAPA brand has proven to be an effective growth driver. We have
introduced the NAPA brand in the U.K. and France and plan to roll it out in Germany this month. We
posted our strongest European sales in the U.K. this past quarter, and NAPA-branded products have grown
to represent a low double-digit percentage of total sales in less than 1 year.

As a reminder, we identified the opportunity for private brands in Europe at the time of our initial
discussions to acquire AAG back in 2017. We are encouraged by the quick acceptance of the NAPA brand
and excited for its growth potential. Likewise, our focus on driving growth with key existing and new
accounts, including the larger national account customers, also contributed to our recovery. So again, just
a fantastic job by the team in Europe on both the top and bottom line.

Turning now to our automotive operations in Australia and New Zealand, this team reported another
quarter of exceptional results, with total sales increasing 16% and comp sales up strong at plus 15%. This
follows a 4% total sales increase and a 2% core sales increase in the second quarter. Our strong sales
for the quarter reflect a robust sales environment for both the commercial and retail customer segments
in the Australasian region, and our team is well positioned with a 60% commercial and 40% DIY sales
mix. We are encouraged by the current sales climate despite ongoing headwinds due to COVID-related
restrictions in select key markets, such as Melbourne and the State of Victoria. To drive this growth,
our team in Australasia is executing on several growth initiatives. These include the continued rollout of
the NAPA brand and new NAPA store openings, digital enhancements across the B2C and B2B platform,

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

strategic pricing and targeted marketing. These and other initiatives as well as the ongoing cost actions
across our operations generated a strong 180 basis point improvement in operating margin for the quarter.

So in summary, we are pleased with the recovery in the aftermarket and our automotive performance
across North America, Europe and Australasia.

So now let's turn to our results for the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.4
billion, down 8.7%, excluding the EIS divestiture. Comp sales were down 9.2%, a significant improvement
from the comp sales decline of 16.7% in the second quarter. These sales results as well as our ongoing
focus to drive meaningful cost savings and optimizing our distribution network drove an 80 basis point
improvement in net operating margin for the quarter.

In North America, our total sales were down 9.7% as compared to a 16.7% decrease in Q2. We saw
strengthening trends in industrial indicators over the last several months and an improving sales cadence
in each month of the quarter. Specifically, the ISM, PMI, industrial production and capacity utilization, have
all pointed to increasing industrial activity since we last reported, and we expect these trends to continue
in the months ahead. We would also add that as customers reopen their plant, we will capitalize on more
on-site sales opportunities. We are also beginning to see an increase in CapEx orders among many of our
customers, many of which were deferred through the crisis. So we see a number of positive signs for the
industry ahead.

Throughout the pandemic, our team has been executing on our growth strategy to further bolster Motion's
leading competitive position in the MRO industry. We are focused on initiatives to expand our industrial
services and solutions capabilities, enhance our pricing and category management strategy and optimize
the effectiveness of our Motion Industries website, which we relaunched just last quarter. Each of these
initiatives has added value for the company and our customers.

For the quarter, our automation solutions group was our strongest operation, posting high single-digit
growth. We are building out this operation to further support the growing megatrend of plant automation
and robotics at our customers. In contrast, the Southwest region of the U.S. was our weakest due to the
significant impact of COVID on the oil and gas sector in that area of the country.

We were also pleased to complete 3 strategic bolt-on acquisitions in North America during the quarter.
Two of these businesses specialize in motion control and automation products and services, including
engineering and application expertise and aluminum extrusion, which complement our growing MI
automation solutions group. Our third acquisition expands our hydraulics business at Motion Canada.
Combined, these operations further expand our presence in strategic geographies and overall products
and service offerings and are expected to contribute approximately $35 million to $40 million in annual
revenues.

So to summarize our North American industrial performance, we were encouraged by the gradual
improvement in sales trends throughout the quarter. Our team also operated well and was very disciplined
in applying their cost control measures, which we believe bodes well for continued progress in the months
ahead as the industrial economy strengthens further.

Turning to Australasia. July 1 marked the anniversary of our MI Asia Pac acquisition. And this team
delivered a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter. While we continue to benefit from the strength
of the local mining industry, we are also executing on our new branding strategy and other growth
initiatives to drive sales and gain market share. In addition, the MI Asia Pac team is operating well and
making excellent progress on key cost reduction and working cap initiatives.

Another focus area for GPC has been the advancement of our ESG initiatives. To account for our progress
in this important area, we issued our first sustainability report back in 2018, and followed that up with a
summary update in 2019. On September 30, we were pleased to issue our 2020 sustainability report. This
year's report substantially expands our disclosure across the ESG spectrum, such as human capital and
diversity and inclusion, among others.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

In developing our disclosure, we engaged with our top shareholders to ensure our pathway to ESG best
practices aligned with the expectations of these key stakeholders. We invite you to visit our GPC website
to view this report and learn more about our company-wide commitment to ESG.

As we move forward through the balance of 2020 and into 2021, our teams will execute on a number of
strategic initiatives to build on the positive momentum of the third quarter. These plans and initiatives
are grounded in a strategic growth framework focused on maximizing the value of our automotive
and industrial business segments and positioning GPC for sustained long-term growth and improved
profitability. Key elements of the framework include: Capturing more wallet share with existing customers
and acquiring new customers; introducing new products and services, while innovating our omnichannel
strategy and expanding digital offerings; building a global branding strategy to further leverage our
powerful NAPA and MI brands, which we have initiated via the rollout of the NAPA brand into Europe and
Australasia; and the rebranding of our Inenco industrial business to MI Asia Pac; expanding our global
geographic footprint, including acquiring strategic bolt-on businesses.

And finally, our strategic framework includes ongoing transformation initiatives to achieve operational
excellence, as exemplified by our cost actions and other initiatives.

So now I'll turn it over to Carol for a deeper review of our financials. Carol?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you, Paul. As a reminder, our comments this morning will focus on adjusted results from continuing
operations, which excludes transaction, restructuring and other costs and income.

Total GPC sales were $4.4 billion in the third quarter, down 3.4% from 2019, or up 1% excluding
divestitures, which is much improved from the 10% decline in the second quarter. We're also pleased
to report our 12th consecutive increase in quarterly gross margin, which improved to 35% compared
to 33.4% in the third quarter last year. The 160 basis point improvement primarily reflects the benefit
of sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix, especially in industrial. The
broad improvement was driven by our focus on strategic category management initiatives in areas such as
pricing and global sourcing.

The divestiture of EIS last September 30 was also accretive to gross margin performance. These items
were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. The pricing
environment has remained stable thus far in 2020 with limited supplier price increases and very little
inflation in our third quarter sales. Based on the current pricing environment, we expect only minor price
inflation through the balance of the year.

Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the third quarter, down 1.7% from last
year and representing 26.1% of sales compared to 25.6% last year on an adjusted basis. The decrease in
operating expenses reflects the favorable impact of both our permanent and COVID-related cost actions
implemented thus far in 2020, as previously mentioned by Paul.

In accordance with our $100 million cost savings plan announced late in 2019, we're pleased to report
that we have successfully achieved the $100 million annual target well ahead of schedule. With more than
$40 million in savings recognized in the third quarter, our permanent expense reductions will -- totals over
$110 million for the 9 months. In addition, our teams have continued to execute on a number of additional
savings initiatives in response to COVID-19. These initiatives contributed approximately $60 million in
incremental savings in the third quarter.

So combined, we generated approximately $100 million in cost savings during the third quarter, driven by
strategic reductions in payroll and facility costs as well as more temporary savings from furloughs, reduced
travel and entertainment, freight changes and other initiatives in response to COVID.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue to execute on our cost actions, and we currently
expect to achieve $130 million to $140 million in permanent cost savings for 2020, which will carry over

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

into 2021. We also expect to generate further savings related to COVID-19, but have less clarity here as
these cost savings will moderate as the economic recovery continues and sales volumes increase.

Despite the continued uncertainty, we entered the fourth quarter focused on driving growth and
aggressively managing our expenses to maximize profitability. Our total operating and nonoperating
expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the third quarter, reflecting a decrease of 1.5% from last year
and comprising 27.9% of sales. Our total segment profit in the third quarter was $392 million, up 9% on
a 3% sales decrease. Excluding divestitures, total segment profit increased 13% on a 1% sales increase,
and our segment profit margin was 9.0%, a strong increase of 100 basis points.

Our tax rate for the third quarter was 23.4% on an adjusted basis, down from 24.9% in the prior year
period, due primarily to the benefit of statute-related adjustments. Our net income from continuing
operations in the third quarter was $233 million, with earnings per share of $1.61. Our adjusted net
income was $237 million or $1.63 per share, which compares to $204 million and $1.39 per share in 2019
for a 17% increase.

So now let's discuss our third quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter
was $3 billion, up 6% from the prior year and sequentially improved from the 10% sales decline last
quarter. Our segment profit of $266 million was up 20%, with a profit margin of 9.0% compared to 8.0%
in the third quarter of 2019. The 100 basis point increase in margin was driven by improved operating
results across each of our automotive businesses, which was a great job by our teams and a testament to
their continued focus on meaningful cost reductions across our operations.

Our industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, an 18.6% decrease from a year ago. Excluding the
EIS divestiture, industrial sales were down approximately 9%, which is a significant improvement from
the second quarter. Our segment profit of $126 million was down 8% from a year ago or up slightly
excluding EIS, and the profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.9%. The improved margin for industrial
reflects gains in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses, which was driven by
the combination of gross margin expansion and cost savings. We expect to see continued progress in the
quarters ahead as the sales environment further recovers. While these sales trends and operating results
are encouraging and reflect a recovery from the lows of the second quarter, we continue to operate in an
environment of significant uncertainty and cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the
coming months. As a result, we believe it's prudent to not reestablish formal financial guidance at this
time.

So now let's turn to our comments on the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $2.0 billion were
down 22% from the prior year, due primarily to the change in sales and the benefit of an agreement to sell
$500 million of receivables to a financial institution earlier this year. We remain pleased with the quality
of our receivables and confident about our collection trends, although we continue to closely monitor
receivables in light of the current business conditions.

Inventory at September 30 was $3.4 billion, up 2% from September of last year, or essentially flat
excluding the impact of foreign currency. This is a function of lower purchasing volumes and our continued
focus on effective inventory management. Accounts payable of $4.0 billion is up 1% from last year and
a reflection of the change in inventory and the impact of lower purchasing volumes. At the end of our
quarter, the AP to inventory ratio was 118%, which has improved from 112% at June 30. Our total debt of
$2.9 billion is down 15% from $3.4 billion last year and down 10% from the second quarter.

During the third quarter, we further strengthened our liquidity position and we entered October with
approximately $2.8 billion in available liquidity, which has improved from our $2.6 billion liquidity at June
30 and $1.1 billion in liquidity at March 31. For the first 9 months of 2020, we generated $1.4 billion in
cash from operations, which is up significantly from 2019. This led to strong free cash flows of over $1.3
billion.

As a reminder, we modified our near-term capital deployment strategy back in early April to preserve our
cash through the duration of COVID-19. However, we remain committed to several key priorities for cash
to serve to maximize shareholder value. These priorities are evident in our improved debt leverage of 2.2x
our total debt to adjusted EBITDA, which compares to 2.5x at the end of the second quarter and the $4.3

billion in capital deployed across our 4 key areas in the last 3 years. These include reinvestments in our
businesses via capital expenditures, M&A growth, net of divestitures, share repurchases and the dividend.

For 2020, we reduced our initial $300 million in planned capital expenditures to approximately $150
million to $200 million, and we have suspended plans for share repurchases through December 31. While
we've also pulled back on acquisition activity, we've made several strategic bolt-on acquisitions this
quarter, as Paul mentioned earlier, and we continue to plan for additional M&A that aligns with our growth
strategies for the automotive and industrial businesses. And finally, we continue to support the dividend,
which has increased for 64 consecutive years.

So that's our financial update for the third quarter. We've made significant progress in several key areas
and we want to thank our teams for their great work and many accomplishments under these tough
circumstances. I'll now turn it back over to Paul.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Carol. Through the continued focus on our top priorities outlined at the beginning of this
call, we were pleased to report a strong financial performance for the quarter. Our results highlight our
progress in several key areas, including strengthening sales trends, continued gross margin expansion,
transformative cost actions and significant cost savings, operating margin expansion in each of our
businesses and a stronger balance sheet, enhanced liquidity and substantial cash flows. We are excited for
the future at GPC, and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the quarters ahead. We thank you
for your interest in GPC. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

When you think about the cadence of the quarter, I guess, NAPA U.S. specifically, but also maybe Europe
as well as we came out of the COVID lockdowns. Could you talk about sort of how businesses either picked
up with mobility improving or it maybe even softened as stimulus money was spent? And then, I guess,
within Europe, talk specifically about the strength you've seen there. Obviously, not as much consumer
stimulus in that economy, yet, seeming to outperform. Could you maybe give us some color as to, was
that share gain that's driving your significant comp? Or is just a underlying lift in service demand?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bret. And let's start with the cadence first, and maybe I'll touch on total company. In total
company, we were steady throughout the quarter, turning positive. We're pretty much flat in July, August,
turned positive in September, total GPC. As we look at automotive, again, total automotive, we were
consistent throughout the quarter, mid-single-digit all in July, August and September.

Europe, we were really strong in August, but we were double-digit growth in every month in the quarter.
And as we look at our turnaround in Europe, I couldn't be more proud of that team over there, Bret. They
-- I mean, you guys know what we went through in Q2. Most of France was shut down. A good bit of
the U.K. was shut down. And for us to post that kind of increase that we did in Q3 is strong. And we're
seeing it across the board. We're seeing it in every market, which is what's really got us encouraged. And
we're seeing it across our customer base. So we saw it in our small independent unaffiliated shops, but we
also saw solid increase with the big national major accounts. So do I think we're taking market share in
Europe? Perhaps. But I guess we'll have to watch that play out.

I'd also tell you, Bret, we're really excited about the rollout of our NAPA private label. And I think that
really bolstered our sales in the U.K. this quarter. We're up to 10 different product categories now in the
U.K., and we're rolling that out in France, and then we'll go into Germany and the Netherlands as well.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Do you want to talk about the margin lift from private label?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. The margin on the private label, Bret, as you know, for our private label, we do generally have a more
favorable margin when you look at the all-in and consider the terms that we get and the global tenders
that we're doing. But generally, we do have a little bit lower price in Europe on that private label. So it
would be neutral in total to Europe on their gross margin. But the fact is we're more dollars, and we're
expanding our market share. And again, when we look at global tenders, there is a GPC benefit, if you will,
when you think about global extended terms and putting more volume through our global suppliers.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

And Bret, as I called out in my prepared comments, when we first started talking to the AAG team a
few years back, we saw a real opportunity to introduce private brands into our European markets. And
it's played out, honestly, exactly as we had hoped and thought it would. And I'll tell you, what I'm most
encouraged by is the acceptance and the -- I guess, the recognition of the NAPA brand in Europe.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

All right. And I guess a quick follow-up. Could you talk about any regional performance highlights in the
U.S.? And then, Carol, you talked about inflation moderating. Do you see anything going on in pricing?
And I guess, maybe more on the DIY side, I think there were some comments coming out of Zone that
they and Walmart have become a bit more competitive. Do you see any pricing changes in the market in
general?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Look, pricing has been really rational and specific to automotive. We cannot say we've seen much in
the way of changes, whether it's do it for me or DIY, we've had very minimal price increases through the
third quarter, 0.1% in automotive, and we really don't expect much at the end of the year. But again, no
supplier price increases and a pretty rational pricing environment.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

And Bret, as far as the -- your question around regionality, and I'm assuming you're talking about the
U.S., much like we saw in the previous quarter, our strongest markets continue to be the Midwest and the
mountain. And those 2 guys are really continuing to do a good job for us, both delivering positive numbers
in Q3. Where we're seeing a bit of stress, and again, not surprising, the Northeast was down mid-single-
digit in the quarter. But I'd point out, Bret, that if you go back to Q2, our northeastern business, we were
down 19% in Q2. We've gone from down 19% to roughly down 4% and change in Q3. Mid-Atlantic, similar
story, high double-digit decrease in Q2 to down mid-single digits in Q3. So still a bit stressed in those
markets. But what we're encouraged by is just really strong sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And it sounded like Europe, U.K. might be the strongest market, with France #2.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

That is correct, absolutely.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.

Beth Reed Pricoli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

This is Beth Reed on for Scott. Just wondering if you guys could help us better understand the cadence
of the recovery in auto. I believe July trends were running about 6%. And first, I just wanted to -- if
you could clarify if that's sales or comp? I think it was sales, but if you could just clarify. And at that
time, where were U.S. comps trending? And then lastly, on the U.S. side, did you see trends improve
sequentially throughout each month? Any color on cadence you could give around those metrics would be
great.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we'll double team this one, Beth. But the first response, I think you asked -- and I'm trying to
recount your questions. I think the first one around was the 6% that was mentioned back in Q2, was that
comp or total? That was total, not comp, okay? So did that answer that question?

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Okay. And then as we look at our automotive business in the quarter, it -- again, as I mentioned, our total
automotive business was consistent throughout -- was consistent throughout the quarter, mid-single digit,
and U.S. automotive followed a similar pattern, and it was pretty consistent throughout the quarter.

Beth Reed Pricoli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. So the U.S. auto comps were down low to mid -- low single digits each month?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Correct.

Beth Reed Pricoli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just 1 on the industrial side...

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Beth, I would just add to that, that improved in the month of September.

Beth Reed Pricoli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful.

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

But Beth, July, and you did say it, July was flattish. There was -- and again, August, September weren't
quite as much as what July was. But in total, it was -- that's our total number.

Beth Reed Pricoli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. Okay. On the industrial side, with the negative trends continuing and, as you guys mentioned,
some of the indices are starting to improve, how should we think about trends in that segment as we look
over the next few quarters?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So just a little bit of history on Motion. Because we've seen the cyclical times before in the industrial
business, we generally lag the industrial indicators. So again, that's consistent with what we're seeing
again in these recent quarters. What we are encouraged by, Beth, is we saw sequential improvement
throughout the quarter. So September was the strongest month of Q3. And we do believe that as the
economy continues to improve, we'll close that gap between our numbers and then what the industrial
indicators are showing. So our -- the takeaway should be, we anticipate improved demand in the coming
months. We're seeing really strong results out of our wood and lumber segments of our business. Pulp and
paper are good. That's -- a lot of that is directly tied to the building industry, which is strong. So we have
no doubt Motion will recover, and we'll be in good shape in the quarters ahead.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions there. First, on the Motion side, you talked about
September being the strongest month. Obviously, down 9% comps for the quarter. I guess how close
are you to getting to positive there? And then could you also size up maybe the exposure to the weaker
industries like energy and travel?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, the energy comment, Chris, that's definitely a headwind for us. If you look at our southwest
part of the United States was our -- was certainly our weakest market in the country, and that is largely
driven by oil and gas. So that's a definite headwind for us going forward. And in terms of looking out,
Chris, it's -- look, it's challenging. I mean it's -- there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets. There's no
doubt. Our expectation is our Motion business will turn positive in '21. But I would also tell you, our
expectation is that we're going to continue to show sequential improvement, just as we did from Q2 to Q3.
We think Q4 will be an improvement over Q3, and then, again, turning positive in '21.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So would that mean that like Motion in September was more down like mid- to high single-digit versus the
high single digits decline in September?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

That is correct.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. And then in terms of -- just to clarify on the U.S. cadence, in particular, did -- it
seems like DIY slowed and do it for me got better. And -- but that was sort of roughly neutral over the
3 months. Is that right? Because you also mentioned that September got better. So I was just trying to
reconcile all that. How do you put that all together?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So my reference on September, Chris, was in relation to August. September was a better month than
what we saw in August. We saw softness in August. And September did improve. Carol mentioned, we
were flattish in July, and we dipped a bit in September. But again, we're talking just a few basis points
from month to month to month. So not a massive shift. And I'm sorry, I missed -- I forgot the second part
of your question, Chris.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So the second part was really like -- it seems like the mix -- the bag in there is like DIY slowing down. One
of your competitors talked about a drop-off in August and into September on DIY. So I guess, maybe, is
that what drove sort of the keeping the relative trend flat over the quarter? And then any comment on
did -- and this is U.S., both questions, did do it for me, how close are we to positive in September and
commercial?

Paul D. Donahue

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Yes. So our DIY business, and you hit it, Chris. I mean we had a huge July in DIY. And I mean, we're up, I
think, close to 20% in July, and it moderated a bit through Q3. But I mean, I don't think anybody expects
the kind of DIY increases that we're seeing across the industry to continue. Certainly, we benefited, as did
all of our peer group, from the stimulus money that hit the market. Our DIFM business was pretty steady
throughout the quarter in that low single-digit range. And again, I would point out, Chris, just as I did with
some of the regionality, as I did with Motion, those down low single digits, those numbers are improved
from the high single-digit declines that we were seeing back in May and June.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. But not -- right. Okay. So -- but -- so U.S. do it for me was pretty consistent in that down low
single-digit range.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. Yes.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Sorry to belabor that. And then in terms of maybe on the margin side, really, a 2-part question.
So first, on the gross margin. EIS actually helped you. Can you talk about how much that was? But
then vendor allowances also hurt you. So at the high level, how much -- how are you thinking about the
potential to continue to drive expanded gross margins going forward? And then I have a follow-up on
SG&A.

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Sure. On the gross margin for the quarter, when you look at our quarterly improvement, I would say, this
quarter, about 1/3 of that was related to the divestitures. So 2/3 of our gross margin improvement, like
100 bps is really related to sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations, specifically our international
strong results on automotive, product mix shift, especially in industrial, and then some of our just pricing
and global sourcing initiatives. So when we look ahead, we do expect to have continued gross margin
improvement with a lot of our initiatives. It may not be quite at the pace that we've seen, but we are very
encouraged by the gross margin initiatives we have. We've done all that, as you mentioned, with lower
volumes. And we have been able to generally offset the lower volume incentives with our lower sales
volumes with having our initiatives. So we've anniversaried the EIS divestiture. So going forward, it will
just be the core gross margin improvement.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then on the SG&A side, Carol. I guess, how are you -- I know you've taken a lot of cost out of
the business, how are you thinking about the potential to add -- have to add back that COVID expense in
2021 from a dollars perspective?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. So on the SG&A side, what we're really encouraged by is the $100 million permanent cost savings
that roughly are $110 million through 9 months. We expect to be $130 million to $140 million for the
full year. The COVID savings were $150 million in Q2. And as we mentioned before, about $45 million of
that was government subsidies. That moderated to about $60 million in Q3, which relates directly to the
improved, as Paul's mentioned, improvement in our volumes, extending hours, bringing folks back in, and
we said a lot of those were temporary things. But part of why we have a higher $100 million permanent
savings is we've shifted some of those things to permanent.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

So we are still -- we will still have some COVID savings in Q4. It will be probably less than what it
is in Q3. But I can tell you, all of our business units have additional cost actions as we look ahead.
There are further opportunities we think we'll have, especially as it relates to facilities and productivity
improvements and, again, some further consolidations in some back office areas. So we're still excited
about the work the transformation team is doing as we look ahead.

Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I had a couple of questions. One, I'd love to follow up. Thanks for all the color around U.S. automotive.
Could you just level set us now on the mix of that business between independents, the NAPA AutoCare
group, major accounts and fleet, just given how disparate the performance has been this year?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

So the -- if we look at the business, and as you just described, Greg, our most challenging segment --
and look, I should point out at the outset, our model is different, okay? I think -- and you've been around
long enough, Greg, you know that. Fleet and government is a big segment for us, and that has been our
most challenged segment. And I should point out that in -- mixed in that fleet and government, we have
our oil and gas energy business, we have large contracts with municipalities, school bus contracts. We
have contracts with the airlines, ground equipment. So all of that is in that fleet and government. And as
you can imagine, Greg, that has been a challenging segment and has continued. It will come back, and
we think it will come back and it will come back strong. Our major account business and our AutoCare
business was down slightly in the quarter as well.

Where we saw good growth, and we are encouraged is with our -- what we would really classify as our all
other wholesale business, and that is our independent, unaffiliated garages. That business held up well,
and we are encouraged by those numbers. And we think we can continue to build on that in Q4 and going
forward.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And if we look at the business, are independents and garages, are they now -- are they like half the
business or 30% of the business? Just -- and fleet and governments maybe be down to 20%, would that
be a fair estimate?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So think of it this way, Greg. When we look at our -- at those segments, fleet is -- and I'll give you
round numbers, 20% to 25%. And then you've got the -- that unaffiliated independent garage segment is
probably 40% to 45% of the total. And I'm sorry, Greg, you asked about our independent owners as well.
Can you maybe ask that again, that question?

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. I just want to know, just generally speaking, how the independents are doing. So what percentage of
the mix are they now as opposed to company-owned stores? And how are they doing? I mean, how many
of them got PPP loans? Are they sort of fully back and up to running the way that you'd want to versus
what in the second quarter?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Yes. A great question, Greg, and I'm glad you did ask. The independent owners are -- they represent
roughly 60% of our business. And I'm pleased to say, our guys have been out, we've been out meeting
with some of our big independents really just this week. They're faring well. And I would tell you that in
terms of PPP money, the vast majority, and I'm talking probably close to 90%, got PPP money. So from a
cash position, our independents are doing just fine.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great. And then if I could steal one more question there. You brought up an interesting addition of, I
think, 35,000 SKUs that would be direct from vendor. Could you just help us frame what that could mean
to sales and sort of expanding the business in a more capital effective way? And I also thought I heard
you mentioned some pricing or remerchandising actions to help gain some share back. But I wasn't
[indiscernible] describe those?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Sure. So let's talk about the SKUs that I referenced, the 35,000 SKUs. Think of that, Greg, as kind of
that whole concept around the endless aisle and taking advantage of our great suppliers and their -- the
total extent of their catalog offering. So today, of course, you take a supplier, Greg, and I know you know
Dorman well, a great partner of ours for many, many years, they have a very expansive catalog. We don't
-- we do not -- we don't catalog all the SKUs that Dorman has available, but we're certainly now going
to make those available online and we think that's going to -- it's too early to put a number to it, Greg.
We've really just launched it. But that would be an example. Another example would be the WeatherTech
line. That line, of course, great consumer brand. So we're excited with what we believe that whole kind of
endless aisle can do for the NAPA business, and we're going to continue to expand that opportunity going
forward.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And I hear some pricing -- I heard pricing was rational, but I also thought I heard there were some certain
actions maybe in particular segments?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. So the -- we were talking about rational pricing and really no supplier price increases in automotive.
The actions taking both in our automotive and our industrial business are really buy side, sell-side type
pricing, global sourcing type internal gross margin initiatives. Really, again, there are no drastic changes in
the pricing environment. We've just gotten much more strategic as it relates to both retail and commercial
pricing and our gross margin efforts.

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So these are -- just so I understand, more strategic, meaning that you're lowering prices to the customer
or end up getting more merch margin based on how you're mixing?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

No. I mean, Greg, we've had 12 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement in an environment
with lower sales volumes and no inflation and tariffs. And again, we've got pricing, data analytics. We've
got investments we've made. Again, these, we are getting improved gross margin with these initiatives
and remaining very competitive. So the idea is to grow our sales and grow the business. And again, really
pleased to see the opportunities and the results that we've gotten in the gross margin area.

Our last person for questions comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Raymond James.

Mitchell James Ingles
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

This is Mitch Ingles filling in for Matt. So most of my questions have already been answered. I just had
a quick follow-up on your major accounts group and automotive. Are these accounts mostly back online
today and purchasing at lower volumes? It sounds like the recovery for Europe for these type of accounts
has been relatively solid. Do you expect a similar trend for these accounts in the U.S. in the coming
months? Any color on the recent trends here would be helpful.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Matt, we -- I'm sorry, we do expect that business to bounce back, and it will bounce back as miles
driven bounces back. We -- one thing that hasn't really been talked about this morning, even though
there's a whole lot more traffic in the roads and people are back behind the wheel, which we're happy to
see, miles driven in the last couple of months that I've seen preliminary numbers are still down close to
10%. So as that begins to come back, and it will come back, the major account business and all of the
commercial business will recover. So yes, no doubt, you mentioned our European business, and we are
very pleased with our major account business in the U.K. and some of the strength that we saw certainly
in Q3 in our European business. And we expect -- quite honestly, we expect that to continue well into
2021.
