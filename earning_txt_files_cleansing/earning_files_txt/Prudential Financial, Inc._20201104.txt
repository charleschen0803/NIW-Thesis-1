Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Prudential quarterly earnings call.
[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead.

Darin C. Arita
Senior VP and Head of Investor Relations

Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie
Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; and Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of U.S. businesses; Scott
Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and
Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we
will take your questions.

Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ
materially from the predictions we make today.

In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such
measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-
looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation, which can be found
on our website at investor.prudential.com.

With that, I'll hand it over to Charlie.

Charles Frederick Lowrey
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

To begin, I hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy. As the global health
pandemic continues, we remain intently focused as a company on caring for our employees and the
communities in which we live and work as well as serving the evolving needs of our customers and other
stakeholders in the current environment. We are also incredibly proud and grateful for the continued
dedication and commitment that our employees have shown in fulfilling our company purpose: of making
lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world.

I'd like to highlight a few of the ways in which we're serving the unique and evolving needs of our
customers, who now more than ever are relying on Prudential to address their financial challenges.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, PGIM has focused on providing clients with timely portfolio updates
and asset allocation ideas. Our operational resilience, diversified global business model and strong
performance has allowed us to support our clients.

One example of the success is the growth of our U.S. mutual funds, where we are one of the top-ranked
companies based on net flows this year.

In our U.S. businesses, we continue to pivot within annuities through our FlexGuard buffered annuity
product, which offers downside protection and upside opportunity at a time when customers face new
challenges in protecting and growing their retirement assets. Following its accelerated launch to market in
the second quarter, FlexGuard continues to gain momentum, accounting for 38% of our annuity sales this
quarter.

And in Japan, our Life Planner model with its highly personalized and customized approach to engaging
customers, continues to be resilient, as demonstrated by our strong sales this quarter. During the third

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020, despite the challenging
macroeconomic backdrop, including taking additional steps to expand our cost savings program. We also
continued to benefit from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which places us on sound financial
footing to navigate changes in the current environment.

Turning now to 2020 priorities on Slide 3. On last quarter's call, we mentioned that we were exploring the
potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our 2022 plan. Through the third quarter of this
year, we have realized approximately $135 million of our $500 million cost savings program. Based on
our progress of accelerating the savings realized and creating new ways of working, we now expect to
generate an incremental $250 million in efficiencies by the end of 2023, bringing our total cost savings
program to $750 million.

With respect to rotating the international earnings mix, during the quarter we announced an agreement to
sell Prudential of Taiwan to Taishin Financial Holding, and expect the transaction to close in 2021, subject
to all regulatory approvals. And we also closed on our transaction to divest Prudential of Korea and receive
proceeds of USD 1.6 billion.

And finally, we continue to take additional steps across the company to reduce our exposure to changes in
markets and rates by shifting sales momentum to less interest rate-sensitive solutions, while aggressively
repricing certain existing products. As an example, in annuities we are focusing on our efforts on
delivering protected outcome solutions like our FlexGuard product. And we're discontinuing all sales of our
traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. We will also explore strategic opportunities
for blocks of business, including reinsurance and other transactions.

Turning to Slide 4. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we remain grounded by
our rock-solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $6.1 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to hold capital that exceeds AA financial strength level.
The financial strength gives us the confidence and the flexibility to manage our business for long-term
growth, while navigating the current and future market environment.

We also continue to closely monitor conditions in the credit markets. While they have been developing
better than previously expected, we don't intend to reinstate buybacks this year. We believe this is
prudent as the duration and severity of the pandemic and its effect on the economy remain highly
uncertain. We'll provide more details on our 2021 capital deployment plans once they have been finalized
and approved by the Board.

Turning to Slide 5. I'll now take a moment to highlight our financial results for the third quarter. Pretax
adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And after-tax adjusted earnings per share was
$3.21, which benefited in part from strong variable investment income across our businesses.

Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $873 million due to higher net investment
spread, offset by lower net fee income in our individual annuities business and less favorable underwriting
driven by COVID-19-related net mortality experience. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income
of $370 million, driven by record assets under management of $1.4 trillion and higher other related
revenues. The 11% growth in assets under management reflects strong flows, robust investment
performance and market appreciation. Our international businesses reported adjusted operating income
of $775 million as business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results were partially
offset by lower earnings from joint venture investments and lower net investment spread.

With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance during the third
quarter. Thank you all for your time this morning.

Robert Michael Falzon
Vice Chair

Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an update on how we're executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM
and international businesses, the outlook for these businesses and a brief update on our investment
portfolio.

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

Turning to Slide 6. Our U.S. businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net
investment spread and underwriting income. We made progress in the quarter executing on 3 key
priorities: first, we continued to implement pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business
mix while protecting profitability. For example, we are further pivoting to less interest rate-sensitive
solutions in individual annuities by discontinuing sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed
living benefits, including both our highest daily income and Prudential defined income products. In our
individual life business, we are repricing products to mitigate the impact of low rates, in addition to
suspending sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. As a result of these actions,
we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. In
addition, we continued to adjust crediting rates in our retirement business.

Second, as the needs of our customers change, including in response to COVID and its economic impact,
we're evolving the way we work. We continue to adapt and develop new ways of working effectively in
remote locations and expect to recognize additional cost savings as we expand the use of technology,
optimize our real estate footprint and benefit from a more efficient workforce. As Charlie mentioned, these
and other opportunities to further efficiencies and improve our customer experience have resulted in a
50% increase in our originally planned $500 million earnings improvement target.

And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. For example, we continued to
see strong interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of
business. In preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we accelerated
our agent onboarding and training processes. While we are only 3 weeks into the annual enrollment
period, we are pleased with the customer demand that we're seeing, which is driving considerable sales
growth.

Now turning to Slide 7. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the
strength and resilience of its multi-manager model. PGIM's strong investment performance and diversified
global investment capabilities across public and private asset classes, especially higher-returning and
income-generating strategies across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us
favorably to continue to capture flows amidst industry-wide dislocation. Our assets under management
reached a record level of over $1.4 trillion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strong flows,
robust investment performance as well as market appreciation. PGIM's long-term investment performance
remains strong, with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks. This
strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes,
regions and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated over $7 billion of third-party net
flows during the quarter, including $5.3 billion of retail flows and $2 billion of institutional flows, driven by
a continued appetite for fixed income strategies partially offset the moderating equity outflows. Our public
fixed income platform generated flows of $11.6 billion as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of
strategies and the leading position of our franchise.

And the combination of customer demand, fund performance and investments in product development
and distribution over the past several years has resulted in PGIM investments being ranked the second
highest U.S. mutual fund franchise based on year-to-date net flows. PGIM's asset management fees were
up 11% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management.
In addition, an increase in other related revenues was driven by an increase in co-investment and seed
investment earnings, record-high agency loan production and higher incentive fees.

PGIM's operating margin exceeded 37% for the quarter, aided by the strong other related revenues as
we continue to focus on generating efficiencies to fund growth investments and on delivering margin
increases from operating leverage. While PGIM's operating margin will vary with market conditions, we
expect margins to remain in the 30% range across the cycle.

Turning to Slide 8. Our international business includes our Japanese life insurance operation, where we
have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth
markets. Our sales this quarter demonstrated the strength of our distribution channels and the continuing
customer demand for the protection and retirement products we offer. Our distribution channels are also
employing more virtual tools for non-face-to-face sales and have benefited from the easing of pandemic

6

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

related restrictions. Life Planner sales increased 57% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the
resilience of the Life Planner model, the easing of COVID restrictions in Japan, and higher sales ahead of
U.S. dollar-denominated product repricing in August. Life Planner head count increased 3% compared to a
year ago due to stable recruitment and lower resignations.

Similar to Life Planner, sales across Gibraltar's life consultant, independent agent and bank channels also
increased in total by 30%. We believe a degree of sales were pulled forward into the current quarter
due to repricing actions. And therefore we expect a lower level of sales in the fourth quarter, with sales
returning to more normal levels over time beginning in 2021.

Current order-adjusted operating income continued to be impacted by low interest rates, and we
anticipate this trend to continue given Gibraltar's higher exposure to U.S. dollar products. We have taken
pricing actions, and we'll continue to identify opportunities to become more efficient. In addition, we had
$15 million of COVID response costs primarily to support our life consultants in Gibraltar, which we expect
will moderate in future quarters.

Now turning to Slide 9. We have a conservative high-quality investment portfolio that reflects our robust
asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification, and a disciplined interest rate
risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including
its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. There has been a slowdown
in the pace of credit migration and impairments since the first quarter of this year, with year-to-date credit
migration and losses below our expectations. For the third quarter, credit losses were just $12 million. We
remain confident that we are well capitalized to weather whatever might emerge in the future. And with
that, I'll hand it over to Ken.

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Rob.

I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter relative to our third
quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in
earnings per share of $3.21 on an after-tax basis. We then adjust for the following items: First, variable
investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter, which is worth $215 million. Second,
we adjust underwriting experience by a net $35 million. This includes seasonally lower reserve gains in
retirement and an estimate of $60 million for COVID-19 claims experienced in the fourth quarter.

Third, we expect expenses and other items to be $70 million higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to
seasonal expenses and implementation costs. Fourth, we expect the net operating costs due to COVID-19
to be $5 million lower in the fourth quarter. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by
$15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment
portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize for third quarter items.

These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.48 per share for the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you
exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.93. The key takeaway is that
our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, including the benefit from higher equity
markets as of quarter end. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be
other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter.

In addition as we look forward, we have increased the expected benefits from our cost savings program by
$250 million by the end of 2023. We expect these benefits will be largely self-funded, with incremental net
savings emerging in 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details about this program on our earnings
call in February.

On Slide 11, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity
of operating income per 100,000 of incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic remains unchanged at
$70 million. Based on our updated outlook, our fourth quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of
$60 million due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and
fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. Also, we continue

7

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

to expect incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $5 million in the fourth quarter. This includes
additional operating costs of $25 million, partially offset by $20 million of lower travel and entertainment
expenses.

Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding.
Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we have liquid assets at the parent
company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our
cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $6.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes
the proceeds from the sale of Prudential Korea. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our
businesses and other contingent capital facilities.

Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute our
strategic priorities for 2020. We have taken additional steps to expand our cost savings program. And we
continue to benefit from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which includes -- which gives us the
confidence and flexibility to navigate the changes in this economic environment.
Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous
Research.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Can you provide some more details on where you expect the additional expense savings to come from?
And how much of the cuts are efficiency initiatives? And how much are sort of reflecting a reappraisal of
business volumes in the revenue environment?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Erik , this is Ken. I'll start. And just by way of background, earlier this year we put in place a
transformation office, and it's led by one of our senior business leaders, Phil Waldeck. And it's given us
the capabilities to identify, prioritize and implement with a continuous improvement mindset. It involves
all of our U.S. businesses and all of our functions. And so we're finding efficiencies through combining
client service centers, process engineering, automation, through procurement strategies. And so it's a
culmination of transformation across the company. so that's generally what's driving that.

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

And Erik, it's Andy. I would just add, it's really not related to business volumes or revenues. It is core
efficiency improvement, where we're applying process and technology and able to hit a number of cost
reduction levers. So It's becoming more efficient at the business that we have.

Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP

Got it. And then you've talked about sort of all options being on the table for your in-force individual life
and annuities blocks, and we've started to see an increase in transaction activity across the industry. So
hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of buyer interest for liabilities like yours
and maybe the current bid-ask spread in the market?

Charles Frederick Lowrey
Chairman, CEO & President

Sure. This is Charlie. Let me take it kind of at a high level and then turn it over to Andy. But Erik, over the
past couple of years, we've been really active in beginning to change our business mix. So as you know,
we've sold our operations in Poland, Italy and Korea, now have agreement in Taiwan. And we continue to
focus on rotating our earnings mix to higher-growth markets internationally.

Now looking at the U.S. in terms of changing the focus within the business, we're on a path to derisking.
And have made major pivots to less interest rate-sensitive and more capital-light solutions in our
individual annuities and in our life business. And specifically you've seen us pivot away from the VAs with
lifetime income guarantees to less market-sensitive products. And at the same time, you've seen us in our
life business pivot to simpler non-guaranteed products.

But what we've also said is that we want to accelerate the transformation. And I've said that we'll
explore reinsurance and potentially the sale of certain blocks. But I'd add the caveat that these type of
transactions are complex and they take time. And as we explore our options, we want to make sure that
we're making good economic decisions that are in the best interest of shareholders. So we're going to take
all these things into account as we go forward. Andy, I don't know if you want to add on to that.

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes. Maybe I would just add, Erik, you also, I think, asked about what's the marketplace for these types
of transactions. And while we'll not quote on any specific deals that are going on, I think there are 2
important takeaways that we should discuss.

One is I think we've generally believed that a number of these blocks of business and our block of
business, its value is not fully appreciated in the marketplace. And I think if you look at the recent
transactions, that certainly has been, I think, proven out. The other thing is that there is capital moving
towards these types of deals and that there's capacity. So we've -- as Charlie said, we've begun to work
on these alternatives. And when we have something more to report, we'll certainly do so.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.

Humphrey Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

I'm just trying to bridge the comments or your kind of sentiment towards the decision to not reinstate
your share repurchase this year, given the credit concern and your -- at the same time, your confidence
about your balance sheet. I guess what kind of -- what do you need to see now to make you feel
comfortable to resume buyback?

Charles Frederick Lowrey
Chairman, CEO & President

So Humphrey, it's Charlie. Let me take a stab at that one.

In line with the risk framework that we have in place, we paused share repurchase in the second quarter.
But it's really about this: Until we have better visibility into the depth and the duration of the pandemic, a
possible recession and the credit cycle, which still may be before us, we're going to maintain our financial
flexibility and the resiliency. And when we get clarity into those issues that I just mentioned, we'll share
the timing with you of our plan to resume share buybacks and by how much. But until then, we're going to
focus on maintaining our financial strength with many of the unknowns still in front of us.

Humphrey Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

I guess just for a quick clarification, so do you suggest -- you do not intend to reinstate buyback this year.
But does it preclude you from using some of your capital strength for acquisitions?

Charles Frederick Lowrey
Chairman, CEO & President

Not necessarily. But again, we're going to take a very measured approach to that because we want to
maintain our financial flexibility. So we're not going to comment about any business or specific transaction.

But if I can take a step back for a moment again and just make a more general comment on how we think
about capital allocation and particular optimization, as we look across our businesses, both domestically
and internationally, we want to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment. And you've seen us do
that with some of the sales we've done internationally, but we're going to continue to look for ways to
optimize capital and capital deployment to maximize outcomes for shareholders. But at the same time,
we're going to take a hard look at the environment in which we're operating. And make sure that, again,
we maintain our financial strength and our financial flexibility and our resiliency as we go forward.

Humphrey Lee

10

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

That makes sense. And then my next question is related to Assurance IQ. So I think in the prepared
remarks, you talked about you're excited with the activity so far in the quarter. Granted it's still very early
in terms of the customer demand. I think last year, the challenge was you see -- you saw similar -- you
saw strong demand, but then you were not able to cope with the processing of those kind of incoming
demand. So maybe can you talk about like how -- like in terms of the demand relative to your current
capacity, where do you stand so far for the enrollment period?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes, Humphrey, it's Andy. So I'll take your question. And as we discussed sort of from a lessons learned
perspective from last year, we've done a lot this year to make sure that we were better prepared for
the annual enrollment period. We direct contracted with the health carriers, which gives us a lot more
flexibility and agility. We invested much more heavily in agent recruiting, licensing and training. And we
began to bring on agents this year in the month of July, which was much earlier than last year.

So repeating what Rob said, we're only about 3 weeks into the season, but we certainly see evidence that
our investments are paying off and that we're having stronger performance than we had in 2019. Having
said that, about 50% of industry-wide Medicare Advantage transactions occur in the last 2 weeks of the
annual enrollment period, and that's the first 2 weeks of December. So while we like what we see from a
growth perspective in these early days, it's certainly too early to draw definitive conclusions.

Humphrey Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

Do you feel like, given the activities that you're seeing and some of the preparedness you have already in
place, do you think Assurance IQ could turn positive for the fourth quarter?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes. And I think in our materials, we had given a walk to about 25 million for the fourth quarter.

Humphrey Lee
Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC

Got it.

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Oh, actually, I had that number wrong. It was 15, Humphrey. Sorry, I was off, looked at the wrong line.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Charlie, just wanted to circle back on capital deployment as my first question. If we think about 2021, at
this point, do you have a preference of buybacks or M&A? And I ask in particular because if you do free up
capital from a risk transfer deal, there also happens to be, say, more activity, more things on the market
now than there were recently. So curious what your view is, if you're more likely to want to do M&A or
buybacks at this point?

Charles Frederick Lowrey
Chairman, CEO & President

Tom, thanks for the question. I guess a couple of things.

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

One, again I would caution the people in thinking we're going to free up capital immediately. These
transactions take a long time, and therefore we have to think through that.

Secondly, I think it depends on the deal. What we have said before is given where our stock price is,
there's a fairly high hurdle, right?

On the other hand to your point, there could be some very interesting things on the market. So we're
going to have to balance, if you will, short-term accretion from stock buybacks and long-term growth. And
we'll have to weigh those 2 against the opportunity set that's out there and the stock purchase price at the
time.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful. And would defined contribution be on the wish list of M&A interest from your perspective?
Because I know you've done more international than you did Assurance IQ in recent times.

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question. We've been very focused on strengthening out our value
proposition in our full-service retirement business. We've talked a lot about, over the last couple of years,
the work that we've done in financial wellness. We've pretty heavily invested in digital and mobile, and
that has resulted in very good organic growth on that platform. If you look at our net flows over time, it's
been very positive. We're completing our third year of record sales. We had our largest corporate client
ever in the quarter.

So we've seen great success. Even though we certainly pay attention to the consolidation on the space,
we've seen great success organically growing the business, and that maintains our focus.

Thomas George Gallagher
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, the elevated level of non-backable expenses at Gibraltar, is that
like -- and I guess for the guide for 4Q, is that likely to continue into 2021? Or is there something that's
more, I would say, temporary regarding the lower earnings and higher expenses at Gibraltar?

Scott Garrett Sleyster
Executive VP & Head of International Businesses

Tom, this is Scott. The Gibraltar run rate base has been impacted by really 2 factors. And one here, this
first one is more permanent.

We adjusted our compensation structure for life consultants to better balance policyholder servicing,
things like customer business persistency and so forth with new business production, and then this led
to a lower level of deferrable commissions. Overall the commissions have not actually changed, but our
immediate run rate was impacted by roughly $10 million a quarter, and we view this as permanent. Now
we recapture that over the life of the products, but that takes quite a while to pick up. By the way, we do
not expect this to have any impact on Gibraltar's cash flow.

Second, Gibraltar does have a large block of U.S. dollar business, which is experiencing spread erosion due
to declines in U.S. dollar interest rates. So it's really those 2 factors combined with the biggest being the
first.

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

I wanted to circle back to Assurance IQ. If we assume your placeholder of $15 million for the fourth
quarter is right, I think it would still put you at a loss for the year versus your original guidance of EPS
accretion in 2020.

So just curious what's driving that? And then should we -- do you think we can get back on track to your
-- I think you had guided to $0.30 to $0.35 in 2021. Should we assume that you can kind of get back on
track there? Or do you think it's sort of more of a challenge to get this back to profitability for the full year
-- for a full year thing?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So Suneet, it's Andy. I'll take your question. And let me maybe raise it up a level. So we're very pleased
that we bought this business model and this set of capabilities, a model that's not sensitive to interest
rates or equity markets. Obviously, with what happened in the March time frame, we're even more pleased
to have this as part of the fold.

We immediately got very focused on building out and expanding the business model, so that we could
care for more needs in the mass market and middle market consumer set. So as we've really worked on
the business internally, success, for us, is not about near-term AOI. Success, for us, is very much about
continuing to expand the reach and breadth of the platform and is very much measured in how we grow
our revenues. It's very much measured in the products that we have on the platform.

So we began with life. You saw us immediately lean into Medicare Advantage. And then more recently,
we've leaned into property and casualty. And again, I always remind this is from a distribution perspective,
not from a manufacturing perspective. And these bring fee-based earnings that are very capitally efficient.
So our focus is really expanding this out as rapidly as we can.

Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then I guess a bigger picture question on your financial wellness initiative. When you guys
talked about this at your latest Investor Day, we spent a lot of time talking about marketing at the work
site, reaching the employees of your corporate customers. So if we assume that we're going to be in this
work-at-home environment for longer, how are you modulating that initiative to make sure that you're still
capturing the growth opportunity that you guys talked about, when you can't do these group meetings
that you guys discussed at the Investor Day?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes. Suneet, it's Andy. And I guess right up front, I'll draw a very sharp distinction in our financial wellness
work from what I would call worksite marketing, which I know a number of voluntary products are more
worksite marketing with feet on the street in the employer.

Ours was very much about building a set of capabilities that could really reach people when, where and
how they want it. So there was a real digital focus to what we've built. We've had accelerating success. If
you remember, there were sort of a couple of stages to what we were trying to accomplish.

At this point, we've had a large portion of our employers adopt our capabilities. We have 20 million
individuals that have access to the platform. That's ahead of our goals for 2020. We've -- what my word's,
permissioned 12 million individuals that they can access, we get access to market our retail solutions. That
is also ahead of our goals. And at this point, we've put 15,000 retail customers into Prudential through the
platform.

As COVID came in, the base capabilities were such that we were able to pretty quickly even expand upon,
as an example, our Prudential pathways program and make it purely digital with webinar capabilities. And
at this point, that's now reaching about 8.5 million folks. So we don't see the current environment actually
hindering us at all, and it's really about how we built the whole platform.

Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.

Ryan Joel Krueger
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I had a couple of annuity questions. One, in recent years, you've been sending dividends up to the holding
company from the annuity subsidiary, it seems like in kind of the roughly billion-dollar range, give or take.

I guess, so first question is to what extent was that negatively impacted by new business streams
associated with writing VAs with living benefit guarantee? So I guess should we see some improvement
there? And do you view the roughly $1 billion per year as sustainable in the current interest rate
environment?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Ryan, it's Ken. Our annuity business, as we've mentioned in the past, has been very well-hedged and very
well-capitalized, and as you mentioned, providing a regular source of dividends to the holding company.
Now that has moderated over time. As our sales have been below our outflows, the business has been
getting smaller. And although we're quite happy with the launch of our FlexGuard products, it won't be, in
the near term, sufficient to outpace the outflows that we have on our in-force block. So over time, that will
decrease our level of earnings and cash flow, and you could see that as a moderating trend.

Ryan Joel Krueger
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And I guess from a legal entity standpoint, I know you probably -- it sounds like you're more likely
to pursue a reinsurance. But just in general, is there any highs legally between the Prudential annuity
subsidiary and PICA or other life insurance subsidiaries? Or is it really completely separate?

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Our annuity business, it actually involves a couple of major legal entities. One would be our Pruco Life
of Arizona company, which is a subsidiary of PICA. That had been historically been the legal entity that
we use to underwrite annuity business. But you may recall, many years ago we acquired an annuities
company from American Skandia, that's what we call Prudential Assurance (sic) [ Annuities ] Life
Assurance Company (sic) [ Corporation ], or PALAC. And that also has a variable annuity business in it.
And so it's in a couple of different legal entities that are involved.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.

John Bakewell Barnidge
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

You didn't really address this in the commentary on cost cutting, but when adding $250 million, pushing
out to 2023, is this real estate savings that is far off -- far out enough that it could address leasing?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So John, it's Andy. This is really just an expansion of our program to, as Ken said earlier, every business
and every function. So it is -- real estate's part of it, but there are a number of different buckets. It really
is across real estate. It's across better vendor management and procurement, more efficiency from a
travel perspective. So it really goes across a number of areas.

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

It's -- we learned a lot in the first 12 to 18 months of this program. We saw a lot of what was possible
and feasible, and we basically expanded it to every corner of the organization. So it's not one particular
category. It's just from the success of the overarching program and accelerating it.

John Bakewell Barnidge
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And my follow-up would be the products within annuities and life that you suspended this year, can
you talk about the amount of assets associated with that, that were suspended, respectfully?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So from an annuities perspective, I'm not going to get this exactly right, but I think it's in the 110 billion,
120 billion range. And I will -- I don't have the guaranteed universal life in front of me.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So first, I just had a question on your disability loss ratio. It's actually -- margins in the business
have been pretty good. Are you starting to see, or expecting to see, any impact from sort of higher
unemployment and just a weaker economy on your benefits ratio in the disability business?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

It's Andy. I'll take your question. So we've actually been very pleased. We have not seen an uptick in
incidents in either our short-term disability business or our long-term disability business. That being
said though, obviously we've operated this business for many, many decades, and we know that in
recessionary environments, there's generally somewhere in the neighborhood of a year lag from when that
incident shows up. So we have invested to make sure that our claims teams have low, what we call desk
loads, so that if and when that incident starts to tick up, we're well prepared for it. But we have not seen
evidence of that yet.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then on -- just on Japan sales, obviously you benefited this quarter from sort of front-ending
prior to a price increase. But so I'm assuming you expect sales to decline a decent amount next quarter.
And then also, if you could just talk about how the conditions are in that market in terms of agents' ability
to meet with prospects and like, given social distancing and everything else that's going on?

Scott Garrett Sleyster
Executive VP & Head of International Businesses

Sure. Thanks, Jimmy. This is Scott. Well, as Rob noted in his remarks, with a significant decline in U.S.
interest rates, we implemented pricing changes in August across all of our U.S. dollar products in Japan.
As you know, it's common for salespeople to use such a pricing change to stimulate client contact. And
that tends to accelerate sales from maybe the quarter ahead prior to such a change. Sales in 3Q also
did benefit from the relaxation of social distancing requirements in Japan that were implemented in the
beginning of June, and I think you also asked on that question.

We expect that such enhanced demand will taper off in the following quarter, but then we are expecting
things really to normalize as we head in to 2021. Overall our distribution in Japan is largely operating in
kind of a back-to-normal mode, and I think that really reflects the strength of our differentiated business
model.

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

If we go back in time maybe 3 years ago, I think that you would have said that individual variable
annuities is a core competency of the company, that a lot of your competitors don't understand or
are backing away from the market. Many of them pivoted to buffer annuities and whatnot? With you
discontinuing sales of variable annuities with living benefits, can you talk about what's the return
characteristics of that product have been over the past 3 years, where they stand today, and what it
means for the back book?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

So Josh, it's Andy. I'll take that. So our HDI and PDI block of business is a very high-returning block of
business. As Ken talked about earlier, it's a well-capitalized block and well-hedged block and creates good
cash flows.

It's more of a go-forward perspective if you think about the decision-making around our product pivot.
We're working towards more of what I would frame as an all-weather portfolio, where we're taking less
fully on ourselves the interest rate and equity market risk. HDI is our most sensitive product in that
regard.

So we think from a go-forward perspective, as you noted, we are very, very good in the annuity space.
We believe there still is a deep-seated need to help people with accumulation and to help them with
decumulation from a longevity insurance perspective. And we think our go-forward product portfolio does
that, it does that well, but does it in a way that's more shareholder-friendly.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Do the financial advisers who work with you need a product like that in their silo from you, for you to
remain competitive with them?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

No. Now if you're asking about do they need the sort of the HDI, PDI types of product, no. We've actually
-- I think we benefit from our brand and our strength of our distribution. And I think that's really why
you see such a strong start to our FlexGuard buffered annuity. It was 38% of our sales here in the third
quarter, and we recently went through $1 billion in sales. And we haven't even finished fully rolling it out
to all states and all advisers. So we think our product portfolio will meet the needs the advisers and we'll
see good growth there.

Our next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question was going back to the capital conversation. You guys mentioned you have over $6 billion
of capital at the holding company. That's around 3x your fixed charges. So can you remind us what you
typically like under normal times to keep at the holding company? And then as we think about 2021, and
you mentioned reevaluating capital return. Once we kind of get out of COVID, will you go back to what you
view as kind of that normal level of fixed charges at the holding company? Or do you think that you're,
going forward after this, will look to hold on to an extra buffer as well?

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2020

Kenneth Yutaka Tanji
Executive VP & CFO

Elyse, it's Ken. Our target for highly liquid assets, in typical times, is 3 billion to 5 billion. And we think
that's a good level to carry to have the flexibility that a company like ours needs. So we are above that.
We think these are different than typical times. And I think as Charlie mentioned, that's a prudent thing to
do. And we'll continue to evaluate a number of factors, including the credit markets, as we go forward.

And -- but again, our target is typically 3 billion to 5 billion. That gives us ample flexibility in ordinary
times, and we think now is a good time to be above that.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I was hoping to get more color on the PRT environment. Obviously, with rates lower, do
you see deal activity slow in the third quarter. Typically, volume does pick up in the fourth quarter as we
close years out. Could you just give us some color on the pipeline there and thoughts about transactions
that we could potentially see in the fourth quarter?

Andrew Francis Sullivan
Executive VP & Head of U. S. Businesses

Yes. Elyse, it's Andy. I'll take your question.

So you're absolutely right. If we look at sort of 2020, the marketplace -- size of the marketplace versus
2019, 2020 is definitely going to be down. We think it's going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of
20%-ish or so. Third quarter was relatively quiet.

We are seeing a building pipeline in 4Q, but I would point out that with a lower overall market size, we
also have talked about in the past that we're now probably up to 5-plus competitors that can do deals of 1
billion-plus. So we think it's going to be a very competitive environment in the fourth quarter. We're going
to be very disciplined about how we approach the marketplace, and we're going to pick our spots.

Operator

And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Charles Lowrey for any closing comments.
