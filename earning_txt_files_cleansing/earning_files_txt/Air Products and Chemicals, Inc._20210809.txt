Operator

Good morning and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals' Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference
Call. Today's conference is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation
and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights
are reserved.

Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Thank you, Rochelle. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Third Quarter 2021 Earnings
Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations
and Sustainability. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO;
Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and current Chief Financial Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, who
we announced is succeeding Scott as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean
Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we'll be pleased
to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at
airproducts.com.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement
disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2.

In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we
specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective
tax rate and ROCE, both on a company-wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-
GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin,
adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures
to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant
earnings release section.

Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to
be on our call today. Today, in addition to announcing our results, we do have a significant announcement,
which is updating our future plans for growth and capital deployment. But before we get into the details,
I would like to say a few words about our CFO transition, which we announced last month. Please turn to
Slide #3.

Following this call, Ms. Melissa Schaeffer will succeed Mr. Scott Crocco as our Chief Financial Officer and
assume leadership responsibility for our worldwide finance organization. Scott is retired from Air Products
on September 30 as part of this smooth transition.

Today, I want to recognize and thank Scott, who has had a distinguished 31-year career with Air Products.
Scott started in our career development program and ultimately progressed to the highest role in
finance, serving as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Clearly, that achievement
is a testament to Scott, particularly his strong work ethic, his drive to deliver and his focus on creating
shareholder value.

Scott, I would like to say publicly what I have told you privately, that it has been a privilege working
with you for these past 7 years, particularly as we have executed our growth strategy and grown world-
class projects in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen. These projects continue to differentiate the

company and position Air Products for significant growth into the future. Particularly, I want to thank you
for leading our effort to position us for the successful closing of the Jazan gasification and power project
and for your efforts related to the project financing of this significant investment. I appreciate all you have
done to help us move forward, and I wish you great health and happiness in the future. Thank you again
for all you have done for Air Products.

Scott, at this point, would you like to say a few words?

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thank you very much, Seifi. I really appreciate the kind words and the support and the leadership
you've provided over these past 7 years. It's been an honor to work alongside you and the rest of the
leadership team to set Air Products on a path where the sky truly is the limit. With strong cash flows,
significant capital deployment capacity and continued dividend increases, Air Products operates from a
position of strength. And I have no doubt there will be many more profitable growth opportunities ahead.
I remain excited about the future of this amazing company. Melissa and I worked closely together over
the past 2 years, and there's no doubt she will continue to excel and help others to do the same. I look
forward to continuing the transition with her over the coming weeks. And again, thank you very much.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Scott. I do appreciate your comments. Let me now introduce Melissa Schaeffer. One of the
things that you learned right away about Melissa is that she is a passionate and driven individual. For
Melissa, it's all about excellence. She is driven to win. Along with that spirit, she brings deep leadership
and financial experience from inside and outside Air Products to this new role. She is a great example of
the culture we are building here, and I have no doubt she will continue to create an environment where
people belong and matter and contribute to their fullest.

Melissa held financial roles of increasing responsibility with Siemens, Ernst & Young and Trinseo before
coming to Air Products. She joined us as Vice President and Chief Audit Executive in 2016. She then
became our Vice President, Finance, a financial responsibility for our megaprojects as well as Air Products'
largest supporting segment. Melissa has been a key part of our growth and success over the past 5 years,
and I'm delighted she will be our Chief Financial Officer.

Melissa, would you like to say a few words?

Melissa Schaeffer
VP & Chief Audit Executive

Thank you for the kind introduction, Seifi. And I want to thank Scott for the tremendous example he has
set as our CFO. I appreciate the opportunity to join the earnings call today and say hello to all of you.
And I look forward to meeting more of the investment community and sharing Air Products' Q4 and full
year results with everyone on our next call. Air Products is truly at the heart of providing energy and
environmental solutions, which makes this company a truly special place to be. I'm looking forward to
our finance organization and the broader Air Products team working together to bring those sustainable
growth solutions forward to serve our customers, support our communities and, of course, reward our
shareholders. Thank you.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, thank you, both Scott and Melissa, for your comments. And now let's turn to our business results.

The stability of our business and the dedication of our people have been on full display as the talented
and committed people of Air Products delivered good results again this quarter. Our people working
together have kept our 750 facilities around the world operating and our customers supplied through the
COVID-19 pandemic. In support of the hard work and dedication demonstrated by our employees, we

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

have not reduced our staff or cut salaries during this difficult period. I am proud to say that Air Products is
emerging from this crisis an even a stronger company than before.

We have continued to acquire new assets and businesses, successfully raised prices and brought new
plants onstream. We have also strengthened our organization by adding resources in various functions,
mostly in engineering and project development, to help us successfully pursue and execute the many
exciting future projects we had in front of us.

At the same time, we also delivered earnings per share of $2.31 this quarter, which is 15% higher than
last year despite absorbing costs related to our growth-driven development efforts. I am extremely proud
of the accomplishments that we have achieved as a team, and I would like to thank all of our employees
at Air Products for their dedication and hard work. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong
financial results while maintaining our unwavering focus on safety.

As Slide #4 shows, despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working
safely, following our strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers and our communities.
As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and our goal will always be 0
accidents and 0 incidents.

Slides #5, 6 and 7 include our goal, our management philosophy and our 5-point strategic plan. These are
the -- you have seen this before, and these are the principles that we will follow every day, and they will
continue to guide us in the future.

Now please turn to Slide #8. We believe the environmental sustainability challenges facing the world are
significant. The scope and complexity of the megaprojects necessary to address these challenges requires
talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together
as one team. As I mentioned earlier, we can solve these problems no matter how challenging as long as
the we always stay focused and united working toward a common goal on a global basis. We believe this is
the calling of our company and the higher purpose for all of us at Air Products.

Now please turn to Slide #9. We recently published an annual sustainability report, which highlights our
sustainability-driven growth opportunities and our many accomplishments in this area. For instance,
our products help our customers avoid 72 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions, which means that
for every ton of CO2 that we emit in making our products, we help our customers avoid 3 tons of CO2
emissions. In addition, more than half of our offerings are sustainable, and close to 1/4 of our electricity
purchases are from renewable sources.

We have also set new sustainability goals which are very much aligned with our growth strategy. Our
Third by '30 goal aims to reduce our carbon intensity by 1/3 by 2030. Our growth opportunities will enable
progress towards this goal. And therefore, we expect to see significant progress later in the decade as our
major projects come onstream and start to positively benefit our results.

At Air Products, sustainability is our growth strategy. And sustainability and our growth go hand in hand.
As we strive to solve the world's environmental sustainability problems, we are also creating growth
opportunities for the company. A prime example of such an opportunity is our innovative world-class net-
zero hydrogen project in Edmonton, Alberta, as we announced last June and I will talk about a little bit
more later on.

Now please turn to Slide #10, which highlights our key gasification projects. We are committed to our
gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We do expect to announce
additional gasification projects in the future.

Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 large gasification projects which I have
discussed on previous earnings calls. First, our $12 billion acquisition of Jazan gasifier and power plant
from Saudi Aramco. We continue to make significant progress working with our partners and the lenders.
The team has worked hard to bring the project to the final stages of project financing, and we still expect
this project to reach financial close by the end of our fiscal year, that is September 30, 2021.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

Second, regarding Lu'An, the plant is operating at full capacity. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to
recognize reduced fees through fiscal year '22 before we return to the full fee in 2023.

Now I would like to provide an overview of 2 new and very exciting developments before I discuss the
major announcement we are making today, which is our capital deployment plans for the next 6 years.

First, on Slide 11, you can see the overview of the Alberta project that we announced last month. This
innovative project includes gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, the 3 pillars of our growth strategy
coming together in one project to support the energy transition. This project is fully aligned with Canada's
green energy diversification strategy and enables Canada to advance its competitive low-carbon economy.
It uses locally available hydrocarbons to make net-zero hydrogen.

As summarized on Slide 12, the hydrogen will be produced using auto-thermal reforming technology,
enabling 95% of the CO2 produced by the project to be captured and stored. To achieve net zero, the
remaining 5% carbon footprint will be offset by exporting the electricity generated by this net-zero
hydrogen. The output will be -- the output, the net-zero hydrogen, will be supplied to our customers on
our existing pipeline in Alberta as well as used to produce liquid hydrogen for the mobility and merchant
markets. The project represents a CAD 1.3 billion investment and is expected to come onstream in 2024.

We also -- as you can see on Slide #13, we continue to focus on the very exciting hydrogen for mobility
market, and we are pleased to announce a project with Cummins to accelerate the integration of hydrogen
fuel cell trucks globally. Cummins will provide hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrain, integrated into heavy-
duty trucks for Air Products as we begin the process of converting our global fleet of 2,000 distribution
vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. We expect the first unit to be online in 2022 and the full conversion
before 2030.

Now let me give you the highlights of our significant announcement today. 3.5 years ago, in 2018, we
announced publicly that Air Products' growth strategy, guided by the global energy transition and based on
the 3 pillars of gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, had the potential to create significant growth for
our company and that we could foresee deploying or committing $15 billion of capital in the 5-year period
from 2018 to end of 2022. At that time, I remember clearly that our announcement was received within a
degree of skepticism.

Well, today, I'm happy to show you, as you can see on Slide #14, that we have developed -- we have
deployed or committed almost $18 billion of capital 1.5 years ahead of our plan. And I want to state
that on the aggregate, the return on this capital is in line with the guidance we have given our investors
before.

This validates our long-term strategy. But now that we are ahead of the plan, the question raised by our
investors was, "What about the future?" I had promised the investors that we would address this question
sometime during the summer of 2021. So here we are today, summer of 2021, announcing, as you can
see on Slide 15, that based on what we see ahead, implementing our focused strategy and based on a
conservative estimate of our financial capacity, Air Products expects to deploy or commit more than $30
billion of capital for the 10-year period from 2018 to the end of 2027.

Later in this call, Scott will go through the details, but today, I wanted to make the point that as before,
we are pursuing a growth strategy. We do have the right strategy to move forward. We are aided by
the megatrends of energy transition. We have the people and the core competencies, and we have the
financial strength to make our dream a reality and deliver on what we promised our investors.

Now at least turn to Slide 16, which shows our EPS growth. As you can see, we have delivered greater
than 10% annual EPS growth since 2014 when I was appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the
company. These results are the testament to the hard work and commitment of the people of Air Products.
And I want to thank them again for their continued hard work and commitment.

Now please turn to Slide #17, a reminder that we share our earnings growth with our investors. Both
our EPS and dividend have grown double digits since 2014. We are committed to delivering increased
dividend while we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities. We have significant cash flow
that supports our substantial dividend and our growth strategy.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

And finally, Slide #18 shows our EBITDA margins, as always, my favorite slide, where it shows that the
margins is up 1,200 basis points since 2014.

Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Scott to provide a financial overview. Scott?

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, the stability of our business and the dedication of our people
have been on full display. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong financial results despite
the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic. If we compare our volumes this quarter to Q3 of
fiscal year 2019, or in other words, before the pandemic, our volumes are up 8%. Our trailing 4-quarter
distributable cash flow has held steady at approximately $2.6 billion for the past 2 years. Now Air Products
is emerging from this pandemic an even stronger company. Our sales, EBITDA and EPS grew double digits
this quarter. All 3 regions reported higher sales and EBITDA. And our price and volume continued to be
strong despite lower earnings from Lu'An and the ongoing COVID impact.

Now please turn to Slide 19 for a brief discussion of our third quarter results. Sales increased 26%
compared to prior year, reaching $2.6 billion driven by very strong volume, better pricing, higher energy
pass-through and favorable currencies. Volume improved 12% as COVID recovery, new plants and
acquisitions more than offset reduced Lu'An contributions. Although the pandemic has eased, the volume
recovery has not been consistent across our product lines. We continue to experience the negative impact
of COVID-19, although the impact this quarter was more modest than last year. Prices were again up, with
improvement in all 3 regions. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gains. Overall,
prices were up 2% in total, which represents a 4% increase for the merchant business.

EBITDA climbed 11%, approaching a $1 billion mark as favorable volume, price, currencies and equity
affiliate income more than offset higher costs, which were impacted by inflation and higher maintenance.
EBITDA margin declined 520 basis points primarily due to higher costs and higher energy pass-through,
which increases sales but not profit. Higher energy pass-through negatively impacted margin by about 200
basis points. Higher costs included higher maintenance spending compared to last year due mainly to low
spending in the prior year, resulting from less access to sites due to COVID-19.

ROCE was 240 basis points lower. The increase in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt
reduced ROCE by about 300 basis points. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, supported by 5% seasonally
stronger volume and 1% higher price. Energy pass-through was lower by 2% as energy prices returned to
a more normal range following the effects of the winter storm in the previous quarter.

Now please turn to Slide 20. Our third quarter GAAP EPS was $2.36 and included a $0.05 tax benefit
primarily resulting from reserve adjustments related to a 2017 tax election on a non-U.S. subsidiary.
Excluding the non-GAAP item, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31 despite the ongoing impacts of
the pandemic and was $0.30 above last year. Volume was favorable $0.26. COVID recovery, new plants
and acquisitions more than offset reduced Lu'An contributions.

As a reminder, it's important to recognize that as the 60% majority owner of the Lu'An joint venture,
100% of the negative impact from Lu'An is included in the volume line because we consolidate the
operating results. However, this is partially offset by the positive impact reflected in the noncontrolling
interest line as the net income shared by our partner is also reduced.

Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.05 as our price increases more than covered variable cost
inflation. We continue to execute pricing actions in response to rising variable costs such as power and
fuel. Like the prior few quarters, our plans to add resources and strengthen our organization to support
growth have increased our costs. Americas' maintenance costs were lower last year due to COVID-19
limitations, and there were temporary COVID-related government incentives in Asia last year.

Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.12, with the Chinese RMB and euro accounting for roughly
half of the impact. Equity affiliate income added $0.04 on strong underlying business results, while
noncontrolling interest was also favorable $0.05 on lower profits from our consolidated joint ventures,
primarily Lu'An.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

The effective tax rate of 18.2% was 110 basis points lower than last year due to a change in U.K. tax law.
We expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below 20% in fiscal year '21. The remaining $0.04 includes
a favorable $0.05 in nonoperating income primarily driven by lower pension expense and an unfavorable
interest expense of $0.01.

Now please turn to Slide 21. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash
flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $12
per share. From our EBITDA of about $3.8 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note
that our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual driven in part by spending on our new global
headquarters.

From a distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.2 billion as dividends to our shareholders,
and we still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash
flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing
dividends and capital deployment.

Slide #22 provides an update on our capital deployment. As Seifi mentioned, we have extended our time
horizon another 5 years to 2027. Since we see tremendous project opportunities beyond the original
capacity of $15 billion, we think it's appropriate to extend the time frame for at least another 5 years.
This updated view of our capital deployment potential shows over $30 billion available through fiscal
2027. The $30 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, almost
$15 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and almost $7 billion already spent. We believe this figure
is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which generates additional cash flow
and, therefore, additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to
maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating.

So you can see, we've already spent 22% and have already committed 57% of the updated capacity we
show here. In short, we exceeded the commitment we made to you in 2018 and has substantial capacity
available to deploy to support our growth strategy.

Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you very much, Scott. Now please turn to Slide #23 for our Asia results. Sales increased 15%
compared to last year, supported by strong volume, better price and favorable currencies. Volumes were
up 6%, reversing the negative trend of the previous 4 quarters. Base volumes, driven by COVID recovery
and the addition of numerous small new plants, more than offset the reduced Lu'An contribution. Asia
pricing overall was positive 1%, primarily driven by good performance in China across most product lines.
This was the 17th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement in Asia. Sequentially, price was
also positive by 1%.

EBITDA increased 9% driven primarily by favorable price, volume, currencies and equity affiliate income.
Costs compared unfavorably, partly due to inflation and COVID-related incentives last year -- I should say,
COVID-related government incentives and costs last year.

EBITDA margin of 47.4% was 270 basis points lower as reduced Lu'An contribution and increased costs
more than offset the benefits of higher price, volume and equity affiliate income. Operating income and
margin compared unfavorably to EBITDA and EBITDA margin due to higher quality affiliate income and
additional depreciation from new plants. Sequentially, sales and profit improved as economic activities
rebounded following the Lunar New Year holidays.

Now I would like to turn the call back to Scott to talk about the Americas results.

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 24 for a review of our Americas results. Sales surged 25% over last
year. Volume, price, energy pass-through and currency were all positive. Volume grew 9% primarily due to
COVID recovery, higher medical gases in South America and onetime items. Most merchant products have
returned to their pre-COVID levels, but hydrogen volume has not yet fully caught up. While the demand
for transportation fuels has improved as people resume travel, the increases are not even across different
types of fuel. Gasoline and diesel volumes have rebounded. However, the demand for jet fuel, which
consumes more hydrogen on a per unit basis compared to gasoline, still lags. Furthermore, the industry
has shifted to use more light sweet crude, which requires less hydrogen. In addition, the industry's
inventory level remained high.

Price was again strong. The 4% increase for the region was equivalent to 8% on the merchant business.
Price was better across all major product lines, and this is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year
price improvement. Energy cost pass-through is again higher as natural gas prices remained elevated
versus last year and drove a 10% sales increase.

EBITDA reached $465 million, a 13% increase over last year as better volume and price as well as onetime
items more than offset power and other cost inflation and higher maintenance. Our maintenance costs
were unfavorable versus last year because limited maintenance work was possible last year due to the
restrictions imposed by COVID protocols. Following the successful completion of the turnaround this
quarter, we expect our maintenance activities to moderate next quarter. Higher energy cost pass-through
negatively impacted EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points or almost 90% of the reported decline.

Compared to last quarter, Americas' volumes increased 6% driven by stronger hydrogen volume, partly
helped by recovery following the winter storm and onetime items. Price also improved 1%, up across all
major product lines. Energy pass-through was lower sequentially as the natural gas price came back down
after the spike caused by the winter storm. EBITDA increased 4% sequentially, supported by improved
volume and price as well as onetime items, while cost was unfavorable. EBITDA margin was 120 basis
points better primarily driven by about 350 basis points of favorable energy pass-through, while strong
price partially offset higher costs.

Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide 25 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region
results. Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales jumped 45%, and
volume and EBITDA were both up about 25% versus last year. COVID recovery and acquisitions primarily
drove the 24% volume increase. Our liquid/bulk business has returned to its pre-COVID level, but the
packaged gas business still lagged.

Price increased for the 14th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major product lines in all
the subregions. The 1% price gain for the region corresponds to a 2% improvement for the merchant
business. Real price increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix since the demand across the
product lines was not even. We are also executing additional pricing actions to recover the recent power
cost increases.

Currencies were a favorable 12% primarily due to the strong euro and British pound versus the U.S. dollar.
EBITDA was up 25% to over $210 million driven primarily by the strong volume. EBITDA margin was down
540 basis points, with higher energy pass-through responsible for about 200 basis points. The remaining
roughly 300 basis point reduction was mainly attributable to unfavorable costs, mostly power and other
cost inflation.

Compared to prior quarter, sales rose 7%, primarily supported by positive 5% volume, but EBITDA was
down 2% and margin was about 300 basis points lower as this volume gain was more than offset by
higher costs, including power and other cost inflation, and lower equity affiliate income.

Now please turn to Slide 26, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as
well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment and project activity, but profit was

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

lower due to business mix and higher product development spending. Sales and profits were roughly equal
to last quarter.

Please turn to Slide 27, Corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate
costs. We were pleased to be selected for Nigeria LNG's Train 7 project, building on the success of the Air
Products LNG equipment and technology for the first 6 trains.

Corporate segment sales were higher this quarter driven by increased project activities as we continued to
execute multiple large LNG and other projects, but profit was lower on higher corporate costs. And sales
and profits were roughly equal to last quarter.

Now to provide some additional thoughts, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you very much, Simon. Now please turn to Slide #28. Air Products continues to deliver consistent
earnings and cash flow. Our on-site business, which is roughly half of our total sales, remains stable. We
have seen signs of improvement in merchant volumes, particularly relative to the very challenging quarter
3 last year.

As I mentioned earlier, Lu'An facility is operating at full capacity, and we expect the Jazan transaction to
achieve financial close by the end of September 2021. For quarter 4 of fiscal year 2021, our earnings per
share guidance is $2.44 to $2.54, up 11% to 16% over last year. This makes our guidance for our fiscal
year to be $8.95 to $9.05, up approximately 8% over last year and within the range we shared with you
last quarter. We continue to see our CapEx at approximately $2.5 billion for the year 2021. Our fiscal year
'21 EPS and CapEx guidance obviously exclude any contribution from Jazan.

Meanwhile, we continue to execute our other projects, bringing them onstream and finalizing agreements
with our customers. We are committed to our capital deployment strategy and to growing our pipeline
of projects. We continue to be very optimistic about our focused long-term growth strategy. The capital
deployment projections that we shared with you today for the next 6 years clearly demonstrate our
significant growth potential in the years to come.

Now please turn to Slide #29. Clearly, the only sustainable long-term competitive advantage of any
company is the degree of commitment and motivation of the people in the enterprise. We are fortunate
to have that commitment with our people. By working together against the hardships of the pandemic,
supporting our customers and each other, I'm proud to say that we have made our company even stronger
in the process. Not only have we continued to strengthen our base business but also further extend our
core competencies, pursuing our growth strategy. Our gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen growth
platforms all support the drive for a cleaner environment, and we are executing mega-scale projects in all
3 areas.

We all know that the world's desire for clean energy will only accelerate. Our differentiated growth
strategy and unmatched expertise have positioned Air Products for continued strong sales and growth well
in the future.

As always, I want to again thank our customers around the world. In innovating alongside you, the
dedicated and committed people of Air Products are doing their part to achieve our common higher
purpose of creating a better world for everyone.
Now we are very pleased to answer any questions that you have.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question we'll hear from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congratulations to Scott, very well done and distinguished career clearly. Seifi, can I ask you on the new
sort of outlook for capital allocation? Maybe 2 pieces about it. One, how are you thinking about how much
of it will be sort of in that megaproject category that we've seen with NEOM and so forth versus sort of the
more traditional industrial gas projects?

And second to that, as I think back over the last 3.5 years of the first CapEx outlook, the menu of things
you're interested in expanded into gasification, and then we got in the green and blue hydrogen, now
carbon capture. I would assume that we're going to see the future CapEx skew more towards those latter
categories, but I'm also curious whether there's anything else that's on the horizon that's not currently on
the CapEx venue that we should start thinking about.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you very much about your comment about Scott. He's a great guy. We all know that.

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Vincent. I really appreciate that.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

With respect to your specific question, Vincent, out of the additional $12.5 billion -- $12 billion that we
announced in the next 6 years, we expect about $5 billion to be in support of our existing business and
the balance of it being the large projects. And in terms of the focus, we are going to stay very focused,
Vincent, and spend our money on gasification; hydrogen, which is blue and green; and CO2 capture.
We are going to try not to venture too much outside of those 3 specific areas. And there is significant
opportunity.

Now that you asked the question, it gives me -- we came up with the $30 billion not because of lack of
projects. It is because of we wanted to demonstrate what is our financial capacity to maintain our A rating.
As we go forward, obviously, we will get it. We cannot project you EBITDA for 2030. So that's why we are
constrained. There are a lot of projects in the areas of gasification, hydrogen and CO2 as you will see in
the future, and we are going to stay focused on that because I believe by being focused, you get results
rather than being all over the place.

Operator

And next, we move to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So a 2-part question. If you look at your European operations and your Asian operations over the last 3
quarters, they're sequentially flat. The Asian EBITDA is a little bit better. The European EBITDA is not. Why
is that the case given that the global economy has been improving?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

And secondly, in your reconciliation tables, in your return on capital, your return on capital has gone from
12.4% a year ago to 10%. It's kind of moved down sequentially. Why is that? What are the factors that
you are encountering that's lowering your capital returns?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Two very good questions. Number one, when you look at it the way you say that it is flat, the global
economy is improving, please take note that the global economy is improving and people going to
restaurants and flying around. In the major economies that we are operating, the industrial economy has
not improved that much. That's number one.

The second thing, our results are significantly affected by Lu'An, you know that very well, because Lu'An
had an EBITDA contribution every year at full capacity under normal circumstances of almost $150 million,
$160 million a year. When you -- when that number comes down, then it distorts all of the numbers. But
please look at our volumes.

And another thing is that our results are affected by another significant item, which I have mentioned
many times before. We are investing in [ increased ] organization significantly to develop these new
projects. When we [indiscernible] project like Canada, we have been working on 4 other projects. Each
one of these projects costs $4 billion or $5 billion, $10 billion -- $10 million to develop. We are spending
that money because we are investing for the future. So that is taking -- also hitting our results.

But look at our volumes. If you look at our volumes, our volumes are better than all of our competitors
during that period. We have grown our base volumes. If you take all of the mumbo-jumbo out of people's
results and our result, our volume growth has improved better than anybody else. It's 12%. So therefore,
I don't [indiscernible] results. That's number one.

The second thing with respect to the return on capital employed, it depends on how you calculate it
because if we can calculate our return on capital employed the way other people calculated that they don't
consider the cash, we are at 15%, not at 10%. The second thing is that our return on capital employed
has gone down because we borrowed $5 billion that is still sitting on our balance sheet and we haven't
deployed that. Once we deploy that, once we pay for the Jazan $2.5 billion, your -- that return on capital
employed jump up. Is that okay, Jeff?

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes.

Operator

And we'll move on to John Roberts with UBS.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

This is Josh Spector on for John this morning. First, just on behalf of the team here at UBS, I just want to
say congrats to Scott in his retirement, and welcome Melissa to the team. Happy to have you here.

Going to the -- so just sticking on the volume point within the regions, with the project starting up, it's
become a little bit tougher to tell where the merchant levels are versus 2019. Could you walk through the
different regions and help us understand how much volume you might be lower in aggregate relative to
2019? Or in other words, how much recovery is left to get there? And then second would just be in some
of the onetime items you called out in the Americas, can you quantify what that is or give us some insight
on what that is that's benefiting you guys in the quarter?

Chairman, President & CEO

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

Sure. Thank you very much. I think that during the course of his comments, Scott mentioned that if you
take our volume and compare it to pre-COVID, we are 8% ahead in terms of our merchant volumes. So
we are actually volume-wise ahead of where we were before the COVID started. That's why the previous
point that I was making.

Then with respect to your second question about onetime items, we don't want to give too much detail
about those because it involves customers and so on and some of the people don't want to -- exactly
for us to disclose exactly what we set out for them if they close the refinery or something like that. So
apologies for not answering that question.

Joshua David Spector
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. If I could just try again on the volume side. So on a like-for-like basis, you would say volumes are
8% ahead. That doesn't include contribution from new projects? Or are we mixing up things there?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

There are new projects, but it is not substantial. Even if you exclude the new projects, we are ahead.

Operator

And we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

Our best to you, Scott. There were a variety of comments made about the year-over-year comparison.
Some of those you would have had visibility on like Lu'An and some of your corporate costs perhaps. But
what would you say was most surprising to you on the cost side or -- that impacted your results in the
quarter that were different from your expectations a few months ago?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the expectation that we had was that the U.S. economy on the industrial side especially would be
stronger than it is and especially also HyCO, I mean, the hydrogen. Those things didn't develop to our
expectation. The rest of it, we did have visibility [indiscernible], but those were -- the surprise was the
performance in Americas.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And one quick one for you on your helium business. Any comments on the outlook for you,
particularly given the large Russian project in development? Any concerns there?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Steve, on that one, I mean, you are very knowledgeable about what is going on in the details. There
is this big price high helium project that the Russians are working on, the so-called Amur project. That
project has a significant amount of capacity. And when and if -- I mean I shouldn't say if, when it comes
onstream, whenever it is, it will obviously change the supply-demand basis in the helium worldwide and
it will have an effect on prices. But we don't know when that is going to be, and that project has been
delayed many times. So when that happens, it will obviously have an effect. It hasn't happened. We don't
expect it to happen next quarter, but it might happen in the future. There is a lot of volume of helium that
can come onstream. Are those okay, Steve?

Yes.

Operator

And next, we move to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Again, congratulations, Scott. It's been a pleasure working with you. So a question on the global business
and the corporate lines because the revenues keep going up pretty meaningfully. You've got some of the
big new LNG business coming in, and yet the profits year-over-year have definitely faded. So I guess,
can you give us a little bit more color as to the drivers behind that and when we might be through that,
whether it's incremental costs or expenses on the corporate line and maybe some of the business mix
changes on the global side? Just because it is a little bit surprising that it seems to be holding back the
revenues as much as it has been.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

John, first of all, good morning. Hope all is well with you. Second thing is that, John, we are talking
about deploying $30 billion of capital. That means those projects need to get engineered and built before
they contribute to the bottom line. We have added, without exaggeration, close to 2,000 people to our
engineering and project management and business development staff in the last 2 years, 2,000 people.
If you take $100,000, $120,000 per person, that becomes a lot of money. We have absorbed a lot of
costs because of pricing and all of that, but still we are spending a significant amount of dollars in order
to position ourselves that not only we develop these projects but that they also execute them and build
them.

But then when we do that -- I mean people know how to do the math better than anybody else. If we
deploy the $30 billion by 2027, which we say we will, and we say that the return on that thing is expect
$0.10 operating profit for every dollar, that is $3 billion of operating profit in addition to what we are
doing. You do that after tax, and then you come up with a significant number with respect to more than
$10, $11, $15 per share. So in order -- we need to make that a reality, that is not going to happen by
itself. And therefore, we are going to be absorbing a lot of additional costs in the meantime.

Now a year from now, 2 years from now, depending on how many projects we have, now if the next year,
we come and say that, look, we spent $30 billion, now we have to increase it to $40 billion, then we will
have to add more people. So there is a sequence to this thing. We need to spend the money to develop
the project, to get the projects. And as you know, the new rules is such that you cannot put the projects
on the balance sheet and then you win them and those that you win, you have to eat the costs. That's the
accounting rules.

So that is where I think the investors need to have a little bit of patience with us because these costs are
going to be with us. And quite honestly, it is amazing that the effect is not as much as it could be because
as I said, 2,000 people, it's costing us $240 million, $250 million a year to support those people. Okay,
John?

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

That's fair -- yes. No, fair enough. Very helpful color on it.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 09, 2021

Seifi, over the last several quarters, we've seen inflation accelerate pretty broadly and a lot of specialty
chemical companies are feeling the effects of that in today's market. Air Products, of course, is blessed
in that you pass through a lot of costs. But as you've been discussing, I think there are other costs that
aren't passed through. And so my question would be, do you think there's any need or opportunity to
accelerate the pace of pricing given that backdrop of industry inflation? And how might your answer differ
by region of the world?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

That is a very good question, Kevin. And first of all, we believe -- I mean the way we operate is that our
base business, people increase prices to cover inflation. That is the minimum we expect them to do. The
other cost increases, obviously, as I mentioned before, is adding additional resources. But our philosophy
is that if power costs go up, prices need to go up. And as compared to other chemical companies, we have
-- another benefit is that our raw material price doesn't go up because our raw material is really air for
most of our products. And if it is natural gas, we do pass it through.

So overall, as I've said many times before, with my 42-year experience in industrial gases, inflationary
times are, in general, positive for industrial gases because it gives you the license to increase prices. And
if the -- I mean, in our call, we mentioned price increases on an overall basis. But if you take just our
merchant price increases, we have had price increases this last quarter of 7% in Americas, 3% in Europe,
3% in Asia, total company 5% in price increase. So that's for the merchant side. So that is significant, and
it's keeping us up to date with inflation, Kevin. Okay?

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Thank you for that.

Operator

And we'll move on to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Of course, my congrats to Scott as well. It's been a pleasure. Seifi, just on Jazan, if we do assume
financial close by fiscal year-end, should we still presume a full year of earnings contribution for Jazan
next fiscal year?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. It is going to depend on the details of the final structure of the financing and all that. But yes, we
have said that once we do financial close and we pay a certain amount of money, we are going to get
BFC, or the basic facility, in accordance with how much money we have put in. So we should expect good
contribution in 2022, yes.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Very good. And do you have an update on the NEOM and Indonesian projects?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

The NEOM project, we obviously are working on it. We have, I think, at least around 400 people
working on that project. The project is moving forward. They are clear at preparing the ground, and the
engineering is going forward. So we are making progress on that project. With respect to Indonesia, I
don't have any update. Indonesia has a lot of issues there with the COVID and all of that. So I don't really
have any update.

And we'll move on to Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Research Partners

Best wishes to Scott, and congratulations to Melissa on the new role. In terms of the Americas business,
you mentioned that we're up sequentially on stronger hydrogen demand. I think that's related to the
Texas freeze and some improvement in refinery utilization. But you also mentioned that some of these
refineries are using more light and sweet crude feedstocks, which require less hydrogen. Can you talk a
little bit more about the longer-term effect of that trend?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, for the longer term, we are actually very bullish about our hydrogen pipeline in the Gulf Coast.
We expect that hydrogen network to be really sold out in about 2 years' time because the fundamental
drivers for growth are there, the refineries will come back and there is a significant trend, Mike, you know
that very well, towards converting the refineries into making renewable diesel. And as we have said, the
intensity of hydrogen for renewable diesel is higher than other things. So we remain very optimistic about
that. It's just quarter-by-quarter, the numbers move. But for the longer term, we are very optimistic about
that hydrogen pipeline and that whole infrastructure there.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Research Partners

All right. And in the EMEA business, you mentioned the higher power costs and the need to go after
additional pricing there. Can you just talk about those dynamics a little bit more? I guess, is there some
seasonal improvement in the power situation such that if you wait it out, maybe the cost will come a little
bit lower?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I don't think so. I think that in Europe, there is a structural issue that when you decide that you don't
want to use nuclear and you don't want to decide to use coal, then the other alternative sources of energy
are more expensive. I mean, in some parts of Europe, energy cost last quarter was almost 100% more
than the last year. So I think that power cost increases in Europe are going to be a thing of the future. And
in order -- and that's why a lot of these things that people talk about, making green hydrogen using the
grid in Europe, is kind of a little bit of a pie in the sky.

But overall, I think that our job is to increase our prices to compensate for the power costs. And our
contracts are structured that way. Sometimes, we might get a little bit of a lag in implementing that, but
our people know exactly what they need to do, and in turn, we will catch up. But I don't think power prices
in Europe are going to ease.

Operator

And Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs will have the next question.

You just asked me a question that I cannot answer because we have been prohibited by Saudi Aramco to
talk about the state of operation of the refinery and what stage it is and how it is operating and so on for
security reasons. So I cannot tell you what is operating, what is not operating and all of that. I mean if
you want, you can ask that question from Saudi Aramco, but I think they will say probably the same thing
that I said. So I apologize. You asked the question, and I cannot answer you. Sorry about that.

Robert Andrew Koort

And we'll move on to Patrick Fischer with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

First question, just around Lu'An. Seifi, I think you mentioned that you thought it was going to get back to
a run rate of $150 million to $160 million of EBITDA. But I didn't understand, was that in the fiscal 2022
for you guys? Or is that calendar 2022 for the customer?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

It is in fiscal 2023. Fiscal '22, I mentioned in the call that it will be low.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. '22 is low, '23 gets -- okay, fair enough. And then second one, on your Alberta project, I believe one
of your big customers up there is Suncor. And they had announced about a month earlier then, you guys
kind of a similar project. Does your project supersede what they were going to do? Or is there enough
space up there that both you can do a large green hydrogen project?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I don't want -- I obviously don't want to speak for Suncor. They are a customer of ours, but we are
not the only supplier. They have their own SMRs. So what they intend to do -- our contract with them lasts
until 2028. I don't know what is their intention about doing a project to replace their own SMRs, doing
a project to replace their own SMRs and what they buy from us, that's something that you have to talk
to them. I don't want to be speaking for them. But the project they announced, they come onstream in
2028, and our project would come onstream in 2024.

And next, we'll hear from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

A fuel cell company, which is -- was a hydrogen customer noted on their earnings call that they
transitioned away from Air Products because they were unhappy with the supply and pricing. The same
company is also building out their own green hydrogen supply chain. Maybe you want to respond to that
situation since it was mentioned on an investor call recently. But the question really is more broadly, what
do you say to investors that might be concerned about competition for hydrogen distribution and mobility
applications?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

So first of all, with respect to that specific customer who made those comments, I wish them very good
luck into what they are doing. We have stopped supplying them for a very simple reason, because we
think the product that we have is worth a lot more and we can sell it for a higher price to other people.
Therefore, we are in the business of making money. There was no sense for us to continue to sell
hydrogen at low prices. That's why we have stopped dealing with them. In terms of building their own
plant, as I said, I wish them good luck, and I hope they are successful.

And as far as other people wanting to get into the business, that's perfectly fine. We have been in the
business of making hydrogen for the last 60 years. A lot of people are waking up in the morning and now
want to get into the hydrogen business. I wish them good luck. There is plenty of opportunity, plenty
of demand for this product. And if they want to get into it, they are more than welcome. I don't think
we are concerned about that. We welcome competition. We have competition in everything else we do.
And therefore, I have no concern about that, and I wish everybody good luck who wants to get into the
business. We just have a minor 60 years of head start on them, but that people might consider is not that
significant, but they'll find out what it takes.

Operator

And we'll move on to Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Scott, congratulations. I hope you found a fun place to retire like Cleveland, but -- just one question on
the 2027 goal, Seifi. You've talked about demand being really good for hydrogen and other areas. Is it
possible that, a, you could maybe deploy that capital sooner than '27? Or is it maybe you have to spend
more potentially if demand is going to be that strong?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

So we believe that the demand is very strong, and we do believe that we will commit more than that. So
that's our view.
