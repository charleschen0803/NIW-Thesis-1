As we discuss our growth rates, keep in mind that growth was negatively impacted by a point as we lapped leap year, somewhat offset by the timing of Easter
We generated net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 7% on an FX neutral basis
A one point acceleration and up 6% organically stable versus the prior quarter
We delivered $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 6%, and $488 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 9%
Total Marketplace revenue was $1.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, a one point acceleration versus the prior quarter
While StubHub is facing tougher growth comps in a more challenging near-term event landscape relative to last year, our long-term outlook of high single to low double-digit growth for the platform has not changed
Moving to Slide 10. In Q1, classifieds grew revenue 10%, a three point deceleration versus Q4. We saw a strong growth in eBay Kleinanzeigen, offset by lapping price increases in our motors vertical last year, and continued ad monetization pressure from the ongoing shift to mobile
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers
In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 30%, which is down 340 basis points versus last year driven by a 110 basis points each in product development and G&A
The impact of foreign exchange was felt across all spend category, so I will focus my comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses
As always you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation
On Slide 13. In Q1, we generated $447 million of free cash flow, which was down 7% on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by lower net income and differences in the timing of cash tax payment
We continue to be disciplined capital allocators and align our actions against our capital allocation tenets [ph]
We're excited about the recent announcement of our partnership with Flipkart, and we believe our $500 million investment along with the contribution of our eBay India business, significantly improves our competitive position in a strategically important market
We expect this deal to close early in the second half of 2017, and upon deal close we will no longer report active buyer GMV and related financials for eBay India
However, we do expect to remove approximately 4 million buyers from our active buyer reporting
This growth range takes into account Marketplace volume and revenue growth acceleration offset by StubHub and PayPal operating agreement comparisons
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.45 per share representing year-over-year growth of 0% to 5% on an as reported basis
EPS growth will be driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program offset by our increased investment to drive improved user experiences and to market our brand
For Q2, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.20 to $0.40. Our full-year non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged from January as we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform
The difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP EPS primarily consists of amortization of intangible stock-based compensation and tax impacts from our ongoing legal structure realignment
While growth may not only be perfectly linear, we expect to deliver acceleration in our Marketplaces platform and exit the year having made significant progress in redefining the eBay user experience and brand
Second, our structured data pages on SCO are starting to contribute to new buyer growth, and while not at a material scale yet we are seeing early positive signs
And so, look, the improvements in our buyer funnel have not been linear
I do think that as we look towards the future it might not be linear, but we believe that active buyer growth is one of the metrics to your question that we look at closely and should portend an acceleration in GMV
