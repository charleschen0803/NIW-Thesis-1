BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Boston Scientific Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please
go ahead.

Lauren Tengler
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are
Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer.

We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2021 results, which included
reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well
as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our
website under the heading Financials & Filings. The duration of this call will be approximately 1 hour.

Mike will focus his comments on Q2 performance largely compared to 2019 and Q2 '20, including [ key ]
procedural impact from COVID as well as future catalysts and outlook for our business, including Q3 and
full year '21 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q3
and full year '21 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan
will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone on the call that operational revenue growth excludes the
impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and
divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions for
organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, which closed March 1, 2021; and Vertiflex and
BTG Interventional Medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. Divestitures
include BTG Specialty Pharma due to close -- which closed on March 1, 2021; and the global embolic
microspheres portfolio and intrauterine [ health ] franchise, which were divested in mid-August 2019 and
second quarter 2020, respectively.

Guidance excludes the recently announced Lumenis Surgical acquisition, which is expected to close in the
second half of 2021; and Farapulse acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3 2021, which are subject
to customary closing conditions, including antitrust clearance. For more information, please refer to Slide 9
of our financial operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations [ website ].

On this call, all references to sales and revenue unless otherwise specified are organic. Finally, growth
goals of 6% to 8% ex COVID represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not
materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws,
which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words
and include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and
financial [ results ]; statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches;
acquisitions; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our
financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and
other factors. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section
of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of
today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.

At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Lauren. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report very strong Q2 financial
results as the resumption of elective procedures strengthened in the U.S. and improved in many but not
all of our regions across the globe. We're well positioned for the second half of '21 and beyond as we
continue to execute our category leadership strategy driven by our innovative pipeline, expansion into
faster-growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities.

Total company second quarter operational sales grew 50% versus 2020. Organic sales grew 52% versus
2020 and 9% versus '19, exceeding our expectations as recovery from the pandemic occurred more
quickly than expected, particularly in the U.S. Importantly, 6 of the 7 business units grew double digits
organically versus 2019. We estimate that 5 of our business units grew faster than their respective
markets. We're pleased with our ongoing and new product launches, and we're now enrolling our clinical
trials at pre-COVID run rates.

Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.40 grew 378% versus 2020, 3% versus '19, exceeding the high end of the
guidance by $0.02 primarily due to sales outperformance and lower spend. Adjusted operating margin of
25.1% was slightly ahead of our expectations as we continue to balance investment with sales recovery.
We continue to be pleased with our free cash flow, with second quarter free cash flow generation of $541
million and adjusted free cash flow of [ $838 million ].

Given the second quarter outperformance, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance ranges for
both sales and EPS, which assumes a manageable level of COVID impact in the second half of the year.
Compared to 2020, we're targeting in the third quarter of '21 organic revenue growth of 12% to 14%; and
full year, 19% to 20%. And compared to '19, we're targeting a third quarter '21 organic revenue growth of
5% to 7%; and for the full year, growth of 6% to 7%.

Our third quarter '21 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.39 to $0.41, and we are updating our full year
adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.58 to $1.62. Dan will provide more details on both sales and EPS
performance, including the revenue contribution from Preventice. We continue to expect a third quarter
close for Farapulse and a second half '21 close for Lumenis Surgical.

I'll now provide additional highlights for the second quarter '21 results, along with comments on third
quarter and '21 outlook. Within the regions, on an operational basis versus second quarter '19, the U.S.
grew 22%; Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 9%; Asia Pac grew 4%; and Emerging Markets sales grew
11%.

Organically, in the U.S. -- the U.S. grew 12% versus 2019. The strength was supported by faster-than-
anticipated recovery of procedure volume levels, along with ongoing new [ product ] launches.

Operationally, EMEA delivered an excellent second quarter with broad-based growth across nearly all
major markets and franchises, even as some countries experienced COVID-related lockdowns and
procedural delays. The EMEA region also had double-digit growth in PI, IP -- sorry, PI, EP, endo and
neuromod [ driven ] by products such as ACURATE neo2, TheraSphere, POLARx, AXIOS and WaveWriter
Alpha, with notable strength in Middle East and Africa.

In Asia Pac, although second quarter results included approximately 600 basis points of negative impact
from the China tender pricing versus 2019, 5 of our businesses grew double digits with strong growth in
China, Australia and Korea. While Japan's second quarter results were impacted by COVID, we've seen
success with ongoing and new product launches such as Ranger DCB, StablePoint and WATCHMAN FLX.

China sales grew 16% versus 2019. We saw double-digit growth within all business units with the
exception of Interventional Cardiology, which did include the negative impact of the tender pricing.
We continue to be pleased with our strong growth in Complex PCI and imaging, enabled by our both
innovative portfolio and by the tender win. We continue to expect full year 2021 double-digit growth in
China versus both '19 and '20.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Now I'll provide some comments on the business units. Starting with Uro and Pelvic Health. Sales were
very strong, growing organically 16% versus '19 with balanced growth across the stone, prostate health
and pelvic health franchises. Stone, which is the largest franchise, grew double digits as enthusiasm
continues ahead of the Lumenis acquisition, which will expand our category-leading portfolio with its
differentiated laser technology.

The prostate health franchise grew strong double digits with continued growth in Rezum and SpaceOAR
businesses. Rezum [ growth ] was driven by further traction of its direct-to-patient efforts in the U.S.,
global expansion and [ continued ] appreciation of the long-term durability and cost benefits of this
minimally invasive therapy. Within our SpaceOAR business, growth was supported by the ongoing launch
of our next-generation SpaceOAR Vue Hydrogel in the U.S. and our recent launch in Europe. SpaceOAR
Vue is visible under CT and negates the need for physicians to use MRI. It's an important step to optimize
the treatment plan of patients undergoing prostate radiation therapy.

Our Endoscopy team delivered an excellent second quarter with sales growing organically 15% versus
2019. Q2 sales grew double digits across all major franchises with notable strength in biliary, hemostasis
and infection prevention, thanks to our [ differentiated product ] portfolio, including key products such
as AXIOS, SpyGlass [ DS ] and Resolution hemostasis clips. Within the quarter, we completed CE mark
for Exalt B, and we're pleased with the early launch feedback highlighting differentiated visualization and
suction and remain on track to launch in the U.S. in the second half of this year. We continue to make
progress with Exalt-D, with physician peer training program launched in the second quarter as well as the
resumption of more normal market development activities as access to hospitals improves.

In Cardiac Rhythm Management, sales were down 6% organically versus '19. We believe that our CRM
performance was slightly below the overall market, inclusive of a temporary impact from the recent
EMBLEM S-ICD physician advisory. Importantly, we recently began launching our enhanced S-ICD
electrode and anticipate improved performance in overall CRM in the second half as we expect S-ICD
revenues to rebound.

In our diagnostics franchise, our Lux-Dx implantable cardiac monitor continues to perform very well and
gained share in the U.S. We're also pleased with the strong growth and execution of the Preventice team
and continue to anticipate full year [ growth ] in that business of at least 20% on a pro forma basis versus
'20.

Electrophysiology sales were up 10% versus '19. Strong international sales growth of 29% were driven
by the ongoing success of POLARx in Europe and StablePoint Force Sensing catheter in Europe and
Japan. U.S. EP sales will likely lag market growth until we receive approval for these therapies, which are
currently enrolling in their respective U.S. IDE trials.

We also exercised our option to acquire Farapulse, which is a leader in [ pulsed field ] ablation, which is
an emerging field that has the potential to improve safety, efficacy and ease of use for cardiac ablation
procedures. Farapulse is the only company with a commercially approved [ pulse ablation ] product
in Europe. It's actively enrolling in its U.S. IDE ADVENT trial. We're excited to bring this differentiated
therapy into our EP portfolio in [ quarter 3 ] '21.

In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 14% versus '19. Our pain management franchise accelerated
growth in the second quarter, supported by an ongoing launch of our next-gen WaveWriter Alpha SCS
system, Cognita digital solutions and continued clinical evidence generation. At the NANS midyear
meeting, we released 1 year follow-up data for the COMBO study, demonstrating a sustained high level of
clinical and functional success at 84% responder rate. We also started reporting on the real-world results
of the FAST therapy, which is designed to improve -- provide profound and immediate pain relief.

Beyond advancing outcomes for existing indications, we're pleased with the progress of our SOLIS study,
which is focused on a nonsurgical back population, which started in the first quarter of this year, and [ look
forward ] to beginning our diabetic and peripheral neuropathy [ clinical ] study by the end of the year.
In deep brain stimulation, the business continues to gain share globally and deliver strong double-digit
growth, driven by the launch of the Vercise Genus platform, expansion of our commercial infrastructure
and partnership with [ Brainlab ].

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 10% versus 2019, double-digit growth in Structural Heart
Valves, WATCHMAN and Complex PCI and [ imaging franchises ]. The growth of the WATCHMAN franchise
accelerated sequentially. The impressive growth was driven primarily by increasing hospital and physician
utilization rates in the U.S. and some share gains in Europe. [ Importantly ], nearly all U.S. accounts have
transitioned from WATCHMAN 2.5 and are now using the FLX exclusively.

Additionally, we're pleased with the 2-year results of PINNACLE FLX, which was featured as a late breaker
at TVT, which reinforced our positive 1-year primary outcomes and met its secondary effectiveness
endpoint. We remain excited about the outlook for the WATCHMAN franchise with our next-generation FLX
device, global expansion and continued work toward indication expansion through ongoing clinical trials.
Notably, the OPTION trial comparing WATCHMAN FLX to first-line oral anti-coagulants for patients with
non-valvular AFib who also undergo cardiac ablation procedure recently completed enrollment ahead of
schedule, in spite of challenges presented by the pandemic.

In TAVR, our ACURATE neo2 launch continues to do well in Europe, supported [ in part ] by real-world
data presented at EuroPCR, which demonstrate that the low ACURATE neo2 PVL rate is comparable to
contemporary TAVI devices, with continued low permanent pacemaker [ implantation rates]. These
outcomes were reiterated in the Early neo2 Registry, also presented last week at TVT as a late-breaker.
Sentinel, our cerebral embolic protection device, achieved its highest quarterly sales to date with strong
new account openings globally. We continue to enroll in the Protected TAVR randomized clinical trial.

Coronary therapies declined mid-single digits versus '19, attributable to drug-eluting stents, which
included the impact of the China tenders and global price pressure. We continue to see strong growth in
Complex PCI and [ imaging, with particular ] strength in ROTAPRO and IVUS. [ Importantly ], our global
Complex PCI and imaging business is now [ about ] 50% larger than our DES business. We're advancing
opportunities for future growth drivers and within the quarter began enrollment in our AGENT DCB trial,
which is a first in the U.S. study of coronary in-stent restenosis.

Peripheral Interventions delivered organic sales up 10% versus second quarter '19. Within interventional
oncology, TheraSphere grew by 30% versus 2019 on a pro forma basis in its first full quarter post PMA
approval. In venous, Varithena continues to grow double digits and gain share in the varicose vein market.
Within arterial, our drug-eluting portfolio achieved record sales in the second quarter, supported by global
expansion along with the sector's continuing [ recovery ]. We're pleased to have started enrollment
on the Elegance registry, a study that will gather clinical evidence on the risk of PAD in [ previously ]
underrepresented patient populations. The study will also look at long-term outcomes of patients being
treated with Eluvia DES or Ranger DCB.

I'd also like to highlight Boston Scientific's recent inclusion on the JUST Capital Top 100 list of companies
which supports healthy families and communities, along with our recognition as a Best Place to Work for
Disability Inclusion. We're proud to be recognized for providing our employees an inclusive and supportive
environment and remain committed to global sustainable practices.

Overall, we're pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, and we remain bullish on
the long-range outlook for Boston Scientific. We look forward to sharing our strategic plan objectives at
our hybrid Investor Day event on September 22. I'd like to extend a big thank you to our employees for
their contributions and winning spirit.

I'll turn the call over to Dan.

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $3.077 billion represents 53.6% reported revenue
growth versus the second quarter of 2020 [ and reflects ] an $81 million tailwind from foreign exchange.
On an operational basis, revenue growth was 49.6% in the quarter. Sales from the Preventice acquisition
[ contributed ] 240 basis points, more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, resulting
in 52.4% organic revenue growth, above our guidance range of [ 44% to 48% ] growth versus 2020.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Compared to the second quarter 2019, organic growth was 8.9%, above our guidance range of 3% to 6%.
This 8.9% growth excludes $15 million in 2019 sales of the divested [ intrauterine ] health and embolic
beads business as well as $178 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, which consists of 2 months
of Vertiflex and a full quarter of BTG Interventional Medicine and Preventice. Top line results drove Q2
adjusted earnings per share of $0.40, representing 378% growth versus 2020, 3% growth versus 2019
and exceeding our guidance range of $0.36 to $0.38.

Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.5%, slightly above our expectations, driven by sales
outperformance in higher-margin business. As expected, we have materially worked through the COVID-
driven negative manufacturing variances capitalized in our balance sheet in 2020 and as a result, expect
slight improvements in second half gross margin compared to the first half, though still not at full year
2019 level as other headwinds remained, in particular the lingering cost of running plants with COVID-
specific measures as well as some impact from inflation. Not unique to us, this inflation [ includes ] items
like increased freight costs, selective wage pressure and some price increase on direct materials.

Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.1%, slightly above our expectations, driven by sales
outperformance and balanced investment and also includes a reserve for legal settlement that we expect
will improve access to additional markets for some of our cardiovascular technology. GAAP charges within
the quarter additionally included $298 million in litigation-related expenses to account for incremental
costs to resolve newly estimable claims as well as known claims and corresponding legal fees within our
legal reserve. Materially, all U.S. claims remain settled or at the final stages of settlement.

Our reserves assumptions are based on full global resolution now in 2023 given recent claim activity
and expected litigation. Our total legal reserve was $617 million as of June 30, an increase $162 million
versus March 31, driven by the mesh reserve increase and cardiovascular settlement, partially offset by
payments to close substantially all of the state attorneys general mesh settlement as well as continuing
mesh product liability payments.

Moving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $107 million, in line with
expectations. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 11.1% on an adjusted basis, also in line with
expectations.

Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $838 million, and free cash flow was $541 million, with $643
million from operating activities less $102 million of net capital expenditures. Our goal remains to deliver
adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020 of approximately $2 billion as we continue to expect increased
working capital headwinds in inventory and accounts receivable during the remainder of the year.

As of June 30, 2021, we had cash on hand of $2.7 billion. Our top priority for capital deployment remains
tuck-in M&A, We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Lumenis Surgical i the second half of the
year and Farapulse in Q3. We have capacity to pursue additional business development opportunities
while continuing to remain active with our venture capital [ portfolio ] and consider opportunistic share
repurchases. We ended Q2 with 1,432 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2020. In the full year, we expect 2021 operational
revenue growth to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 50
basis point headwind from divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals,
partially offset by the acquisition of [ Preventice ]. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures,
we expect to organic revenue growth to be in the range of 19% to 20% versus 2020 and versus 6% to 7%
versus 2019.

For organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales million exclude [ $50 million ] in sales of our embolic
beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales.
And at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $490 million in sales from recent
acquisitions, including Vertiflex through May, BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August and
Preventice as of March as well as $13 million of Specialty Pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture.

For Q3 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range 11% to 13% versus 2020, which
includes an approximately net 100 basis point headwind from Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

by the acquisition of Preventice. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic
revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 14% versus 2020 and 5% to 7% growth versus 2019, which
includes a 300 basis point sequential comp headwind from Q2 to Q3 2019. Therefore, the midpoint of
guidance assumes results in line with Q2 with a continued manageable level of [ COVID impact ].

For the Q3 organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $35 million in sales of our embolic beads
portfolio, intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals. And at the midpoint of guidance,
2021 sales exclude approximately $110 million in sales from the acquisitions of BTG Interventional
Medicines through mid-August and Preventice.

For adjusted operating margin, we continue to target an average of 26% in the back half of 2021 while
simultaneously investing to more normalized operating expense level as the first half of 2021 remained
below what we would expect for near-term run rate. We continue to forecast our full year 2021 operational
tax rate to be approximately 11% and our all-in tax rate to be approximately 10%. We continue to expect
adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital
portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program, to be approximately $400 million to $425 million
for the year.

We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1, 437 billion shares for Q3 2021
to 1,435 billion shares for the full year 2021. We are raising full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance to
a range of $1.58 to $1.62, which includes our updated sales guidance and considers Q2 results, which
remove additional uncertainty from our previously wider range. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings
per share is expected to be in a range of $0.39 to $0.41. Please check our Investor Relations website for
Q2 '21 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q2 results.

With that, I'll turn it back to our newly appointed Vice President of Investor Relations, congratulations,
Lauren, very well deserved, to moderate [ Q&A ].

Lauren Tengler
Director of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can you hear me okay?

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes.

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

We hear you fine, Bob.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congrats on the strong quarter, and congrats to Lauren. So first question for Mike and Dan is just
wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your back half 2021 assumptions. You mentioned that
you assume a manageable level of COVID. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what that
means.

Does that mean specifically that you assume things get a little worse from what you're seeing today? Or
do you assume things stay about the same?

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

I think if you look at the numbers, Bob -- and I think a lot of it has to do with the comps, right? If you look
at our comps from 2019 quarter by quarter, they're 6%, 6%, 9%, 7%. And so we put up effectively a 9%
in Q2 versus a 6% in 2019. If you look at our guidance for Q3, it's 5% to 7%. So just take the midpoint of
6%. That's against the comp of a 6%, which is -- of a 9%, which is 300 basis points harder.

So in theory, the 6% effectively becomes a 9% when you adjust for comps, which is kind of what we did
in Q2. And I won't go through the whole process, but the implied Q4 ends up in a similar range. So I think
what you're hearing us say is that -- Q2, that the impact of COVID was manageable. You heard Mike's
comments that the recovery was very strong, particularly in the U.S. And what our guidance would imply
is that for the most part, it continues in the back half. So manageable COVID impact would be a quarter
similar to what you saw in Q2.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. So it sounds like you think -- sorry, go ahead, Mike.

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

No, I just -- does that track and make sense for you?

10

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Yes. It sounds like you're assuming that things will basically stay the same. They don't get worse from
what you just said, which...

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

Correct. That's correct.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up question is I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit
more about WATCHMAN trends in the quarter. It sounds like things went really well, but just curious if you
maybe could provide a growth rate over 2019. Just curious for kind of flushing out the experience with
WATCHMAN in the quarter a little bit more. And if you can quantify it at all, that would be helpful.

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, sure. Yes. We won't be providing a growth rate on '19, but overall, the plans with WATCHMAN FLX
have gone exceedingly well. As we mentioned, the U.S. has really been fully converted at this point, which
happened ahead of schedule. And we enrolled the OPTION trial ahead of schedule.

But the big benefit we're seeing is with the ease of use and the safety profile of FLX, the utilization of
WATCHMAN FLX in the U.S. accounts in particular continues to increase. So we do have some small new
incremental account openings. But far and away, the bulk of the growth in the U.S. is being driven by
increasing physician utilization and penetration rates. And we recently have some approval in Japan. And
so we're starting to get some minor impact from Japan, which will get more so in the second half as well
as in 2022.

But it's really being driven by, the utilization rate, the safety profile, physician comfort with the device
and training new physicians at existing facilities. So current doctors are doing more WATCHMAN, and
new doctors at the same facilities are being trained on WATCHMAN. And the referral base, the physician
community is becoming more and more comfortable and aware as are patients with this treatment. So we
pegged this growth of this segment to be likely plus 30% growth. And we continue to expect to do well in
it, but it's an exciting platform for us.

The next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. I'll add my congratulations on a really nice quarter. Two for me. First, it looks like you had great
growth in the U.S. with 12% organic over 2019. I was wondering. Maybe you could just give us an
overview of where you're seeing the recovery.

Are you seeing any lagging trends from Delta variant? And is there any discrepancy in inpatient versus
outpatient? You're one of the first to report here with such a global covering and diverse offering. I think
it'd be really [ instructful ] as we think about the rest of the year and the guidance.

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So just broadly, we saw terrific results in the U.S., very strong results in Europe despite the
lockdowns in Europe and despite more COVID impact in Europe. That business grew 9% organic. And
we had the most significant COVID impacts in Asia, in ASEAN countries and Japan in particular, with
Korea, Australia doing well as was China. So we saw more COVID impact broadly in Asia Pac and a strong
recovery in the U.S.

And then in terms of the U.S., to your question there, we really -- with the exception of EP, we think
every business globally and in the U.S. grew double digit organically versus '19 and likely gained share in
their respective markets with the exception of potentially EP and CRM. But EP grew share in international
markets.

And in the -- if you break down -- if you look at uro and endo particularly and also PI, where we have
a more substantial ASC business and outpatient business, you saw 15% -- 16% growth in uro, 15% in
endo and 10% organic in PI with strong growth compares here. So I would say, in the U.S., we saw a
nice rebound both in the hospital setting, which I think has been verified by many of the public company
hospital chains reporting prior to us, and we saw strong growth in the outpatient/ASC center as well.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And maybe a follow-up for Dan and a suggestion. Dan, I think some of us had a little trouble
hearing the nuanced guidance you gave. If you guys want to send out your prepared remarks, I think
that'd be really helpful for all the investors.

But maybe just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned higher input costs in COGS, so improving in second
half versus first half but maybe not all the way quite up to 2019. How are you thinking about the
company's ability to absorb and pass on some of those costs? And do you think that's going to be an issue
going into 2022 as we exit the year here? Because you did have great expense control down the P&L, just
thinking about the cost component.

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Sure. Thanks, Robbie. Relative to gross margin, so we averaged 69.8% in the first half. And I think
we feel comfortable that we'll improve upon that here in the second half of '21.

Specific to what's going on in gross margin, we will have the tailwind of the COVID-related variances
that we put on the balance sheet during 2020. Those are amortized over your inventory turns. And so
effectively, as of 6/30 this year, the end of Q2, those are gone. So that's good news.

We do still have some COVID-specific lingering costs of running plants in a COVID environment. So COVID
is not completely done, obviously, as you know. And so we do have those, and those are adding costs.
And then as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not unique to us, we do have some pockets of inflation,
and -- particularly with freight, where we just need more commercial airliners to be flying than are flying
today. We have wage pressure in certain locations. And then direct materials, particularly precious metals
and things like that, we're seeing inflation there.

So we do have some headwinds. But overall, as we look at the back half of '21, we would assume we
would improve versus that 69.8% average in the first half. And then as it relates to '22 and beyond, I
would envision we'll give you a more detailed review of that in Investor Day on the 22nd of September.

Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter, and congrats to Lauren. Just one follow-up on the investor meeting in September.
Maybe Dan or Mike, just level set us kind of what we should expect. Will you provide an update to your
financial goals and pipeline? And any reason to think the algorithm of 6% to 8% sales and 50 to 100 basis
points margin improvement with double-digit EPS growth has changed? And I have one follow-up.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

We'll be there, Mike.

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

No. We expect to, as we've done in previous years, provide an update on our portfolio across the
company, give some visibility to the long-range strategy and financial goals, similar to what we've done
historically. So we would look to provide some more updated 3-year sales guidance, what we think margin
improvement will look like. But more importantly, you'll hear from the business unit presidents on portfolio
and innovation across the company.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just for my follow-up, Mike. On Lumenis and Farapulse, why was this the right time to acquire
both? What's the outlook for Lumenis? Is -- that $200 million you said for sales in 2021, is that net after
your distribution agreement?

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I have to verify that number. We'll get the -- I don't know what you've said about the number in the
past in terms of the Lumenis net number, so we'll -- let's circle back on that one.

But the timing just strategically, it makes perfect sense. I think that the group is aware of this. We had a
distribution agreement with Lumenis in the U.S., distribution agreement with them in China, which was
effective, but therefore, we weren't getting the same level of gross margin benefit that we wanted nor
could we innovate on the platform and I guess, tie it more comprehensively into our StoneSmart platform.

So by owning it, we obviously improve our gross margins. We can drive a more robust product road map
within our StoneSmart ecosystem, and then we can expand our direct coverage in Europe and especially in
China, where they have a very big business. So that makes sense.

And what did we say here, Lauren?

Lauren Tengler
Director of Investor Relations

We only disclosed the full year gross number of $200 million for 2021. We did not disclose the net, Larry.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And Farapulse, Mike?

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

So Farapulse, we expect that to close pretty soon here early in the third quarter. I won't go too far on it.
We're really excited about. It's the only approved platform in Europe in the pulsed field ablation field. And
they're enrolling ahead of schedule in the U.S. clinical trial.

The physician community -- and Dr. Stein's on the phone. He can comment on it. I don't know, Ken, if you
-- Dr. Stein, if you're on the phone, maybe you want to provide a quick update on Farapulse.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

Yes. Absolutely, Mike. I think the pulsed field ablation and particularly, the Farapulse approach to pulsed
field ablation is the most exciting thing to come along in ablation really since ablation. What Farapulse
has demonstrated in a wealth of clinical data to date, over 100 patients in clinical trials that have
been reported out publicly, is a very high expectation that this is going to be safer than other thermal
approaches to ablation and because of the safety, a much more straightforward procedure for physicians.
So quicker procedure for physicians and is, again, likely to be at least as effective and probably more
effective than other technologies.

So given that, we're extremely excited and optimistic about their approach. And as Mike said, given
that they are the only approved technology in Europe, given that they're executing so well on their
clinical trials, by exercising the option now and again, hopefully closing in the near future, we have the
opportunity now to help them scale up distribution and production and again, the ability to help them
continue to execute their clinical trials and get to U.S. approval in a timely fashion.

The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Mike, congrats on the quarter here. One on a high level. If I just look at the 2Q performance in the back
half implied guide, we did 9% in 2Q versus pre-pandemic 2019. Back half implied is 7% to 9%. I mean
we're already running -- if I look at the 2Q to 4Q performance, we're already running well north of 8%.
Preventice, Lumenis, once these deals become organic, they should be incremental, plus you have these
pipelines. I guess when I look at the LRP of 6% to 8%, shouldn't these results provide a high degree of
confidence in upper end of the LRP on the top line going forward?

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, I think we're not going to comment specifically within the range of 6% to 8%. Obviously,
we'll, as Mike said, probably tee that up for an Investor Day conversation relative to the portfolio and the
overall results. So I don't think it would serve us well to comment relative to the specifics in there. But the
strength of the portfolio and the pipeline is what's given us the confidence to put up the numbers that we
put up in the past and obviously, looking forward, give us the confidence in the revenue growth trajectory
for the future. So -- but specific to where in the range, I don't think I'll go there.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood, Dan. Just one on margins maybe. When should gross margins get back to pre-pandemic
levels? Or perhaps on operating margins, just given the commentary around freight inflationary pressures,
should '22 operating margins be at 2019 levels?

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean if you think of the back half of this year, that's what we're calling for, Vijay. So we're calling for
an average in the back half of '21 to be at our full year 2019 level, which was, call it, around 26%. So the
goal is to do that in the back half of '21 and set us up for '22 and beyond.

Gross margin, as we said, it was 69.8% in the first half. It will be improving on that in the second half. So
when does that get back to specific 2019 levels? We'll -- again, we'll give more details at Investor Day. But
if you think at the overall operating margin level, the thing that we've proven time and time again over
history is that we make the effective trade-offs through the P&L. So if you think back 4, 5, 6 years ago,
gross margin was growing very nicely and -- as a percentage of sales, and we were investing in places like
the emerging markets and other areas.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 27, 2021

So SG&A was sometimes actually increasing as a percentage of sales, but still delivered very solid
operating margin progression through that time frame. So it may shift a little bit as we go forward. Maybe
gross margin doesn't pay as many of the bill, so to speak. But SG&A, potentially with lower travel spend
and other trade-offs that we'll make in addition to more efficient R&D spend, the goal is always to have
operating margins increase year-over-year, and I think our track record speaks for itself on that.

The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley.

Cecilia E. Furlong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to ask about SCS trialing trends and really just what you've seen from a relative recovery versus
other more elective procedures in the quarter. And then kind of tying in also just Vertiflex, what type of
traction you've seen recently?

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. We haven't had all the competitors report in that field, so we're not exactly sure how we grew
versus the competitive set. But we had a strong acceleration in 2Q. U.S. -- overall in the quarter. And I
think part of it is a combination of the unique portfolio that we have with the new launches, the new FAST
algorithms that I detailed in the script that you may have had difficulty hearing so we're going to send it
out to people, but a combination of the new FAST algorithms as well as the clinical work that we're doing.

So SCS overall improved versus first quarter. And then it was augmented, as you've mentioned, with
Vertiflex's growth in the quarter as well as continued growth in our RF portfolio. The RF portfolio, although
a bit smaller, continues to exceed expectations.

And then the other really big growth driver for neuromod in the quarter was our deep brain stimulation
business, and it's really impressive what that group has done. They continue to gain market share, really
the #1 de novo player in Europe and close to that now in the U.S. And they continue to accelerate market
share gains through the innovation of that business. So the DBS probably had the largest snapback of any
business in the second quarter with the COVID impact waning in the U.S. But overall, the SCS market and
the pain side did quite well as well. But we'll see the other competitors report, but we're impressed with
the sequential growth that we saw.

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And happy overall with the 14% growth versus 2019 for all of that neuromod business that Mike just
detailed.

Cecilia E. Furlong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And you also called out Rezum in your prepared remarks. Could you just comment a bit more, just
what you've seen from recent procedure trends and procedure recovery trajectory coming out of COVID?

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I think with our Rezum business, we continue to drive increased growth there. The overall uro
business had a big bounce back in the quarter, growing 16%. And the big things that we're focused on
with Rezum is we're continuing to drive improved reimbursement rates with some of the specific payers,
which is helping.

But it's also the long-term durability data, and that's giving physicians more confidence in the product
that's driving the growth. And we've also expanded our international footprint with Rezum, particularly in
Europe and also some additional DTP, direct-to-patient and direct-to-physician, marketing campaigns to

Rezum.

The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter, and also congrats to Lauren. To follow up on Bob's question, I understand the
comps versus 2018 (sic) [ 2019 ] for 3Q is a challenging 9%. But we also heard from the public hospitals
that June is the best month of the quarter and strong June trends continue into July. So just curious,
as you look at your third quarter guidance, are you seeing normal 3Q seasonality? Or are you simply
assuming that you'll see it at some point during the quarter?

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I appreciate the question. We're just not going to comment kind of intra quarter as we sit here in the
third quarter. I think the answer to Bob's question, the short answer is we're expecting the trends that
we saw in the second quarter to continue. We're not going to parse it month by month. We're expecting
the overall trend of that growth rate to continue comp adjusted in the back half of '21. But specific to the
month versus month, we're not going to get into that -- those specifics.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. A quick question on EXALT-D. I understand the markets have been pretty dynamic sort
of last year sort of due to COVID. But sort of 2 questions. How many accounts are you selling EXALT-D
into at this point? And those accounts, what is the market share reorder rate of those accounts? And as
you watch EXALT-D, how much revenue contribution should we assume in the back half of the year?

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We're probably frustrating you. We're not prepared to share that information with you. On EXALT-
D, just as you've heard in previous quarterly updates, the team continues to make progress. As COVID
impact is improving, although -- hopefully, the Delta variant isn't too much. But as approved in the U.S.,
we have seen more of an uptick in traction with EXALT-D as physicians are becoming more comfortable
with it. The training and the capital placements have gone well, so you're seeing an uptick in EXALT-D
usage.

And then in the second half of '21, you'll see an enhancement, a next release -- or next-generation
release, if you will, of EXALT-D to further improve the platform. So we expect to see continued momentum
with that. The big news for us is the recent approval of EXALT-D in some sites that tried it for the first time
in Europe, and we're really bullish on that platform. That's an established market with a few competitors,
but we think we have some differentiated capabilities with EXALT-D. And so in the second half of '21 and
much more so in '22, you'll see the impact of that platform as well. So it's all going to plan, but we're all --
we're seeing some improved momentum with EXALT-D in the U.S. as COVID is improving.

Chairman, President & CEO

We can.

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

We hear you fine.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Excellent. It looked to us like when we compare the delivery versus consensus, the 2 areas that might be
lagging a little bit are EP and CRM. But I also remember that there are a number of key products in those
sections. Can you highlight 1 or 2 that might bring you back into sort of the market taker or gain position?

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Well, you nailed it. We think every one of our businesses with the exception -- well, EP grew double
digits versus '19, but likely globally, that's below market. In CRM, we think we're a little bit below market.
With the exception of those 2, we think every other one grew faster than market.

On EP, I think you'll see a similar trend likely for the next couple of years in that we expect the -- our
EP results in the international markets to exceed market growth, which we think they did in the second
quarter on the heels of our cryo platform. We're now the only competitor to the established player in cryo,
and we're taking share there. And then our StablePoint, which is our Force Sensing catheters approved
in Europe. And as previous question, we'll be closing the Farapulse deal in early third quarter, and they're
commercial in Europe. So the 3 distinct technologies that are quite differentiated will be our IRE platform
with Farapulse upon closure, our cryo and StablePoint in Europe.

And we also expect to see a benefit of cryo in Japan towards the end of '21 and full year '22. So our
international business, which is now bigger than our U.S. business in EP, will grow faster than market.
And our U.S. business will likely lag market until we get those products approved. And all those products
are in clinical trial right now, and thankfully, as COVID has improved, the clinical trial run rates of those
platforms have increased significantly over the past 100 days. So that will be the balance in EP: really
strong outside the U.S., less so in the U.S. likely for the coming earnings calls.

In CRM, we think our performance in the second half of this year will improve versus what you saw in the
second quarter. And the primary reason for that is the S-ICD advisory that we had, which caused sales to
lag a bit in the S-ICD segment for us, which is a big segment for us globally. And now we have a new lead
that is being implanted now across -- in Europe and the U.S. And we expect our third quarter and fourth
quarter S-ICD results to improve quite a bit versus second quarter, which will improve the overall growth
rate of our CRM business and likely take us closer to market growth rates for all of CRM.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And my second question also is product related. If I had to say to you what are the 3 products you want
us to focus on over the next 6 to 12 months, what would your answer be?

Michael F. Mahoney
Chairman, President & CEO

If I only have to pick 3, I think WATCHMAN is number one given the scale of it, the growth profile we
see and this enthusiasm. I would say within PI, the BTG acquisition has exceeded expectations and the
TheraSphere segment within -- in particular and Varithena are doing extremely well.

And then if you give me a third one, there's lots of different areas to speak to. I think -- yes. I think just
overall in the -- I know it's super early, but we're very bullish on the combination of cryo and Farapulse,
although not in the U.S. yet. That market is so large and the growth profile of EP is so good that we'll

The next question comes from Travis Steed with Barclays.

Travis Lee Steed
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I appreciate some of the longer-term comments you gave on operating margins. Just curious what the
base we should be using for that 50% -- or 50 basis points of margin expansion per year, if we should
think about that 26% in the back half here. So thinking about The Street, somewhere in 26.5% next year
would be a reasonable place to be at this point?

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I wouldn't comment on '22. But for '21, I think the reasonable basis as a starting point would be
that 26%. That's what we're kind of resetting to here in the back half. It's where we were in 2019, and it
should be a nice jumping-off point for 2022. Yes, I would agree with you there, Travis.

Travis Lee Steed
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to make sure the message was clear on the full year guidance and
the guidance raise. So you're going from 2% to 5% for the full year versus 2019 to 6% to 7%. Is that all
coming from the Q2 beat and so basically, the back half expectations are staying the same? Or are you
actually seeing more confidence here in the back half versus your original expectations?

Daniel J. Brennan
Executive VP & CFO

No, I think if you go back to the original guidance back in February and for the most part, reiterated
in April, it was COVID impact in Q1, less COVID impact in Q2 and then a more -- a return to more
normalized procedure volumes in Q3 and Q4. I think we got a little bit of that early as our results would
point to versus our guidance ranges for Q2. And then if you take what we're saying about the back half,
which we say is the same type of COVID impact and pretty much the same type of results in Q3 and Q4 as
in Q2, it's a broad-based story of Q2, Q3, Q4. It's not just Q2.
