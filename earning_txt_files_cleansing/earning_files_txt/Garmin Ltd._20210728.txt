Presentation

Operator

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Garmin Ltd. Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Teri Seck, Manager of Investor Relations. Please
go ahead.

Teri Seck
Manager of Investor Relations

Good morning, everyone. We would like to welcome you to Garmin Ltd.'s Second Quarter 2021 Earnings
Call. Please note that the earnings press release and related slides are available at Garmin's Investor
Relations site on the Internet at www.garmin.com/stock. An archive of the webcast and related transcript
will also be available on our website.

This earnings call includes projections and other forward-looking statements regarding Garmin Ltd. and
its business. Any statements regarding our future financial position, revenues, earnings, gross margins,
operating margins, future dividends, market shares, product introductions, future demand for our products
and plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking events and circumstances
discussed in this earnings call may not occur, and actual results could differ materially as a result of
risk factors affecting Garmin. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our Form 10-
K and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, there is significant
uncertainty about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that results could
change at any time, and any statement about the impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results
and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date.

Presenting on behalf of Garmin Ltd. this morning are Cliff Pemble, President and Chief Executive Officer;
and Doug Boessen, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Cliff Pemble.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue
and operating income for the second quarter. Consolidated revenue increased 53% over the prior year and
exceeded $1.3 billion. We experienced strong double-digit growth in all 5 business segments. Profitability
in the quarter was also strong. Operating margin expanded to 28% and operating income increased 97%
to $371 million.

There are 2 important things to consider when looking at our Q2 performance. First, Q2 of 2020 was
negatively impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced consumer demand and
disrupted our retail partners. As a result, a portion of the current period growth is attributable to the
unusual comparable from the prior year. Second, the compound annual growth rate from 2019 to 2021
was 18% for the period, which is very much in line with recent trends during quarters less impacted by the
dynamics of the pandemic. We believe this indicates that the underlying market is healthy and continues
to grow.

To meet the growing demand for our products, I'm pleased to report that later this fall, we plan to open
a fourth production facility in Taiwan, which will approximately double our capacity. This is part of a
multiyear initiative to improve our capacity and prepare for opportunities that lie ahead. Also, we entered
a new phase of our Olathe facility expansion to convert the former warehouse building into additional
office space. These projects follow the recent completion of other notable investments, including a new
production facility for Tacx cycling trainers, our new auto OEM production facility in Europe and the
expansion of our Olathe facility to include auto OEM production.

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we're updating our full year guidance. We
now anticipate revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, up 17% over the prior year, with double-digit
growth expected in each of our 5 business segments. In a moment, Doug will provide more details on our
financial results and updated guidance. But first, I'll provide a few brief remarks on the performance and
outlook of our business segments.

Starting with fitness. Revenue increased 40% to $413 million, with growth across all categories, led by
cycling products and advanced wearables. During the quarter, we celebrated Global Running Day with the
launch of 2 new running watches, the Forerunner 55 and the Forerunner 945 LTE. The Forerunner 945 LTE
is noteworthy because it includes built-in connectivity and leverages the safety monitoring capability of
our recent GEOS acquisition. We also launched the Venu 2 smartwatch in 2 sizes, which will enhance the
appeal of these devices across a broader range of customers. Given the strong performance of the fitness
segment, we're raising our revenue growth estimate to 17% for the year.

Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 57% to $323 million, with growth across all categories, led by
adventure watches. During the quarter, we launched our smallest dive watch, the Descent Mk2S, featuring
multiple dive modes, multisport training and smartwatch features for everyday use. Given the strong
performance of the outdoor segment, we are raising our revenue growth estimate to 17% for the year.

Looking next at aviation. Revenue increased 43% to $181 million and we experienced growth in both OEM
and aftermarket categories. Revenue in the quarter was comparable to the levels achieved in the second
quarter of 2019, which is significant considering the impact ADS-B had on 2019 performance. During the
quarter, Autoland was awarded the prestigious Robert J. Collier Trophy as the year's greatest achievement
in the fields of aeronautics or astronautics. Autoland is the first certified autonomous system designed to
activate during an emergency to safely fly and land the aircraft without human intervention.

We also announced the acquisition of AeroData, a leading provider of performance information for
commercial aircraft serving more than 135 airlines worldwide. AeroData broadens our presence in
commercial, and we look forward to building on their success. We're pleased with how the aviation
segment has recovered from the impact of the pandemic and the completion of the ADS-B mandate. We
now expect full year revenue to increase approximately 10%.

Turning next to the marine segment. Revenue increased 66% to $262 million, with growth across multiple
categories led by chartplotters. During the quarter, we announced support for Mercury's SmartCraft
engines, expanding the list of engines compatible with our display systems. We also launched the MSC 10
marine satellite compass, which provides precise position and heading information without the interference
challenges associated with traditional magnetic compass systems. The marine segment is off to a great
start in 2021, and we expect that demand will continue to be strong throughout the remainder of the year.
With this in mind, we expect full year revenue to increase approximately 27%.

And looking finally at auto. Revenue increased 74% to $148 million, with growth contributions from both
consumer categories and new OEM programs. During the quarter, we launched our first connected dash
cam with Live View monitoring and premium subscription-based cloud storage. Given the strong start to
the year, we now expect the auto segment to increase approximately 15%.

In summary, we're very pleased with our performance so far, which gives us confidence to raise our
guidance for the year. In addition, we are investing for the future by expanding both our production
capacity and office facilities, so we are well positioned to seize opportunities that lie ahead.

That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results
and our updated guidance. Doug?

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results,
provide comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes and our updated guidance. We
posted revenue of $1.327 billion for the second quarter, representing a 53% increase year-over-year.
Gross margin was 58.8%, a 50 basis point decrease from the prior year quarter. Operating expense as

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

a percentage of sales was 30.9%, a 670 basis point decrease in the prior quarter. Operating income was
$371 million, a 97% increase. Operating margin was 28%, a 630 basis point increase. Our GAAP EPS was
$1.64 and pro forma EPS was $1.68.

Next, we look at our second quarter revenue by segment and geography. We have a highly diverse
business model, provide a rich set of opportunities and reduce our reliance on single markets and product
lines. Fitness is our largest segment, contributing 31% of the sales in the second quarter, followed by
outdoor at 24%. During the second quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in all of our segments, led by
auto with 74% growth. By geography, the Americas region contributed about 1/2 of our revenue with the
remaining coming from EMEA and APAC. We achieved double-digit growth in all 3 regions, led by strong
growth of 72% in APAC, followed by 53% in Americas and 46% in EMEA.

Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $83 million or
25%. Research and development increased $35 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering
personnel costs across all of our segments. SG&A increased $34 million compared to the prior year
quarter, a decrease as a percentage of sales of 12.5%, a 270 basis point decrease compared to the prior
year. Increase in SG&A was primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses and information
technology costs. Advertising expense increased approximately $14 million due to higher spend in the
fitness and outdoor segments.

A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and
marketable securities of approximately $3.2 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-
over-year to $737 million due to strong second quarter sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially
and year-over-year to $939 million, primarily due to raw material requirements. During the second quarter
of 2021, we generated free cash flow of $120 million, a $22 million decrease from the prior year quarter.
Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $110 million. We expect full year 2021 free cash flow
to be approximately $750 million and capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to be invested
in expansion projects that Cliff previously mentioned. During the second quarter of 2021, we reported an
effective tax rate of 14.8% compared to the prior year quarter GAAP tax rate of 6.8% and pro forma tax
rate of 14%.

Turning next to our full year guidance. We estimate revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, an increase of
17% from the prior year, with double-digit growth in each of our segments. We expect gross margin to
be approximately 58.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance of 59.2% due to higher supply chain
costs. We expect an operating margin of approximately 23.8%. Also, we expect pro forma effective tax
rate of 11.5%, which is higher than our previous guidance of 10.5% due to income mix by jurisdiction.
This results in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $5.50.
This concludes our formal remarks. Valerie, could you please open the line for Q&A?

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Chung of JPMorgan.

Paul Chung
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great quarter. So just on the Forerunner 945 LTE, can you give some insights on how that product is
doing? What percent of customers are repeat versus new? And then on the monthly LTE contract, how
does the margin profile there shake out? And what percent of customers are opting for the LTE function?
And is the strategy to kind of expand LTE to the fenix and other watches and expand the subscription
service? And I have a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Paul, I think that it's early days for the 945 LTE. So really not a lot to say yet about the results there,
and we don't provide results by product category anyway. But I would say that in terms of the kind of
customer that will buy this product is a customer that's specifically interested in the safety story that
Garmin offers. With the integration with our GEOS subsidiary that we recently acquired, it allows us to
offer now with the connectivity and end-to-end solution for people that want real-time monitoring of their
activities and also the ability to summon safety help if they need it.

So that's the kind of customer that would take that product. And again, it's early days, and I really can't
speak to the road map right now, but it's something that is compatible with the approach we've taken with
our inReach product line in terms of safety monitoring for active lifestyles.

Paul Chung
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then on aviation, you're approaching '19 levels of revenue and a very nice rebound in
operating margins. Should we expect to see operating margins kind of hit north of 30% as we navigate
through the balance of the year? Or are there some different dynamics or product mix going on with less
ADS-B benefit? And then on AeroData, how much contribution should we expect there? And talk about any
cross-selling opportunities you see with that existing customer base?

And then finally, on Autoland, can this be another kind of ADS-B type of opportunity? I've seen very high
ASPs for this product. So assumed not as large of an adoption there, but where is the penetration rate
you think that goes? And does Aerofit -- AeroData kind of fit in here in terms of improving the overall
performance of this feature?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So in terms of operating margin, it's come up in this period because of the additional sales leverage
that we have. And our aviation team has, of course, worked very hard on managing expenses during a
pretty difficult challenge that we faced. But that said, we don't forecast really the operating margin that
we have for the future other than to say we strive to be and expect to be very profitable. It will depend on
the investments that we make in the programs and the new products that we're doing in aviation.

In terms of AeroData contribution, it's a small adder, but an important one because it's very important
performance calculations that are done for commercial flights that help airlines conserve fuel and also
provide safety escape procedures for engine out during takeoff. And so that's a critical function that's
required in commercial aviation, and it's something that we think we can expand to business aviation as
well.

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

And then finally, on Autoland. Autoland is delivering on 3 models right now, the TBMs, the SFs from Cirrus
and then the M600 from Piper. And of course, in those models, it's 100%. This is not an option. So the
market is growing rapidly. The number of aircraft out there is growing with the delivery of those models
and they're very popular models. In terms of the AeroData part of that, they aren't closely connected to
Autoland per se, but AeroData in business aircraft would be something that's an enhancer from a safety
and performance point of view.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

Doug, could you tell us a little bit about how you would characterize the current supply situation on
components? Inventory was up, it looks like a lot of it was raw materials. But how did that influence --
that availability influence 2Q? How do you think about what that could do for the remainder of the fiscal
year? And then I have a follow-up.

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I'll give you a little flavor on the inventory. Yes, the reason that inventory is up year-over-year is due
to raw material requirements. We're looking at making securing our raw material requirements to make
sure that we're meeting the increased demand.

I'd say as it relates to the supply chain situation, that is something that we're managing very effectively
on a daily basis just to making sure that we do have the appropriate components to meet that demand.
As I think about the rest of the year, as it relates to inventory, I think it will increase some even more
than what we have today, probably a -- probably increase more than what our sales level is going to be
and probably just a rough number, probably close to $1 billion probably by the end of the year. But it's
something that we're -- the team is all focused on making sure that we are managing the situation, like I
said, on a daily basis with that.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. And then the other item. With this facility expansion as you bring on a fourth Taiwan facility and the
potential to double your production, could you just talk us through where you think you are right now on
utilization of the existing footprint and the timing for when the fourth facility will be online or ready to go?
Just approximate timing for that would be helpful.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Ben, I think in terms of utilization of our existing footprint, specifically talking about our consumer
manufacturing, I would say we're almost at 100% capacity. I mean we -- we've been bursting at the
seams, especially keeping up with this market growth and demand. So it's a very important step for us.
And in terms of timing of the new facility, we're targeting a fall opening to start to produce products there
and that will help alleviate our overall capacity constraints.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeffrey Rand of Deutsche Bank.

Jeffrey A. Rand
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Congrats on a strong quarter. Your consumer auto business appeared to bounce back nicely in the quarter.
Can you talk about what is driving this? Is it new or older products? And how do you think about this
business going forward?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

We saw, Jeffrey, growth in all of the categories in our consumer auto business. We've been talking for
a while about the growth opportunity and the strength in specialty products. Of course, they did very
well. And the traditional PNDs also bounced back. Some of that is simply the pent-up demand as people
traveled less last year and, of course, had less demand for those products. But in general, all of the
categories did well.

Jeffrey A. Rand
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. And based on your revised outlook, it looks like year-over-year revenue growth is going to
decelerate in the second half of the year. Are you seeing any signs of slowing demand? Or is this just kind
of being driven by the hard comps of the second half of last year?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think there's really a few things to consider in our guide. First of all, last year, the first half was very
challenging because of the pandemic. And we believe that a portion of the impact in the first half was
really shifted to the second half. So our second half benefited from what we weren't able to do in the first
half due to the pandemic. And I mentioned those factors earlier that there was a pullback by consumers
initially. And then retail partners were disrupted, many of them not even opened their doors. So that is a
factor as we look at our guide.

And then we also look at our product release timing of this year versus last year. That's a factor in our
outlook. And finally, potential uncertainties around supply chain that still exists. So that's what went into
the guide. And yes, it is at a lower rate than what we experienced in the first half, but we believe that
much of that is explained by the factors I just mentioned.

Operator

Our next question comes from Will Power of Baird.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes, I guess, echo my congratulations on the strong quarter. I guess I'd love any color that you're able to
provide broadly, probably across categories, on what the channel inventory situation looks like. I mean it
seems like strong in-demand. Do you feel like channel inventories in balance where you want it? So maybe
just kind of sell-in versus sell-through. Any broader color there and how that may or may not be impacting
the forward outlook.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Will. I think in terms of channel inventory, it's better than it has been in the past, but still,
depending on product and segment, there's areas of lean inventory that we continue to scramble to fill.
We're air shipping a lot of our products right now in order to keep up with that and the sell-through that
we see, especially on those products that we have the ability to observe through registrations in Garmin
Connect. The sell-through has been in line with the deliveries we're making. So the inventory situation a
little bit better, but still not where we need to be.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then just I wanted to ask on the M&A outlook from here. I mean, obviously, you continue to
generate strong cash flow. Just any color on areas of interest and kind of what valuation parameters look

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

like. I mean how much of a barrier is that here, given some of the broader demand trends for some of the
areas you might be targeting?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

I think M&A is something we're continually looking at. We are usually looking at a few different
opportunities at any one given time. I really don't ever share what specifically we're interested in, but
I would say anything that complements our segments in terms of technology or adjacent products is --
are things that are interesting to us. Valuations are kind of a challenge, very nuanced right now. There's
obviously a lot of exuberance in the market and expectations. So we certainly don't want to and aren't
interested in those things that are simply out of line, so we typically don't engage on those.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nik Todorov of Longbow Research.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Doug, if I look at the guidance, you took gross margin down because of the component cost, but you took
operating margin guide up. I wonder, is that driven by leverage? Or has your OpEx plans for the year
changed? I ask because it looks like your R&D and specifically OEM out -- or R&D came down meaningfully
sequentially. Is that reflecting receiving credits for OEMs? Or what's driving that?

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I just want to give you a flavor for the overall OpEx for the full year as a percentage of sales then
kind of sequential, what's going on there. So on a full year basis, the percentage of sales, we expect
operating expenses to be up about 60 basis points year-over-year. Looking at each one of the categories.
Advertising, our goal is to keep that relatively flat, the percentage of sales on a full year basis. Now we'll
increase on absolute dollars as co-op, increased sales and media spend.

As it relates to R&D, we do expect that to be up about 50 basis points year-over-year the percentage
of sales, and they're just increased headcount supporting our product road map. We're talking about
investing in Autoland, et cetera.

Then on SG&A, a little flavor there, percentage of sales on a full year basis. We expect that to be slightly
up, maybe about 10 basis points, and that's really due to increased sales. Also driving that to volume,
some of the areas such as IT costs, as well as product support and different operations.

As it relates to R&D on a sequential basis, the situation there is that is lower in the second quarter due
to reimbursement of some change or requests from our OEM partners. The situation is whenever an OEM
partner gives a change of request, we get reimbursed for that, and that is shown as a reduction in R&D.
So there may be a little bit bumpy between the quarters there from that standpoint.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. Got it. Very helpful. And Cliff, if I look at the aviation guidance, it implies meaningfully lower
sequentially second half revenue. What would be driving aviation sales to go down from here? And also
related as we speak of aviation, how should investors think about normalized operating margins in aviation
once that business kind of goes back to normal?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

I think in terms of second half, Nik, again, we try to analyze all the factors that we can in coming up with
that, and there's quite a bit of art and a little bit of science that goes into it. But some of our outlook for

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

the second half is related to the timing of deliveries of certain products to customers. So that's one thing
we benefited some in the first half because of some accelerated delivery. So that's part of it.

In terms of the normalized growth rates, I mean, there's a lot of studies and a lot of people that put
effort into long-term projections for the aviation market, and they typically grow at or above GDP levels
for developing countries. And frankly, those studies are so long term. It's very difficult to know how real
they are based on everything that can happen. As we know pandemics can change the whole course of
these growth trajectories. So we probably only look at that from a passing interest point of view, and we
generally say that we want our aviation segment to continue to grow, both in terms of market share and
penetration on platforms and with market growth.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on another incredible quarter.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Ivan.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

On your increased guidance, you increased the guidance for marine tremendously from 15% to 27%.
What is driving that growth?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, the marine market continues to be very strong. There's a lot of interest in boating. Our boating
OEMs, the people that build the boats are backlogged now many into 2022, and some are even saying
that's closing as well. So there's just a lot of interest in boating. Our retail partners also see a lot of
interest in people upgrading their existing boats. So the momentum is there, and we're simply working
very hard to satisfy the needs of the market.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

And you're seeing equal demand from OEMs and, let's say aftermarket products as well, which has been
doing better?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

I would say, just generally, they're both very strong. It tends to go up and down. The OEMs have taken
some time to spin up their production, because, of course, it's very complex and a lot of materials involved
in what they do. But they're definitely accelerating. We're seeing that in our OEM product sales. And
meanwhile, retail, there's still a lot of interest from our retail partners and a lot of promotions planned for
the products in the future.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

When you say a lot of people would, say, buying used boats and then just upgrading all of the marine
equipment?

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Yes, when they can find the used boat, the market is so incredibly tight. No one is letting go of their boats.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

And then also with your incredible innovation on the aviation side for autonomous control, like Autoland
and Smart Glide, are you seeing incorporating that in OEM automotive autonomous capability and
working with some of -- not only the OEM manufacturers, but some of the OEM autonomous computer
manufacturers, let's say, like NVIDIA and Qualcomm and then Waymo and GM Cruise?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

I would say that the autonomous technologies between aviation and auto are very different. So there's
little overlap in terms of what we're doing in those areas. So really nothing to comment there.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

But what about your camera capabilities? You have some AI capabilities in your OEM cameras.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean from a sensor fusion point of view and sensor technology, those are building blocks for sure
of things that can be applied. But for the most part, auto OEMs have their strategies and their partners
that they're using to work on the autonomous kind of features that they want. And so we're a part of their
overall plan, but not necessarily the ones that are doing their technology.

Ivan Philip Feinseth
Tigress Financial Partners LLC, Research Division

And then one last area. In corporate wellness, you had made some comments on opportunities there.
What kind of opportunities you see growing the, let's say, corporate wellness integration into your Garmin
Connect app and things like that?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Well, we continue to press on those opportunities. I think what's interesting about corporate wellness and
some of those program wellness opportunities that are out there, each one is different. It requires some
level of customization, especially on the part of partners. The benefit that we have in our offering is that
we have a broad product line that can be applied to almost any kind of opportunity, and we've served
opportunities anywhere from the very highest end fenix, down to the entry-level vívofit. So we continue to
work on those, and we continue to look for more opportunities in that space.

GARMIN LTD. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Doug, I want to start with automotive margins. I'm curious how we should think about gross margins and
operating margins, sort of that trajectory as you transition to the OEM side and some of those investments
you're making there conclude maybe over the short or medium term? And then I have a follow-up.

Douglas Gerard Boessen
CFO & Treasurer

Sure. As it relates to overall auto, yes, you're seeing that those gross margins are decreasing as our auto
OEM business becoming a bigger piece of auto. And also with -- more specifically within auto OEM, you're
seeing that gross margin come down on a year-over-year basis also since some of our new programs,
primarily BMW [indiscernible] hardware-related have a lower gross margin overall.

So it's really just going to be a function as it relates to the gross margin in there as those newer piece of
our business become a larger piece of that and actually kind of play into a segment type of a mix in there
from a standpoint of what one of those gross margin on an overall basis.

As it relates to the operating margins there, so yes, the consumer auto business is doing well. From
that standpoint, we are in the investment stage relating to auto OEM. So with that, we have a high
R&D standpoint. So we'll probably be in that for a couple of years here until we get into a production
standpoint.

Derek John Soderberg
Colliers Securities LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just curious quickly on Prime Day. Wondering how that was relative to prior years? And if
that had any impact on your guidance for the rest of the year? And then just a quick one on that as well.
How does Prime Day typically impact gross margin for you guys?

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So with that, the Prime Day year-over-year, there was a shift from the standpoint. So last year,
that was in the third quarter. This year in the second quarter. So that did impact the -- as Cliff talked
about, the comparable that we do have. As it relates to the gross margins, yes, there are -- that's a more
promotional business force from that standpoint, but kind of from an overall -- for a full year standpoint,
probably didn't impact it a whole lot.

Operator

Our next question comes from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. I just want to start. So obviously, you're seeing a stronger 2021. Your new
guidance range implies some of the upside in 2Q can also continue into the second half. And so can you
just maybe help us understand what has changed from your perspective over the last 3 months that gives
you confidence in your new guidance targets? And then just are you embedding any component -- any
impact from component constraints into that forecast? And then I have a follow-up.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Erik, when we create our guidance at the beginning of the year, as I mentioned, there's a lot of art
that goes into it because we're a business that's not driven by a backlog book, it's consumer demand. And
a lot of times, we don't even see a forecast from our customers, and we have to kind of project what they
want.

So we take that into account at the beginning of the year. By the time we reach this point in the year, of
course, we've had much more time to evaluate the dynamics of the market and what's happening. And
also we start to see a picture of what will take place in the back half with promotions.

So it gives us a better sense of how the year might finish, and that's why we've been able to update our
guidance this time because we saw strong trends in the first half ahead of our expectations. And then as
we look to the second half now, we have more clarity of what's transpiring for the end of the year.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then if we touch on margins, mix shift to autos would be a headwind to gross
margins, but I believe your guidance also assumes some incremental pressures in the second half
unrelated to mix. And so maybe where are you seeing those pressures? Maybe can you talk about what
you're embedding in terms of cost pressures from the new manufacturing facility? And then maybe also
component costs and how that impacts your gross margin? Kind of all of that together into one.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's really very simple. I mean we take all of those things into account. We look at the general
trends of margins based on promotions. We look at what we're seeing in terms of component trends and
other supply chain pressures. So all of that has been factored into our outlook, and we do that every year.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And maybe if I just clarify that. Are you saying you expect more component cost pressure in the second
half? Or is it more related to logistics? Just want to make sure I understand that.

Clifton Albert Pemble
President, CEO & Director

Generally, I would say our supply chain cost in the second half will increase more than what we have seen
so far this year, and that's been built into the guide that we've provided.

Erik William Richard Woodring
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats again.

Operator
