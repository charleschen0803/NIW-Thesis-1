DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Dominion Energy Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Steven Ridge, Vice President, Investor Relations.

Steven D. Ridge
Director of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Earnings materials, including today's prepared remarks
may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's
estimates and expectations.

This morning, we will discuss some measures of our company's performance that differ from those
recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures, which we are -- which we can calculate are contained in the earnings release kit. I
encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to review webcast slides as well as the earnings
release kit.

Joining today's call are Tom Farrell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Chapman
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; as well as other members of the executive
management team.

I will now turn the call over to Jim.

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Steven, and good morning. Our second quarter 2020 operating earnings were $0.82 per share,
which included a $0.03 hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service territories.

Weather-normalized results of $0.85 per share were at the top of our guidance range. And for the 18th
consecutive quarter, we're at or above the quarterly guidance midpoint.

We expect a full year financial impact of weather to be more balanced than during the first 2 quarters of
the year.

Preliminary data indicate that July was around $0.04 better than normal, and early predictions for August
suggest potential for additional weather help.

Note that our second quarter GAAP and operating earnings are not adjusted to account for discontinued
operations, given the timing of our recent announcement, but will be reflected beginning with our third
quarter disclosures.

GAAP earnings for the quarter were negative $1.41 per share. This result was driven primarily by
impairment-related charges associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header projects. We
also had a positive impact attributable to net gains on our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. As a
reminder, we report such gains and losses on these funds as nonoperating. A summary of adjustments
between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit.

On Slide 4, we're initiating the third quarter 2020 operating earnings guidance with a range of $0.85 to
$1.05 per share. As mentioned, this range reflects the impact of recasting operating earnings to exclude
discontinued operations. We're also affirming the 2020 annual guidance range provided on our July 6
investor call. As usual, these ranges assume normal weather. Variations from which could cause results to

DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

be towards the top or the bottom of these ranges. Typically, we provide year ago actual results alongside
our guidance. Given the need to adjust historic results for discontinued operations to provide a useful
point of comparison, we plan to provide these figures when we report third quarter and full year results,
respectively.

I would also note that our 2020 10-K will include 3 full years of historic results that have been adjusted to
reflect the impact of discontinued operations. Finally, we are also affirming the long-term annual growth
guidance we gave earlier this month for earnings and dividends per share.

I'll now turn to discuss our observations on the financial impacts of COVID-19. The graph on Slide 5
represents daily and 7-day average weather-normalized load in the PJM dom zone as compared to the 2-
year historic weather-normal average. Strong residential and data center demand continues to support
overall load levels that modestly exceed the historic average. This is a continuation of the theme we've
seen since the pandemic began. And looking forward, we expect this trend to continue.

We provide corresponding data for Dominion Energy South Carolina on the next slide. Recall the story
here diverged from DEV and that we did experience weather-normal load degradation earlier this year. On
the first quarter call, we suggested that April could represent a bottoming out with gradual improvements
through the summer. Fortunately, at least so far, that has been the case with July demand only 1% off
weather-normal historic averages. I would also point out that the higher volumes sold in the summer
months, like July, tend to have a larger impact on our annual sales revenues than the lower volume
shoulder months. We currently expect this general recovery trend to continue in South Carolina through
the remainder of the year.

We estimate that through the end of June, lower-than-budgeted sales associated with the impacts of
COVID-19 across our electric utility operation has impacted operating income by approximately $0.04
per share, which thus far has been largely offset with corporate initiatives. The future remains difficult
to predict, so we are reiterating the demand-related earnings sensitivities that we provided on the first
quarter call and which can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.

Consistent with our expectations, customer arrears have increased modestly to date. We continue to work
carefully with our customers to provide options and tools to assist them in returning their accounts to
current. Our GAAP results for the quarter reflect the recognition of a COVID-related reserve of around $20
million, representing our current expectation for incremental expense associated with future uncollectible
accounts.

Turning now to a financing update, as shown on Slide 7, we provide detailed guidance on our equity
capital raising plans. First, we are ceasing the issuance of new shares under the DRIP program with
immediate effect, resulting in a total of about $160 million of new share issuance under the program in
2020, roughly half of our prior estimate. In 2021 and beyond, we'll return to our historic norm of around
$300 million of new share issuance per year. Second, starting in 2022, we expect to see our at-the-market
program begin to ramp up such that by 2024, our first big year of offshore wind investment were back to
the $300 million to $500 million per year range that we previously articulated at Investor Day. And third,
we continue to target year-end completion of the share repurchase we announced earlier this month.

Recall that the Board's authorization for the announced $3 billion buyback was with immediate effect. We
currently expect that there may be some modest upward bias to this figure based on additional refinement
of our overall tax analysis. We'll provide additional details around share repurchases next quarter, but
would note that we have not yet repurchased any shares.

We have an exciting opportunity to deploy significant amounts of capital directed at sustainable energy
and related projects. These projected modest equity financing activities will support these EPS-accretive
capital investments.

Turning to fixed income, we've included in slide in the appendix detailing our very modest remaining
issuance for the year. Overall, we view the debt capital markets as healthy and liquid across the spectrum
of term, and we currently have nearly $7 billion in available liquidity. Our credit rating agencies responded
positively to the announcements we made earlier this month. S&P revised their outlook to positive

DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

while Moody's and Fitch affirmed our ratings. In all cases, the agencies remarked on the credit positive
aspects of our strategic repositioning. We expect that successful execution of our financial plan will further
demonstrate the clear and positive reduction of our overall business risk profile.

Finally, before I summarize my remarks, let me give some insight into our Investor Relations strategy over
the next several months, as shown on Slide 8. We are increasing our proactive outreach using virtual tools
to interact with both existing and prospective shareholders throughout the world, including geographies
where ESG-related factors are playing an increasingly prominent role in investment decisions. We are
ramping up our investor targeting efforts to identify prospective shareholders for which our compelling,
clean energy, operating and financial profile will resonate.

We plan to use our fourth quarter earnings call to provide something of an Investor Day-style refresh with
supplementary appendix disclosures aimed at providing projected CapEx, rate base, and other inputs,
which we hope will assist investors in their financial evaluation of our company. It's our responsibility to
get our repositioning story into the market. We, therefore, look forward to connecting with many of you
for discussions on these topics during the next several months.

So to summarize my remarks, we remain focused on extending our track record of delivering financial
results that meet or exceed our public commitments. We feel that our businesses are well positioned with
regard to COVID-related demand impacts, but we are monitoring that situation carefully. We are affirming
our updated 2020 operating earnings guidance as well as the long-term operating earnings and dividend
growth outlooks provided earlier this month. And finally, we look forward to increasing engagement with
existing and prospective investors in the months to come.

I'll now turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas F. Farrell
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by again expressing our gratitude for
the medical and other frontline health care professionals who are engaged in a courageous effort to assist
those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We salute their efforts, just as we salute the
efforts of our employees who continue to perform a vital public service by literally keeping the lights on
and critical energy flowing.

We continue to evolve our COVID response to incorporate the most up-to-date guidance from the medical
and public health community, social distancing, proper PPE and where practical, remote work have become
the expectation for all employees.

We're also mindful of our customers and the difficult time this has been for them. We have worked closely
with regulators to take steps, including the voluntary suspension of nonpayment service disconnections
and the offering of flexible payment plans to assist our customers in addressing the financial challenges
they may be facing.

Turning to safety, which is our first core value on Slide 9. Our year-to-date results put us on track to
make 2020 the safest year of operation in the company's more than 100-year history. As an organization
with nearly 20,000 employees and 7 million customers, our safety performance matters to thousands of
families and communities, which is why it matters so much to us.

The ability to impact lives on a broader scale is also why when we see an issue that deeply impacts
our employees, customers and communities, we get involved. Recent social unrest, partly caused by
the murder in Minneapolis, has led us to question what more we can do to assist in the cause of social
justice and racial equality. Early last month, we publicly committed $5 million to social justice and
community rebuilding efforts. The funds will support nonprofit organizations advocating for social justice
and equality. Grants will also be designated to help minority-owned and small businesses recover from
recent disruptions to their businesses.

Words can evoke sympathy, empathy, compassion and understanding. But at Dominion Energy, we
believe that actions speak louder. So we're investing in recovery and reconciliation and in the vital work

DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

of overcoming years of debilitating actions, attitudes and abuses of authority that have traumatized our
country. This month, we followed up on that commitment with an additional pledge of $35 million that will
support 11 historically black colleges and universities, representing 35,000 students across Virginia, Ohio,
North and South Carolina as well as a scholarship fund focused on African-American and underrepresented
minority students across all of our service territories. These institutions have been foundational in the
struggle to improve the lives of African-Americans and in the fight for social justice.

We are pleased and humbled to build on our company's nearly 40-year history of supporting historically
black colleges and universities. These initiatives are a recognition of the importance of education as an
equalizer in society. Across our company, we are engaged in these issues like never before, listening and
being heard. We are committed in taking major steps to increase the diversity of our workforce. And in
recent years, we have meaningfully improved our supplier diversity. Embracing diversity inclusion is not
only the right thing to do. It is imperative to our long-term success as a company and we are changing the
way that long-term success will look, operationally and financially.

Slide 11 summarizes the highlights of our strategic repositioning, which include a narrowed focus to
our premier state-regulated utility operations, which will account for approximately 85% to 90% of
our operating earnings, an industry-leading clean energy profile, best-in-class long-term earnings and
dividend per share growth and a low-risk business profile and healthy balance sheet. We have a vision
for the future and we are preparing our company to be at the vanguard of the energy transition that is
accelerating across our country. We are investing billions of dollars in a transition that will make zero- and
low-emitting resources accountable for around 95% of our company-wide electric generation by the end of
2035.

As shown on Slide 12, we have a plan described in our integrated resource plan filings to grow our
renewable energy capacity on average over 15% per year for the next 15 years. We have successfully
achieved our 3,000 megawatt target for renewable generation in service or under-development in the
State of Virginia, 1.5 years ahead of schedule. And we are now the third largest owner of solar capacity
among utility companies in the country.

Our pilot offshore wind project, depicted on the cover of these materials, is the only project to have
successfully completed the BOEM permitting process and will begin to generate electricity this quarter.
Our $8 billion, 2.6 gigawatt full-scale offshore wind deployment continues on schedule. Recent permitting
recommendations for Northeast wind projects are not expected to alter materially our project plans and
will be accounted for when we submit our construction and operation plan later this year. Finally, earlier
this month, Virginia State Corporation Commission approved our renewable energy tariff, which enables us
to offer an exciting 100% renewable energy product to our customers.

We are equally focused on emission reductions at our Gas Distribution utilities. Pipeline and other
aging infrastructure replacement, extensive leak detection and repair efforts and modified operational
procedures designed to capture gas that used to be ventilated -- vented during maintenance will reduce
the methane emissions of our natural gas utility operations 65% by the end of this decade and 80% by
the end of the next.

We are also finding innovative ways to help our customers improve their sustainability. As one of the
country's largest investors in renewable natural gas, we are at the forefront of the intersection of
agricultural emission reductions in offering natural gas customers a green option that is actually carbon
negative, meaning that it takes lower greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than it creates when it is
used by the customer. In coming months, we will share additional insights into our expanding vision for a
sustainable energy future for our company and the country.

Next, let me address the upcoming Dominion Energy South Carolina rate case. Earlier this month, we
made a preliminary filing that formally signaled our intent to file a general rate case proceeding next
month, the first for the base electric business in South Carolina since 2012. We expect new rates based on
a typical procedural schedule to be effective in March of 2021.

DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

Since the last rate case 8 years ago, Dominion Energy South Carolina has connected over 80,000 new
electric customers, representing a 12% increase and invested over $2 billion net of retirements in electric
generation, transmission and distribution systems that serve customers every day.

Despite prudent cost management, the resulting earned return does not measure up to the cost of capital
we must employ to maintain excellent reliability and service that our customers rely on. We estimate
that our filing will imply a single-digit percentage rate increase, which will be significantly lower than the
compounded rate of inflation of nearly 14% since the end of the last test year of 2011. Customers count
on us to keep the lights on and to deliver affordable and increasingly sustainable electricity. We are as
committed to that ideal in South Carolina today as we were when we closed the merger.

With that, I will summarize today's call as follows: our safety performance is on track to set a new
company record; we are making important financial commitments to address social justice and support
African-American and underrepresented minority students; we achieved weather-normalized operating
earnings that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for the 18th consecutive quarter; we affirmed
our enhanced long-term earnings and dividends per share growth guidance; our transaction with Berkshire
Hathaway is on schedule for our fourth quarter closing; and we are aggressively pursuing our vision to be
the most sustainable energy company in the country.

Before we turn to your questions, I want to discuss our announcement this morning about my change of
role from President and CEO to Executive Chairman of Dominion, effective at the end of this quarter. I'm
in my 25th year at the company, 15th year as CEO and turned 65 last December. Three years ago, the
Board began to consider various alternatives to my eventual retirement. We have undertaken a series of
steps over these years. Last September, we took an important step in that process by creating the Co-
Chief Operating Officer role. Today's announcement is another step in a long designed succession process.

I'm pleased to say that Bob Blue will become President and CEO on October 1, reporting to me as
Executive Chair. And Diane Leopold is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer, reporting to Blue and
will be responsible for all of the company's operations across our multistate footprint. Jim Chapman,
our CFO, will report to Blue; as will Carter Reid, President of our Services Company; Carlos Brown, our
General Counsel; Bill Murray, our Head of Corporate Affairs and Public Policy; Corynne Arnett, our Head of
Regulation and Customer Experience; and Tanya Ross, our Chief Auditor. Carter Reid will also report to me
in her role as Chief of Staff of Dominion.

I provide you with this detail to underscore that the team we have assembled at Dominion over the past
15 years will be the same team that carries us into the future. It is this group that has taken Dominion
to the top ranks among American utilities in safety, operational excellence and compliance. It is also
this team that has supported and expanded our steadfast commitment to sustainability, diversity and
community engagement. These individuals, of course, did not achieve these results on their own. They
were supported by thousands of others at our company who share and live our company's values. As you
know, over the years, we have made significant and, in some cases, transformative changes to Dominion,
like our succession process, we have taken a deliberate strategic approach to reposition Dominion for the
future.

We are now largely state-regulated, multi-utility company with a growth profile for both earnings per
share and dividends among the highest in our industry. We also have one of the strongest ESG stories in
this sector. From exiting oil and gas production and merchant fossil generation to emerging with Questar
and SCANA, to embracing solar power, advanced storage and grid modernization, to relicensing our
nuclear fleet as well as the development of the largest offshore wind farm in the Americas, it has been this
team of individuals leading the way.

With our most recent strategic alignment in selling our gas storage and pipeline segment and embracing
a clear path to net zero by 2050, the Board and I thought it would be an appropriate time to take the
next step in our management transition at the end of this quarter. There is no established time frame
for my role as Executive Chair, and I look forward to continue to serve the company on behalf of our
shareholders, customers and communities. The primary goal of our succession planning process has
been to ensure continuity of our strategy, public policy, corporate values and operational excellence. This
change is a step in carrying out that goal.

be particularly focused on continuing to develop our strategic plan and Dominion's leadership in the new
clean energy economy.
And with that, we will be happy to answer your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Good morning. Can everybody hear me?

Thomas F. Farrell
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we can.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And before we start, congratulations to both you, Tom, Bob and Diane for the announcements today.
I'm glad to say it. Just 2 real quick questions. On Slide 8, you discussed an Investor Day-style financial
update, which will include a rolling forward of the capital plan and the rate base estimates. Would this
include a year-by-year or a segment-by-segment program breakdown of the capital spend as well as the
associated rate base by year and segment?

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

James, it's Jim. Yes. So we're in the planning stages for that for the fourth quarter rollout of that Analyst
Day, Investor Day-style refresh. And we hope to do at least the kinds of things we did last time around --
last March, where we did provide by segment and mostly by year rate base and other growth data. So if
we can improve on that a little bit, we're thinking through how to do that. We welcome feedback. But we
do expect to provide kind of everything you just mentioned on the fourth quarter call.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And I mean -- and just staying in that vein, since you've already given sort of some of the financing
through 2024, we're going to be looking forward a year. Will we probably roll this out to -- will this be like
a 2021 through 2025? How are you thinking about that?

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I haven't decided that yet, but that's a possibility for sure. And I would say, let me add to that, our
existing disclosure is not so up to date. Last March, we set out $26 billion of growth capital spending from
'19 to '23. We updated some of that on the first quarter call this year, for 3 programs under the VCEA in
Virginia. Obviously, longer term, our gas transmission storage capital spend, which is about $3.5 billion,
comes out of that. But our existing guidance is still largely intact and relevant, but we will be providing
that rollout with some more granular updates on the fourth quarter call.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And then just last question on this part of it is -- and really just kind of sticking to the 2025 sort of time
frame. You've given a lot of line of sight on the financing through 2024. But your CapEx, really, as you
start to do the offshore wind starts really building up in '23, '24. Just wondering if you are looking to sort
of move your CapEx forecast out a little bit farther to kind of talk about the financing plan as we move into
'24 through '26 and the offshore wind starts coming online?

DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Fair enough. I mean those numbers do get big, and there's a lot of visibility around that offshore
wind spend. But I would say that on an overall basis, the cadence of that $26 billion build number in the
updated number, I mean, it's pretty much a run rate. So yes, there's a slight increase there. So if we -- as
we provide additional detail or an additional year of capital spend, we'll also support that with information
on our financing plan. But I wouldn't expect a drastic departure from our kind of run rate numbers that
we've talked about today.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

[Technical Difficulty]

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, James, you're cutting out there a little bit, but, yes, that kind of run rate again. We'll provide an
update on the fourth quarter call. But it's not going to be a drastic departure from that, if that was your
question.

James Macdonald Thalacker
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes, yes. No, that's perfect. And then the last question, I apologize. But clearly, there's been a lot of press
in the last week surrounding political spending practices and vehicles. On Slide 20, you briefly address
your rankings in the CPA-Zicklin Index, which highlights user trends that are under their methodology,
but I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more of your past and current use of social welfare
organizations like the 501(c)(4). And do you plan to modify your political strategies at all in light of the
recent investigations?

Thomas F. Farrell
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Thanks for asking. First, we have fully disclosed 501(c)(4) contributions for many years. Zicklin
Center you referenced is an independent organization that works with The Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania to look at a huge, very wide variety of factors, and they rank all these
companies on their disclosure practices. And our disclosure is -- ranks among the highest in the country,
certainly among the highest in utilities for its transparency. And like I said, we've disclosed all of them.
And over the last 5 years, I think our contributions have been under $500,000, 70% of which went to an
organization that associated with American Petroleum Institute supporting pipeline projects. So we are --
fully disclosed everything. It's not a -- it's a very small part of what we do, under $500,000 over 5 years.
And we have no intention of changing our practices because they are perfectly appropriate, completely
compliant with every state and federal law by wide margins. We are -- we have nothing to be concerned
about with respect to any of our political giving or giving to these so called 501(c)(4)s.

Operator

Our next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just on the equity guide, some people may be struggling with it, buying back this year and starting to
issue next year. Can you touch on this thought and why not decide to delever and further sort of improve
the credit metrics versus buying back, which could be sort of multiple accretive in and of itself. So -- and I
just have a quick follow-up.

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

Yes, Shar, let me start there. So look, our balance sheet is already in the right place. And I don't want to
take time to go through all the history but I think, as you know, we've made just a ton of progress in that
area over the last several years. And it's even better pro forma for the sale of the T&S business. So that
sale, almost $6 billion of the $10 billion transaction value is really, from our perspective, debt retirement.
So I think the agencies have recognized that also in their commentary, as I just talked about positive
outlook from S&P, et cetera.

So given that, the status of our balance sheet and the related improvements from this transaction, we feel
pretty good about our plan to provide the net proceeds back to our shareholders in this buyback, which
we're -- as I mentioned, we're targeting for completion by the end of the year. But that said, we do have
a sizable clean energy and related capital spend program, just talked about that with James. And it's only
increasing as we go through the year slowly. So therefore, we do -- even though we're doing the buyback
and we're giving the net proceeds back to our shareholders, we think it's prudent with that strong balance
sheet position we're in.

We do plan to recommence some equity issuance, even if it's just in this form of DRIP in 2021 and
beyond. But I think the perspective is important, I mean, for spending programs of the size what we're
doing, to be starting out with DRIP, less than 0.5 percentage point of our market cap a year in a pretty
efficient program like DRIP. And later just with other efficient programs, all in our ATM, we think it's overall
pretty modest, and we think it's the best way to go.

Got it. And then just honing in on the buyback, what's specifically, again, driving the upsizing, can
you kind of sort of quantify? And then on the timing, it seems that 4Q purchases could be a little bit
conservative on your viewpoint. Can you buy back sooner, even if you don't have the proceeds in the
door? And can you potentially close this transaction sooner than 4Q? So what's driving the upsizing? And
can you start to buy back sooner than 4Q even if the proceeds are mandatory?

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So we have a couple of things there. We have Board authority to commence our buybacks with
immediate effect. We do not need to wait until the transaction closes. But we haven't bought any yet. And
we retain kind of full flexibility. We can do that with open market purchases. We can do it with accelerated
share repurchases, tender, Dutch auction, so more guidance to come on that through the fall as we go. We
do expect still to complete that by the end of the year, even if we start sooner.

We're not guiding to any different closing time line than the kind of early fourth quarter, although that all
remains on track. But then as it relates to the amount, the quantum, yes, we mentioned there's upward
bias. Where is that coming from? We'll provide more detail on that too as we go. But that comes from --
first of all, just a conservative first cut on what the tax -- cash taxes would be on this sale. We indicated
about $700 million. So there's interplay there between the tax aspect of the sale and the tax aspect of the
Atlantic Coast Pipeline abandonment, an impairment of Supply Header, and the interplay of our sizable tax
credit position.

So as we continue to do more work on that, we see probably, if anything, a downward bias in the taxes
payable from $700 million and, therefore, an upper bias in the size of the buyback. And it's not huge.
I mean, again, we'll come to that guidance. It sits somewhere between 0 and $200 million kind of that
magnitude. And we'll provide more guidance. But again, conservative first cut, probably improving from
there modestly, and we'll provide more detail on all of that as we go through the fall.

Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Shar. Appreciate it.

Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congratulations to you Tom as well.

Thomas F. Farrell
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So maybe just starting off, I actually have 1 question only. Just -- the other questions have been
answered. Jim, so the credit rating agencies opposed the transaction, obviously, came out with a positive
view. I didn't see it, but is there a chance that your FFO-to-debt metrics get adjusted here going forward
now that the business mix is very different?

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Durgesh. By that, do you mean kind of the downgrade or upgrade thresholds from the agencies?

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Exactly. Yes.

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I think there -- I can't speak for the agencies there. On the downgrade side, there hasn't been done any
action yet. I would think that as we continue to execute on this plan and improve on our business risk
profile, derisk our profile that, that would be a logical thing to discuss. But we're not guiding folks to
expect that in the near term. But I understand the question, and we'll see what happens.

Operator

Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations, Tom, Bob and Diane, all 3 of you. I just want to ask about the -- as we get closer to the
triennial review, I think you're going to -- you should be filing it pretty soon, if not already. What should
we be looking for there in terms of time line and dates and hearings and things like that?

Robert M. Blue
Co-COO & Executive VP

Michael, it's Bob Blue. So obviously, we're focused on that triennial. We will file it in March of next year,
and it will be litigated over the course of that year with a decision by the end of November. So that's the
cadence for that.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Great. And in terms of the offshore wind project, it wasn't really much mentioned in the
presentation this time around. But I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on, I guess, the filing,
which I think you're still planning towards the end of the year, right, with BOEM?

Robert M. Blue
Co-COO & Executive VP

Right. We expect to file the COP with them at the end of this year. And it's progressing well. The survey
and geotechnical work and the preparation of that are going very well. So we're pleased, just as we were
pleased with construction on test turbines.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

And is that project included on that slide that shows the 15 -- over 15% increase in renewable generation
over, say, 2035?

Robert M. Blue
Co-COO & Executive VP

Yes.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. So -- and just a relatively small part of it, it looks like solar is the vast majority of it, right?

Robert M. Blue
Co-COO & Executive VP

That's correct. It's large solar builds. I don't really think of the commercial project as small; however, it's
the largest in the Americas.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

It looks like it's going to get dwarfed by solar. Is that all in the state of Virginia and South Carolina, I
suppose?

Robert M. Blue
Co-COO & Executive VP

It's within the PJM footprint. But we're talking mostly in Virginia, yes.

Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

First, Tom, congrats to you. It's been a long time. And also congrats to Bob and to Diane, well deserved.
So -- in good hands. So I guess, just -- could you just remind us what you need to do to actually get the
transaction closed, in terms of approvals, just so we're tracking that?

Thomas F. Farrell
Chairman, President & CEO

We just have HSR, really, and that's progressing along just fine.

DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. And then, I mean, there's not going to be a lot of time to actually execute on the buyback in
Q4. It's a decent amount of stock. So could you just talk about kind of how you are thinking about doing
it?

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Let me go there, Steve. So again, we don't have specific guidance on that yet, and we'll provide more
through the fall. But I just mentioned all the kind of options we have at our disposal to get that done, but
we don't necessarily need to wait until the fourth quarter to start, and we probably won't. So it could be
-- it very well could be a mix of approaches of market purchases and other approaches in addition to or in
place of fourth quarter tender-style event. So I know that's pretty broad. But we don't need to compress
that into just a month or 2 in the fourth quarter. We have the authority to start now.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then maybe just when you look at -- I guess, that -- I know you said you're going to be doing
a lot of continued marketing on the company and story and the kind of new clean energy further refocus
there. Just maybe you could give a little color on what kind of feedback you've gotten so far because,
obviously, there was big news with the financial changes and then this refocus. What kind of investor
feedback you've gotten so far?

James R. Chapman
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Let me start there. And that was just 3 weeks ago or so when we made those announcements. And
we did get quite a bit of feedback from across the spectrum, different types of investors. And we took it
all to heart. We sat around and considered a lot of that pretty carefully, including, notably, the feedback
from retail investors who are very focused on the dividend and income fund investors. So we get that and
took that to heart. But the feedback from, I guess, maybe longer-term investors, institutional investors
and those investors, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that or North America or elsewhere, that
increasingly are thinking about their investment decisions through the lens of ESG topics. That feedback
was pretty positive on the long-term prospects of this transaction, repositioning the company in this way,
strengthening the balance sheet, increasing the growth rate, highlighting all the -- already underway, ESG
spending programs, clean energy and related. So that feedback has been pretty good.

But it is a change -- a material change for Dominion. So we have been already and we highlighted here
that we're going to spend a lot of time in the next few months just reconnecting with people, existing
investors, prospective investors. We're walking through that story, making sure everyone gets it, not only
what we've done, but exactly what we're doing under the spending programs and the size and scale and
cadence and the financing. So there's a lot to talk about. And one thing that's been consistent in all of our
interactions with investors, existing perspectives in the last 3 weeks is everyone really wants to spend
more time to make sure they get it and they're understanding all the dynamics. But overall, it's been
pretty positive.

Operator

And our last question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just a multipronged question on natural gas, if I could here. Just wondering how you think the needs
in your service territories have changed over time since you first announced ACP. And with the ACP
cancellation, what are your expectations for gas distribution CapEx into the fourth quarter refresh here? Is
there an upward bias especially without competing for capital? And finally, if I could, just how do you think
hydrogen could fit into the picture over time here?

DOMINION ENERGY, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 31, 2020

Thomas F. Farrell
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you for the question. I'm just -- on the -- let me -- I'm going to answer the very first part of it and
then turn it over to Diane. The need for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in our service territory, of course, the
service territory for us was Virginia and North Carolina and potentially South Carolina. Well, the need has
not changed at all. The result of it is that need will go unmet as a result of the cancellation of the Atlantic
Coast Pipeline. The pipeline was over 90% subscribed for 15 years by utility companies that we're going to
use it to serve gas distribution customers and convert coal plants to natural gas facilities over the years to
come. That need will now go unmet. So with respect to that 1 project, no change.

The balance of the question, I'll turn it over to Diane.

Diane G. Leopold
Co-COO & Executive VP

Okay. So with respect to the LDC capital spend and -- certainly, we'll give a refreshed look in the Q4 call.
But we really don't see any change there. So we really have jurisdictions that are in very supportive states
for our programs. And they're in high-growth areas. So we have North Carolina, Utah, Ohio, West Virginia
in the key jurisdictions. We have pipeline replacement programs in essentially all of those areas that are
significant, and our commissions recognize the long-term nature of those programs and the need to have
that infrastructure replacement for safety, reliability and sustainability. So I really don't see anything there
as well as the continued growth projects to meet the increasing demand in these high-growth areas. So
really no change on the LDC side.

With respect to hydrogen, we do see that there will be an increase in hydrogen utilization in the energy
mix over the next several decades. And we've certainly spent a lot of time studying it. At the moment,
at least to our knowledge, no continental U.S. LDC is blending hydrogen into its supply mix today. We
committed a couple of years ago to making sure our LDC system is ready to accept up to 5% hydrogen by
2030, so just in the next decade. And our initial pilot is in advanced planning stages in Utah. So high level,
we think there's going to be a lot of activity in this area. But for the most part, it's still in that study and
preparatory planning stage. But expect it to be ramping up and look forward to sharing updates.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's very helpful. And just going back to the gas situation real quick. With MVP, do you think that there's
any role for that to play, I guess, in meeting some of those needs that are going to go unmet without ACP?

Thomas F. Farrell
Chairman, President & CEO

Not that we can see.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And just 1 last one, if I could. With regards to the upcoming election here, just wondering if you
had any preliminary thoughts on potential impacts at the federal or state level for Dominion overall?

Thomas F. Farrell
Chairman, President & CEO

I have no intention whatsoever of commenting on the upcoming elections in any respect.
