Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Centene Corporation 2019 Fourth Quarter and Year-end Results
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now turn the conference over to Ed Kroll, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.

Edmund E. Kroll
Senior Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations

Thank you, Brandon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and
full year 2019 earnings results conference call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this
morning's call, which can also be accessed through our website at centene.com.

A replay will be available shortly after the call's completion, also at centene.com, or by dialing (877)
344-7529 in the U.S. and Canada, or in other countries by dialing (412) 317-0088. The playback code for
both dial-ins is 10138090.

Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-
looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements
as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-Q and
Form 10-K and other public SEC filings.

Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change. While
the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we
specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A
reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in
our fourth quarter and full year 2019 press release, which is available on the company's website at
centene.com under the Investors section. A reminder that Centene will host its First Quarter 2020
Earnings Call on Tuesday, April 28, 2020.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full
Year 2019 Earnings Call. I'd like to apologize now for any residual cough you may hear as a result of some
bronchitis I had a week or so ago.

Before I go through our 2019 results, let me say how pleased we are to have closed the WellCare
transaction on January 23. We were cautiously optimistic that the transaction would close early in the first
half of 2020, and we are happy that this was the case.

We are now a $100 billion plus enterprise, providing health care services to more than 24 million members
across all 50 states or 1 in 15 individuals across the nation. Having achieved this, we still have a long
runway ahead of us, with enhanced scale, further diversification of products and capabilities and greater
opportunities for growth across portfolio.

As we have previously disclosed, our planning assumption was to be ready to begin the integration by
January 1. I am pleased to report that the integration process is well underway, and teams are managing
their various work streams.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

For example, we have begun to align 2021 bids for our Medicare business. In addition, we have activated
integration plans in markets where WellCare and Centene overlap, such as New York, Georgia and Florida.
We remain on track to achieve our previously committed and communicated accretion and synergy
targets. Most importantly, we are happy to welcome the WellCare team and colleagues to Centene.

Let me now turn to a recap of Centene's 2019 highlights. 2019 was another robust year for Centene. We
delivered strong top and bottom line growth, enabled by operational and commercial successes across
our enterprise. We remain focused sticking to our business-as-usual approach. We were not distracted by
the significant headline noise during the year. We continue to execute against our strategic priorities and
invest in capabilities that have positioned Centene for long-term success.

In 2019, we added 1.1 million members, representing growth of more than 8%, surpassing the 15 million-
member mark. This growth was achieved in the face of state eligibility redeterminations, which continued
to moderate. We continue to grow our market-leading position in both Medicaid and the ACA marketplace.

We grew revenues by 24% to $74.6 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share by 25% to $4.42. The
HBR increased 140 basis points to 87.3, driven by normalized margins in the exchange business relative
to favorable performance in 2018 in the health insurer fee moratory. The adjusted net income margin
increased 10 basis points to 2.6%.

We continue to execute a smooth and seamless integration of Fidelis. The only remaining task in this
process is to finalize the incorporation of Fidelis onto our claims systems platform. We also continue to
invest in strengthening our products and capabilities, with a focus on areas that will complement our core
business and works to continually enhance how we impact patient outcomes while delivering long-term
care.

A few highlights. We achieved meaningful progress with Centene Forward, an important initiative that
we expect will better position Centene for long-term growth, increase margins and profitability. In 2019,
we executed a more than $500 million in initiatives. And the program has now evolved into a permanent
part of Centene's and the company's organization and culture. We continue to migrate our membership
to RxAdvance, the technology-based pharmacy platform, which enhances quality and transparency while
lowering costs. We continue to focus on proof-of-concept, and we'll expand as appropriate.

We increased our stake in Ribera Salud from 50% to 90%. This demonstrates our commitment to continue
developing Centene's international portfolio. We are also proud of the initiatives we announced in 2019
to enhance the health of the communities we serve. I would like to highlight just a few. In February,
we formed the Social Health Bridge trust to help organizations more effectively address the social
determinants of health. In April, we launched the OpiEnd Youth Challenge to raise awareness among
adolescents about opioid misuse and prevention of dependence. And in September, we launched the Food
For Today and Food for Tomorrow development initiative. We're feeding America to help those experiencing
food insecurity. These initiatives are all in line with our whole health focus, an integrated and holistic
approach to how we work with our community. We will focus on addressing the broad range of social
determinants of health.

For example, Medicaid have always -- are particularly likely to struggle with nonmedical barriers to health,
including nutrition, education, transportation and proper housing. As a leading multinational managed care
enterprise, we will continue to lead initiatives and partner with organizations to transform the health of
communities across the globe.

Moving on to the market and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. During the year,
we maintained our industry-leading Medicaid RFP win rate of 80%, with success across new contracts as
well as renewals and contract expansions. Medicaid membership grew approximately 3% to year-over-
year to 8.6 million recipients.

Texas. In November, Centene successfully re-procured the expanded -- and expanded its STAR+PLUS
contract in Texas. We will be providing health care services to recipients in 2 new service areas, El
Paso and Travis, while continuing to operate in our 7 existing service areas. Centene currently serves

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

140,000 beneficiaries under our existing contract. The new expanded contract is scheduled to commence
September 1, 2020.

On a separate note, the state of Texas has now indicated that the STAR and CHIP re-procurement
announcement will be sometime in February. We remain confident in the value we bring to the state.

Pennsylvania. On January 1, 2020, Centene successfully launched the third and final phase of the
Pennsylvania long-term care contract, adding approximately 38,000 beneficiaries. As a reminder, we
launched the Southwest zone in January 2018 and the Southeast zone in January 2019. We are the
leading long-term provider in the state, currently serving approximately 90,000 recipients. The addition of
the third zone will bring our total annual revenue in Pennsylvania to over $2 billion. Centene's participation
in this important program reinforces our national leadership position in long-term care.

Louisiana. I'm pleased to announce that on January 17, 2020, the Louisiana procurement officer found
the state's procurement to be the most -- for the most recent RFP, and I quote, was fatally flawed. After
months of reviewing our protest, the procurement officer agreed the state failed to comply with the
requirements set forth in the RFP MLR. Consequently, the procurement was rescinded and the awards
were canceled. The state and awardees have appealed the decision to the Commissioner of Administration,
and we are currently waiting for a resolution. We remain confident the Commissioner will uphold the
procurement officer's decision. Centene's plan continues to operate under the previously mentioned
emergency contract with the state.

North Carolina. As we have noted, Centene, as a provider of entity, has been awarded 3 regions in
North Carolina. North Carolina's Medicaid managed care program has been delayed from its previously
announced February 1, 2020, start date, pending approval in the state budget. At this point, no
official time line has been announced. We continue to maintain sufficient operations for all required
implementation activities during this period. In addition, we are defending our awards against ongoing
protest and expect that we'll retain all awards once the process is complete.

Illinois. In February, we commenced operations on the state's foster care program, serving approximately
15,000 beneficiaries. We expect additional enrollment of approximately 17,000 later this year.

Health insurance marketplaces. We remain pleased with the strength of our marketplace business, which
has continued to be very popular and an attractive option for many consumers. In 2019, we retained our
market-leading national position. At year-end, we served approximately 1.8 million exchange members
in 20 states. This represented growth of approximately 20% year-over-year. For 2020, we expanded our
footprint in 10 of our existing Ambetter states and 106 new towns. Our continued focus on providing high-
quality affordable health care led to a very successful open enrollment.

In January, we had almost 2.2 million members across 20 states. This represents a year-over-year
increase of approximately 200,000 beneficiaries. In addition, the key demographics of these members
remains relatively consistent with prior years. The average age declined by 1 year to 42. Our retention
rate increased 2% to 82%, and our effectuation rate increased by 3% to 96%. We expect to have another
strong year of operations in our industry-leading marketplace business.

On to Medicare. At year-end, we served approximately 405,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries, a
decrease of approximately 3% year-over-year. We did not achieve our growth expectations in Medicare,
and overall performance has not kept pace with the rest of our products. We have been focused on
addressing the underlying drivers of this underperformance.

The addition of WellCare's high-performing Medicare portfolio will serve as an important catalyst to
accelerate our growth and performance in this business. As I mentioned last month at an investor
conference, we plan to operate our Medicare business under the WellCare brand name. Looking ahead, I'm
comfortable that we will be able to reset the trajectory of this business.

A couple of quick comments. Our medical cost today remains stable and in line with our expectations in
the low single digits. On the rate outlook for 2019, our composite Medicaid rate increase was 2%. We are
expecting a composite Medicaid rate increase of approximately 1.5% for 2020.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Now let me provide commentary on health care legislation and regulatory environment. We believe that
there is little desire in Washington, D.C. to revisit comprehensive health care reform. However, Congress
and the Administration continue to explore ways to improve the health care delivery system. We are
pleased with the end-of-year legislation, which included a provision fully eliminating the health insurer fee
beginning in 2021.

This tax not only increased the cost for seniors and those who purchase commercial coverage, but
requires states to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for a tax that place significant strain under Medicaid
programs. In addition, the marketplace revisions aimed at stabilized individual market further indicate
bipartisan support for exchanges.

Last week, the Administration announced a block grant proposal, aimed at giving states more flexibility
with their expansion population. We are currently reviewing this proposal and look forward to working
with the Administration to help promote Medicaid fiscal integrity, while making sure the program remains
available to those who need it. Centene welcomes the federal government's efforts to promote state
innovation across all programs to make coverage more affordable and sustainable. It represents another
opportunity to be an innovative partner with the states, and Centene, with its local approach, is well
positioned to do so.

In conclusion, 2019 was another very successful year for Centene. We delivered solid financial
performance and made significant progress against our strategic priorities. We look forward to 2020 and
beyond with confidence, as we continue to build on this positive momentum, with a focus on driving
significant growth across the portfolio, with an enterprise on organic growth -- an emphasis on organic
growth, continuing our focus on operational excellence and margin expansion, and investing in the
strength, scale and quality of our enterprise and portfolio to position us to continue to deliver value over
the long term.

Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide you with further details on fourth quarter and
full year 2019 financial results. Jeff?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter and full year
2019 results. Fourth quarter revenues were $18.9 billion, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter of
2018. And adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.73 this quarter compared to $0.69 last year.

Now let me provide additional details for the fourth quarter. Total revenues grew by approximately $2.3
billion over the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of growth in the health insurance marketplace
business, expansion in new programs in many of our states in 2019, particularly Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa,
New Mexico and Pennsylvania, and our recent acquisitions in Spain, this growth was partially offset by the
health insurer fee moratorium in 2019.

Moving on to HBR. Our health benefits ratio was 88.4% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 86.8%
in last year's fourth quarter and 88.2% in the third quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was
attributable to the health insurance marketplace business, where margins have normalized as expected,
from favorable performance in 2018. The increase was also due to the health insurer fee moratorium.

Sequentially, the 20 basis point increase in HBR from the third quarter of 2019 is primarily due to the
normal seasonality in the health insurance marketplace business and a moderate increase in flu-related
costs. The HBR for the fourth quarter was higher than our expectations, driven by higher-than-projected
medical costs in our marketplace business and slightly higher-than-projected flu costs. The marketplace
business continues to perform well and finished the year with pretax margins well within our targeted 5%
to 10% range.

Marketplace membership remains strong as we ended the year with approximately 1.8 million members.
For 2020, we expect our peak enrollment to be approximately 2.2 million members, representing growth
of over 10% from last year's peak enrollment. This is in line with the range that we provided at our
December Investor Day.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Now on to SG&A. Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.5% in the fourth
quarter this year compared to 9.9% last year and 8.8% in the third quarter of 2019. The year-over-year
decrease reflects the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues and lower variable compensation cost in
2019.

The sequential increase is primarily due to an increase in selling costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 and
the impact of approximately $440 million of at-risk state directed payments in California recorded in
premium revenue in the third quarter of 2019.

Additionally, we spent $0.05 per diluted share on business expansion costs during the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded $30 million or $0.05 per diluted share of debt extinguishment costs
related to the redemption of our $1.4 billion, 5.625% senior notes due February 15, 2021. This includes
the call premium, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loss on the termination of the
$600 million interest rate swap associated with the notes.

Investment income was $126 million during the fourth quarter compared to $67 million last year and
$98 million last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects increased investment balances over 2018,
including the proceeds of our $7 billion senior note issuance related to the planned financing for the
cash consideration of the WellCare acquisition, improved performance associated with our deferred
compensation portfolio and the impact of higher investment balances. Sequentially, investment income
increased in the fourth quarter due to the higher investment balances associated to WellCare financing and
improved performance associated with our deferred compensation investment portfolio, which fluctuates
with its underlying investments.

The earnings from our deferred compensation portfolio were substantially offset by increases in deferred
compensation expense recorded in SG&A. Interest expense was $113 million for the fourth quarter
of 2019 compared to $98 million last year and $99 million last quarter. Both the year-over-year and
sequential increase reflects a net increase in borrowings related to the issuance of an additional $7 billion
in senior notes in December 9, 2019, used primarily to finance the cash consideration of the WellCare
transaction. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.3% compared to 32.5% in the fourth
quarter of 2018. The decrease is driven by the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium.

Sequentially, the fourth quarter tax rate was in line with our expectations and lower than the third quarter
tax rate, driven by the vesting of our employee stock awards, which occurred every December.

Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $21.4 billion at quarter end, including $7.2
billion held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues
to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt at quarter end was $13.7 billion, which
includes $93 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio at year-end was
34.3%, excluding our nonrecourse debt and the senior notes issued to fund the WellCare transaction. This
compares to 37.4% at the fourth quarter last year and 35.6% at the third quarter of 2019.

Our medical claims liability totaled $7.5 billion at quarter end, and represents 45 days in claims payable
compared to 48 days in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease in DCP is driven by a reduction in state
directed payments that are a component of our medical claims liability. As we have highlighted in the past,
we expect the DCP to be in the mid-40 range on a run rate basis, but state directed payments at the end
of some quarters have increased our DCP to a higher level.

In the fourth quarter, we did not have any material state directed payments included in our medical claims
liability, which drove the decrease in DCP. Historically, these payments were administered as pass-through
and not a component of medical cost. But as states have moved these payments into premiums with a
small amount of risk, they have been included in premium revenue and medical cost.

Cash flow used in operations was $651 million in the fourth quarter, and cash flow provided by operations
was $1.5 billion for the full year 2019 or 1.1x net earnings. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of
2019 was negatively affected by the timing of payments from a few of our state customers as well as the
absence of material state directed payments that I previously mentioned.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Now let me provide an update on the WellCare acquisition. We are pleased to close the WellCare
acquisition on January 23 and have begun the integration process. Each WellCare share was converted
into 3.38 shares of Centene common stock, valued at $66.76, plus $120 per share in cash for a total value
of $19.6 billion, including $1.95 billion of assumed debt.

Based on the closing price of Centene stock on the acquisition date, we expect our debt-to-capital ratio
to be approximately 39% at close, excluding any share repurchases or repayment of debt associated with
the proceeds from divestitures. Given the closing date, the results for January will be prorated for our
ownership period of WellCare and the divestiture of our Illinois business.

Now shifting to 2020. As stated in our press release this morning, we will be providing consolidated
guidance, including the WellCare acquisition, on Tuesday, March 3, with a conference call the morning of
March 4 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

As I just highlighted, we need to close the month of January and prorate the activity for the month's
performance and account for the divestiture transaction. Absent the WellCare acquisition and related
divestitures, the Centene stand-alone guidance we provided at our Investor Day in December was still
intact. We remain comfortable with the previously communicated accretion targets of no less than
breakeven in the first full year post-acquisition and mid- to upper single-digit accretion in the second full
year.

Additionally, we continue to expect year 2 net synergies of $500 million, and run rate net synergies of
$700 million. We will provide an update to all these metrics on the March 4 call.

While we will provide our formal guidance in March, I would like to highlight a few headwinds and tailwinds
that will affect the guidance for 2020. First, the headwinds. In the S-4, WellCare assumed the North
Carolina contract would begin on February 1. Moving the start date to October 1, in line with our model,
reduces revenue and earnings for 2020.

Second, due to the closing date, Centene will not incorporate 22 days of WellCare's January results into
the combined 2020 guidance. Additionally, the amounts in the S-4 did not account for any divestitures.
The total divested business represents approximately $3.6 billion in annualized 2020 total revenue and
650,000 members.

Now turning to tailwinds. WellCare had a successful open enrollment period for both its Medicare
Advantage plans and Part D plans. Medicare annual enrollment was in line with expectations, and the
PDP business currently has approximately 4.4 million members. Given the timing of close, we continue to
review WellCare's 2019 results, including any onetime items in the effect on the 2020 forecast. As stated
earlier, we will provide a full update on the March call.

In summary, 2019 was a successful year for the company as we continue to execute on our growth
strategy. We grew both total revenues and adjusted earnings by approximately 24% over 2018. Total
revenues grew by $14.5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.88. We reduced our
leverage by 300 basis points in 2019 in preparation for the WellCare acquisition and continued to expand
net income margins. Looking forward, we expect to leverage the combined capabilities to provide
meaningful growth and efficiencies across all of our product lines. We are focused on executing the
integration plan and achieving our stated synergy and accretion targets.
That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

All right. Great. That WellCare commentary was helpful. But I guess I just wanted to see if there was
anything else that you would highlight as far as the delay in the guidance, because I think you guys
provided the guidance for Health Net before the transaction closed. So just wondering if there's anything
else that kind of lowers your visibility or any other items that you really want to get color on before you
provide maybe the proposed MA rates or anything like that that you want to get color on.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, just a couple of things, Kevin. I think it's just purely the timing of the closing, the WellCare -- or
the Health Net transaction closed around the end of March and their annual 10-K audited financials were
already out. And so literally, I think it's just the timing of close. And I think you also have the fact that
their audit is not complete as well as the last step in the regulatory approval process in this transaction
was the Department of Justice piece. So again, we were operating as 2 independent companies until the
time of closure.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

That is a considerably larger complex number of states and businesses they're involved in. And we want
to -- as you know, Kevin, we'd like to do it methodically and carefully, so taking an extra 30 days or so
seemed to make sense.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then just my last question. The MLR on the exchange is coming in higher than you expect in the
quarter. Can you provide a little more color as to why that was the case? And why we shouldn't be worried
that that's going to impact your 2020 outlook? If costs are higher, why doesn't it flow through into how
you price for 2020 if it came in after you priced?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I might just start and then Jeff, pick it up. We want to remind you what we have said historically. One, it is
falling within our guided range of 5% to 10%. Two, we had commented how we are keeping the members
longer, and so that could have an impact on the MLR in the fourth quarter. But because of keeping them
longer, the total margin impact is not affected by it. You may want to go a little bit beyond that, Jeff?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, I would say a couple of things, Kevin. I would say we did see some higher noninflation costs in
the fourth quarter than we anticipated. But also a little less than half of the fourth quarter costs in the
exchange business that were higher than our expectations was associated with the reconciliation of
outstanding claims items that were settled and resulted in more favorable reimbursement going forward.
And the majority of these were in states where we have MLR rebates.

So -- and then the other thing, as we have mentioned -- we did mention in our December Investor Day

would say is you combine all that together, we're still comfortable with where our 2020 expectations are
for the exchange business.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

It's a very strong business. And as I commented, all the demographics continues to own the growth. And
basically what people expected additional competition, et cetera, we continue to do well, and it's -- and
these onetime things Jeff talked about can have an impact. But that's -- that really has a benefit going
forward.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So I guess just to make sure, you're saying that some of these settlements were going to also
prospectively impact costs upward, but there are markets where you have rebates. I guess if you had a
settlement like that in Q4, and you're paying rebates, why would that impact your...

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, no, no. What I'm saying is, is that we had costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter that will provide
better reimbursement going forward.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Oh, better. Yes.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

And those -- yes, and the -- more favorable reimbursement going forward. And those costs that we
incurred in the fourth quarter happened to be in states where we have MLR rebates, so there is some
mitigating effect. And it reduces those MLRs 3-year rolling calculations, so it reduces the effect of the MLR
going forward.

Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

The first one, just on the difference between sort of first year at least breakeven versus missing the first
3 weeks. Should we assume that that's actually a favorable thing in terms of, I think, about PDP benefit
design? Or should we think of it as 2020, no material difference than first year post-closing?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Well, I mean that's why it's one of the reasons why we're waiting, Josh, is you have to actually close the
month of January. And as you're well aware, there could be variability on the medical cost side. I think on
the revenue side, you kind of know your members and you know the premium, but the cost side is what
you don't know. And so one of the reasons we're waiting until the beginning of March to give the combined
guidance is just to get the actual numbers for January and do the proration math.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

Okay. And then how are you guys thinking about PBM opportunity on the legacy WellCare book? I don't
think there was a formal announcement. I know they were talking about making some changes, or at

least going through the process there. Now it's part of Centene overall, and I assume you guys will be
instrumental in that decision-making process, so how are you thinking about that?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I think -- let me -- I'll let Jeff give you the more specifics. But we said earlier that the PBM will be based
in Tampa, and Drew is going to drive that process for us. And we see some real benefits in the total
purchasing power without having a consolidation, but you can give more specifics.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Josh. I think they were in process on an RFP. I think they've concluded that process. Right now, is
what I would say is we're in-flight on the synergy analysis, obviously, looking at their contracts and our
contracts and all the PBM capabilities. And I would say, harmonizing those to achieve the value that we're
trying for in the synergies. So I guess that's where we are. We've begun the process, and we're in process
on that now. More to come in March.

Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

One follow-up on your answer on the PBM question. You mentioned that WellCare concluded the RFP
process. Can you just clarify, did they make a decision on that? Or do they just concluded the review of
the RFP process?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, no. They've made a decision in that. I think they extended their contract with CVS for a period of 3
years.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then just as you think about the MLR obviously, you talked about the moving parts in the fourth
quarter that impact your initial thought. So should we think about kind of like the flu is a 20 bps impact?
Do you think it was kind of like the difference between the high end of your initial range versus where you
came in? And then when we think about the impact in the first quarter, and I know that you don't guide to
the quarter, how should we think about the flu continuing to weigh on MLR?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I guess a couple of things. I just bifurcate the marketplace versus flu. Again, this is versus our
expectations. I would say the marketplace was 2/3 of the variance, with the flu being 1/3. So I think that
gets you close to 20 to 30 basis points on the quarter. So I think you're close on that. As far as the flu for
Q1, we'll have to wait and see. 1 month is not a quarter, and so we'll have to see how flu costs pan out for
the entire quarter. As you're well aware, we did talk about the effect of leap year and the additional day on
the first quarter's performance, and I think we discussed that ad nauseam at our December Investor Day.

Got it. Sorry. Maybe one more follow-up on the PBM question. If there's an extension for 3 years with
CVS, is there any change of control provisions that would allow you as you do the analysis to consolidate
the PBM operations sooner? Or would you have to wait for the 3 years to be over to really kind of roll
something altogether?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I think there's certain flexibility built into the contract. So obviously, they knew they were in the middle of
a transaction. And so I think there's some flexibility in that. But again, we're doing the full analysis as we
speak, and more to come in March.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

It's really the -- and pricing, with the amount of purchasing power we have will be very important.

Charles Rhyee
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Understood. And then just going back to individual a little bit. I think you said that, for the year, you're
sort of well within the target range of 5% to 10%. But when we think about margin normalization over the
near medium term, where do you think we are in the process? Do you think we're going to -- where do
you think we kind of stabilize out over the next year or 2?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, I'll kind of go back to our -- what we said at our December Investor Day. A couple of things to
just highlight, remember, we've always talked about 2018 was a very good year for the marketplace
business. And what we saw in '19 is a margin, a pretax margin that was very consistent with 2017, '16,
'15. So we have seen very consistent margins since the inception of the exchange business. For us, the
outlier is really 2018, which had an exceptional year. And so as we close 2019, I would say margins were
exactly -- they're roughly in line with that experience, meaning, consistent with '17 and '16. So we're still
comfortable that in the 5% to 10% range. And I think we mentioned at our Investor Day that we saw
them moderating slightly, but it's not substantial. We don't see a material moderation of margin from '19
to '20.

So 2020 is probably expected to be a more competitive year for exchanges. And wondering if you can tell

compared to expansions in past years?

Michael Frederic Neidorff

I think I heard the same thing last year. And we grew 10% in a market that shrank 1%. And I think we
have strong networks. We saw a -- we saw the continuity of our members increase by 2%. We saw the
effectuation increase. So -- at every level, and I said all last year that we know how to be competitive.
It makes us better. And I think there is -- the product is strong. And our consumers recognize it, like the
networks we have. And we expect to be more than competitive ongoing.

to Medicare growth? So should we think about that as potentially providing an opportunity to grow above
market rates for Medicare?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

No. I think we're still working through. And now that we're able to work with WellCare, and as I said, we're
going to be consolidating that and we'll also be headquartered in Tampa. We might pull in. And so we're
working through that. They're working with us on the joint ventures. Those are things that are unfolding
very nicely. They'll take time. And I think the time to talk about the impacts they'll have will probably be
when we give guidance for 2021. And the team has had the full look at it. But we really see our trajectory
changing with the input of the marketing and other capabilities that WellCare has demonstrated.

Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs.

I guess, one on the RxAdvance and WellCare. Sort of curious, did WellCare have full visibility into the cost
and benefits of RxAdvance before renewing with CVS? And what your view as...

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, we were -- I want to be very clear, we were very careful, prior to the approval from Department of
Justice, to operate as 2 very separate companies, and that we had no insight into their contracts, and we
were careful they didn't have any of ours because the rules of that are very clear, and it's the old story.
You have to be honest and appear to be honest. And so we -- they'd had no insight into it.

Stephen Vartan Tanal
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just one other on Centene Forward. Wanted to understand how you
guys are sort of thinking about in the context of earnings. Did you expect at any point to sort of commit to
a certain net number contribution? And is that not '20 or '21? Like, just any color on that?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Let me start. I think as we said from the beginning, we are really self-funding a lot of development in
our systems and systems capability. And the name of the game going forward is that -- and that's where
our scale and size as a $100 billion company is so important. We have -- it gives us the resources to
continue to focus on the systems that's going to deliver the kind of performance, margin improvement, et
cetera, in '21, '22 and going forward. And as we start to let some of that fall to the bottom line, as such,
Jeff will be in a position to disclose that in a succinct way. But it's -- that -- so -- I can't -- I'm trying to
remember who that deal -- you have to -- that cost a little bit.

Like your fingernails, you have to continually trim them. And we see this as incorporated in the company.
And it's a continuous process of reducing costs while improving the capabilities of the company. And we're
clearly more pleased with the $500 million that we were able to achieve this past year. And we see it
continuing to grow an additional funding this year, which will just continue the next-generation of systems
work. And in fact, I'm going to give you just a little more color that we have -- we were really bifurcating
or trifurcating, I guess, would be the word, our systems. We have that -- we have a group that's going to
be maintaining the systems that work day in and day out.

We have a group that's going to be working on the transition, because there's a lot of transition with these
systems. And I make no stink of it, and they don't either, that WellCare knew they were going to be sold

at some point. And so there's a lot of little systems that's going to take some time to transition. And that's
why we've said it's a 2-, 3-year process to do it right and get it right, and we're focused on that. And the
third group are the advanced technology group. And these are the think tank people, the people that have
brought us things like Interpreta and others that give us real-time -- HEDIS for the physicians. They're
going to take us to the next generation. So that's being funded by these savings.

Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

First, I just want to follow-up, one last question on the PBM. There were some talk by WellCare Group
getting better economics potentially pulled forward into 2020 debt renewal, even though the contract
doesn't begin or doesn't end to the end of the year, the original contract. So I'm curious, is that something
we should consider that maybe 2020 could be -- could have better PBM costs rather than 2021? And then
can you tell us if the strategy is to move Medicaid over to RxAdvance from WellCare Group thoroughly and
then leave the Medicare PBM for CVS during the contract?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Justin, Jeff here. So as I mentioned before, I mean we're going through the process right now
comparing the PBM contracts and all the capabilities that both companies have and rationalizing that for
the synergy opportunity. And so I'm not going to comment today. I kick that question to March when we
provide full combined guidance because then we'll have the opportunity to have the benefit of visibility on
both those contracts.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And Justin, if I may. Just if we think about when you're combining these 2 companies, we had
multiple work streams that were developed during the period of time we're waiting for Justice approval,
and that's whether it's systems, it's combining them. When you take the Florida and Georgia, they're
large companies, both sides combining them. And the things that we're doing, and while we have divested
some plans, we have obligations there to ensure a smooth transition of that membership, you put all that
together, it's very complex. So we were just trying to take a -- use the next 30 days to take a very careful
view of it and get it right. We're not trying to duck anything except say, it just takes time when it's as
complex as this one. It's -- I keep telling you, it's not how fast, it's how well you do it.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Totally makes sense. I appreciate that. And then just my follow-up is on the exchange medical costs in the
fourth quarter. So Jeff, if we think about the -- you were above the high end of your range by about 20
basis points on MLR, so 80 basis points for the quarter. Can you give us some delineation in terms of how
much of that was the exchange miss? Was it 50 or 60 out of the 80 basis points? Just trying to understand
where exchange margins were in the quarter.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Yes. I'll kind of package everything that I've said together in one; maybe this will clarify everything.
So you're right on the 80 bps. So MLR for the quarter was higher than our expectation by 80 basis points.
I said 2/3 of that was marketplace, 1/3, I would say, is flu. And those are just rough, right? That's -- and
then of the marketplace piece, I said a little bit less than half was associated with these reconciliation of
the outstanding claims, where we effectively had medical costs in the fourth quarter that will provide a
best fit going forward, right? And some of that was in states where we had MLR rebates. And so there's an
offsetting effect there, but it's not a 1:1 because the MLR calculation is a 3-year rolling calculation.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I want to restate it. Just if I may, in my simple nonfinancial. Okay. In fact, the -- when you look at what
we did there, we had some states where balance, billing things were issues because we didn't have a
contract with the hospital. We now have contracts with them. And we got those things settled. We got it
right with them. So we had the expense to settle those claims with those groups. But now going forward,
and these are larger states, going forward in 2020, we're going to be in a stronger position because
they're now part of the network. And those kind of issues won't be there. So it was really a onetime, get
it right. And it could happen again, Justin, be very candid, but I always view those things as that's where
the long term comes in. We were in this, and we continue to do very well in a long time. It will cost us a
couple of bps here or there in the quarter. I'm looking at 2020, and I'm really pleased with what we see
happening, particularly when I see the membership, the effectuation rates, the demographics, it's just a
really great business for us.

Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just on, first, the comment about Medicaid rates. I think you came in, if I've got my notes right, into 2019
looking for a 1.5% increase. And I guess today you're saying that you ended up with about a 2% all-in
increase. And I'm just wondering, is that mostly due to some true-ups around the research verifications?
Or is it something else? And were there any reverifications of note in the fourth quarter? And you're saying
1.5% for 2020, are there potential reverifications that can help you in the early part of 2020?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think we said the rebirth, the -- it's really moderating. And yes, we've had great success because
of real-time systems we've had in getting the states to recognize the membership mix and the acuity mix
within it. We're never satisfied with the timing in how fast they make those investments, but part of it is,
while they say we have real-time systems, they have to wait and see what some others are doing that
don't have that real-time capability, and that can slow down the whole process. So on balance, we were
comfortable that the states and the large states we're working with are going to get it right with us. And
it's just a matter of timing, so which quarter it fall was in? That's a little more hard -- that's a little harder
to forecast, but it's all coming together right there too. Jeff, anything you want to add?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No, I think Michael's exactly right. It's a timing perspective. We're not -- there are some states that were
still searching for rate adjustments heading into 2020. So again, it's a timing issue, and we're still looking
for additional rate adjustments in certain states for this effect.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. But maybe my other follow-up question would be, once you complete the WellCare deal, you said
your pro forma, I think debt to total cap will be at 39% as sort of you're where -- that's within your target
range, I believe. So do you need some time to digest WellCare? Or are you back on the acquisition hunt if
something comes available that's attractive to you?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Let me comment. One, that 39%, we still have to determine the proceeds of sale, and we're looking at
both stock buyback and retirement of debt. So that will help. But I guess I have to respond to this and

say, we're not going to look at anything serious and large until we're really comfortable that the trade, this
transaction and the integration has taken place to a level that's appropriate. But those people that know
us know that we have an insatiable appetite. And so I would say, as soon as -- and they also know we're
balance sheet managers, and we look very carefully at that.

So I would say, as our balance sheet continues to strengthen, this gets integrated. And if we see
opportunities, we'll be back out there. But I have to emphasize what we said at our Investor Day, and I
say it every chance, we are very driven by organic growth. And I remind people, we had almost $7 billion
of organic growth last year. So we're going to continue to focus on that, and that's our primary focus. And
then as we see new capabilities and things we can add, we'll go in the M&A route. Does that help you?

year 2019, how did Medicaid MLR perform relative to your expectations?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke

Medicaid, in aggregate, I think Medicaid was within the range. It wasn't -- we would have called it out if it
was material one way or the other on the full year, when you look at year-over-year results.

here. How are you thinking about this in terms of this being more of a net sort of positive around the
innovation opportunity that you mentioned? Or more of a net potential negative around the funding caps

Let me -- I don't want to be very general on it because it's so early in it. But as we said, this is -- this
involves expansion, not the current businesses. This is key and focused on the expansion of the area.
Caps -- or block grants work really well in states that are not growing and states -- at Oregon have an
impact. So various states will have various impacts. But as we look at it, we think -- I'm going to say that
I tilt towards a net positive on it, because it's giving the states some opportunities to be innovative. And
as you know, we are very decentralized, and our local plans have strong relationships with those states.
And I think they'll be in a position to be able to help the states with that and use some of our assistance
capabilities and tests and model things. But it is limited to the expansion aspect of the business. So that's
key. So I think going forward, I'm going to tilt to the positive side, but we're going to continue to work
with it and help to make it better.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then for my follow-up question, I know there are a bunch of different MLR dynamics discussed
in the exchanges. Jeff, just interested in sort of where the thinking is right now on the risk adjuster
payable ending the year, really 2 things in particular, I just wanted to ask about one, one of -- one of
your peers had cited the weekly report that came out at the end of the year, and that had led them to
make some adjustments to their risk adjuster assumptions. And then also just interested just in terms of
those higher 4Q costs that you had in the exchange business. Does any of that sort of flow through to the
estimated acuity profile of your population relative to the market? Or were those just sort of other factors
that don't play into the risk adjuster assumptions?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, a couple of things. I guess our risk adjustment was in line with our expectations. And when the 10-
K comes out, you'll see the total number. We've got roughly $1 billion payable to the government on the
books. So it wasn't really a risk adjuster phenomenon for us. It was really just higher non-inpatient costs.
And as you're aware, we have to get those -- we're estimating a significant portion of our medical costs.
And so we'll have to wait for those claims to come in and look at the diagnosis codes and submit those for
risk adjustment. And so there may be an effect there, but it's too early to tell.

legacy WellCare and integration? And how do those differ?

Michael Frederic Neidorff

organization chart that we were working with initially. Drew is going to report to me, become part of my
senior management team because of the increased focus on pharmacy at this point in time. Ken, in fact,
he should be here later today, in his new role of markets and products, and he'll help me to do that and
bring that in place. But that's all been laid out. And we operate in what I call a partnership. And people
have clear responsibility, they have the accountability, the responsibility and the authority to manage their
businesses. And when you're at a scale, we are -- this enterprise is now international in scope, you have
to do that. So it's very -- the accountability is just very, very clear. So going forward, that's the basis in
which we're doing it.

In terms of the integration, as you raise it, there's different work streams -- the systems, and I've
commented on that that's going to take time. And there's a group working on the transition of systems.
WellCare is in the middle of transitioning some of their systems. We're bidding in another. So that all has
to be brought into play.

The general measure, I think, Jeff explained, we'll be on a general measure by July 1. So that will all
be in place, and that's in place. They'll be moving to our form of -- we've reserved calculations as that
occurs, and we're doing some of that now. We use date received. So all those things, there's different
work streams for it, it's coming together. We know who will be managing what markets, and they control
that. And that's moving through. And it's because of the need for systems that we're going -- it's going to
take a little bit of time.

You take Florida, they had a large business, we have a large business. And so we're going to operate there
in 2 systems for a short period of time, so we can convert to our systems. So this has all been laid out,
and it's very detailed. And it's something that the Board looks at every quarter. We've probably spent 30,
40 minutes reviewing where we are and how it's going at our Board meeting yesterday. So it's something
we're very comfortable with. And I remind people, it's something we've done historically. I mean Fidelis
was a large company last year, and it's fully integrated, simply moving the claims platform, which we said
all along would take some time. Health Net was integrated. So I mean this -- and the fact that we have
strong management in both companies.

Now I just want to add one more thing that we just lay out to everybody, so they know it. That we had
culture surveys of their culture and our culture. And we can say this is yours, this is ours, and ours is
the one that will prevail. We're not trying to blend things, and we have found historically, that makes a
difference. We also said right up front that all things being equal, in terms of performance, the Centene
person gets the job if there's 2 people for the same job. That does not mean that the WellCare person
will not be re-purposed into a very senior position that gives them challenging new opportunities, but it
also gives them comfort that the next time we do a deal, that they have that same protection. So these
are things that we have historically done that worked really well for us and helped to ensure a smooth
transition, and we expect that again. Does that help you?

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes. Yes, it does. And just as a follow-up, as you spoke about maybe not doing large-scale M&A right now
until this is digested, but obviously, having an ongoing appetite for M&A in general. Could you talk a little
bit about the priorities and talk to whether there are regions or particular capabilities in light of having the
combination of both companies?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Well, I think it's going to -- once again, it's -- we talk about capabilities. Some of that may be
systems. And there's some small acquisitions we can make, because of our size of scale, we don't even
have to disclose it. I have jokingly told people that we did 1 deal and the person was thrilled we didn't
have to disclose it because he said, "Now my families aren't going to be chasing me for some of this
money." So I mean there's some benefit there. But we do that type of thing. Two is the capability. See, if
some other opportunities come up nationally, internationally, we'll do it.

But when I say scale and size, when you're now a $100 billion plus enterprise, with $5 billion of EBITDA
at bottom, and the balance sheet that we have, and the improved credit rating that we have. And what
we're able to sell our bonds at and what our bonds are trading at, it says that what's relative and what
can be done has changed a little bit from several years ago. But we will, once again, just focus on what's
the strategic value and it has to make financial sense, first, then strategic value, and then we'll look at the
capabilities it brings.

And I can't go beyond that because then I'd be starting to tell you who we're looking at.

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.

Peter Heinz Costa
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just want to belabor the point on the MLR guidance for the HICS business one more time, just to make
sure I fully understand what you're saying. You've talked about being in the range of 5% to 10%. But
you've trimmed that back, that guidance into that range a couple of times now, so it seems like you're
probably in the mid- to the lower half of that range. You talked about for next year, still some nonmaterial
moderation of that. So does that really imply that next year you're going to be in the lower half of that
range that you've talked about for sure? Presumably, the tailwind that you pick up from the risk adjusters
being a little better as of the fourth quarter reconciliations doesn't help you that much. And then finally,
does this have anything to do with the Iowa Medicaid claim payments that you were delayed?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. The Iowa, we all know, had some issues. We were culpable as and so they got our attention. It's
being fixed. And we made all the progress we made, and that's kind of historic. And it's not material;
we're going to get the funding. It's not a question of that.

On the medical loss ratio, I want to remind you that it will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on out-
of-pockets, maximum out-of-pockets, a lot of different things. So what we're saying is that in any given
quarter, you'll see some variation. Now we also know that the last quarter of the year tends to be higher
because the maximum out-of-pockets have been met, and sometimes people try to get some services and
other things done. And Jeff commented that the inpatient was a little bit higher, but I expect some of that.
On balance, the 5% to 10% is a solid range. We're very comfortable with it. And in the first quarter, it's
going to be in the higher part of that range.

In the last quarter, it could be in the lower part of that range, but on balance. And we tend to -- we love
to be conservative. We love to under-promise and over-deliver where we can. And so we're saying it's
realistic to say that as the business grows, there may be a little moderation, but it's still solid and it's
solidly in the 5% to 10% range. But if just I tell you where, then I'm giving you more than we have
historically -- it serves no purpose. It's great business.

Our next question comes or Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just a quick question about the group commercial business. I know it hasn't been front and center for a
while, and I'm curious what your thoughts are on the state of that business coming to 2020, the intensity
of competition there?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we have some of it in California. We've said we'll maintain it. It's good business for us. And I would
say that all that's under a strategic review. But honestly, Matt, I'm back burning a little bit, so I want to
get -- I want to get WellCare fully integrated and get things before we start distracting people in some
other opportunities.

Maybe just going back to the divestitures. Thanks for the revenue number, but can you also make any
comments relative to profitability and size of the proceeds? And have you actually decided whether
you're going to redeploy on buybacks or debt paydown? Or is that still to be determined as you put the
consolidated guidance together?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we -- where we're going through right now, that analysis, and that's going to be a function of stock
price as much as anything. And so stay tuned. That's something will resolve, probably, Jeff, what, next 30
days or so?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Yes, absolutely. And then the other thing on the size of proceeds, $1 billion pretax. So $1 billion
pretax is the proceeds. And that, by the way, that also includes statutory capital as well.

Michael Anthony Newshel
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. Got it.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

I think it was a fair transaction for everybody.

Michael Anthony Newshel
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Maybe one more, just -- sorry if I missed it. But do you have any update to marketplace enrollment
expectations for 2020 now that open enrollment is over?

Yes, we said 2.2 million, 2.2 million members, peak.

Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

First, just a quick clarification. Did you say the higher MLR, was it non-inpatient? I think, Jeff, that's what
you said. I thought Michael, in my recollection, said inpatient.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes.

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I'm sorry. It was non-inpatient. I -- I...

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

It was non-inpatient side.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then if you could just flesh out when you say non-inpatient, is that just elective outpatient? Is it drug?
Just help us in terms of what areas popped to that magnitude to drive the MLR?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I think we just saw normal PCP visits. So it wasn't necessarily in the specialist category. So just higher
doctor visits is what I would say.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. All right, fair enough. And then just my quick follow-up here. Any initial comments around some
of the proposed changes for HICS in 2021? And I guess specifically around pulling tax credits for those
who pay 0 premiums if they don't enroll and don't update their income. I guess just trying to understand
logistically, do most update each year so it's a nonissue? Or how easy would it be for you all to sort of aim
in making sure this sort of gets done? And if you could, just what percentage of your HICS enrollees pay 0
premium?

Kevin J. Counihan
Senior Vice President of Products

It's Kevin Counihan. So the payment notice just came out Friday, as you know. We're still digesting a lot
of those issues that you speak to. We've got broad diversity of folks within the FPL range, I think as you
know, though we tend to have the majority under 250%. So again, not trying to be evasive, but we still
are just working through the payment notice.

Operator

Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I wanted to ask a question on revenue, may seem trivial, but you were outside of your revenue range
by about $400 million. It doesn't seem like exchange retention is enough to account for all of that. I just
want to make sure there weren't any onetime benefits flowing through the revenue line.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

No. I think, Dave, I think we -- there -- we mentioned in the, I guess, in our December Investor Day that
we thought the fourth -- it was either Q3 call or December Investor Day that our fourth quarter revenue
will be lower than our third because of the size of the pass-through payments. And I think we did get a
few pass-through payments in the quarter that kind of helped revenue. We don't have great visibility on
these from states, and so they just show up. So I think our -- we expected a bigger drop in revenue from
Q3 to Q4, but we had $100 million or so in payments.

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then second question, just again, to go back to your headwind and tailwind commentary. I want
to make sure I understand that that is relative to S-4 but your guidance, both on to the earlier question
about divestitures, but also in terms of timing of close, that it would seem that those 2 items, relative

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

to what you would have baked into your neutral in year 1 and mid- to high single-digit accretion in year
2, that particularly the year 1 element of that that those 2 things probably came out better than you
expected. Is that a fair conclusion timing of close in divestitures?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Which 2 items came out better than we expected?

David Howard Windley
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Timing of close and the magnitude of divestitures.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, yes, but the time you closed. I mean when we gave our numbers, we are -- the accretion target is a
full year, right? So it doesn't really matter when it starts, it's a full year. And my point on the guidance is
that we're going to have to prorate January, and that's going to have an effect, right? I mean if you just
take the WellCare top line number that they were -- they expected to hit for 2019 and you take 22 days
out of that that's a sizable number.

Operator

Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I appreciate the -- I wanted to -- I had a clarification on that last point as well. So maybe I'll try to put
it a little clearer because I've had a few questions. So Jeff, when you'd laid out some of the headwinds
around health care, those are relative to ultimately the 2020 consolidated pro forma guidance you're going
to give, those are not headwinds to the year 1, at least, neutral accretion guidance?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Yes. Yes, that is correct. Yes, yes, yes, you're correct on that.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. I just had a couple of questions. My last one, I wanted to go back to the exchange question just
1 more time, and make sure I understood about -- you had mentioned that some of the increased
costs were in states where you were already up against the minimum MLRs that had some accruals. So
effectively, costs -- additional costs you would have incurred in those states, I guess, might have -- would
not have impacted earnings because you'd already -- your margin is essentially already capped or your
MLR is already capped. And consequently, moving into next year, any improvement wouldn't flow through
the earnings. Because again, your MLR, at least, is already essentially capped if you're into the minimum
MLRs. Am I understanding that correctly? Or is there a different point you were trying to convey on that
part?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

The biggest piece of that that you're missing is that the MLR calculation is a 3-year rolling calculation.
So to the extent we had costs in the fourth quarter, and you're in a minimum MLR rebate, it's not a 1:1,
right? And it depends on the magnitude of the prior year MLR rebates. And so when you go forward, if I
had lower MLR rebate in 2019, that is a lower amount that I have to deal with in the future, right? So it's
not a 1:1. I mean you could -- if everything was equal per year, you could say it's a 1/3 benefit. So if we

CENTENE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

had costs in the fourth quarter, we'd get 1/3 of that back. But the math isn't that simple because every
year is a different MLR number.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So the math is complex, but I think the point you were trying to convey, though, at least, was that the
thought that incurring some of these settlements and reaching in network agreements with some of these
PCPs, ultimately, was going to provide some better overall performance in 2020.

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, right.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Is that fair?

Jeffrey Alan Schwaneke
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Well, I would say there's 2 things. Number one, it's better reimbursement, more favorable
reimbursement for us going forward as a contracted provider, right? So that helps. And then yes, it
reduces the aggregate level of MLR payable that you have, and so thereby, provides a benefit going
forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.

George Robert Hill
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

A lot of my questions have been answered. I guess I'd ask one kind of philosophically on the Medicaid
demonstration projects around the block grants. Do you guys, in the pharmacy business, feel like you're
better off with the statutory rebate on the drug side? Or do you feel these guys -- like the business would
be better served taking a formulary approach in being able to negotiate your own discounts and rebates?

Michael Frederic Neidorff
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean I always -- I've always liked the idea we are more masters of our destiny, right? But I think
when you have the systems we have and the capabilities and where we're going, we have the flexibility to
work either way. So we'll make our decisions, as I've always said, based on the facts of what they are at
the time, and these are still issues under discussion. And there's opportunities to influence some aspects
of it, we believe. And that's what we'll do. And it's -- we just take a very open-ended approach to it. And
I'm comfortable we'll end up in a strong position at the end of the day.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael
Neidorff for any closing remarks.

Michael Frederic Neidorff

Well, we thank you for your comments and thoughts today and the chance to clarify some of these things.
And we're looking forward to the March 4, as I recall that's the date, Jeff, where we're going to be able to
give you the full guidance and kind of set the baseline on what this combined company will be doing going
forward, and we believe it will be very significant.
