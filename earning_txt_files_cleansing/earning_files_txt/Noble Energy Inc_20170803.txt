Thanks, Dave
I'd like to start with highlights from our U.S
onshore business
We continue to see tremendous drilling advancements, especially in the Delaware and the DJ Basins, which are clearly driving substantial cost efficiencies
Our average 2017 drilling cost per lateral foot in these areas is down 20% to 30% compared to last year
We expect to further this track record of success as we advance new techniques that improve drilling efficiencies and lower costs
For example, we've incorporated new advances in data analytics along with physics-based learning processes in our drilling operations
Our real-time capabilities and advanced data techniques have allowed us to develop and utilize algorithms that provide predictive changes that we incorporate to further improve our performance
With the teams working collaboratively utilizing these new approaches, we're continuing to be successful in driving down costs, minimizing non-productive time on the rig, and ultimately delivering a better well for completion
We also continue to realize significant improvements and efficiencies on the completion side, particularly in the Delaware Basin
As we progress the multi-well pad developments, we've shaved days off of our planned cycle times compared to single-well completions
Continuous operations, and zipper fracking, reduced completion time on the 10,000-foot Wolfcamp A wells on the Monroe pad by more than a week from our plan
In addition, our midstream business is providing a significant operating advantage, particularly in the Delaware
Our teams are quickly applying our expertise from the DJ Basin and coordinating development with Noble Midstream-operated centralized facilities
This critical infrastructure will be integral to the development of our Delaware acreage position
Combining these competitive advantages with our premier quality U.S
onshore assets positions Noble to deliver truly differential value
Since closing the Clayton Williams Energy acquisition, our teams have not missed a beat with integrating activities across the entire Delaware position
We've been able to immediately apply learnings to the Clayton Williams acreage, including drilling the first 10,000-foot laterals on the position
We also recently completed three wells with Noble's standard high-intensity completion design, and we look forward to sharing the results in the future
High-quality rock, along with our operational expertise, has led to industry-leading wells
As you've seen from our press release and supplemental slide deck, the results being generated across our acreage position are very encouraging and include wells from the Wolfcamp A and B zones
We've also highlighted recent results from Clayton Williams' wells, including extended production history from the Wolfcamp C well, which is outpacing expectations
We continue to evaluate the best completion designs with a strong focus on optimizing capital efficiency
We plan to test variations in stage spacing, number of clusters per stage, and local sand sources
In addition, we will conduct a completions test, utilizing produced water, later this year
Our database of production, drilling, and completion information continues to rapidly expand
We're watching extended results from all of our wells, including those with our highest intensity completions
In particular, we remain very encouraged by the 5,000-pound-per-foot Pony deal completion that we highlighted last quarter, which continues to widen its outperformance compared to the offset 3,000-pound-per-foot job
Our teams are busy with the ramp in the Delaware, and we expect to bring on production 35 to 40 more wells through the remainder of the year, with the majority coming online in the fourth quarter
In late July, we began producing into the Billy Miner central gathering facility operated by Noble Midstream, which also provide access into their partly-owned Advantage oil pipeline system
Our Monroe pad, a three-well pad of 10,000-foot laterals targeting both the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp A and the Third Bone Spring zones, ties into this facility and is commencing production
The coordinated efforts between the Noble Energy and Noble Midstream teams was a great accomplishment considering the scale of this development, and resulted in the safe execution of this project
We're also progressing a number of additional pads that will tie into this facility
A second central gathering facility is expected to come online towards the end of the year, along with a seven-well, multi-zone spacing test within the Calamity Jane area in the northeast portion of our acreage
We're currently planning two additional facilities to come online in the first half of 2018 on the southern part of our acreage
These initial facilities, along with planned expansions, will increase oil gathering capacity in the basin to 90,000 barrels per day by the middle of next year
Moving to the DJ Basin, the dominant theme continues to be performance improvements from enhanced completions, which drove us to record volumes in our focus areas of Wells Ranch and East Pony, along with a record oil mix of 53% for the basin
On slide 11 we outlined our well results to date for the year
In both Wells Ranch and East Pony, we continue to substantially outpace the type curve
A third of the 2017 wells shown in the Wells Ranch plot are from the 13 wells shadow pad, which was completed using our standard design of 1,800 pounds per foot
The per well average production is over 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day for more than 100 days
As part of this pad, we were testing two different completion designs, holding our cluster spacing consistent but widening stage spacing, which reduces completion cycle time
Early results indicate similar well performance across the pad, and we'll continue to watch extended production histories
In East Pony, we brought online a combination of both enhanced completions as well as lower concentration jobs
Overall, the 2017 wells are producing tremendous results, including some of our highest 30-day peak rates for 1000-foot achieved, within the second quarter
East Pony wells are averaging over 80% oil
Our extremely strong horizontal well performance in the DJ has offset lower than expected, gassier vertical production in the second quarter
This is evidenced by a 6% increase in liquids and 11% decrease in gas sales volumes compared to the first quarter
A portion of this vertical production decline was due to the further expansion of our previously announced deferrals of well work-overs
For wells with low production rates, high gas mix and higher lease operating expense, work over-expenditures often don't make economic sense at this time
Vertical wells have also been affected by higher gathering line pressures outside of our current focus areas
Vertical volumes averaged 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter and are expected to be down a few thousand barrels in 3Q and 4Q, and will continue to decline for the foreseeable future
This will impact gas volumes more than oil
The vast majority of our horizontal production remains protected behind compression on Wells Ranch or flowing to own gas plants in East Pony
And we anticipate the horizontal volumes, by the end of this year, to be up 8% year-over-year
Before moving on from the DJ Basin, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank our teams for their dedication and the response to the notice to operators issued by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission
Year-to-date our teams have successfully completed approximately 7,500 flow line integrity tests across the field and have permanently abandoned 4,000 off pad flow lines
We put in over 45,000 incident free man-hours to timely execute these activities
Demonstrating Noble's commitment to ensuring the safety of people, protection of the environment, and the integrity of our operations
On laying out our plans for 2017, we've said that the Eagle Ford would be a significant contributor to the U.S
onshore volume growth
But we certainly realize that growth in the second quarter with average volumes growing 60% over the first quarter of 2017. Completed our drilling program and the highly prolific Southern Gates Ranch Row 4, as part of systematic development approach to optimize performance
The wells we brought online so far are some of the best in the basin and are performing within our expectations, achieving an average IP 30-rate of approximately 620 barrels of oil equivalent per day per 1,000 lateral feet
The volume growth in the Eagle Ford is anticipated to continue, as we've only brought online about half of the South Gates Ranch wells that we have planned for the full year
Moving to our Eastern Mediterranean assets
Sales volumes from Tamar once again benefited by Israel's increasing shift to natural gas usage for power generation
In the third quarter, sales volumes are anticipated to be slightly higher due to seasonal demand
In fact, production for certain days in June and July has exceeded nameplate capacity of over 1.1 Bcf a day
This substantial in-country demand, coupled with the government's mandates increased natural gas usage in power generation to 80%, underscores the importance of Leviathan's development to the state of Israel
Our teams are continuing to progress Leviathan towards first gas by the end of 2019. Recently completed drilling operations at Leviathan 5, after which, the rig was released
We've tendered for a rig to drill and complete the remaining wells, which is the last major contract for the project
And we anticipate awarding that contract in the next couple of weeks and the rig should be in the field in first half of next year
We've outlined our guidance for the remainder of 2017 in the supplemental slides
We're moving to full-year sales volumes from the Marcellus, along with some other non-core divestments
We remain on track to deliver our original annual volume guidance of 340,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
This is in spite of the impact of zero expected liftings at Alba and EG in the third quarter and the lower DJ vertical volumes I already mentioned
We're still on plan to deliver significant growth from our U.S
onshore assets, with oil expected to increase approximately 40% from the first quarter through the fourth quarter
In fact, when you look at the quarterly trend and remove the impact of divestments, we delivered 15% higher U.S
onshore oil volumes in the second quarter
The third quarter is expected to be up another 5% and the fourth quarter up nearly 20%
This puts us in great shape with our plan for the year adjusted for the divestments
As you can see from our comments, we're performing very well
And I'm excited for the rest of the year
And with that, Katrina, we'll open the call for questions
I think from the production standpoint, we've been incorporating more and more of our recent performance into those forecasts
And that's partly what allows us to offset like the vertical declines in the DJ, for example
So, I'd say we've got much more of that incorporated than we have in the past
I think as far as the efficiencies showing up, I mean you're seeing that and us being able to maintain our original guidance while actually bringing fewer wells online
So, we're not only drilling wells faster, getting them on production potentially quicker; but then with better results per well, we're able to deliver the same volume for fewer wells online
We're working on those, just like we have consistently in the DJ Basin over the years
We've talked in the past about two large acreage trades that we did in the DJ over the last several years, but we've actually done many smaller ones, too, down the one-off locations that you don't ever really hear about
We're doing the same thing in the Delaware
We're looking for those opportunities, where somebody has 40 acres, 80 acres offsetting us, and we have the opportunity to trade it for an equivalent amount somewhere else, and actually, firm up each company's ability to drill longer laterals
So, that's just part of our ongoing daily business that we do
Well, I think when you look at our slides, I mean, we show the resource inventory that we've got, the Delaware Basin course, it's 2 million barrels equivalent, and then we show an average lateral length of all those 4,000-plus locations of almost 8,000 feet
Well, I think you're seeing a combination of things, Dave
I mean, it starts with the movement to have a larger percentage of the power generation coming from gas and moving off coal
We saw that switch as they moved to trying to push closer to 60%, which is what we've been seeing being used by gas
And I think we've actually even seen the ministry out talking about continuing to push that closer to 80% over time
I think you're also seeing even with Leviathan coming online now – not coming online, but the project being sanctioned that you got this line of sight that's creating additional comfort in just the demand growth, even on small projects in the country
So, you're seeing that combination of things that continues to increase probably at a faster pace than we originally even anticipated
Thanks, Dave
The vertical volumes in the DJ, as we said, we were about 11,000 barrels equivalent in 2Q and we expect that to continue to come down in 3Q and 4Q for a variety of reasons, probably a few thousand barrels a day in each quarter
A part of its line pressure is part of it, as we've said
We've really curtailed our investment in work-overs and facility modifications, and things like that on the vertical program
And then, just, obviously, underlying natural declines since we're not drilling any vertical wells or doing any refracs, or anything like that
So, it's coming down for a variety of reasons
I'd say that the line pressures that we've seen have been really outside of our core operating areas in the DJ
And they haven't really affected any of our focus areas in Wells Ranch and East Pony
We continue to be very well protected there
So, to the extent that you might see a little more impact from higher line pressures outside of those areas
I think, at this point, it's not going to impact us significantly, I would say
And anything that does impact us, we think we can cover with the performance we're seeing from our wells, which, again, as I alluded to in answer to Dave's question
The outperformance of the new well that's coming online is able to cover that
Well, I think as you allude to, Evan, we really are seeing that demand increase showing up
You look at it quarter-on-quarter, second quarter this year versus second quarter of last year
I think as far as ongoing contracting, we're making great progress
I think in Israel, as we've talked about it, as they continue to push more power generation from coal to gas, that's helpful and those discussions
And then also, just additional folks, that now as a result of us having sanctioned Leviathan, they're now in a position where they're more comfortable sanctioning their own projects that will use more gas
I think on some of the regional discussions, I think they're progressing nicely
I think all of the combination of those things are what gives me confidence that we'll, as I've said before, we should have solidified a Bcf a day or so by the time Leviathan comes on production
I mean there's, we've talked about that in the past, of potentially filling in some of that gap
That gap's kind of narrowing with the in-country demand in Israel
You know, where you're up, you're starting to approach a Bcf a day in and of itself
So, there's probably not as big a portion, but we'll continue to look at that on just the ability to continue to maximize and fill in any capacity we may have, especially in off-peak periods
Well, I think there's a bit of a timing issue there probably because we are bringing fewer wells online, and it's not like we're just shutting down everything in December
So, that impact is kind of spread throughout the second half of the year, I would say
So there is probably a little bit of a timing impact
I mean, part of it has been, we've been so efficient in getting wells drilled and completed in the DJ and being able to deliver on our targets there with fewer wells, that we've taken the opportunity to shift some of that capital down to the Eagle Ford and actually bring some projects forward there, too
So, that's setting up the Eagle Ford very nicely to not only deliver what we already plan to deliver this year, but setting it up better for 2018 as well
Yes, and Doug, this is Gary
I'd just reinforce both of those are really moving dollars from 2018 into 2017. So, it's just being a little further along in both of those project areas than we anticipated when we put our original guidance out
David, this is Gary
We haven't actually changed the cluster spacing, we've just been testing wider stage spacing
So, you can still have the same cluster spacing, the same effectiveness of the frac, frac it with the same efficiency but have wider stage spacing, then you can reduce the cycle time, the completion time of the well quite a bit
So, we've tested some of that
We like what we've seen so far
I think we need to see a bit more data to convince ourselves that that's something that can be repeated
But if it is a situation where we can have the same number of clusters, the same cluster spacing, the same efficiency of fracking those clusters but with wider spacing and shorter times and less cost, then that's obviously something we're going to continue to pursue
I add, I mean, it's a lot of wells, but it's spread between the three areas, right? We got 35 plus or minus in the Delaware in the second half and 55 to 60 in the DJ and 20 or so in the Eagle Ford
So, it's split between three areas
We've got – it's pretty much in line with our original plans, as Dave said
As I mentioned earlier, there's actually fewer wells online in the DJ in the original plan
But these are plans that have been in place for quite a while and the teams have been working very closely with all service providers that we need to interact with to make sure these come on, on time
So, I feel very comfortable with where we're at
Hey, Brian
I think part of what may be driving that, Gail, is that East Pony wells on average are probably shorter lateral length
The longer laterals, as we've talked in the past, we ramped them up slower and then they stay flatter for a much longer period of time
So I think probably you're just seeing the impact of that
Gail, I'm not going to get into all the details of the chemistry involved
But basically what we're doing is just running the appropriate test on the core, the water samples, and getting comfortable that we can use our own produced water to frac wells in the future
We've got plenty of water right now
We've got our own water rights and we've got plenty of fresh water to handle our fracs for the foreseeable future
We've modeled up to at least the next five years and we don't have any issues there at all, but it sure would be nice to utilize our produced water for those fracs if we can and recycle that rather than taking fresh water out of the ground, and also save us obviously on some disposal costs
So it's something the teams are spending a lot of time on
They're doing a lot of testing to ensure that the chemistry works and that we don't end up getting rid of some produced water but damaging the formation in the meantime
And we'll be doing some testing of that in the field later this year
Yeah
We still got a number of Lower Eagle Ford locations after we finish up this South Gates Ranch Row 4 area, spread through the rest of the acreage in the northern part of the Gates Ranch as well as some of the other
Beyond that, you're right
The Lower Eagle Ford we keep is busy for probably another year or so
Upper Eagle Ford, we've done some testing on it
We've seen some things that we like
We need to see a bit more history to see how it's going to stack up against the Delaware and DJ going forward as far as returns, and that's how we'll make the decision
I mean, if it's something that competes for capital then we'll obviously move forward on that development
And if it's something that doesn't compete for however much capital we have available to deploy at any time, then we won't; we'll direct it to somewhere else
But I think given the limited testing that we've done to-date and the history that we've got, it's probably too early to make that call
It's on the slide
It's on slide 6. You can see it's the Trigger 40 well on slide 6, so you can see it relative to the type curve
Yeah
I think we had talked about that a little bit on the last call
And if I remember right, what I said at that point was we were looking at probably doing one or two later this year
I think the latest plan is probably for one late this year and probably a second one early 2018, and we will be testing some of that acreage that's kind of outside of our core IDPs
It's an area where we've done some drilling in years ago with the prior completion designs
It wasn't something that we got all that excited about at that time based on the results we saw
But given some of the performance uplift we've seen in the other areas with the new designs that we've got, it's certainly worth going back and testing because we've got quite a bit of acreage in those areas
And if we can generate that same type of uplift, the EURs and production and returns in that area than we've seen in the others, then it could very well compete for capital going forward
