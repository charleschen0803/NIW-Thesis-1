Thanks, Kate
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today
For today's earnings call I will cover the high-level trends we are seeing in the business
And Dave Morton will then discuss certain financial highlights
And I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter
Before I begin my operational comments, I would like to discuss our announcement today of Seagate's CEO succession plan
Today, Seagate's Board of Directors voted unanimously in favor of my transition to Executive Chairman of Seagate and appointed Dave Mosley as Chief Executive Officer
Dave and I will assume our new roles effective October 1, at which time I will shift my focus primarily to strategic growth initiatives and other opportunities designed to enhance shareholder value for the company
Dave has also been appointed to the Seagate's Board of Directors effective immediately
Over the last two years the board and I have been focused on executive management succession
In addition to Dave's appointment, Dave Morton transitioned to CFO 18 months ago
And recently we have appointed Jim Murphy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing; Kate Schuelke as Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary; and Ravi Naik as our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer
In addition, as part of the restructuring actions taken over the last 12 months to optimize our global manufacturing and development center investments, we have also aligned all of our manufacturing operations under Senior Vice President of Operations, Jeff Nygaard
And we have reorganized our R&D functions to meet the evolving storage marketplace requirements
The board and I believe we have the right management team and organizational structure in place to execute Seagate's business strategy, capitalize on opportunities in the storage marketplace, and continue to create long term shareholder value
It's been an honor and a privilege for me to serve as Seagate's CEO in 16 of the last 20 years
I'm grateful to our amazing employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders
And I look forward to working closely with the management team on our future opportunities in my new role as Executive Chairman at Seagate
Turning to our operational results
The overall macro environment continues to exhibit stability
And we believe this will continue through the rest of the calendar year and well into 2018. We remain cautiously optimistic that this should translate to moderate IT spending growth
In the context of the storage marketplace the major transformative shifts from a client server to mobile cloud high capacity mass storage deployments continue to represent significant opportunity for Seagate
The long term trajectory of growth in infrastructure spending for the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies remains intact, as they continue to increase their service offerings and demonstrate significant business momentum
At the same time, the more mature enterprise storage technologies remain a large percentage of the overall IT storage market and can exhibit variance beyond seasonal patterns as the structural shift to a wide variety of IT and cloud service providers accelerates
In addition, the end-to-end storage supply chain is continuing to experience price increases by as much as 2 times to 3 times in the memory markets
The effect of this significant price increase is evidenced by some near time enterprise customer demand softness, which we believe will be resolved over the next several quarters
For the June quarter Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.4 billion, GAAP gross margins of 27.7%, net income of $114 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.38. On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 28.9%, up 310 basis points year over year, net income of $192 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.65. HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 62 exabytes
Average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was approximately 1.8 terabytes per drive
And ASPs per unit were $64. We saw strength in the quarter from our largest nearline U.S
based CSP customers and relative seasonal demand in the compute and branded markets
Offsetting this was weakness in our enterprise storage customers, including traditional OEM nearline and mission critical demand, China CSP nearline demand, and our own Cloud Storage Systems business
In addition, there was weakness in the surveillance and NAS markets due to some intraquarter channel inventory management
As a result, our overall revenue results were approximately 5% below plan, with approximately half of that shortfall from our Cloud Storage Systems and half from HDD enterprise weakness and channel inventory management
We believe some of these factors, particularly China CSP demand and NAS and surveillance market demand, are temporal and supply chain related, while some of the OEM revenue declines are more structural
Our non-GAAP margin results of 28.9% were approximately 210 basis points below our guidance
Within this, approximately two-thirds of the impact was due to operational trends issues in our CSSG business and approximately one-third was due to lower than expected enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix
GAAP operating expenses were $470 million, down 16% year over year
And non-GAAP operating expenses were $422 million, down 5% year over year
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $243 million
And free cash flow was $139 million, up 13% year over year
While we were disappointed to not meet our top-line targets in the June quarter, Seagate effectively achieved our operating margin and gross margin profitability targets for fiscal year 2017. For the year, diluted earnings per share grew 215% on a GAAP basis and 82% on a non-GAAP basis
In addition, for fiscal year 2017 we generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations and returned 53% of that to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases
In summary, I'm pleased with the operational improvements we made in fiscal year 2017. And we are well positioned for the markets that are being served by our products and systems
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton now to go into more details on our operational activities
Thanks, Dave
Turning to the market outlook
We remain cautiously optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment and IT and enterprise spending trends
We believe the end to end supply chain issues we identified last quarter will persist at least through the end of the year
And therefore, we want to exercise more caution than seasonally normal for traditional enterprise spending and other markets affected by higher than normal supply chain pricing
At the same time we are continuing to anticipate a stronger back half of the calendar year for exabyte growth with the CSP ecosystem and seasonal demand for our other major markets, including PCs and the branded market
For the September quarter we are expecting to achieve revenues of between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion
Our gross margin expectations for the September quarter are relatively flat and within our 29% to 33% targeted range
Cash flow from operations will be up sequentially
As Dave indicated, non-GAAP operating expenses will trend sequentially down to approximately $415 million in the September quarter
And we expect to exit the December quarter at or below $400 million
While we are not on a trajectory to meet our previous guide of non-GAAP EPS of $4.50 for calendar year 2017, we do anticipate revenue and profit growth sequentially for the December quarter
Thank you for joining us on the call today
And we'll now open the call up for questions and answers
Question-and-Answer Session
So, Katy, let me first say, while I appreciate your congratulations on the retirement, much to my children's chagrin, I have not retired
In fact, this is probably the best way for me to stay engaged with the company for a few more years
But I did I suppose retire from the CEO job
But so I'm super happy about where I'm headed and what my engagement will be with the company
Also super happy that Mosley is CEO
As I said to someone the other day, that running a disc drive company is a little bit like driving in stop-and-go traffic
Sometimes you're going 15 miles an hour and sometimes you're going 85 miles an hour
But you usually get to your destination on time and no one's hurt
But it's stressful as shit for the driver and oftentimes for the passengers too
So I think we have a younger driver with better reaction times now
The – I think your point is right on where we're headed on margins
The way we see the math, to your point, clearly ramps are always challenging, whether or not it's a 2.5-inch notebook product or a 3.5-inch surveillance product or a high-end nearline product
And whenever you're ramping the products, the yields come up the ramp
And you get better and you also do redesigns and bring costs down
And you also start to understand customer needs, which allow you to optimize the firmware, et cetera, et cetera
So we would expect that with the ramp on those products and the overall mix-up that occurs as customers move from 10s [terabytes] to 12s [terabytes] to 14s [terabytes] to 16s [terabytes] that we have opportunity to move up in that margin range
I think the good news on the quarter frankly is even with the weakness that we had in nearline and mission critical in certain customer bases and even within the services group, the margins that they did contribute were not what they should have been
Even with that, the overall margin structure was pretty solid, which I think should give you a good sense of the underlying core HDD business is operating pretty nicely right now
And yes, it should improve as we execute here in the second half of the year
Yeah
Let me answer that
And then I'll turn the other thing back to Mosley
Like, we've never talked about where our gross margins are by products
And it's a really dangerous game to get in, because we're so leveraged in our manufacturing and our R&D systems that to try and actually splice margins by segments, while it may be a fun accounting practice, it's really deceiving from an overall business practice
I will tell you though that our client portfolio has definitely greened up in terms of the technologies we're deploying
And again we have an areal density lead there that's now going on almost two years
So that means fewer heads and discs
So to reach the same capacity points those clearly have better margins than they did historically for us competitively
So but I think the real message here is that it's you have to view it as the manufacturing company as a whole
And we strive to get as much leverage as we can across the components into the products as possible
If you go back a year ago, we kind of – I think we did at the June call of last year indicate that we were going to take a variety of actions on the manufacturing side to address the capacity issues and where that would have a significant COGS impact, which is obviously reflected
And secondly, that we were going to work OpEx on two different vectors
One was absolute OpEx dollars, and the other was to maintain our margin model that we've committed to and we're staying committed to
That one, as you may remember, wasn't kind of on the steady ramp down, because the last six months of last year were quite strong
And we needed to keep a fair amount of people in place to actually meet the upside demand
And there was also some critical product transitioning going on that we felt it made sense to keep the resources in place to make sure those transitions went well
And that benefited us extremely through fiscal year 2017, where we obviously overachieved fairly dramatically relative to where we were a year ago
So I think we're back on how do we get to $400 million? I would probably say though, as we think about going from $400 million to $375 million, that that is not a reflection so much of something going on in the market as much as a reflection of what happens when you start making adjustments to your OpEx
You obviously then see other opportunities where you can take some additional actions
And some of it is also related to things that Dave Mosley mentioned about what's the quality of business that we're doing in the systems side? And what's the underlying OpEx support for that? And does that math really make sense? So a little bit of that, I'd say in terms of how we're going to get from $400 million to $375 million
But not like market-related to the sale of disk drives
It's more I think related to what we think we can do within the context we've always described as one that's positive
Okay
I think we have time for one more question, because I know we're running into the open here
And we want to be respectful of that
I'll do the HAMR first
So this is a technology, for everyone's benefit, that we've been working on for quite some time in the hard drive industry
It's the next S-curve
The top of the areal density curve that we're on right now, it's getting harder and harder to squeeze that much more out of
The progress – and we haven't talked about HAMR very much in the last two years
But the progress has actually been pretty substantial in the labs both on the reliability front, which was really the issue, and then on the demonstration of areal density front as well
So historically we had talked about 20-terabyte drives in 2020. And we still are on path for those kind of demonstrations
We're going to shoot as high as we can
And we may even get above that based on what we're seeing in the labs right now
But productization is looking more and more favorable all the time
And we're going to be driving hard from it from inside of Seagate
So what that means is there's been a lot of discussions about 12 [terabytes] and 14 [terabytes] and then ultimately we'll get to 16 terabytes
But we will get to 20 [terabytes] and 24 terabytes some day
And we're seeing that – those kind of components in the labs right now that with the right amount of coaxing, we'll get them into products and get them out to the markets
And then on
Okay
I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to be on the call today and thanks to our employees and our customers and suppliers and investors
Look forward to talking to you next call
