Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and thank you for holding. Welcome to Aon plc's Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] I would also like to remind all parties that this call is being recorded. If anyone has
an objection, you may disconnect at this time.

It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements
that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such
differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2021 results as well as having
been posted on our website.

Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by
Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President.

As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.

We want to begin by thanking our 50,000 colleagues. 2021 continues to be a remarkable year. And as a
result of our colleagues' hard work, dedication and perseverance, we've delivered outstanding results in
Q3 and year-to-date. This performance is an extraordinary accomplishment and a direct result of their
efforts, working together as one firm to bring the best of Aon to clients.

We're also proud to report that our client feedback continues to be outstanding, as net promoter scores
are at a 5-year high. Additionally, Aon's colleague engagement is at the highest levels we've seen over the
past decade, consistent with top quartile employers. This client feedback and colleague engagement are
directly reflected in our firm's sustained momentum and financial performance.

In deep appreciation for all that our colleagues do for our clients and our firm, we were excited to
establish in Q3 the Aon United growth ownership plan. This unique program rewards every colleague with
a stock-based award to share in the current and future success of our firm, and we're thrilled to recognize
and support our colleagues in this way.

Overall, as we reflect on Q3 and the first 9 months of 2021, our momentum, defined by client delivery,
colleague engagement and financial results, is exceptional, even more promising as what we see in the
opportunity ahead. Our conversations with clients reinforce substantial and growing unmet demand to
support them in making better decisions to protect and grow their businesses in an increasingly volatile
world. This opportunity to create new markets to serve our clients is the catalyst for our innovation
agenda and a source of greater momentum in our business.

Focusing on financial performance in Q3, our global team delivered outstanding results across each of
our key financial metrics, including 12% organic revenue growth, notably our strongest growth in over
a decade for 2 quarters in a row, driven by mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth from
every solution line, highlighted by particular strength in Health and Commercial Risk at 16% and 13%,
respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 14%.

Year-to-date, our 9% organic revenue growth reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic growth from 3
of our 4 solution lines. Our Aon United strategy is delivering significant momentum in every solution line,
with net new business generation and ongoing strong retention. We also saw double-digit growth for the
second consecutive quarter in the more discretionary portions of our business such as transaction liability,
human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the full
year 2021, 2022 and over the long term as we continue to win share in our core business and execute to
further expand our total addressable market.

As we move forward, we continue to be guided by our Aon United Blueprint, to ensure we're operating
as a fully integrated global team capable of delivering the best of our firm in every local market. Today,
we'd like to highlight how the core tenets of our blueprint drive momentum and deliver greater future
opportunity. Specifically, how delivering Aon United is enabling core new business generation and fueling
stronger retention; how Aon Business Services is building capability for colleagues and translating into
better service for clients; how our ongoing focus on innovation at scale is accelerating the development
of new solutions to serve unmet demand; and how our commitment to inclusive people leadership has
resulted in the highest level of engagement and retention in over a decade.

First, executing Aon United is delivering net new business generation and ongoing strong retention by
continuing to engage clients across all their needs within the entirety of our firm. This strategy has been
built over many years and enables extraordinary solutions for clients, resulting in Aon winning more,
growing our book of business with new and existing clients and, in turn, delivering exceptional results to
shareholders.

Second, we've invested heavily in Aon Business Services, or ABS, over the past 5 years, which now
represents the core operating platform that spans the entirety of the firm. ABS Centers of Excellence
have and will continue to grow margins by driving efficiencies across all solution lines. Equally important,
ABS capability enables us to improve client service delivery and scale innovation globally much faster,
driving higher organic growth. The ABS model is redefining what we're capable of delivering to clients and
improving the way we work.

Third, we continue to accelerate innovation at scale. AON is delivering innovative solutions to our
clients by helping them navigate new forms of volatility, build resilient workforces, access new forms of
capital and address the underserved through digital solutions, all of which substantially grow our total
addressable market.

This has been demonstrated, for example, in intellectual property-backed financing, a first-of-its-kind
option created and enabled by Aon's IP solutions team. Given the intellectual property represents 80-
plus percent of the value of the S&P 500, we believe the entire IP category has the potential to be a
$100 billion market over time. Other categories that represent new addressable markets in the tens of
billions include cyber, climate, supply chain and digital client solutions, led by our exceptional team at
CoverWallet.

Fundamentally, this opportunity to serve substantial new addressable markets is driven by client demand.
At Aon, we relentlessly focused on the voice of the client, and we're hearing consistent client feedback
about the need to make better decisions around long tail risks. For example, we're currently getting this
guidance from the almost 3,500 clients that are currently participating in our regional Aon Insight series,
and it's also being reinforced by 2 pieces of proprietary research that we recently released.

Every 2 years, Aon conducts our global risk management survey, and the latest report released 3 days ago
was informed by insights from more than 2,300 clients across 16 industries spanning public and private
organizations from 60 countries around the world. With more emphasis and reliance on technology, cyber
risk topped the list as the #1 current and predicted future risk globally, its highest rank since the inception
of the survey. The top 10 risks also reflect the impact COVID has had on organizations, as they needed
to navigate volatility with better and faster decisions. We're seeing organizations shift focus from event-
based to impact-based risk assessments, reflecting the shift in mindset following the systemic impact of
the pandemic.

Aon also recently released results of a survey focused on 800 C-suite leaders and senior executives in
the U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada to understand how organizations are preparing for and responding to the
current environment. We found that, today, senior leaders are more astutely risk aware than ever before
but remain confident to take on calculated risks in investments that build resiliency of their companies.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

As we stated before, the approach to risk strategy has shifted from being generally defensive and risk
averse to more opportunistic, taking a holistic integrated view as they seek solutions to address these
challenges. There's great respect for the need to defend their businesses, but that's accompanied by a
desire to find solutions that help them win as the IP financing example highlights. In this environment,
we're uniquely positioned to deliver data-driven insights to help our clients make better decisions that
grow their businesses.

Fourth and finally, we continue to see tremendous impact of our commitment to inclusive people
leadership. Voluntary attrition is down substantially versus our 2019 baseline and our quarterly pulse of
colleagues shows that we continue to enjoy all-time high engagement levels.

Many examples highlight our talent focus and priority, including our commitment to Aon Apprenticeship
Program and a $30 million investment to create 10,000 new roles in the apprenticeship community; our
investment in talent development, as over 14,000 Aon colleagues around the world have participated in
training programs in the last 9 months alone; and the announcement of the Aon United growth ownership
plan.

In summary, our global Aon team delivered the best third quarter results in over a decade. Our Aon United
Blueprint, powered by our capability in Aon Business Services, combined with significant investment in
new and growing categories of addressable client demand, reinforces the momentum we have today and
offer even greater potential over the next few years. The result is clients that are better informed, better
advised and equipped to make better decisions.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and our long-term
outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued
progress for both the quarter and year-to-date. Through the first 9 months of the year, we translated
strong organic revenue growth into double-digit adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per
share growth, building on our momentum as we head into the last quarter of the year.

As I further reflect on our performance year-to-date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 12%
in the third quarter and 9% year-to-date, our strongest organic revenue growth in over a decade. We
saw strong global macroeconomic conditions in the quarter, but we continue to assess 3 factors as we
have since the beginning of the pandemic. Those factors are the virus and vaccine rollout, including the
potential impacts of new variants; government stimulus; and overall GDP growth. These macroeconomic
conditions do impact our clients in various areas of our business.

Considering the current outlook for these factors, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic
revenue growth for the full year 2021, 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that total reported
revenue was up 13% in Q3 and 12% year-to-date, including the favorable impact from changes in FX
rates driven by a weaker U.S. dollar versus most currencies.

Moving to operating performance. First, I want to speak to the impact of our previously communicated
repatterning expenses as compared to COVID-impacted expense in 2020, which I'll describe before
any 2021 growth. As we've described, the timing of expenses is changing year-over-year such that $65
million of expenses moved into Q3 from Q4. This impact is due to the actions we took and highlighted
in 2020 as we reduced discretionary expenses to be prepared for the impact of COVID-19 and potential
macroeconomic distress.

In Q3, this repatterning negatively impacted margins by approximately 240 basis points, resulting in Q3
operating margin contraction of 30 basis points. Excluding this impact, margins would have expanded by
210 basis points in Q3 and 240 basis points year-to-date. A second key factor impacting adjusted margins
has been the relative speed of revenue growth and investment.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

In Q3, excluding the impact of the repatterning, our strong organic revenue growth significantly outpaced
expense growth similar to Q2. We continue to evaluate investments using our return on invested capital
framework in the areas of talent and business services and innovation to enable long-term growth. We
expect that these areas of investment will continue to ramp up significantly during Q4.

In addition, we anticipate continued resumption of T&E and modest increases in real estate as more
colleagues return to the office. Collectively, the headwind from expense repatterning and tailwind from
slower investment as compared to revenue growth were the main factors driving 30 basis points of margin
contraction in Q3 and 20 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date. Looking forward, as we've said
historically, we expect to deliver full year margin expansion for 2021 and over the long term.

Turning back to the results in the quarter. We translated strong adjusted operating income growth
into adjusted EPS growth of 14% in Q3 and 16% year-to-date. As noted in our earnings materials, FX
translation was a favorable impact of approximately $0.02 per share in Q3 and $0.24 per share year-to-
date. If currency is to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an insignificant impact in Q4.

Excluding the costs associated with the termination of the combination with Willis Towers Watson-related
costs, our performance and outlook for free cash flow in 2021 and going forward remains strong. Free
cash flow decreased 40% year-to-date to $1.1 billion, as strong revenue growth was offset by the $1
billion termination fee payment and other related costs. Of the total $1.363 billion of termination fee and
other related costs, a pretax amount, the $1 billion termination fee was paid in Q3 and approximately 2/3
of the remaining charges will be paid in 2021, with the majority of the balance paid in 2022.

We continue to expect to drive free cash flow over the long term, building on our long-term track record of
14% CAGR over the last 10 years based on operating income growth, working capital improvements and
reduced structural uses of cash enabled by Aon Business Services.

As Greg highlighted, Aon Business Services not only drives efficiencies but also enables revenue
opportunities and innovation at scale. As an example, through our integrated vendor management system
in the U.S. last year, we were able to ensure that 5% of addressable vendor spend was with diverse
suppliers, which is 2x higher than the Fortune 500 average. In addition to being a key initiative for Aon as
part of our overall ESG strategy, this is also a way we can have an even bigger impact on what we deliver
for clients in an Aon United way.

In the third quarter, we had an opportunity to engage with the biopharmaceutical clients looking to
establish a supplier diversity program as part of their broader inclusion and diversity strategy. Given
our demonstrated supply diversity expertise, our global spend management team and human capital
colleagues came together to forge a new innovative solution based on this client's emerging need, which
included establishing government structure and conducting research on peer and industry norms.

Given our outlook for long-term free cash flow growth, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain
our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. In the third quarter, we repurchased
approximately 4.4 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion. We also expect to continue to invest
organically and inorganically in innovative content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. Our
M&A pipeline, centered around the 4 areas that Greg described, is focused on bringing innovative solutions
to our clients' biggest challenges, delivered by the connectivity of Aon United.

I would also note that on October 1, we closed the previously announced sale of our retiree exchange
business to Alight. In 2020, the retiree exchange generated $176 million of revenue, and it is a
predominantly Q4 business.

Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remained confident in the strength of our balance
sheet and managed liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In Q3, we issued $1 billion
of senior notes as we return closer to historical leverage ratios while maintaining our current investment-
grade credit ratings. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $85 million,
reflecting our increased debt levels. Over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of
growing debt as EBITDA grows.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

Further, I'd note that fourth quarter is our seasonally strongest quarter for free cash flow generation, and
we intend to allocate this cash to our highest and best uses based on return on capital, which remains
share repurchase.

In summary, strong top and bottom line performance for both the quarter and year-to-date reflect
continued progress and momentum as we enter the last quarter of the year. We believe our disciplined
approach to return on invested capital, combined with expected long-term free cash flow growth, will
unlock substantial shareholder value creation over the long term.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question now is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question is on the ramp-up that you were talking about expenses in the fourth quarter. Christa, I
think you used the word significantly when talking about that. Just tying to -- if you could expand on the
ramp-up you're expecting from investments, T&E and real estate. And tying into that, should we expect
your full year margin expansion to be at or better than your 10-year average, which I believe is around 90
basis points?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks so much for the question, Elyse. As you mentioned, over the last 10 years, we've delivered
890 basis points of margin expansion for approximately 90 basis points a year for 10 years, and we
will deliver full year margin expansion for the full year 2021. As I mentioned, in Q4, we will continue to
invest meaningfully in talent, in Aon Business Services and in innovation to enable long-term growth.
And we expect the expenses associated with these investments will ramp up during Q4 due to the terrific
opportunity we see ahead. And so as I mentioned, at least, we expect full year margin expansion. We
don't give specific in-year guidances for that, but we have delivered margin expansion for the last 10
years of 90 basis points a year.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And how -- any other color you can give us in terms of the -- like, were you guys investing in the
third quarter that it's significantly -- was there [ some ] going on in the third quarter just in terms of
sizing the ramp-up that maybe we could see sequentially?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So what I did say about Q3 is our strong revenue growth significantly outpaced our expense growth.
And so these investments are really going to increase more in Q4 than Q3.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

And Elyse, I would -- just to reinforce, when you think about margin over time, Christa [ stated ] exactly
right. You think about sort of our historical performance, it's been what it's been, and we fully expect that
continues in the future, our margin improvement, as we said, next year and the following years and over
time.

I would just highlight, though, there has been a continued increase in ability to invest in growth and build
momentum in the business in various specific areas that we believe are really reacting to client need. And
what they're essentially saying is they've really got to [ believe they see ] new solutions on. So I do want
to reflect that level of increased investment.

Maybe, Eric, there are a couple of specific areas you might just want to highlight just so Elyse gets a sense
on sort of the kinds of things we're able to invest in and still maintain margin improvement.

Eric Andersen
President

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

Sure, Greg. Maybe a couple of ways to answer -- make the comment. One is, going back to the question
around T&E. We've been doing these client impact series events over the last couple of quarters, and
they've drawn thousands of clients, right? And we've been able to do it virtually, which allows us to bring
global capability, global speakers, global insight to any region and share best practices around what our
clients are thinking about around the world has been really helpful. And really one of the benefits of using
the technology in a way that we're going to keep using going forward. So the historical model of doing
a road show, putting people in conference rooms around city to city to city, right, our ability to do it in 2
hours and talk to 4,000 clients at the same time is material. So that's just one area. Christa, I just didn't
want to lose that point because it has been such a great impact for us.

And then second, Greg, is we continue to see real growth opportunities in the business really in a couple
of different areas, right? First, on the data and analytic area, continuing to invest in our digital space, our
modeling and analytic capability to help clients see what's coming and understand better. You mentioned
in your opening comments around C-suite people are now risk-aware. And by risk aware, that means
they want more information, right? And so we need to have more analytic capability, more modeling
capabilities. So we're investing there. And then you've got your traditional areas where we're seeing great
growth, right, whether it's M&A services, construction, health benefits, those areas where we really do see
that need underneath the Aon United platform of integrating those teams is really -- it's something. So
there's a lot out there. We could talk for days about it, but just to make those comments off the question.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then one last one. The tax rate was on an adjusted basis, which is under 24% this quarter, so a little
bit higher than where it's been trending, if you can provide any color there. And then any implications that
you can share from the global minimum tax.

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Elyse, thank you so much for the question. We're not going to give guidance on tax rate going
forward. But if we look back historically, exclusive the impact of discretes, which can be positive or
negative any one quarter, our historical underlying rate over the last 4 years was 18%. And what you saw
in Q3 was a tax rate slightly higher with an unfavorable discrete item. And in terms of the global minimum
tax, obviously, we're tracking this very closely and monitoring, et cetera, and the implementation of that
has not been worked out yet. And as we learn more, we look forward to sharing with you, Elyse.

Operator

Our next question is from Charlie Lederer with Wolfe Research.

Charles William Lederer
Wolfe Research, LLC

I'm dialing in for Mike Zaremski this morning. A couple of questions on cash flows. Should we expect the
net loss on a GAAP basis to help reduce cash tax payments over the next 12 months or so? And also,
you noted in the slide deck that -- about the $363 million that will be paid in '21. Have you disclosed how
much of that has been paid to date?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

So maybe I'll take those in reverse order, Charlie. Thanks so much for the question. So we had $1.363
billion of expenses that were adjusted out of Q3, $1 billion in termination fee and $363 million of charges,
which is at the lower end of the range we provided. We provided a $350 million to $400 million range.

We paid the $1 billion termination fee in Q3, and 2/3 of the $363 million in charges will be paid by the end
of 2021 and the remaining 1/3 will be paid in 2022. And then I think your first question was around sort of
the free cash flow. We do expect to generate strong free cash flow this year, and we expect free cash flow
over the long term to be growing double digits.

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

One of the things I'd note, Charlie, is if you start with the $2.6 billion of free cash flow straight off the
GAAP cash flow statement in 2020, that's cash flow from operations less CapEx that equals $2.6 billion,
you can grow that double digits, Charlie, and get yourself to a good starting point for 2022 free cash flow.
And then I think you're also really asking about the tax deductibility of the $1 billion, the $1.363 billion, in
fact. And we have said that's a pretax number. We have not disclosed the details of the tax deductibility of
it.

Charles William Lederer
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then some of your peers talked this quarter about significant rate increases in cyber insurance.
Is this helping your organic growth? And can you talk about what you're seeing there and whether there's
more of a supply/demand imbalance going on now?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Maybe, Charlie, I'll start with that. I'd love to get, Eric, your comments on this. [indiscernible] when we're
asked about rate, we always come back to market impact. That's more important than anything else.
Literally, how clients really endure kind of what's going on in the broader marketplace.

And remember, our role in life is to help them actually model, understand analytics and all the pieces
and sort of create the best set of solutions for them in the face of market impact, and we reflect prices
modestly -- modest impact on us over the course of the quarter and the first 9 months. But generally, you
can pick the one-off pieces, but overall, we're looking at how to help clients manage that. But Eric, on the
day to day, how would you reflect it?

Eric Andersen
President

Yes, Greg, I think I would say it in that -- maybe a little bit of what you said to pick up on it. The clients
make decisions based on their risk appetite, budget capacity, insurance options in the marketplace, et
cetera, and each product essentially has its own dynamics, right? It has its own claim trends, it has its
terms and conditions, retention/deductible, supply/demand, which markets are competing, et cetera.

So we're coming out of probably a 24- to 36-month price increase environment. We're seeing a
deceleration across the globe on the major products. You mentioned cyber, in particular. It's important to
put that in scale in terms of the size and reach of the entirety of the insurance marketplace.

So it gets a lot of attention over the last couple of days I've heard as well. But the reality is, it's one
product in an entire risk management portfolio that clients are managing against. And a lot of the energy
that's going into cyber today is actually going into the consulting aspect of it, the risk management part or
the post-event part as opposed to just the risk transfer, as the market is trying to get its right balance as
to what is -- what's the right trading price, if you will, for risk transfer and what's covered in it and the like
based on all the activity we've seen in ransomware and other things over the last couple of years.

But keep it in context because, overall, the size and scale of what our clients are doing around the world,
they're trying to make trade-offs and choices based on market conditions that have been more favorable
to insurers than clients over the last couple of years. But ultimately, our role in that is to help them using
our expertise, our analytics, our modeling capability to help them make those choices. But I would just
say, I would keep cyber in context relative to the entirety of the marketplace.

Operator

Our next question now is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

So first, I just had a question on employee retention. You've lost a number of high-profile employees
during the Willis process. It doesn't seem like it's impacted your results though. So wondering if you could
just talk about employee retention overall and whether you expect a little bit of a slowdown in results?
Just haven't seen that yet, but you might be expecting that over the next few quarters because of it.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Jimmy, maybe I'll start with the perspective. Listen, as you've heard in my opening, quite the reverse in
terms of what we look at and what we see every day. Obviously, I mentioned in my opening comments,
our voluntary attrition is sort of -- we pegged it against 2019, and we're way ahead of that baseline. So
actually, we've gotten stronger over time, very, very positive.

And then most important, our engagement. And we do a full survey very frequently quarterly and
sometimes even monthly around where we are, and we literally have the highest engagement we've
had in the last decade. And you have to understand, we're looking at, as we think about our colleagues,
better ways to help them serve clients, which means it's much more focused on their expertise and their
development, their insights.

And as clients achieve their goals and what they're trying to do, our colleagues go alongside them and that
creates a very unique environment, and that's what Aon is. And as a result, we're much more, as I said,
focused on talent development. Some of the things I talked about in my comments reference that.

And so we just -- we feel tremendous momentum with our colleagues around the world. And that's borne
out in our performance, both our top line performance and our bottom line performance and, as I said
before, in our NPS scores, Net Promoter Scores.

So from our standpoint, we are in a very privileged position. We feel terrific about where we are, what our
colleagues are able to deliver around the world. And as both Eric and Chris and I have all highlighted, I
feel even more optimistic about what the potential holds in terms of where we are.

But listen, talent is literally what we do every day, what we're focused on every day. I want to get Eric's
and Christa's input on this as well. Eric?

Eric Andersen
President

Yes. Thanks, Greg. Look, I would just say, from a -- from your direct question of are we losing senior
people, the answer is you can't track it based on the snippets of the insurance industry rags that print. We
feel it's great -- we feel great about our team and feel like where we are investing for the future is critical
to how we are positioning our assets.

We also have something as you think about our Aon Business Services platform. It's an opportunity
for us to provide professional service, consistent standards around the world and actually leverage our
innovation in a way that I don't think anyone else in our industry can do.

And so as we focus our investment on talent, we're focusing on where we can grow, where we see growth
opportunities. We're also focusing it to make sure we've got the depth of service teams as we do and
have been building our bench over many years to make sure we can do that. So feel really great about
where we are. But having that ABS platform is a game changer for us because it actually allows us to
scale our innovation, provide the level of service that our clients need and really target our growth -- our
investments in growth and talent in the areas where we can make an outsized client impact.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then on the timing of expenses, you did mention and you, I think, mentioned before as well the
expense -- the shift in expenses towards 2Q and 3Q this year. As we think about expenses and margins in
2022, should that be consistent with 2021? Or would it be more consistent with pre-pandemic levels?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Great question. So 2021 is the right patterning of expenses for each go-forward year, Jimmy. So you
should use 2021 as your right patterning.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just lastly, I think you've obviously benefited from lower T&E spending in the near term
and I think, at some point, that comes back. But as you think about your expenses longer term, are there
sort of long-term benefits from the pandemic, whether it's lower real estate footprint or less travel going
forward at least through the next few years? How do you think about sort of how the pandemic affects
your margin trajectory and expenses?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks so much for asking the question, Jimmy. It's a great question. We're really focused on learning
the best lessons in how we've been serving clients well over the last 18 months, bringing global expertise
and teams to serve their most important issues via video globally, as Eric described, with our client insight
series, over 4,000 clients virtually. And it's creating more opportunities for colleagues to be included
globally, and we're utilizing this to bring the best talent and best expertise to clients.

And so for us, this is really about the future of work and how we position Aon in a new better scenario. So
serving clients with the best talent and expertise, providing employees with flexibility and ensuring that
they're productive and having a diverse and an inclusive workforce. But Eric, you're at the front and center
of business clients every day, what would you add here?

Eric Andersen
President

Yes, Christa, not much other than to say, it has really provided an opportunity for us to unlock our
global talent in a way that we can bring it to a client that historically was just more challenging because
of logistics. When a client is -- if it's a U.S.-based client and they want to talk about something that's
happening in France, you just pop up the French team, and they can go direct to it and have that
conversation.

Though, historically, that would have come from the team in France to the account exec in the U.S. and
would have been talked about in the third person as opposed to just unlocking the global team, and it
does a couple of things for us, one, it shows the power of the global company to a client; it also makes
connections among our teams in a way where they're learning firsthand as well and so can repeat that
learning. So you're absolutely right on everything you said, Christa, before, but it is -- there's an ability for
us to really see and use the global connectivity in a way that historically had just been harder to do and do
it on a more frequent basis.

And we have found over the last 18 months that the clients have really valued that access, being able
to get right to the point of the expertise and be able to bring it and deliver it in a really easy way for the
client to digest it and really build those relationships as well.

So we definitely are going to take those forward. That has been a real value part for us and something
that we're going to bake into the model going forward.

Our next question now is from Meyer Shields with KBW.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

First a [ few questions ], if I can. What are you telling your clients about the persistence of current
inflation in the U.S.?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

So overall, Meyer, in terms of -- I just want to make sure -- so just what we're counting our clients about
it? Or was that the question?

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Yes, pretty much just because I think that your insights are going to be tremendously valuable. I'm just
wondering what the actual view point is.

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Go ahead, Christa.

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, Meyer, this is such a great question because wage inflation is certainly real, and our human
capital business is hearing directly from clients about it and seeing in our compensation surveys and data
where compensation increases. And compensation is averaging increases in the 12% to -- 2% to 12%
range, depending on the role.

And as a result, our teams are spending a lot of time with clients to form strategies to deal with it.
Areas like total rewards and resource allocation, organizational benchmarking and readiness and the
development of long-term talent strategies are really topical right now. Not surprisingly, we're seeing a
lot of demand in our human capital business, and it's reflected in the double-digit growth of that business
we've seen over the course of this year.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. Does it go beyond compensation-related inflation?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

That's the main area. We're seeing it in the labor area. Are there other areas you're thinking about,
Meyer?

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

The general people are calling it financial inflation, sort of the all item PPI?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean we're certainly -- I mean one of the things we would say more broadly, Meyer, is inflation is
a positive thing for Aon's business overall. If you think about it, you are insuring assets and whether the
assets are corporate revenues or employment levels or commercial property assets, inflation is generally a
tailwind for our business.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

Okay. Perfect. And then if I can follow up. With regard to the stock ownership plan for colleagues, are we
going to see any associated stock issuance associated with that? Does that offset the share repurchases?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Well, again, just to start with the overall plan. I think, Christa, you can talk to the mechanics of those. I
do want to just highlight that this is about -- this is -- this has been amazing. It's just been a wonderful
opportunity for all of our colleagues around the world to participate and take part in the success of the
firm. But Meyer, it actually goes well beyond that.

When you talk about financial wellness and understanding, every colleague at Aon has a fidelity
statement. Now every colleague at Aon actually has a piece of the firm, can watch and see what happens,
engage in a discussion around how this works, the mechanics of it, all the nuances of it. It's really -- it's
been fantastic.

And in essence, in many respects, they're getting a chance to see the firm in a way they haven't seen it
before. So beyond kind of the aspect of the -- sort of the wealth creation aspect of it, really, the financial
wellness aspect of it has been absolutely fantastic. And then obviously, in the context of what we're doing,
we looked at this investment in our colleagues. We look at all investments from a return standpoint, and
we thought this was a phenomenal one. And by the way, our high expectations have been exceeded. The
reaction is [ suspense spectacular ].

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

And then Meyer, maybe just from a share point of view, we obviously are issuing options as part of this.
But as we think about utilizing our cash, you know we run the firm based on return on capital, cash-on-
cash returns, and our highest return on capital opportunity across Aon remains share repurchase because
we value the firm on a discounted cash flow basis if values are substantially above where we're trading
today. And therefore, the return on capital share repurchase continues to be the highest investment
opportunity across Aon. And so we're investing in share repurchase because of the return, not to offset
any dilution.

Operator

Our next question now is from Weston Bloomer from UBS.

Weston Clay Bloomer
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

My first question is on the investment in talent and what that could potentially mean for organic growth,
more specifically just in the second half of the year because it looks like you'll probably come off a difficult
comp in second half 2022. So more curious, as you bring on new talent historically, what have you seen in
terms of a ramp-up, in terms of getting the full efficiency or your broader expectations there?

Gregory Clarence Case
CEO & Executive Director

Weston, maybe I'll start just broad view, and again, all 3 of us can comment on this. I would step back.
Essentially, we talked about mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth across all of our solution
lines. And that's where we are, and that's where we have achieved and continue to achieve, and that's
what we're anticipating for next year, the year after and the coming year.

So look for that. That's the benchmark in terms of where we are. We really don't look at it in the same
way. Maybe I'll just describe this idea of quarter-to-quarter and, of course, get a return. We really look
at overall how we support our colleagues, the talent strategy of our firm, how we both bring them in and
develop with them, but also how we develop our current set of colleagues who come in and are part of
Aon over time.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

And that's sort of new hires, but it's also, I think, about our apprenticeship program. Our apprentice
program has been an amazing investment and opportunity over the last number of years. We started this
in 2017 as an example. In Chicago, we now have 15 employers engaged in the apprenticeship network
with 1,000 apprentices in Chicago. We made this investment across North America. We've copied what's
been done across Europe. We've been recognized, even Fortune recognized sort of what we've done in
terms of sort of the impact this is going to have.

And all I'm trying to highlight, Weston, on the topic of talent, it's central to Aon. And we develop it in a
very specific way. I talked about 14,000 Aon colleagues in the last 9 months alone really going through
training programs that help our colleagues continue to evolve as professionals help serve clients in an
environment which becomes more complex. That is the way we approach the market in all angles and all
aspects. With full expectation, we're going to achieve results, mid-single digit or greater.

So it's not kind of up, down or different. It's just that's what it's going to be, mid-single digit or greater.
And then we see opportunity to continue to expand with these new addressable markets we talked about.
So that's philosophically how we think about it. It isn't kind of the ramp up, ramp down, ramp up, ramp
down that others often talk about. Ours is really mid-single digit or greater over time.

But Eric, thoughts on, from your standpoint, as you think about this from the talent?

Eric Andersen
President

Yes. Maybe a different angle on it, too, is that when you think about our Aon United model and how we
actually interact with clients, essentially having a client leader who can bring all of the capability of the
firm to a client, whether it's on the risk side, whether it's on the wealth side or the health side, et cetera,
that model is a team-based model, right?

So it's less about hiring a person and then getting an immediate return. It's really around investing in the
capability so that as we interact with clients, we can bring to them either existing solutions that we have
today or as the teams work together and create new solutions together, where you're matching human
capital and risk or reinsurance and health to try and create new ways to unlock value. That's less about I
need 5 new people to get 5 new things. It's more around how do you invest consistently over time so that
you have the expertise and you have the team-based culture that allows you to deliver that capability to a
client in a way that nobody else can. That's what we're after, and that's what we've been building on over
the last couple of years.

So as Greg said, it's less about headcount up, head count down. It's around do you have the right culture,
do you have the right expertise and the right planning process so that we're able to interact with a client
in a way where we can deliver something no one else can. That's the play.

Christa, anything you'd add?

Christa Davies
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Look, just to build on Eric's point about investments. We've invested in Aon Business Services and
specialized teams, and we've engineered a firm that's capable of sustained long-term organic growth and
margin expansion at any point in the cycle, as we've demonstrated over the last decade.

Weston Clay Bloomer
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. That makes sense. And just as a follow-up, and I might have missed this. Did you provide a
CoverWallet growth in the quarter? I think you provided double-digit last question. Curious how that's
trending.

AON PLC FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

We didn't provide a specific growth call-out. I just want to highlight sort of this team has done
exceptionally. And it really is the perfect example of what Eric and Christa just talked about. It is looking
at opportunities in digital and what we can do to help serve clients more effectively. CoverWallet is just an
amazing firm, and we brought them into the Aon family, and together, they've made our global firm better.
And hopefully, as we've invested in that capability, they become stronger over time. And so we're seeing
substantial impact, not just in what has been defined as the core business they came in with, but really
how they've helped us grow businesses around the world, and we see this as really the tip of the iceberg
and what the opportunity could be driven by the team and our broader team around the world.

Operator

Thank you very much. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.
