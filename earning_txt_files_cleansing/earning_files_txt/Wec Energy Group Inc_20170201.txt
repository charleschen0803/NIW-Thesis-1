Good afternoon, everyone
Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year
I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, who is our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and finally Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations
Now, as you saw this morning, we reported full 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, ahead of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs of $0.01 per share
Scott will provide a more detailed review in a moment
Now, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 5% to 7% off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share
Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, and this is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations
In addition to our full-year results, we have two other positive developments to share with you today
On January 20, we signed an agreement to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding, which owns an underground natural gas storage facility in Michigan
This facility can provide approximately one-third of the storage needs of our natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin
The total acquisition price is $230 million
Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our three natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin
The earnings from this investment are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies
We plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission in the coming days for a declaratory ruling
In this request, we will ask the Commission to confirm that is reasonable for our Wisconsin gas utilities to enter into these transactions
The service agreements were expected to provide for a utility return on capital
I believe this investment will bring very meaningful customer benefits
We chose the service agreement structure for two reasons
First, we don't want to put the Wisconsin Commission in the position of being asked to approve an out-of-state acquisition by our Wisconsin distribution companies
Second, this avoids directly involving our state regulated companies in an interstate natural gas business
The second positive development relates to our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan
On Monday, we filed for required construction-related authorizations related to our generation plan there
This filing was made on behalf of the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation or UMERC for short
UMERC began operation on January 1 of this year, following its approval by the Michigan Commission
We are proposing a $275 million investment in about 180 megawatts of natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engines
This will provide a reliable cost-effective long-term generation solution for our customers in the Upper Peninsula including the mine owned by Cliffs Resources
We are targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant
This should give significant savings in operations and maintenance expenses as well as reduce carbon emissions
Turning now to the regulatory front
Last year, we only had one rate case
Now, this case was actually filed in 2015 but was decided in 2016. We received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission in October for our natural gas LDC authorizing a 9.11% return on equity
The revenue increase was approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million in line with our expectation
I also expect we will have another quite year on the rate case front
We do not plan to file a case in Illinois this year, and we'll know more about Wisconsin in the coming months
Our strong preference would be to keep rates flat while managing our costs and returning additional benefits to our customers through the earnings sharing mechanisms that we'll put in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas by the Wisconsin Commission after the Integrys acquisition
These mechanisms delivered $24 million of benefits to customers in 2016. Turning to our ATC investment
On September 28, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint
ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member, thus increasing their return on equity to 10.82%, and we are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level
Although the recent commissioner resignation at FERC injects some additional uncertainty, we still expect an order by the end of June in the second MISO complaint case
In that case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%
Again ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which would bring their return on equity to 10.2%
When the final order is received, we anticipating transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity
We factor this return into our long-term financial plan
Now, a reminder on our dividend
On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level
This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level
Our annual dividend rate stands at $2.08 per share
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings
Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth
I would now like to provide you with an update on our five-year capital forecast
Our five-year plan now reflects $9.7 billion versus the last five-year plan, which was $9.2 billion
I would note that the $9.7 billion plan includes the natural gas storage as well as the UP generation investment that I just discussed
These figures do not include our share of projected capital investments at ATC, which is $1.4 billion for investments inside the traditional ATC footprint and approximately $300 million in projected capital outside the footprint
We do have some news regarding ATC
On January 30, ATC announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with the Arizona Electric Power Cooperative
The partnership known as ATC Southwest will develop needed transmission projects in Arizona and the Southwest United States
Finally, I'd like to take some time to address potential implications of tax reform
Both the Trump administration and the House Republicans have floated some tax reform ideas that could impact our business
Although the details have yet to be finalized, the current proposals have three common elements, reducing the corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and eliminating interest expense of the deduction
These elements would have different impacts on customers and shareholders, depending on whether we look at the utilities, We Power or the holding company
I would like to address these in conceptual terms first, and then summarize the potential impacts for shareholders
In addition, we have included a chart in the earnings packet that lays out the potential impacts to customers and shareholders for each segment
First let's look at the regulated utilities because of the traditional rate-making approach, reducing the corporate tax rate directly benefits customers by lowering the provision for income taxes and rates
The lower tax rate also creates an excess deferred tax position that would benefit customers over time
From a shareholder perspective, this change would be neutral to slightly positive as the regulatory liability related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities is amortized
The second element, 100% expensing of capital, would reduce rate base in the short term
However, a lower tax rate would help to offset this impact
The third element, elimination of the interest tax deduction, would increase the cost of capital for customers
I view this as a large negative for customers
However, this would be neutral for shareholders
So, We Power, the facility leases between We Power and We Energies would flow the benefit of the tax rate change through to customers
Any one-time excess deferred tax balance created would remain at We Power and benefit shareholders
100% expensing of capital would have little impact because of We Power's low projected capital spending levels going forward
The elimination of the interest expense deduction would be detrimental to We Power, if the change affects interest on existing debt
It is unknown if this change would affect only interest on new debt or all interest expenses
In addition, the House plan mentions taking into consideration an offset to interest income and the possibility of exempting banks or leasing entities
From the shareholders' perspective, there are three key issues, the deductibility of interest, the impact on utility rate base, and deferred taxes at We Power
Deductibility of interest has the largest potential impact
If existing interest is not deductible, the estimated impact would be $0.14 per share at the holding company and $0.05 per share at We Power
However, if interest on existing debt is allowed to be deducted at a lower effective tax rate of 20%, the net effect would only be approximately $0.05 per share in total
Of less significance is the rate base effect at the utility level
The cumulative effect of all these changes, 20% effective tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and non-deductibility of interest would reduce rate base by approximately $300 million over a five-year period
On a positive note, with an assumed change in the deferred tax rate to 20%, we would expect the We Power deferred taxes to have a one-time reduction of approximately $270 million, which would reduce future tax payments
Finally, both plans would reduce dividend and capital gains tax rates to the benefit of our shareholders
Although, this would not have an impact on the earnings of the company, it could potentially impact sector valuation
As I mentioned earlier, much of the details on this still need to be worked out by Congress and the new administration
Obviously, we will be paying very close attention to tax reform as it takes shape
But we wanted to share our current understanding of the implications of the plans that are now being discussed
So now with details on our 2016 results and our financial outlook, here is Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Scott
Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our conference call
Question-and-Answer Session
Good question, Greg
And I think maybe I'll just answer the question
It's kind of at a summary high level
The plan that we put together for 2017 would call for us to reduce O&M
So if you look at the 2016 run rate, the run rate in 2017 would be 3% below the level that it was at in 2016. Now, in addition to that Greg, as we have always done in previous years, weather is obviously uncertain, could be better or worse than normal, so we certainly have levers if you will above and below that 3% level, so that we can adjust our operations as we see weather that's either favorable or unfavorable
But the base plan would call for a 3% reduction in the level of O&M
So, I think you're referring to the Wisconsin Commission, and we
began engaging with their staff right after the holiday
So the first week of January, we started having discussions with them
In terms of a likely timetable, Greg, my view at this point would be, from traditionally if you're going to file a case, you're filing kind of the mid-to-late April, early May sort of timeframe
So, I think we certainly need to come to a resolution before, say, that mid-April timeframe
And I think we're on track to either be able to file a case although we don't think that's the best path or to let the mechanism that the Commission put in place continue to operate for at least another year
And so, let me bridge back to the capital plan that I'd discussed kind of in the prepared remarks
So, if you take the $9.7 billion, what I would just call the more of the retail business, add the $1.4 billion for ATC inside the footprint and then, put on top of that the $300 million outside the footprint
Greg, I see that getting us kind of more of the low end of that 5% to 7% range
And then, what you'd need to do in order to kind of move up in that range, I'd say most likely would be to make some significant investment outside the footprint, the traditional footprint at ATC
But the capital plan that I described in the prepared remarks, very supportive of something kind of near that low end of the range
Thanks, Greg
Hi, Julien
Yeah
I would say, well, short answer is yes, you should be paying attention, Julien, because I think that Arizona, there are certainly a lot of needs for transmission in Arizona
So, I would say though in terms of most likely places that ATC could do things outside the footprint, Arizona is one of them and then going into the California market, because they're going to be looking
They still have very aggressive renewable goals, and they're going to be looking to import effectively renewable power in the California
So, I think the largest potential opportunities outside footprint are in the West and more likely the North Arizona and California
Right
I think your description was very good, Julien, but maybe just let me review it for everybody on the call
So, what we would do, Bluewater Holding would be a first here subsidiary of WEC Energy Group
We would capitalize at approximately 50% equity, 50% debt
The equity would come from the parent, and then we would issue debt sort of on balance sheet, if you will, non-recourse debt down at that subsidiary
Equity return in the low 10%s is what you typically see right now for the Wisconsin utilities
So that's how we would structure it
And then you would have a collection of three service agreements back from Bluewater Holding, an agreement to each of the three Wisconsin LDCs
Okay
So, let me start with kind of the nature of the service agreements
So, when we'll lay this out in our declaratory ruling request, I mean literally in a matter of days, so we'll include in there the service agreements as we would propose them
In terms of tenure, Julien, we would actually propose 60-year agreements, so very long tenure agreements
And effectively what the agreement would provide for is a return on and of capital that's been invested, including the initial investment, and then as you have O&M, which we expect you would have O&M of course and I think it'd be modest capital but if you had some additional capital that would be required at the field that would also be recovered kind of through that return of and on mechanism
So, we'll lay all that out in the declaratory ruling and there will be attachments to that
The service agreements will be attached to that ruling request
Getting kind of to the second question that you ask, additional opportunities, I believe in terms of working gas, this field has like 23.2 bcf in terms of working gas, that's about a third of our requirements
I do believe, you could do some additional expansion at the field and you could add some more working gas at the field
If you did that, that would be also covered by that service agreement, sort of structure that I mentioned
I think other than that for the Wisconsin utilities, there really aren't any other gas infrastructure things that we're looking at
So, hopefully
Yeah, it only covers the third of the needs, so there certainly would be room to do a bit more own storage in the future because it's only a third
That's right
Yeah
Right
Well, I think maybe I'll talk about in terms of the shareholder impacts
When we talked about rate base, it was a cumulative impact of $300 million on rate base and again that's cumulative over a five-year period
So, I would certainly view that on a company of this size, there certainly would be other opportunities that we could pull forward or identify that would help offset that $300 million
So, I think from a rate base standpoint, I'd certainly think that's manageable
Not much to say about the deferred tax impact at We Power, that would be a shareholder benefit, and that kind of leaves interest deductibility
And I think I would just stress to you Jonathan and everybody on the call, all this that we put into the earnings deck, it's bit of a speculative enterprise, I mean we're just trying to give people a sense for the impacts
On the interest deductibility front, if you take one extreme where it's still deductible but at a 20% level, well, that's $0.05 a share on a base of say circa $3, so that'd be fairly small and I would expect that that's probably manageable
As you start getting the things more like $0.15, that'd be tougher for us to manage
But as I look at it, I mean it's not a foregone conclusion, but that's where they're headed in terms of how this would be structured
Thank you
Hi, Dan
I've not thought about that a great deal at this point, Dan
But I think look if you basically or Congress makes changes in the tax that effectively changes the after-tax cost of the different components, you'd most certainly have to rethink what's the best capital structure for the utilities
But quite candidly, I haven't gotten to that level yet in my thinking
Scott, do you want to take the answer to that?
Thanks, Dan
(48:04)
Thanks, Andy
Right
Well, I think in terms of being able to continue to maintain O&M reductions, I do believe we'll have additional capacity to reduce O&M, Michael
But I would say, as you look out say to 2018, 2019, 2020, which I think is kind of more where you're going, the larger reductions in O&M are most likely going to be centered around our generation portfolio as we restructure that generation portfolio
And let me just give you one example in particular, bridge back to the conversation or the prepared remarks when I was talking about the new gas-fired generation in the UP
Well, once we have that new generation online, and we're able to retire the Presque Isle Power Plant, the run rate of O&M at Presque Isle, it's about $40 million a year, which very, very significant both for Wisconsin Electric as well as the consolidated entity
So, I do believe, there'll be additional opportunities, but the really big opportunities in terms of O&M reduction are going to come more from the generation side
There will be more modest, not unimportant but more modest opportunities and say, we implement our new ERP system, so now we're going through efforts where we're trying to get all of our utilities on common systems
So, as we implement our new ERP system in this year and in 2018, I would see more savings opportunities there, but that's a little more modest
Yeah
So right now, the largest single, say, third-party provider of storage is ANR
So, ANR is the largest single provider
I believe that they provide about 40% of the storage or thereabouts for the operating companies, so that's the biggest one Michael
As the service agreements would be put in place, if you look at it from a present value standpoint, okay, so cover all the return of capital, cover all those costs, we would see roughly a $213 million net present value savings to customers
And in terms of the year where you would see an absolute reduction due to this, I think that's in year four, so pretty quickly gets to annual reduction in rates, and any increase in the early years, it's less than 1%, but present value, that's $200 million-plus – $213 million net present value, so very significant savings that we would see
Does that help Michael?
Yeah
And Scott, why don't you address Michael's question about the first quarter?
Yeah
And then I think Michael, in terms of longer-term growth, I addressed that in the script and also talked a little bit about it in the response to Greg Gordon's question, was there any other aspect specifically about that that you want me to cover?
Well, in terms of – and let me talk about that in terms of capital allocation, if you will
So if you look at the five-year capital budget, just that half, in fact, maybe a little over half of the capital that we would expect to commit over the next five years is in the natural gas distribution business
So, given that the natural gas distribution as measured by rate base is about a quarter of the company, right now
In terms of percentage growth, we're going to see much greater or expect to see much greater percentage growth in earnings in the natural gas business than we would in electric
But in terms of absolute capital employed, it's almost even, electric versus gas
But in terms of percentage growth, most of it's going to come from gas we would expect
Thanks, Michael
