EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q2 2021 Extra Space Storage Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator
Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, Jeff
Norman. Please go ahead.

Jeffrey Norman
Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications

Thank you, Latif. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. In addition to
our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please
remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-
looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ
materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties
associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary
statements contained in the company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to
review.

Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, July 28, 2021. The company
assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market
conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Before I turn to the results, I want to take a
moment and congratulate the entire Extra Space team. One of our goals for this year was to get to 2021
stores in the year 2021. And we've achieved that, which is a great thing.

When I first started with Extra Space, we had 12 stores and it's incredible to see the exceptional growth of
this company, the value we've created for our shareholders. So I want to thank all the folks at Extra Space
who contributed to our achieving that goal.

I'm also happy to announce that we recently published our 2020 sustainability report with disclosures
and information related to the company's environmental, social and governance initiatives. I invite our
listeners to review the report on the Sustainability page of our Investor Relations website.

Heading into this quarter -- I'm sorry, heading into the second quarter, our management team had high
expectations due to our record high occupancy levels, significant pricing power and a relatively easy 2020
comparable, and actual performance far exceeded these elevated expectations. Same-store occupancy
set another new high watermark at the end of June at 97%, which is incredible, as you consider the
diversification of our national portfolio. The elevated occupancy led to exceptional pricing power with
achieved rates to new customers in the quarter over 60% higher than 2020 levels. While this is inflated by
an artificially low prior year comp, achieve rates were over 30% greater than 2019 levels and accelerated
through the quarter.

In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers
closer to current street rates as more of the state of emergency rate restrictions are lifted throughout
the country. Other income is no longer a drag on revenue due to late fees improving year-over-year
and actually contributed 20 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. And finally, higher discounts,
primarily due to higher rates were offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

growth of 13.6%, a 900 basis point acceleration from Q1, and same-store NOI growth of 20.2%, an
acceleration of over 1,300 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady
returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 33.3%.

Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be, in our view, expensive. Given the
pricing we are seeing in the market, we have listed an additional 17 stores for outright disposition, which
we expect to close during the back half of 2021. We continue to be actively engaged in acquisitions,
but we remain disciplined. Year-to-date, we have been able to close or put under contract acquisitions
totaling $400 million of Extra Space investment. These are primarily lease-up properties and several of the
properties came from our Bridge Loan Program. We have increased our 2021 acquisition guidance to $500
million in Extra Space investments.

Looking forward, many of our acquisitions will be completed in joint ventures, and we have plenty of
capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders.

We were active on the third-party management front, adding 39 stores in the quarter and a total of 100
stores through the first 6 months. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their
properties. In the quarter, we purchased 11 of these stores in the REIT or in one of our joint ventures. Our
first half outperformance coupled with steady external growth and the improved outlook for the second
half of 2021 allowed us to increase our annual FFO guidance by $0.50 or 8.3% at the midpoint. While we
still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation of approximately 300 basis points from this summer's peak
to the winter trough, the moderation will begin from a higher starting point than we previously expected.
As a result, we assume minimal impact on revenue growth from the negative occupancy delta in the back
half of the year. Our guidance assumes moderating but still strong rate growth for the duration of 2021,
which should result in another great year for Extra Space Storage.

I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-
store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing
customers. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.64 per share, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%. Property
performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution coming from growth in tenant
insurance income and management fees. Despite property tax increases of 6%, we delivered a reduction
in same-store expenses in the quarter. These increases were offset primarily by 13% savings in payroll
and 31% savings in marketing. Our guidance assumes payroll savings will continue throughout the year,
however, at lower levels due to wage pressure across the U.S. Marketing spend will depend on our use of
this lever to drive top line revenue, but it should also remain down for the year.

In May, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering, issuing $450 million in 10-year
bonds at 2.55%. Access to the investment-grade bond market provides another deep capital source at
low rates and will allow us to further extend our average maturities. Our year-to-date dispositions, equity
issuances and NOI have resulted in a reduction in our leverage. Our quarter end net debt-to-EBITDA was
4.8x, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities since we generally target a range of 5.5
to 6x on this metric.

Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue
range to 10% to 11%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 0% to 1%, resulting in same-store
NOI growth of 13.5% to 15.5%, a 750 basis point increase at the midpoint. These improvements in
our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected achieved rates, higher occupancy and
lower payroll and marketing expense. We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.45 to $6.60 per
share, a $0.50 or 8.3% increase at the midpoint. Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our
anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.14 to $0.12. We're excited by
our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our customer acquisition, revenue management,
operational and growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio.
With that, let's turn it over to Latif to start our Q&A.

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America.

Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congratulations on the quarter. Joe, my first question is on the point you discussed on seasonal occupancy
and the moderation. You're still building into guidance 300 basis points. Are there any signposts right now
pointing to that? Or to be fair, would you say that there's still some conservatism here?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question and for your kind words. So far, we don't see any signs of it. And
we are actually over 97% occupied in July. So we're still waiting for that moderation to begin, but we do
believe that slowly over time, customer behavior will revert to normal.

Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. I guess let's flip the question then on the other side in customer acquisition. I mean where are the
surprises coming from because we've been talking about the moderation. And of course, this past year has
been much stronger than expected. I guess let's talk about customer acquisitions. Is it particular regions?
Where are they coming from? Any changes? What are the nice surprises you've seen just even in, let's
say, the last quarter or last month?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

Yes. It's really on the vacate side, I would say. Our Q2 vacates were 10% below 2019 vacates, right? They
used -- 2020 as a comp doesn't really help. So we still see people staying in the units and gives us fewer
units to rent up and more pricing power, and it's all good.

Operator

Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital.

Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just hoping we could touch on rate growth. How are you guys thinking about that growth going forward?
The year-over-year comps have been clearly impacted by COVID discounting, but your in-place rents are
at record levels, near $18 a square foot. If we look back to 2015, '16, you had kind of 2 years of rate
growth of about 6.5%. Do you think we could see something similar in terms of the quantum and duration
of the year-over-year growth in in-place rates?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Juan, I can maybe walk you through some of our assumptions, and I'm not sure I can tell you exactly
what's going to happen. I think that's the big question here. We've seen very good rate growth. If you
look at our rates year-over-year, we mentioned that we're 60% ahead of where we were last year. Last
year was an odd comp. If you look at it compared to 2019, you're 30% ahead. So we continue to push our
street rates. And the expectation is that we will continue to push them through the year. We do come up
against a more difficult comp at the end of this year as we started pushing rates at the end of last year.

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

So that is one thing that we're looking at as we move into the fall. A couple of other maybe data points,
discounts are up slightly in the quarter, mainly due to rates being higher. Our discounting strategy hasn't
changed significantly. We'll continue to use them as a tool, but we'll continue to monitor those also. Our
existing customer rate increases are running above where they've historically been, and part of that is
an odd comp again from last year, where last year you had many state of emergencies where we paused
rate increases. And so from a year-over-year perspective, those existing customer rate increases are
contributing more than they were last year.

Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And if you guys just look at the net street rates for new customers, have you seen any sequential
deceleration in the pace of that growth through July?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

No significant change in July from what we've seen in June.

Operator

Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

In terms of the revised guidance, and Joe, I appreciate the comments around revenue growth in the back
half of the year. But I'm just curious, and maybe Scott can chime in here, but what are you anticipating
for same-store revenue and same-store NOI growth as you exit the year? If you can maybe provide some
detail around the trajectory throughout the balance of the year based on what's implied by the revised
guidance, that would be helpful.

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's -- without providing exact kind of monthly sequential here, I'll just give you a few data points. We
are seeing rate contributing more in terms of the overall percentage as the occupancy delta wears off. By
the end of the year, occupancy won't be benefiting us, and it's all coming from rate. But we do not expect
it to accelerate significantly through the rest of the year, but also contribute through the remainder of the
year as we come up against these tougher comps.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And what's the spread right now between rates for customers moving out and the achieved rates on
customers moving in?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, the disclosure we've given maybe a little bit different than that. What we've typically disclosed is
our in-place rents compared to our new move-ins. And that right now is high teens, which I would tell
you right now is exceptional. And typically in the summer months, it's flat to slightly positive, meaning
customers moving in pay slightly more than our in-place rents. And this year, it's high teens, which is as
good as we've seen.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And just last question for Joe. Your comments on investments. I think you mentioned -- you
characterized the market as expensive and said that you would look to do more investments through joint

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

ventures. And the joint venture platform used to be a bit bigger, and you've been acquiring assets from
within the JV platform. With all the capital looking to invest in storage, would you look to do something of
size and maybe generate premium returns and backfill the pipeline a bit at the same time?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So we are kind of governor and what we're willing to do isn't how big or small it is, it's what we view the
risk-adjusted returns to be. So we'll do as big a deal, and we have capital to do as big a deal as necessary
or is available, provided the risk-adjusted returns are good or we'll buy one-off stores. And historically,
we've done both. And we're not focused on what's too big or what's too small. We're just fully focused on
what we believe the risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders are.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Should we expect investments going forward to be primarily weighted towards joint ventures versus
on-balance sheet investments?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

I think that's a fair assumption given where pricing is today. We can significantly improve the price -- the
returns to our shareholders by investing in the joint venture structure, which makes deals that we would
look at as dilutive on a wholly owned basis being accretive to us in a joint venture structure.

Operator

Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi.

Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

I was just wondering you mentioned existing customers are coming closer to kind of overall market levels,
assuming so what sort of percent, I guess, of the portfolio maybe -- will still be subject to more rent
increases, I guess, maybe as restrictions come off? Or is that pretty much behind you now?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

So we only have a few markets that have restrictions in place. So they're very limited to a few specific
California markets that have restrictions that go back to buyers from several years ago. You have a few
others across the U.S. that are between 10% and 20%. So the majority of the portfolio is open to rate
increases. There are a few that still have some limit.

Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. And then [indiscernible], could you talk just a little bit more about what you're seeing on the labor
side? You mentioned some of the savings -- sort of updated what you're seeing there. But I mean are you
having to pay people more? Are you having trouble staffing? Or how are you -- just a little more color
around how that's working out.

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

Yes, it's a significant issue that we're working with. We have fewer applicants for open spots. It takes
longer to fill and it's more expensive. So we're working real hard to try to be appropriately staffed with
quality people. We do see that as supplemental unemployment insurance burns off in certain states,
the problem gets better. So -- I'm sorry, the problem ameliorates. So we're hoping that, that pattern

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

continues, but we absolutely are aware that there's wage pressure, we're feeling it, and it's going to be an
issue we're going to have to deal with.

Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. Okay. And then just last question, I was just interested to see that you did not re-up your ATM in
the second quarter, and you mentioned that you would do it in the third quarter. Was there a reason for
not doing it during the second quarter?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, we were focused on getting our inaugural bond offering done. We then turned to recasting our credit
facility. Both projects were done during the quarter. We feel like we had a great quarter of getting those
done, and then we'll refile the ATM as we finish the quarter and file the Q.

Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.

Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

How are you thinking about managing the interplay between occupancy and rate? I understand the goal is
to maximize revenue. But like how are your models thinking about pushing rate maybe at the expense of
occupancy in this environment?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

Yes. So it's a great question, and you're right to focus on the different levers that lead to maximizing
revenue. But I would suggest there's many others. It's not just occupancy and rate, it's marketing spend,
it's discounting, it's days you allow customers to reserve a unit. There's many other tools we can use to
maximize revenue. And the data scientists and the algorithms take all of these factors into play in setting
daily pricing and occupancy targets to try to maximize revenue.

Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

That's helpful. And what are you seeing on the supply front. Given the strength of trends and they've
remained strong, does supply pressure inevitably come back? And if so, how far away are we from that?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

Really good question. So based on what we see on the ground that affects our same-store pool, so not
national statistics, things we care about. We continue to believe that there is going to be some moderation
of deliveries in 2021 from 2020, just like there was from 2019 to 2020. But that being said, I think we're
going to see more development in the future. Just this week, I talked to 2 developers who had projects
that did not hit underwriting, they were making no money and they're selling them and they're getting
bailed out by current pricing. And I asked both of them what they're going to do with the proceeds, and
they said, we're going to go stick shovels in the ground.

So between great fundamentals, low interest rates, lots of capital floating into the space, albeit I get
that costs are higher. I think we're going to continue to see development, and it's going to be something
we're going to have to deal with just like we've been dealing with for the past 4 or 5 years, no difference.
And that being said, I'd point out that one of the advantages of having a broadly diversified portfolio like
Extra Space is we have exposures to many, many different markets, some of which are heading into a
development cycle, some of which are coming out of a development cycle, some of which have never

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

been affected by development. And all those markets are in some different stage. And because of that
diversification, our returns are smoothed out.

Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Very helpful. And just if I can squeeze one last in. On the acquisition front, has there been any change in
market conditions from the first to the second quarter? And are you seeing any new bidders?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

I'm not sure there's new bidders from the first to the second quarter. I mean there's certainly a lot of new
entrants in the market. It's hard for me on the top of my head to think about one that appeared in the
second quarter. I don't see any material change. I think there's a lot of capital, interest rates are low, and
self-storage has proven itself to be a great investment.

Operator

Our next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore.

Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess just sticking on supply, I mean, are there any -- just to elaborate a little bit more on maybe the
markets that are a bit -- any indication or initial kind of concerns that you're seeing in any markets to call
out?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

I think our list of markets is pretty similar to the list of markets we've had in the past. The boroughs of
New York, we continue to be concerned about. And we continue because of that new development have
results there that are below our portfolio average. Northern New Jersey, Atlanta, Vegas maybe a new
market on the list we're starting to watch. Philadelphia also maybe a new market. Those are, I would say,
the markets that where we have significant exposure that we're focused on right now.

Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And I guess my second question is really around -- on the disposition side. I mean could you see yourself
bring more assets to market considering how strong pricing has been here?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So we closed the disposition of 16 assets into a joint venture. And we expect to close the second half of
that transaction shortly to reduce our interest in the venture further. We have another 17 assets on the
market now for outright sale. We have a couple ordinance that we're working on to get in a position to
sell, but nothing major. And we're constantly looking at the portfolio and trying to decide what moves
would be optimal to rebalance to have the right amount of exposure in different markets. So we'll always
consider it, but that's what we have on the plate now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Maybe just a question on the Bridge Loan Program. The guidance now assumes that you retain $100
million of Bridge loans this year, but it seems like you're running below that pace considering what you've

10

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

closed and sold so far this year. So wondering if you can go through the outlook there and what visibility
you have to activity in the second half?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

Yes. That's a great question. So yes, we are behind initial projections in terms of timing. We are confident
we're going to achieve our guidance. It is going to be more back-end loaded. We currently have $200
million worth of loans with signed term sheets and deposits to close in the back half of this year and the
beginning of next year. So nothing is guaranteed, but I'm pretty comfortable we will get to our guidance.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of the customers, I know you mentioned that you're finding that
there's lower vacates than you've had in the past. But just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the
new interest that you're seeing for space that's helping that occupancy too. Do you have any insight into
what's driving customer storage needs this year and how that compares to the past?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So this is more of a longer-term answer, not just this year. But we saw during the pandemic the reasons
people gave us for storage. Traditionally, the #1 reason has been they're somewhere in the moving
process. And then that declined and what increased during the pandemic was lack of space, and that
became the #1 reason for a while. Those lines have since crossed again. But we interpret lack of space
as I'm at home and I need a bedroom to -- for in-home school or in-home office or a workout room or
I'm going to find a cleaner garage or whatever. And those customers tend to stay longer than customers
who give the reason of staying is moving. So I would point to that as why we're seeing currently declining
vacates. And I don't think all of those customers eventually take their stuff out of storage and convert the
home office back to a bedroom or whatever. I think some of -- not all of them, but I think some portion of
them will be longer-term customers.

Operator

Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway of Green Street.

Spenser Bowes Allaway
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Just going back to the transaction market once more. Have you guys observed any shift in pricing spreads
just in terms of quality or any notable outliers in terms of geography?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So we're not very, very active in tertiary markets. So it's hard for me to comment about that. I would tell
you that for good stores in primary and secondary markets, there's very, very little spread in pricing.

Spenser Bowes Allaway
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just in terms of your inaugural public bond offering, what role should we anticipate the
unsecured market playing for you guys in terms of its source of funds moving forward?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

So I think that you'll see us be a repeat issuer going forward. There's 2 or 3 things driving that. I mean,
obviously, you're always looking at the rate, and you're trying to get the lowest rate possible. I think that
we're looking to extend the tenure of our debt. And then we want to have as many capital sources as

11

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

possible. So we are going to access the capital source that we feel like is the most advantageous to us at
this time.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You talked about buying lease-up assets. So I was curious for the $500 million that's baked into
acquisition guidance. Can you give us a sense as to what an average going-in cap rate or average
occupancy would be?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So I'll talk about our recent deals because I think to talk about deals that we signed up last year that
closed this year is probably not indicative of current pricing. So our -- for the wholly owned lease-up deals,
we have recently approved, our first year yield is 3.1%, low 3s with an average 17 months to stabilization
at an average stabilized cap of 6%. So we're happy to accept or willing to accept that initial dilution
because we have confidence in our ability to underwrite lease-up and get to those accretive returns. For
the deals we've done in ventures, the first year yield to Extra Space, not at the deal level, is 7.2%, 13
months average to stabilization and a stabilized yield of almost 11%. So you can see how the venture
structure significantly helps our returns.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Got it. And is that -- what's the typical occupancy on the wholly owned where you're getting that
3% initial versus the 7% for the JV? Is it comparable -- it's not a comparable -- going-in occupancy, would
it be?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So the occupancies were higher than you would imagine. A lot of them were in the 60s or 80s. But
that's physical occupancy, and we look at stabilization when you get to both physical occupancy and rate
stabilization, right? We have one that's -- or a couple there in the 90s physical occupancies, but have
significant rate growth before they get to economic stabilization.

Does that make sense, did I explain that correctly?

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I think so, I think so.

Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.

Ronald Kamdem
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just going back to the ECRI questions that was asked earlier. Maybe thinking about the entire portfolio,
number one, just what percentage does still have some sort of restrictions on it? Is it sort of 5%? Is
it 10%? And the second question is, are you able to sort of charge even higher ECRI than you have
historically given the rate environment?

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

I don't have the exact percent in front of me, but it's a small percent, a very low percent. So even in
California, it's not a majority.

Ronald Kamdem
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And then on the ability to push the rate increases, are you seeing sort of an ability to do it at a
higher and faster level than historical, given sort of the record rate environment?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

That is what we are currently doing. We're pushing things more towards street rate today, and part of
that has to do with the fact that sometimes you've had rate caps in place or state of emergencies that
have been in place that have hindered our ability to raise rates for the past 12 to 18 months depending
on the location. And so we have brought them up more significantly as well as the fact that many of these
customers moved in very steep discounts that were unprecedented also.

Ronald Kamdem
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Makes sense. And then my last question was just on the preferred investments. Is there anything
that changed? Or is there any call risk with sort of the pricing environment that you're seeing today on
those preferreds? Or are they sort of [indiscernible] maturity?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So one of the things we've changed in our guidance this year is there is a $100 million piece of the
preferred to JCAP that opens in the end of October, I believe. And our initial guidance had assumed that
was outstanding for the entire year. And given how well the properties are doing, the company is doing,
we have changed our assumption that, that gets paid off prior to year-end, reducing our dividend income
from that. So I think it's a safe assumption that, that company will want to retire 12% money as soon as it
can.

[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Smedes Rose of Citi.

Smedes Rose
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Just two more quick ones. The first one, I wanted to ask you, it looked like the third-party managed
platform, the number of assets under management declined sequentially on a net basis. And I was just
wondering, is that just -- you just see that as a normal ebb and flow of business? Or is there anything in
particular that went on during the quarter? And then the second question was, could you just talk about
length of stay? I think last -- on your last call, you mentioned that length of stay had shortened a little bit.
And I was just wondering, is it returning back to maybe what you've seen historically?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So Smedes, I think you're right to observe that we have a lot of churn in our management platform.
A lot of people are taking advantage of pricing in the market and selling. But even given that churn,
we continue to grow that platform. We ended the year at 724 properties. We ended the first quarter at
763. We ended the second quarter at 768. And that includes 19 properties that left the platform that we
bought. So we continue to grow that. We have a very, very healthy pipeline. We project to add net 100 to
130 properties this year. It's not guaranteed. We don't know what else is going to sell. But we continue to
grow that quarter after quarter and expect to continue to do that.

Executive VP & CFO

Smedes, I think that also might be a little confusing when you look at the buckets. We're moving
sometimes between buckets. And so when you take the total of JV and third party, it actually did
move slightly as we had some JV partners sell some of the assets in the quarter. But the third-party
management business, just the third-party management actually saw a net increase.

And then the second question, Smedes, on the length of stay. Our length of stay is now back up. We saw a
tick down slightly and then it's back up today.

Operator

Our next question is a follow-up from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital.

Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just a follow-up on the balance sheet, which you noted is in a very strong position, 4.8x at the end of
June. How should we expect that to trend? And where do you see capital going? And as a kind of a side
question, how much in proceeds should we expect from the 17 assets that are now being marketed for
disposition?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

So the 17 assets that are being marketed for disposition are over $200 million. In terms of where we
expect to spend our next dollar or where we expect to borrow, I think it will depend on the opportunities
to invest. I think that we'll look at the cheapest cost of capital, whether that's debt. I think that we
typically want to operate in that 5.5 to 6x. Today, we're sub-5. So we do have a lot of capacity there. And
I think depending on the size of the deal, you would also consider equity at times. But right now, we do
have a leverage capacity.

Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. But the focus for incremental spend sounds like it's on acquisitions via the joint ventures, there's
not necessarily new investments that could be used as you think about kind of taking the balance sheet to
where you want to from a target leverage perspective?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So the -- with the exception of the second half of the joint venture sale, that recapitalization, if you will,
that I mentioned earlier, we believe future joint venture acquisitions will not be out of our portfolio, they'll
be from the market. So it won't produce additional investable dollars for us. We'll invest a portion of the
acquisition price.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kevin Stein of Stifel.

Kevin Stein
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I was just wondering on the expense side. I know marketing and payroll expenses were down. I was
just wondering if you could give us some color on what's driving that and how sustainable that is going
forward?

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Yes. On the expense side, we mentioned we had an increase of property taxes. Our property taxes are
running about 6% year-over-year. On the payroll side, we have seen a decrease. That's driven by a couple
of things. One is a year-over-year comparable that is quite easy from last year. Last year, first half of the
year, you were essentially fully staffed, and we were providing some -- we were generous in the COVID
benefits, making sure that our employees were taken care of. In terms of going forward and the -- how
sustainable that decline in payroll is, I think it's to be seen. We expect some benefit, but not necessarily to
the degree we saw in the first and second quarter as we are expecting some wage pressure, and we have
more difficult comps in the back half of the year. In terms of the marketing, we are expecting a benefit.
But again, if that's always the wildcard to some degree in that -- if we do see an opportunity to spend on
marketing, we will use that if we feel like we can get higher rate and higher occupancy.

Operator

Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I had a follow-up question again on the acquisitions. You guys gave some detail earlier about how in the, I
think, wholly owned properties you were looking at the initial yield was 3.1%, stabilized was 6%, and then
in the JV properties, it was 7.2% initial and stabilized almost 11%. I was just wondering if there was any
real detail you could give us into what's driving that difference? Is it just fees that you earn in the joint
venture or something else?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

So the primary driver is we collect the management fee from the joint venture, and we retain 100%
of that tenant insurance income. So we're retaining all of that income against a much smaller capital
investment versus 100% capital investment. In some of our ventures, we do get acquisition fees or other
fees. We also have the opportunity to earn promotes, and in some of our older ventures, we are earning
promoted -- cash flow promotes, but that's not assumed in any of these numbers.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then just maybe obvious, but in raising the acquisition guidance to the $500 million,
then that just means that this year volume of transaction will be that much higher, just your portion is
going to be $500 million. Is that it?

Joseph Daniel Margolis
CEO & Director

Correct. That's correct.

Operator

Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Two quick follow-ups here. First, I think the comments from earlier were that rate growth does not
accelerate in the second half of the year, but the revenue growth for guidance for the second half of the
year implies an increase versus the first half. And you talked about the contribution from occupancy
gains diminishing as we move further into the back half of the year. So it would seem that rate growth is
expected to accelerate. Can you just clarify those comments, or perhaps I misheard?

EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Yes. So I think really what you're -- what I'm saying is Q3 is better than Q1. So Q1 is dragging it down,
Q3 will bring it up. Q4 will also be better than Q1. But I'm saying they're not accelerating from where they
are today in June and into July.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. And then seasonally, what's typically the beginning of the off-peak season for you where
move-outs are higher than move-ins? And are you expecting anything different from a seasonality
standpoint this year with schools and return to schools relative to last year?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Peak occupancy from a month-end perspective is July. From an actual -- when it peaks, it's mid-August,
but then you do see some decline as students move out, and we are expecting some of those students to
move out and typical student volatility.

Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And that begins -- that coincides with that mid-August timing?

P. Scott Stubbs
Executive VP & CFO

Correct.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to CEO, Joe Margolis for closing remarks. Sir?

Joseph Daniel Margolis

Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for participating in the call and your interest and support of Extra Space.
I mean, obviously, we're having a fantastic year. We have all-time high occupancy, exceptional new
customer rate growth. We're continuing our innovative external growth strategies as well as innovating at
the store level, and we expect to have a very strong same-store and core FFO growth this year. Thank you
again, and have a good day.
