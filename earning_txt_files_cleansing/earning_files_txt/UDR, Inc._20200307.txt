UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the UDR's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference. [Operator Instructions] As
a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Director of Investor Relations, Trent Trujillo. Thank you, sir.
You may now begin.

Trent Nathan Trujillo
Director of Investor Relations

Welcome to UDR's quarterly financial results conference call. Our press release and supplemental
disclosure package were distributed yesterday afternoon and posted to the Investor Relations section of
our website, ir.udr.com. In the supplement, we have reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the
most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G requirements.

Statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements.
Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable
assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. A discussion of risks and risk
factors are detailed in our press release and included in our filings with the SEC. We do not undertake a
duty to update any forward-looking statements.

When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone's time and
limit your questions to 1 plus a follow-up. Management will be available after the call for your questions
that did not get answered during the Q&A session today.

I will now turn the call over to UDR's Chairman and CEO, Tom Toomey.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Trent, and welcome to UDR's First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. On the call with me today are
Jerry Davis, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mike Lacy, Senior Vice President of Operations; and Joe
Fisher, Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our results. Senior executives, Harry Alcock and Matt Cozad
will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.

While we are pleased with the strong combined same-store NOI and FFOA per share growth we produced
in the first quarter, the executive team and I are more gratified by how our business and dedicated team
of associates have successfully adapted to the ongoing challenges that have come with the COVID-19
pandemic. We appreciate the position that many of our associates are in and thank them for continuing to
show compassion to and accommodations extended to our residents that have been negatively impacted
by the coronavirus.

From a high level, our business continues to perform well. This is a testament to the outstanding work of
our teams and culture, the investments we have made in technology over the past decade, our diversified
portfolio across geographies and price points, the strength of our balance sheet and the defensive nature
of apartments. I'm encouraged by the fact that traffic and leasing trends have steadily improved in the
recent weeks, and our next-generation operating platform has enabled us to continue to deliver a high
level of service to our residents and prospects while providing the tools necessary for our associates to
execute our business in the face of a fluid and the changing regulatory requirements.

I am confident that our next-generation operating platform is not only a foundation that enables
our teams to meet today's demands, but it's also one that allows us to pivot when customers or the
environment changes. And it will continue to be a differentiator for UDR as we make our way through the
pandemic and adapt to the new ways we are all going to do business in the future.

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Moving on to a brief update of our business. April's cash collections were strong at 95.5%, with 98% of
our residents paying all or part of their April rent. Resident retention has moved higher and turnover has
declined throughout the portfolio. Traffic is lighter than we would typically see this time of year, but it has
been trending up in recent weeks, and we are encouraged by the prospects of a number of cities starting
to open up again. And our dividend is secure, and our balance sheet remains strong with substantial
liquidity at our disposal. Jerry, Mike and Joe will provide additional details on each of these areas later in
the call.

Last, a pandemic and an economic uncertainty it has created, we're not in our original plans. Therefore,
we decided to withdraw our full-year 2020 guidance outlook. COVID-19 like other disruptions we faced
over the decades will eventually pass. And I remain confident that we are on the right team, the right
strategy and the right portfolio in place to manage through this time of volatility like we're currently
experiencing. Companies like UDR that remain focused on driving operations and innovation, ensuring
positive outcomes for the residents and associates, maintaining a strong balance sheet and deploying
capital in a disciplined manner will come out of this much stronger.

With that, I will turn the call over to Jerry.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. With combined same-store revenue, expense and NOI
growth rates of 3%, 1.7% and 3.5%, respectively, we continue to produce solid operating results during
the first quarter. Our controllable margin expanded by 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of
2019, and we reduced controllable expenses by 1.1% versus a year ago.

Over the past year, we have encouraged those listening to view personnel and R&M expense growth in
tandem with one another as our next-generation operating platform initiatives pushed their respective
growth rates in opposite directions, but also reduced their combined growth rate over time. This was again
true in the first quarter with a combined growth rate of negative 2.3% year-over-year. But as Tom alluded
to in his prepared remarks, first quarter results take a back seat to what has transpired over the past 2
months. We and the nation continue to face a challenging situation. COVID-19 has altered the way we live
our lives, interact with people and has changed the way UDR and the apartment industry approaches day-
to-day operations.

With all the negative headlines in the news, I am proud we collected the April rents from 98% of our
residents, with 95% of residents paying in full, and I'm inspired to hear the positive uplifting actions our
associates continue to take to provide quality service to and engagement with our residents.

This would not be possible without our next-gen operating platform. When we originally laid out our vision
for the platform, 3 years ago, we understood that a majority of businesses were rapidly transitioning to
an online self-service model and that we could capture first-mover advantages in the apartment industry
by doing the same. Since early 2019, we have reported on a variety of stats and have highlighted how the
next-gen operating platform is driving efficiency gains and contributing more dollars to our bottom line
through controllable margin expansion and self-service.

While we did not envision a pandemic when embarking on the transformation of our operating platform,
we are thankful for the great people at UDR as well as the investments we have made to help ensure the
ongoing well-being of our workforce and the resident base in a world with mandated social distancing.

Some of the traditional aspects of our business that have changed during the pandemic include: first,
100% of in-person property tours have ceased and have been replaced with virtual and self-guided
tours. One of our original goals for 2020 was to roll out virtual and self-guided tours across all of our
communities, and we are in a great position to accomplish this already, having implemented this initiative
in over 100 of our communities pre-COVID.

Leasing offices have largely gone virtual. 100% of resident documents are executed electronically. Our
corporate insight sales and renewals teams have been working overtime to reverse notices to vacate
and capitalize on the traffic we are receiving. And nearly all service requests are made online by phone

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

through our app via other electronic means such as text. This is in comparison to approximately 80% of
service requests being submitted electronically or by phone pre-COVID. To ensure the safety of associates
and residents alike and to comply with social distancing requirements, we continue to fulfill emergency
requests only at this time.

Our next-gen operating platform is clearly demonstrating its value by allowing us to quickly adapt to the
current environment and fully run our business, which keeps us in a position of strength during this crisis.
Tools such as Zoom-based leasing and a real-time update on collections are 2 such examples.

In terms of operating details and relative market performance, Mike will provide more information later in
his prepared remarks. But from a high level, I am pleased with how well we have adjusted to the situation
and the steps we have and continue to take to drive solid operating results. In particular, the $1.9 billion
of community acquisitions we have made since the start of 2019 continue to perform relatively well given
the identified upside opportunities relative to private market operators.

Last, I would like to express sincere gratitude to our associates in the field and at corporate for continuing
to embrace the challenges brought on by the pandemic and for accelerating the adoption of next-gen
operating platform. I am proud to work alongside each of you, as we create new and innovative strategies
that will ensure continued high levels of service for our residents.

With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Thanks, Jerry, and good afternoon. As everyone listening to this call is aware, the pandemic has led
to unprecedented levels of unemployment claims over a short amount of time, which in turn has led
to widespread concerns about residents ability to pay rent. As Jerry mentioned, through the dedicated
efforts of our associates and the physical response by federal government, April cash collections totaled
95.5% and 98% of our residents made some level of April rent payments, with 95% paying in full. For
comparison purposes, April 2020 collections were just 4% below of April 2019. While may not be as well-
known to those on this call is the web of regulations, federal, state, county and local governments have
enacted or are likely to enact. These are wide-ranging, include eviction moratoriums, stay-at-home orders,
restrictions on fees that can be charged, freezes on line increases, lease break legislation and restrictions
on debt collections to name a handful.

While each of these has impacted our business in one way or another, our market and asset level
operating strategies in response have remained surgical, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all approach. And
by surgical I mean that we are working with and combating any resident that has faced financial hardship
due to COVID-19 on a case-by-case basis while ensuring our compliance with any regulatory action. I
want to thank all of our associates for staying on top of these constantly changing regulation and adapting
our strategies as needed.

On the operations front, occupancy remains strong at 96.6% in April, which is approximately 20 basis
points below the same period last year. Blended lease rate growth for the month of April was 2%, driven
by solid renewal rate growth of approximately 5%. Retention is higher as annualized turnover in April
is 720 basis points lower than last year's comparable period. As reported in our release last night, we
experienced a 19% decline in traffic and a 15% reduction in applications on a year-over-year basis in April
due to stay-at-home orders.

However, we also saw our lease closing ratio improve to 54% compared to 31% a year ago. I'm
encouraged with the positive momentum in traffic, applications and signed leases over the past 2 weeks.
To build on this momentum, we have implemented [ BART ] approach to each community, while our next-
generation operating platform have allowed us to continue to drive traffic, execute leases virtually and
take a more surgical approach to maintaining rent and preserving our record.

While it is still too early to understand the long-term impact, if any, the regulatory actions may have on
our business. Some reset high-level operating trends we have identified over the past 45 days are as
follows: Occupancy in our B quality portfolio averaged 97% in April and hasn't declined much; A quality

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

occupancy averaged 96% in April, but has and will likely continue to be pressured by corporate lease
exposure and lower traffic due to shelter-in-place orders in key markets; traffic and turnover have been
slightly better at our B communities due to the more suburban nature of our B quality portfolio; blended
rental rate growth has been comparable between As and Bs; and we have seen slightly lower collections
across our B quality communities.

Highlighting some of the specific markets. Greater Seattle is one of the first markets afflicted by the
coronavirus, yet our results through April are a pleasant surprise. However, due to recently enacted
regulations in the state of Washington that mandate flat renewal growth for the foreseeable future, we are
likely to see some forward rate growth headwinds. In certain urban coastal markets such as New York and
San Francisco, we are experiencing a vacancy impact due to lower demand for short-term and corporate
leases.

Because of lower levels of traffic in these markets, we are facing reduced pricing power and are generally
competitively priced on rents to increase leasing velocity. Orlando, Tampa and Orange County are our
largest markets were tied to hospitality and retail-oriented employment, and collectively represent
approximately 20% of NOI. These 3 markets have seen some softness in both rents and occupancy as
a result of relatively high exposure to service sector employment combined with a large amount of our
portfolio in these markets being suburban and B quality.

Finally, having previously worked in the field for a number of years, I understand that a period of extreme
change can impact our regional and community leaders. Our associates have all worked well together to
adapt to a new operating environment, develop targeted market approach and engage with our current
and prospective residents. I'm proud of each and every one of you, have continued to exemplify the UDR
values during this health and economic crisis. Thank you for all that you do.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Mike. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results and the withdrawal of our
full-year 2020 guidance and a balance sheet and liquidity update, inclusive of recent transactions and
capital markets activity. Our first quarter earnings results came in at the midpoint of previously provided
guidance ranges. FFO as adjusted per share was $0.54, approximately 9% higher year-over-year and
driven by strong combined same-store and lease-up performance, accretive capital deployment and lower
interest rates.

Regarding guidance, we have elected to withdraw our full-year 2020 guidance outlook, given uncertainty
around the impact the coronavirus pandemic will have on the economy and our business. As disclosed
in our press release and as Mike discussed, we have presented an operational update through April to
provide stakeholders with additional insights into trends. Moving on, our balance sheet and next 3-year
liquidity profile remains strong due to the efforts that we have taken over the last several years. As such,
we are well positioned to weather the effects of COVID-19 and the downturn that has accompanied it.

Some highlights include: first, our capital capacity and debt maturity profile put us in an advantageous 3-
year liquidity position. As of April 30, our liquidity as measured by cash and credit facility capacity, net of
our commercial paper balance, was $775 million. Through 2022, only $106 million or approximately 2% of
our consolidated debt outstanding is scheduled to mature, excluding principal amortization and amounts
on our working capital credit facility. Please see Attachment 4B of our supplement for further details on
our debt maturity profile.

Second, we entered into $105 million of forward ATM contracts, sold one community in the Greater Seattle
area on May 1 for approximately $90 million and are under contract with a nonrefundable deposit to sell
another community. Combined, these equate to approximately $250 million of capital sources.

While the forward ATM proceeds were originally raised in anticipation of a single asset external growth
opportunity, COVID-19 has changed these plans, and we have elected to focus on capital preservation in
the near term.

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Third, to maintain flexibility on previously planned development starts and to preserve capital, we do
not anticipate starting any new development projects until there is more clarity on the macroeconomic,
regulatory, fundamental and cost environments. Our current development and redevelopment pipeline
totals only $304 million at cost or less than 2% of enterprise value and is nearly 40% funded with
approximately $191 million of remaining capital to spend over the next 2 years.

Fourth, our dividend remains secure and well covered by cash flow from operations. Based on first quarter
2020 AFFO per share of $0.51, our dividend payout ratio was 71%. This implies that our earnings would
need to decrease by approximately 30% before reaching cash flow parity, substantially higher than the
losses we or the multifamily industry experienced during any of the past several recessions.

Taken together, our liquidity position is strong, and forward sources and uses are very manageable.
Moving forward, we will be highly selective with where and how we choose to invest your capital as
we believe it is prudent to preserve capital in the current environment, while retaining value creation
optionality for the future.

In terms of credit metrics, as shown on Attachment 4C of our supplement, we have substantial capacity
before, we have not been incompliant with any of our line of credit or unsecured bond covenants. As of
quarter end, our consolidated financial leverage was 35% on undepreciated book value and 31.5% on
enterprise value, inclusive of joint ventures. Consolidated net debt-to-EBITDAre was 6.0x and inclusive of
joint ventures was 6.1x, which looks slightly elevated due to the timing of acquisitions completed during
the quarter versus the closing of announced dispositions and a pending settlement for ATM proceeds.
Please see Attachment 13 of our supplement for further details on sources and uses of capital.
With that, I will open it up for Q&A. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question is coming from Nicholas Joseph of Citi.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I hope you guys are doing well. Appreciate the operating environment has obviously changed over the last
2 months. You have been and continue to be in the process of rolling out your next-generation operating
platform. So I'm wondering if there's any lessons learned thus far in terms of either an acceleration or any
delays or any changes to that next-generation operating platform as you see it over the next few years?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Nick, this is Jerry. Yes, we did start working on the next-gen operating platform about 3 years ago, started
reporting the efficiencies and the contributions to our controllable margin last year. And I would tell you,
I think, we were well suited when the pandemic did hit to adapt quickly towards 100% virtual as well as
self-guided tours. We were doing quite a bit of that before, but transitioning to 100% was fairly easy. We
were also able to shut down our offices to physical traffic and accommodate our customers electronically
or over the phone, that went extremely well. And I would say it probably accelerated us 6 to 12 months of
where we would have expected to have been as far as customer self-service.

In addition, we've been working on the big data side of it, and we continue to learn new things every day.
I'll say, I have been working remotely for the last 2 months and have become proficient at Zoom, even
though I never had really used Zoom before. And when you look at the adoption of the U.S. population
to that way of doing virtual meetings, we're starting to utilize that on virtual tour. So rather than just
doing FaceTimes, where you can just walk around, the ability to share a screen such as udr.com and walk
somebody through the entire website, I think, is going to enhance our ability to sell virtually, especially,
as people continue to not want to travel as much, at least, over the near term. In addition to that, Matt
Cozad and our team have developed a mechanism to track collections really on a minute-by-minute,
probably second-by-second basis. So you kind of seeing collections as they come through in real time and
it allows us to direct our resources to do a better job on managing these collections. So I would say in
addition to everything we talked to you about previously accelerating, we've also found new opportunities
as our customer has adopted technologies, and we're going to start using that in our business.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then just maybe on a collection trends thus far, and I recognize it's very early in the month, but what
have you seen relative to April and historical averages?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes. This is still Jerry. I'm going to turn it over to Mike Lacy in a minute. A lot of you know, Mike, he's been
running ops really for us for a couple of years, and we thought since he is more into the details, especially
as we work our way through this a couple of months, it would be a good opportunity for him to give those
updates. But I can tell you, I'm pleased with the way our teams have reacted in both April as well as May.
But Mike, why don't you give us some stats on how we're doing?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

9

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Sure. Thanks, Jerry. Nick, based on what we can see right now, our May collections are actually 87% of
May billings, which is flat to our April collections at this point in the month. And we can see April today is
96% compared to the 95.5% we had in the press release. As Jerry said, we're able to see this real time.
So I just pulled that number a minute ago. Currently, today, is 96% occupied. I expect we end up between
95.5% to 96% this month after we take back some more corporate units.

Our main traffic today is trending about where it had been in the last few weeks, which is around 10%
to 15% down compared to last year, but significantly better than where we were in March this time last
month, which was down about 35%. We expect our blended lease rate growth will remain positive in May.
And we're keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. But just to remind everybody, our April numbers
came in at plus 2% for blend. And annualized turnover is expected to be flat to down for the month of
May. And again, credit to our next-gen operating platform team, having this visibility real time to look at
collections has been huge for us. We can focus our energy where we need to do it. And credit to our teams
out in the field because they're able to take this and work with those that need it most.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just curious, you referenced some markets that are more exposed to hospitality. And I know it's still very
early, but certainly, the impact has been swift in some of these markets as far as layoffs. I'm just curious
if you feel like you've seen sort of the worst of the impact play out in some of those markets. And you now
have kind of a better sense of where some of the more challenged submarkets are across the portfolio?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes. This is Jerry, again. I'm going to throw it to Mike in a second. It's hard to tell, we've seen the worst
of it. I think it's going to depend on when back to stay-at-home orders or mandates are released. And
we see a lot of that starting to happen in Florida. So the Orlando market should pick up. It's going to
be interesting to see how quickly the tourism base returns to -- want to enjoy the vacations there. Now
Orange County has started to stabilize a little bit.

Traffic patterns there are probably pretty stable today. We did have some -- again, some delinquency
issues there during the month of April. But Mike, anything you would add to, again, SoCal as well as
Orange -- as well as South Florida?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Yes. Just in general, what we're seeing right now across the portfolio, New York, San Francisco and
Boston, definitely a little bit higher turnover there, given corporate exposure and lower traffic due to stay-
at-home orders. But on a positive note, we've seen Texas, Nashville, Seattle, L.A. and Salinas with strong
retention, traffics increasing and honestly, decent rent growth.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. Appreciate the detail there. And then one other question that I've been putting out there.
I'm just curious, as you think about future development and how things have evolved. If you were
negotiating contract today on a construction project, where do you think hard cost would be versus pre-
COVID-19? And then how does that sort of overlay with your strategy for restarting the development
pipeline ultimately versus pursuing additional DCP type investments?

Harry G. Alcock
Chief Investment Officer & Senior VP

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Austin, this is Harry. We had 2 projects with planned starts during the second quarter. We had paused on
these 2 while we, as you mentioned, look at pricing and overall economics. We recognize NOI is likely to
decline in the near term, but we also know the multifamily fundamentals tend to be strong coming out of
downturns. And we believe that we will be able to pull some cost out of the projects, which is a permanent
benefit for the NOI trends, which are inherently temporary or cyclical. I think in terms of hard costs,
and we're in the market looking to take some cost out of our existing pipeline in addition to the forward
pipeline. I mean it really depends a little bit in terms of the type of construction and the market you're in.
I think there's a general view that it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% of hard costs is probably a
safe number. There's some optimistic views that it could be a little bit greater than that, perhaps as high
as 10%.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And then how are you thinking about that versus kind of when you're looking at potential investment
opportunities in a DCP-type deal or future development? Any additional thoughts there? And then that's all
for me.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Austin, it's Joe. Just in terms of how it relates to future investment opportunities as well as external
growth. I think first off, we start with the balance sheet in terms of where do we sit today. We spent some
time on the prepared remarks and on the press release talking about all of what we've done in terms of
building up capacity, pushing down maturities and really doing a lot of work there in the last couple of
years. When it gets to the external growth, it's coming similar to what we've done over the last couple
of years, which is pivot to where the returns take us. So we've reduced development significantly. When
we don't see returns, we ramped up DCP. We really hit the go button on equity and external growth
on acquisitions last year when we saw the opportunity there. So I think DCP developments, buybacks,
acquisitions, et cetera, they're all going to end up competing with each other. But right now, we view
capacity and liquidity is kind of at a premium and a desire to be patient in our approach. So we'll probably
start to whittle away here at some point, but right now, I'm just trying to be patient with the capital to --
what we have.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Rich Hightower of Evercore.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Hope everybody is doing well. Joe or anybody, really, just a follow-up on the external growth question.
Talking to others, including your peers, it sounds like there's not yet a lot of distress out there, right? The
Fed is cooperating and business is still holding up. But do you envision that scenario changing over the
next few months as developer balance sheets or anybody else in the ecosystem as they get stretched?
And do you think that's where the opportunity might come up a little more favorably for well-capitalized
owners and investors like UDR?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

No. Rich, it's Joe. I think for real estate broadly and then multifamily specifically, it's probably going to be
tough to get into a fully distressed situation. If you go back to the last downturn, we had a fundamental
downturn, a capital markets downturn and real estate was at the epicenter of both of those. You look at
where we're at today. I think, the Fed, the treasury and the U.S. government have done an exceptional
job in terms of trying to keep businesses in a good liquidity situation, making sure consumer survives
and making sure that credit markets continue to act pretty well, when you look at unsecured and secured
space. So I don't think we have anything ahead of us on the capital market side that would be concerning
in terms of distress. So that it just comes down to how do you underwrite the near-term NOI growth

profile. And so I think we're all still waiting through that, trying to figure that out. But it's hard to see us
going into a situation where we have a lot of distress out there in the transaction market.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Those are help -- go ahead, sorry.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

No you're good, Rich.

Richard Allen Hightower
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay, okay. Those are helpful comments. Yes. And then just on the fundamental environment, factoring
in construction delays in different places versus other places. And as we think about the lease-up
environment over the next few months, where across your broad portfolio do you see supply -- new
supply having the greatest impact on market rents over this kind of peak leasing curve that we're into
right now?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Rich, I'll kind of kick it off, and some of the others may jump in here. But when we came into the year,
we saw supply overall in 2020 was going to be in that flat to up 10% range. When you look at individual
markets, Boston, L.A., San Francisco, those were some of the markets that we thought there would be
a little bit more pressure on in terms of supply being up. When you look at the stay-at-home orders and
some of the shutdowns in terms of construction activity, clearly, it's been a little bit more impacted on
the East Coast. So Boston, specifically, where we thought there'd be some more pressure probably slows
down a bit. Like New York definitely slows down. A little bit less of that taking place on the West Coast.
But overall, you will see some degree of slippage throughout the country, a little bit more so in certain
markets. So that flat to up 10% number probably looks more flat to down 10% and just drips into '21.

And then if you look at a more forward picture, if you look at starts activity, clearly, it's come off
materially. We'll see where April is next week when we get the numbers again. But I'd expect starts,
permits activity to keep coming off both due to credit markets, which on the construction financing side,
it's kind of one area of the credit markets that have really shut down a little bit in terms of cost and
proceeds. And then governmental losses clearly have slowed their activity and/or shutdown. So probably a
positive impact when you get out there later '21 and into '22.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And I would just add, when you look at our portfolio, where we've probably felt the most impact from
new supply would be Downtown San Diego, SoMa District in San Francisco and Downtown L.A.

Our next question is coming from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.

Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just -- I know you guys have been through different cycles and the great geographic -- discuss or think
about longer term, some of the different regions and future trends you expect at this point?

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Yes. Jeff, this is Toomey. Let me take a shot at that. With respect to -- we're right in the middle of, if
you will, the crisis of this pandemic. And often, I find it wise not to adjust our strategy in the middle of a
storm. What you do adjust is your tactics. And you can see we laid a good foundation with the operating
platform to address those tactical opportunities. And Mike and the team are working very diligently in
executing that. As we've talked about what lies ahead on the backside of this, it is interesting when we
start looking at the decision trees as well as the opportunity sets. And the first cube we come up with on
a decision is, well, do we come up with a virus vaccine? Do we come up with adequate testing? And do
we go back to, if we have those 2 things in hand in the next year, do we go back to February of 2020?
Or is there something else that's going to evolve in that slow progression out of this? And so I think it's
just early for us to adjust our strategy. We'll keep revisiting that question, looking at the opportunity sets
that come up. And what we do have, and I believe, is a very strong foundation to build off of, whether
that's the team, the platform, the capital availability. So no adjustment to strategy at this time. We'll play
it through. But I think we could be sitting here 6 months from now with a completely different landscape.
And what we'll be proud of is the tactical execution that we've done and probably reach that decision when
that time comes best.

Jeffrey Alan Spector
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Appreciate those comments. And does that also go for how the amenities or what you can offer, I guess?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think Jerry and Mike can handle what we're doing on the individual community levels about opening
those up.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes. One of our amenities have closed. We will open them up as soon as the cities allow. There will be a lot
of protocols put in place to comply with spacial distancing, cleaning standards, things like that. But I think
when you look at amenities going forward, over the last 2 to 3 years, what we've seen and a lot of our
revenue-enhancing spend has been placed in converting things like theater rooms and spaces like that into
smaller conference rooms and other types of work areas. So I think that's going to be continuing. I think
when Harry is building product in the future, we'll see how this plays out. If there's other things, we'll look
to do. I think having high-speed WiFi in buildings is also going to become much more of a selling point, as
probably there will be more remote workers. But Harry, anything you want to add to buildings plans that
you think about in the future?

Harry G. Alcock
Chief Investment Officer & Senior VP

No. I think, again, it's early. As Jerry mentioned. As we now look at particular to build new buildings, we'll
definitely look at things such as the quality of airflow and filtration systems. We'll likely further expand
package rooms to handle increased delivery volume. We'll ensure that we're using antimicrobial surfaces
such as quartz or Caesarstone, those types of things.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.

Unknown Analyst

This is Summit in for Nick. Two broad questions, actually. One, I think you mentioned earlier on that
collections were a little lighter on the Class B side of the portfolio. So just wanted to get a sense of
renewal or even blended lease pricing trends, as the differential being Class B and, let's say, the Class
A kind of property? And then the second question is more around DCP. Are there any active projects in
your pipeline that could potentially suffer yield loss because of delays? And are you -- how are you guys
structured around controlling disbursement or funding on those kind of situations?

13

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

What type of DCP, Harry?

Harry G. Alcock
Chief Investment Officer & Senior VP

Sure. So with respect to DCP, we're open to some more DCP. We expect new development starts to slow
in the near term, which likely impacts demand. But over time, we expect to be able to continue to deploy
capital in DCP. And it is an investment class that we like and we continue to look to deploy capital in that
area.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

And then maybe just to add on to that, in terms of the protection that we have in place for some of those
transactions, as you think about the underlying collateral or real estate, we've underwritten majority of
those to about 5.5% to 6% type of yield on developers' numbers. So if we do see a drawdown in terms
of NOI expectations, think we have plenty of cushion to get down to our level of basis. If you look at our
basis in general where our capital sits, we're kind of in that 55% to 85% of the stack. And you had asked
about our ability to sign off on draws, we do have that ability. But when you look at our remaining funding
within the developer capital program, we've only got about $14 million left at this point in time. Primarily
related to the Thousand Oaks transaction, which we recently announced. So all of the equity hasn't been
invested behind us, most of our DCP capital, and now it's under the construction lender to finish out the
funding.

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Yes. This is Mike. Just to touch on the rents, are very comparable between As and Bs or even suburban.
And I believe you asked about delinquency, too. Again, we're averaging around 4% across our portfolio.
New York and Boston are highest due to corporate exposure. We're working with them right now on rent
assistance, L.A. which makes up about 4% of our NOI, is the next highest given regulatory environment
there. Then you have Seattle, Austin and Nashville. They're all at the lowest between 1% and 2%.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

I'll just make an additional comment there on those delinquencies that Mike referenced at 4%. We do
have payment plans or financial arrangements in place with, call it, about 1.5% of that delinquency, which
over time, we think then reduces you to 97.5%. In addition to the fact that we continue to get payments
coming in from individuals we do not have payment plans with. So we'd see those each and every day
coming in. And so we think that number will continue to go up in terms of cash collected for April.

Operator

Our next question is coming from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Mike or Jerry, as you guys ramped concessions in April, are there any markets that just did not respond to
the increased concession, whether it be 6 or 8 weeks break?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

John, it's Mike. New York City has been the one, probably where it's a little bit more challenging right
now because of the stay-at-home orders. So while we did increase concessions to try to increase demand
there, we quickly pivoted and we're finding that we're doing more of the virtual tours there, getting those

Zoom tour that Jerry spoke to, and that's helping us out right now. And then as far as other markets, in
some cases, we did a few loss leaders, where we're trying to drive demand. And you could see that in San
Francisco. That did help us out to some degree, but a little bit more than say New York City.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Sticking with San Francisco, revenue growth in the quarter, even pre-COVID-19 lagged pretty
meaningfully. Could you share April occupancy and new lease growth for San Francisco portfolio?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Sure. So San Francisco today looks like we're around 94%. In April, we were 95.2%. And then our
blended growth there today is right around 1% to 2%.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Two things I want to address. The 11 JV properties that you put into your combined pool. Could you just
maybe talk through the revenue benefits and the expense benefits? I noted on some of your disclosure
that your controllable expenses turn negative. So I'd love to just understand a little bit more of what the
benefit of those new additions to the pool are?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Sure, Rich. This is Jerry. Just to get everybody up to speed, that's about 3,600 units, mostly it was deals
we traded for in the MetLife transaction last year. Makes up about 8.6% of combined same-store NOI
this year. So when you look at those assets, they had revenue growth of 3.9%, that compares to the 3%
blended level. So it benefited total UDR revenue growth for same stores by 10 basis points because the
legacy assets would have come in at 2.9%. A lot of that was actually in fee and other income, which is
really attributable to our platform. As you know, one thing we've told everybody in the past about why we
don't combine the MetLife joint ventures is we will have full control over those. We have to run those in
conjunction with an asset management function that doesn't always adopt our entire platform. So we've
got those deals 100% back in the fourth quarter of last year, put the UDR platform on them. And like I
said, you saw revenue growth come in at 3.9% for the first quarter.

When you look at expense growth, expense growth in total was negative 6% almost at those Met deals.
That compares to 1.7% on a combined basis. So the legacy assets were at 2.7%. So we got about a 100
basis point benefit on the expense side. And when you look at the controllables, which is the question
you asked, and that's where most of the benefit comes from the next-gen operating platform. We've
been telling you about all of the benefits for the last year or 2 to UDR's same stores. And this was a good
opportunity to see how quickly as we get the efficiencies from outsourcing, centralization, sharing staff
between multiple properties that are close by how you could benefit. But the controllable expenses at
those 3,600 homes was down 9.7%. That compares to our legacy assets being held at flat, which is still a
very strong number. The end result on a combined basis is they were down 110 basis points.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Rich, this is Joe. Just one thing for reference for everybody on the call. Within our supplemental
on Attachment 5, we did provide a substantial amount of detail in terms of trying to make sure that we
remain transparent. So you can see on Attachment 5, we do give detail on combined same-store that
acquire JV same-store portfolio as well as what you could call the legacy UDR same-store portfolio. So you

can see rev, expense, NOI kind of back into some of the caps that Jerry is talking about on a rev, expense
and NOI number. So you can work the numbers yourself on that end, if you'd like.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And then I'm sorry if you've already asked this question -- or answered this question. But for April,
do you have any updates on the actual leases signed in April and what the rents look like? What I'm
getting at is some of the disclosure we've heard from some of your peers has been a little bit mixed. But if
you have any updates on actual leases signed in April, that would be really helpful.

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Rich, it's Mike. We signed between a blend on the new and the renewal is around 2% growth.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

But then for leases that go into effect in May, so leases that we may have signed in April, including news
and renewals, well, we're not ready to give detail on that at this time. We do think they'll remain positive
and when we get to May. And so when we get up to June NAREIT, we'll provide an update within our
disclosure at that point in time. So you can kind of track these numbers forward in terms of collections,
blends, traffic, et cetera.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Rich Anderson of SMBC.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

So if I could maybe ask a little bit of a clinical question because it's more fun, I guess. So all of your peers
are kind of in that 95%, 96%, 97% range of April collections, which is great. And really awesome for all of
you. You guys included. But I'm curious how the realities of those conversations went? Were people just
willing to pay the rent? Or were there like some negotiations that went on along the way for in some of
those conversations, assuming that you have several levers from which to pull, to get people to pay their
rent? Or was it just as simple as, yes, here's my rent payment. I feel like that there might have been more
realities to those -- to many of those conversations to get you to that 96% level?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Yes, this is Mike. I'll tell you, it really goes down to the property level, and that's why we've taken that
surgical approach from the beginning, and it's a case by case. So in some markets, we've seen a little
bit more where there's people coming in and they're negotiating versus others where it's been more of a
business as usual. But for the most part, we only have about 700 payment plans today. So I think there's
a lot of pride out there and a lot of people that did come in and pay the rent.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

I think most people have their jobs, have not been financially impacted too hard in our portfolio. And Mike,
what did you say May collections were today?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Were 87%.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

87%. So that's people that just are normally going to pay on time. So if you think that, that was roughly
the same as last month, we had to go work to really get the next 9%, I guess, I would say. And a lot of
those people were the ones that were under financial distress, and we entered in these payment plans.
Mike's talking about in some locations where late fees are not legal anymore. People didn't have the
incentive to pay quickly and some of those would lag. But I think, by and large, our portfolio is of such
a quality that the majority of people are going to pay on their own without a lot of negotiation or being
forced to do it.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Toomey, one I didn't think, I was overly cynical. But what I found is...

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

I got a second question. Then you go ahead.

Unknown Executive

Go ahead.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Currently, on the collections negotiating status, what's intriguing is the ops platform, we've talked about
a number of times. We've got history on every resident for their length of stay, their pattern of pay, their
level of service, any issues they've had. And so Mike and his team are armed with, "Listen, you've been a
great resident, you've been with us 27 months, we understand you have a challenge right now. We want
to work with you." We offer them our payment plan. A lot of them surprisingly, they look at it, and they
just come back and say, "Well, I can pay this much", and we'll put them on terms.

Others, "I don't have it right now, what can I do?" And so he's got a team that are -- and while we say
automation, it still does require people that have skills and data to sit down with people and try to work
out a plan. And I think that's what you're seeing with respect to the April. You're here in May 7. We're
still collecting money from those April rents, whether they're on employment checks, government aid
checks or they're out looking for work. But we want to be accommodating towards our residents to try to
help them get through this and believe that on the back side of this, that goodwill, but also our brand and
our image are maintained. And it's just going to be an individual-by-individual situation. Hard to throw a
blanket over it. We shouldn't throw a blanket over it. We should be compassionate and accommodating.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Okay, okay. Second question, when you think about the type of unemployment that's happened, maybe
it's, I don't know, 20% of the U.S. workforce or something. I don't know if I have that number exactly
right, but how much of that has hit you directly in terms of people who have lost their jobs within your
portfolios? Assuming a lot of this is service-oriented sector, I don't know how big that is in your portfolio,
but I'm just curious about the direct hit for UDR?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Rich. It's hard to tell. If somebody got laid off and didn't come in and ask us for rental assistance,
we're not aware of it. As Mike stated a little bit earlier, in April, we entered into 700 deferral plans with
individual residents, which is a little bit under 2% of our portfolio. So I would tell you, as of April, it wasn't
very high. We're offering the same type of deferral plans for people that are under distress, and in the
month of May, we do ask them to provide some sort of proof of their being financially impacted by the
COVID virus. But right now, it's not that much.

But you don't have a read about what their jobs are, like when they come in the door, you don't have an
understanding of their position.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

We do. We just haven't gone back and looked at exactly where they work or if they got laid off. As we
said, some of the markets we've felt more of it is in the -- in those hospitality markets in Orange County
as well as Orlando. But -- as far as I can tell today, they either still have their jobs or they're able to make
their rent payments.

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

I mean, Rich, to realize, when we're in the application process, you do get a degree of comfort about what
their position is. But our average resident is staying with us 28 months. They've moved on to and been
promoted, changed jobs, we really do not have the mechanism to collect that. And it's often the deficiency
of when people try to report income, well, how much of it's passive income, how much of it of W-2 or
1099, it's data but it's not useful. Their actions is what's useful. Their interaction is what's useful.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Neil Malkin of Capital One.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just one on the operations side, Jerry or Mike. I'm wondering if the COVID pandemic has maybe shined a
light or help expedite move to more technology or over the next-gen platform or the capabilities in such
a way that maybe that changes your operating cost model on a property level? In other words, you might
not need as many people doing tours or back office or maintenance, et cetera. Is that something that
you're kind of seeing come through?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Yes, Neil. I said a little earlier, we've been working on our new platform for about 3 years. A lot of it
was really for that efficiency and to allow our residents to adopt self-service. I think what we've seen
with the last 2 months is our customers were ready for it. They adopted it. And it's going to allow us to
continue moving forward with this. And I also said that we're finding new things through technology to
even enhance that self-service ability where they don't feel it as necessary to show up toward the site. So
yes, I think you're going to see efficiency. I think -- we've been talking for the last year, 1.5 years about
contraction to our controllable margin. This quarter, our controllable margin grew by 60 basis points as
a result of, again, controllable expenses being down 1.1%. So that shows some of that efficiency you're
talking about. I would expect it to continue, but some of it has been accelerated.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Other one for me is, could you just maybe sort of juxtapose the Coastal versus Sun Belt market,
the major things you're seeing in terms of payback periods, moratorium, fees being suspended, anything
along those lines that would give some help to understanding really what the economic and political or
legislative environment looks like between those 2 parts of the country?

18

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Neil, it's Joe. You're right. There has been a little bit of juxtaposition between different regions and states,
while at the federal level, but we've been very, very thankful for all the efforts. It is fair to say that some
of the local and state regulations have made operations more difficult in nature. When you just start
with the shelter-at-home orders, as you look at the sequencing of when those come off over time, about
10% of our markets are actually open at this point in time. Those being here in Denver, Nashville, the
Florida markets, Texas starting to open back up. So you are seeing more of a Sun Belt opening, and
that's where we're really trying to figure out how to work through the operational reopening of the assets.
When you get into some of these other restrictions, such as eviction moratoriums and other things,
the eviction moratoriums generally are lasting longer. When you get into the Coastal markets, again,
California, Seattle, Massachusetts, Oregon, all those are longer. New York just recently changed theirs,
I think last night or this morning to August 20. So you do see longer eviction moratoriums on the coast,
similarly with the payback periods. We've seen most of the payback period restrictions taking place in
California markets, San Fran, L.A., San Diego, Costa Mesa. And then out on the East Coast, DC Proper
has more restrictions on payback period as well. So it is a little bit more coastal in nature at this point in
time. I don't doubt that, that's part of the reason when you hear the commentary from Mike and Jerry on
delinquencies and what we're seeing there. There probably are a few bad actors that are taking advantage
of eviction moratoriums. But if and when they open up, we'll continue to work with them and try to get
payments and be compassionate towards them, but also utilize the law on our side as well and try to get
those collections that are contractually owed to us.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

That's super helpful. Just, I guess, on that question, are you willing to -- someone just said, I believe, kind
of just letting them go, maybe take a loss to get control of the unit back, how do you kind of weigh that
business?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

I think a lot of it depends on how much demand we have at that particular property. If there's significant
demand, we would probably consider it. If there's limited traffic coming in and low demand and high
exposure, we're probably going to hold them to a lease.

Operator

Our next question is coming from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I guess a similar question on geography differences on renewal rates. And are you just keeping them flat
where it's mandated like California and New York? And so -- if so, what percentage of your markets are
you at free market terms versus government-mandated renewals being flat?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

John, it's Mike. So yes, again, we are taking this again property-by-property, market-by-market and
pricing at market. So when we're looking at renewals today, we've already priced out through July, and
we're anywhere from 4% to 4.5%. That being said, we are working with those that are facing a hardship,
and we do have regulatory pressures in a few counties and states. So we'll see where they come in, but
that's what we've been sending out as of now.

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

John, this is Joe. If you look at where we're at in terms of regulatory restrictions, I mentioned in terms
of the rent-stabilized assets that are subject to Costa-Hawkins in California. We do see that in L.A., San
Fran, San Jose, where they've required 0% renewal increases for certain durations of time, depending

19

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

on emergency periods or otherwise. DC Proper, it's through the emergency period plus another 30 days
after that. And then the state of Washington as well have renewals of 0% here for another month or so.
But obviously, caveat that, that could change at any point in time. So when you kind of look through the
portfolio overall, we're probably just around 10% of our rents right now that are subject to flat renewal
increases with the rest being very market and asset-specific, as Mike talked about.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And then looking at your April update, it looks like you signed more new leases this April than last
year, just looking at the application multiplied by closing ratio. Is that just because your portfolio is bigger
or incentives that are being offered? Or can you provide some color on that?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Yes. When you really look at our closing ratio, Mike, why don't you go through the math on closing ratio
because it's -- our supplement doesn't quite reconcile?

Sure. Yes. So we look at qualified traffic as somebody who's either calling us or hitting our website. And
then we really look at visits and applications, and that's how we get to our closing ratio based on visits. So
what we've been seeing over the past few weeks is less people obviously coming to our properties where
we have more of the stay-at-home orders in place. But those that are coming to our properties are more
likely to rent. And so we've seen that go upwards 50% to 60% as of late.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So that ratio is multiplied by visits, not applications or traffic?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Right.

Our next question is coming from Robert Stevenson of Janney.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Joe, what are you going to be accruing for bad debt now in 2020? And what's been your bad debt cost
running you in a typical year like '19?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Rob, so I'll give you a historical, first. Typically, when you exit a month, you've got about 1.5%, 2% of
rents outstanding that you build. And so over that subsequent period of time, leading all the way up into
eviction process, you typically continue to collect. So that's why when you look in our press release, Q1
2020, we had 99.6% of rents collected. So you can see we had about 40 bps that were still outstanding,
waiting to be collected. As we go forward, we're going to be able to assess each individual tenant in each
bucket and try to determine collectability at that time. So I can't speak to how we are going to recognize
revenue and therefore, what the collectability and bad debt is going to be as we move throughout the year
because it's really going to depend on each individual circumstance. So do they have a payment plan in
place? Do they have a good payment history? Have they come to us and spoken about their ability to pay
or that they're waiting for a governmental check that we will then receive? Or have they simply skipped

and they're gone out at this point in time? And all of those have different collectible probabilities. So we're
going to assess that as we move through 2Q and continue to get more information. So hopefully, a we'll
have a better update in July when we get there for you.

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Yes. I would tell you, historically, when you look at our portfolio, we look at net bad debt. So that's
whatever you write-off this month, offset by whatever you've collected from previous write-offs. So when
Joe talks about the delinquency, sometimes it carries over. Sometimes people move out, but they come
back to pay us. But when you really look at that net bad debt as a percentage of gross potential rents, it
typically runs in the 0.1% to 0.3% range. So it's a fairly small number.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then what are you guys thinking is the -- is going to wind up being the sort of lost revenue
chain from the lack of renting the spaces for corporate events, for parking, all the other sort of fees,
probably less application fees, et cetera? What has that sort of all gone up to when you guys think about
that today as to what you've sort of lost thus far?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Sure. I can give you a little bit more color on what we saw for the month of April. And just to go to your
first question on the common areas, that was an initiative that was starting to ramp up for us. It's about
1% potential of our total other income or roughly $1 million over the course of the year. Right now, we
have had to shut that down. But as amenity spaces start to open up, we expect that we can start to gain
some momentum there again. But to late fees, admin fees, ad fees, things like that, they were about 55%
to 60% of our total miss in April. And I'd tell you, in total, fees were off by close to $1 million.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And as we think about operating expenses, are there additional operating expenses that we need to
be thinking about of any material nature to deal with COVID and the challenges with the eviction bans and
all this other sort of stuff that you're going to have to be dealing with throughout the remainder of 2020,
just quantify...

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Rob, this is Jerry. There are some COVID expenses. We had to buy some PP&E, some cleaning materials,
we actually -- we did -- are providing a bonus to our site associates for all of the policy changes they've
had to endure over the last couple of months as well as the next few coming forward. You're going to have
utilities expense go up as more people are staying in their homes. You're going to possibly, hopefully not
have higher insurance claims as people stay in their homes more. You should have a -- you're going to
have a higher level of cleaning cost for common areas as time goes on. Ideally, a lot of those costs are
going to be offset by lower turnover. So when we kind of bundle all of our expenses up together, today, we
don't think it's a material difference from what we originally had guided to.

Our next question is coming from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Just 2 questions, really quick. First, up in Boston, what percent of your portfolio is traditionally occupied by
overseas students?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Up in Boston, I don't think it is very high. We've got some in our 345 Harrison deal. I don't have that
number on top of me at my fingertips, but we can get that back to you after the call, Alex.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Basically, Jerry, if you don't know it off hand, it sounds like it's a pretty small number.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

It's not material.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay, great. Second question is on New York. Have your property manager has been getting a sense of
what people thoughts are for this summer, whether they're going to renew or move out? Just -- I mean,
certainly, we know what the rumbling is here, but obviously, our sample set is going to be different than
your resident sample set.

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Yes. This is Mike. We're still seeing really low turnover in New York right now. And as we've set out
renewals, we haven't seen much of an increase in notices yet. We are seeing it a little bit more on the
corporate side, where we've had some exposure there. But as far as our traditional residents, they're still
sticking in place for the most part.

Operator

Your next question is coming from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates.

Hardik Goel
Zelman & Associates LLC

Joe, I heard you talked about this a little bit on the call, but if you could just rank what you see or what
you perceive are going to be the best uses of UDR's capital in the coming year? You mentioned Developer
Capital Program is still being very attractive. If you can highlight how you guys are thinking through that,
that'd be really helpful?

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, of course. So I think at this point in time, we talked about being patient. We're still trying to look
for opportunities because we do believe we have capacity, given the strength of the balance sheet. But
it's tough to really rank them, given the dearth of opportunities that are out there. You've seen the
transaction market really shut down at this point in time. Development, obviously, in terms of starts is
coming off, which impacts land opportunities, impacts DCP opportunities. So the only opportunity we have
to really look at day in and day out is our stock price. And so trying to compare near-term returns, cash
accretion and long IRRs, it's pretty difficult in this environment. So it's tough to commit to any one class of
assets other than to say that we'll continue to pivot where we can to get the best risk-adjusted return.

Hardik Goel
Zelman & Associates LLC

And just as a quick follow-up. Any deals you did that don't look as good right now? I'm not saying that
you're going to lose money on them, but the returns are lower than you would have thought?

UDR, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Joseph D. Fisher
Senior VP & CFO

I mean, obviously, we were incredibly active on the acquisition front using equity last year. And while it's
possible the near-term return might be lower, given the rental rate environment that we're in today. The
reality is that we used a source of capital that was priced attractively. We locked in that cost of capital,
put it to work in new assets to add typically 5% to 10% upside due to the operational initiatives combined
with the platform. So I think that opportunity still exists. The current environment does not take away
from those opportunities that we saw to expand margin, to expand NOI yields by 5% to 10%. The near-
term market rent growth, yes, that may have come off, but it came off for our entire portfolio. So the fact
that we utilized cost of capital match funded it -- locked in the accretion, I don't think we have any sense
of regret other than probably wish we would have done a little bit more.

Operator

Our last question is coming from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So I guess my first question is a bit of a twist or follow-up to an earlier question. You guys are in a unique
position relative to your peers that have reported thus far, to give a broader perspective by market, price
point, product type. So that gives you, I guess, a unique perspective to give color on the debate over
higher-priced urban coastal apartments with greater COVID movement restrictions, but offset by a greater
proportion of white-collar workers with greater work-from-home flexibility versus the Sun Belt, which has
less COVID cases, fewer restrictions, but lower incomes and less flexibility to work from home. So I guess,
I'm curious, on what your early read is here, urban coastal high-rise versus Sun Belt garden, lower price
point, which is the 2 -- what have you seen recently that informs you? But more importantly, what are you
thinking of over the next several quarters, which of these 2 groups can potentially outperform and why?

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

Yes, this is Jerry, Haendel. Probably throw it to Mike and potentially Timmy on more of a long term. I
would tell you, it's too early, as Tom said earlier, to make a real call on urban versus suburban. I can tell
you right now, when we look at it, and Mike referred to this earlier, as we look at the delta between A and
B and pricing power in April, whether it was on the renewal side or the new lease side, they're almost flat.
It's Really Not much of a differential. I think you pegged it right, our Sun Belt in some of our B properties
had residents that were probably at a higher risk of being in the service sector and could have lost their
jobs. I think those -- and -- but I would say this traffic is probably picking up in those locations more
rapidly because the cities are opening up. The urban core markets, traffic is slower as stay-at-home is still
widely in effect. I would tell you, we also had some corporate exposure in a few of those markets that we
felt some impact, but it wasn't material, but that's where the impact was. It was in those San Francisco,
Boston, New York City locations. But I would tell you right now, when I look at how it all works out,
whether you're talking; A, urban; B, suburban; they've all been impacted in some way, but it's in different
ways. Traffic is perking up more rapidly in suburbia. But right now, we're just playing them property-by-
property. They all have a little bit of a different story. I think Mike and his team are dealing with it well.
Tom, I don't know if he would add anything to what he said earlier about the long-term aspects of these.
And again, like I said, it's just too early to tell what this means for future quarters. It depends on when do
cities lift stay-at-home mandates, when do employers expect people both to come back to work, but also
when do they start rehiring for some of those jobs that have been laid off. And then when do consumers
want to get back out there and start buying things. So I think it's depending on a lot. It's just too early to
make a call. Anything you want to add, Tom?

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

No. I think you got it right. I mean, you're just right in the middle of the storm. And as the cities open
up, people start getting out, their patterns are going to start gravitating back to where they were before

with the constraints. The constraints can go away with immediacy testing, different transportation, a
vaccine, if those are 6 months or a year off, are people going to make a decision and live with 6 months
of discomfort until a long-term cure is on horizon. Will they make a decision in that window of time that
impacts them for years to come, or will they hunker down and deal with the inconveniences and then
when they're lifted, come back to normal. So it's just too early to overlay that rewinding of the economy
onto a portfolio strategy and draw a conclusion.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. And maybe you guys could talk a little bit about the virtual tours, you
mentioned earlier in the call, being a handy tool here, obviously, in a post-COVID world for your leasing
efforts. Can you share perhaps what percentage of your tours conducted maybe in the month of April
or during some time frame have been conducted virtually versus conventional? And then maybe some
comment on the differential in conversion rates between these virtual and the more traditional in-person
leases? And on top of that, are you finding that you need to offer any incremental incentives as part of
these virtual leases as well?

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

Sure. Haendel, this is Mike. And this back to the whole property market, specifically, again, where we have
places where we just can't give a guided tour and in some cases, can't even offer self-guided tours. Virtual
tours are 100% of our traffic right now coming through the property. And in other cases, where we are
starting to open up more, we're still doing the self-guided tours, and we have guided tours where we can.
But I would say over the last week or 2, as we looked at this technology, and we're utilizing the Zoom tour,
that's started to pick up more, and we're utilizing that as a very good tool to help us close.

Jerry A. Davis
President & COO

And I would add, I don't believe, Mike can correct me if we've added, we've offered any additional
incentive for virtual tours.

Michael D. Lacy
Senior Vice President of Property Operations

No. That's correct.

Operator

There are no further questions in queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to Chairman and CEO, Mr.
Toomey for closing comments.

Thomas W. Toomey
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, operator. And first, let me start with, thanks to all of you for your time and interest in UDR.
And certainly, we here hope that you are and your families are safe and healthy. Again, thanks to the team
in the field, in Denver, very proud of what you've accomplished so far, and I can't say that enough. Very,
very proud of you.

On the business front, I'm reminded that America is extremely resilient, that you see the power of
solutions come through in a variety of different ways. Grateful for that, but I do believe America is an
extremely resilient society, and we will get through this. We have a business that is, frankly, a necessity.
And we take that responsibility very seriously and at the same time, recognize it is a core of our business,
and people will continue to rent, and we're grateful for that.

Also very grateful to our experienced leadership team. We've been through different crises, different
challenges, and they've risen to the challenge. On our teams in the field, I know you're focused, you've

got the tools, the resources. We've discussed already that we have an abbreviated leasing season. But I
am confident that they will perform well during this short leasing season that's going to be in front of us.

Lastly, grateful that we have a diversified portfolio, a strategy that gives us optionality and a platform to
build on. And we look forward to showing you more of this in the future and demonstrating again the right
strategic decisions we've made and how they're going to build for our future. And with many of you, we'll
see you at NAREIT. Look forward to that and certainly hope that you are safe and well in the interim, and
please take care.
