Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Allegion Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Vice President of Investor Relations and
Treasury. Please go ahead.

Tom Martineau
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for Allegion's Third
Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.

Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to
in today's call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived
on our website.

Please go to Slides #2 and 3. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered
forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law.

Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual
results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these
forward-looking statements. Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures.
Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.

Dave and Patrick will now discuss our third quarter 2020 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session.
[Operator Instructions]

Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start by walking through the third
quarter financial summary. Revenue for the third quarter was $728.4 million, a decrease of 2.7% or 3.4%
organically, which shows sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3. The organic revenue decrease was
driven by continued economic challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact of divestitures of our
business in Colombia and Turkey. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment.

Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points in the third quarter. I'm extremely proud of the
resiliency shown by the Allegion team. We executed extremely well and the cost management actions
taken during the year helped mitigate the deleverage from volume declines. Positive price and muted
inflation also helped deliver the operating margin increase. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.67 increased
$0.20 or approximately 14% versus the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by favorable other
income, tax rate and share count offset the lower operating income.

Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $256.1 million, an increase of just over $26 million versus
the prior year. Improvement in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures more than offset the
lower net earnings.

Please go to Slide 5. Access has been part of our company's heritage for more than 100 years, and our
vision of seamless access in a safer world are providing a sound foundation for our future. In the realities
of a post-COVID world, customers have new concerns and new needs for healthy environments. The

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

importance of making home, work and institutions safer has never been so important to our customers,
and the needs for touchless access is not going away.

Our business is disciplined and focused, prioritizing investments in our seamless access strategy. As a
result, Allegion continues to deliver leadership and innovation across the portfolio.

Our Schlage brand is a 100-year-old powerhouse that spans the globe. In the building channel, our mix of
Schlage mechanical and electronic solutions continue to help us win projects, including a new development
community in Florida with over 3,000 homes.

Allegion is further advancing seamless access for builders with electronic solutions that provide contactless
home showings and the Schlage Encode Smart Deadbolt continues to gain momentum in both the
residential, new construction and retail markets.

On university campuses, among the first schools to adopt Schlage security solutions for Apple Wallet
are the University of Tennessee, University of Vermont and the University of San Francisco. Allegion now
supports contactless student IDs across Apple Wallet, Android and Google Pay.

For commercial and institutional markets, we have a full suite of mobile-enabled Schlage locks and
readers. In a post-COVID environment, mobile technology, contactless hardware and readers in
combination with wave-to-open actuators now extend our touchless options for interior and perimeter
security.

Seamless Access also gained ground outside the Americas in Q3. SimonsVoss is celebrating its 25th year
as an electronic access innovator and was recently recognized in Germany as the #1 electronic locking
system manufacturer.

In Australia, we just delivered the Gainsborough Freestyle Electronic Trilock for single family and short-
term rentals, giving the owner full control of access from a mobile app. And in Australia and New Zealand,
we introduced the Schlage Omnia fire-rated smart lock for multifamily and office settings.

In the quarter, we booked over 4 million in orders to support and provide seamless access solutions to a
global leader in social media to be delivered in '21. Our investments in seamless access are bolstered by
global accelerators.

Allegion's partner of choice and open credentials strategy is an important accelerator. More than 45
physical access control software providers already integrate with Schlage electronic locks and devices.
Many of them are moving to integrate to our mobile credential ecosystem as well.

Our global accelerators include e-commerce, touchless access and increased focus on visitor management
and occupancy monitoring. Seamless access is providing to be a strong foundation for our future.

Patrick will now talk you -- walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back later to discuss our 2020
outlook and wrap up.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #6.
This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of
2019, reported earnings per share was $1.40, adjusting $0.07 for the prior year restructuring expenses,
integration costs related to acquisitions and debt refinancing costs. The 2019 adjusted earnings per share
was $1.47.

Favorable other income and interest expense increased earnings per share by $0.15. The increase was
driven by an approximately $14 million noncash currency translation gain related to the liquidation of a
legal entity in our EMEA region. This benefit would not be expected to recur in 2021.

Favorable year-over-year tax rate and share count combined to provide another positive $0.08 per share
impact. Operational results decreased earnings per share by $0.03, driven by volume deleverage that

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

was nearly offset by favorable price and productivity exceeding inflationary impacts as well as favorable
currency. This results in adjusted third quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.67, an increase of $0.20 or
approximately 14% compared to the prior year.

Lastly, we have a $0.09 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring and impairment costs.
After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the third quarter 2020 reported earnings per share of
$1.58.

Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the third quarter.
I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we
experienced a 3.4% organic revenue decline in the third quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic continue to
have an impact on the top line number, although we did realize the benefit of delayed projects from the
prior quarter.

As shown in the trending chart, revenues rebounded nicely, but were short of the very strong quarterly
results in the prior year. Despite the difficult and uncertain times we are operating in, the overall business
performed very well, particularly in the supply chain and meeting customer requirements. It is also
important to note that price remained solid in the quarter, which slightly offset the volume pressure.
Currency also provided a tailwind to total growth and more than offset the impact of the divestiture of our
businesses in Colombia and Turkey.

Please go to Slide #8. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $539.1 million, down 5.1%
on a reported basis and down 4.6% organically. The decline was driven by volume challenges on the
nonresidential business due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was partially offset by good price realization
and strength in the residential business. The nonresidential business was down low double digits.

Conversely, residential bounced back nicely and grew at a low double-digit rate. The Americas electronics
revenue declined in the mid single-digit range as discretionary commercial projects are delayed. We see
electronics and touchless solutions continuing to be a long-term growth drivers and expect electronics
accelerated growth to resume when market conditions normalize.

Americas adjusted operating income of $166.6 million decreased 5.1% versus the prior year period, and
adjusted operating margin for the quarter was flat. Discretionary cost actions, restructuring benefits and
material deflation mitigated the impacts of volume deleverage and unfavorable mix.

Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $148.4 million, up 7.7% and up
2.9% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by strength in the Global Portable Security and
SimonsVoss businesses as well as solid price realization. Favorable currency impacts contributed to the
total revenue growth and was slightly offset by the impact of the divestiture in the business in Turkey.

EMEA adjusted operating income of $17.1 million increased 42.5% versus the prior year period. Adjusted
operating margin for the quarter increased by 280 basis points. The margin increase was driven primarily
by price and productivity exceeding inflation.

Productivity was bolstered by benefits from lower operating costs from the restructuring actions taken
earlier in the year and discretionary and variable cost reductions.

Please go to Slide #10. Third quarter revenues for Asia Pacific region were $40.9 million, down 4.2%
versus the prior year with an organic revenue decline of 6.8%. The decline was driven by continued
COVID-19-related impacts and weakness in Korea.

Our Australia business performed quite well despite the ongoing pressure in Australian end markets.
Currency tailwinds offset some of the organic revenue decline.

Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $3.2 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, with
adjusted operating margins down 250 basis points versus the prior year period.

Of note, the prior year operating income includes a $1.1 million favorable onetime item related to the
recovery of previously remitted nonincome taxes. This had a 260 basis point favorable impact on Asia
Pacific margins in Q3 of 2019. Excluding that, margins were essentially flat year-over-year, with the

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

volume deleverage and unfavorable mix being offset by favorable price and productivity exceeding
inflation.

Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2020 came in at $256.1
million, which is an increase of just over $26 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was
driven by improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures, which more than offset
lower net earnings.

Our strong cash flow generation has been an asset to the company. This was evident in the third quarter
and will continue to serve us well during the current market environment. Looking at the chart to the
right, it shows working capital as a percentage of revenues decreased based on a 4-point quarter average.
This was driven by reduced working capital needs from the lower volume as well as strong collections
performance.

The business continues to generate strong cash flow, and we remain committed to an effective and
efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize working capital and
drive effective cash flow conversion.

Please go to Slide #12. Our financial and liquidity position remains extremely solid. Our net debt-to-
EBITDA ratio is 1.6 based on the last 12 months' performance. Our debt covenants are well within the
required limits, and we have no near-term debt maturities. Our $500 million credit facility remains
untapped.

Our quarterly dividend in 2020 increased 18.5% through the third quarter. This is the sixth consecutive
year of annual increases. In addition, with the strong operational execution and cash generation, the
increased cash position since the beginning of the year and better visibility into business conditions, we
have resumed share repurchases under our previously authorized $800 million program.

As you have heard us say numerous times, we put our excess cash to use as part of our commitment to a
flexible and balanced capital allocation strategy.

I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2020 outlook.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #13. As you know, we were one of the handful of companies who
provided an outlook following Q2. With another quarter behind us and a bit more clarity, we are updating
our outlook for 2020.

In the Americas, we expect to see continued pressure on the nonresidential business as discretionary
spending in commercial markets remain tough due to the people continuing to work from home.

In institutional markets, the projects already started will continue to finish. The rate of completion may be
slowed as restrictions for the number of people on job sites remain in place and supply chain issues to the
construction sites.

Residential markets are expected to remain strong in all channels we serve: big box, retail, e-commerce
and new construction. With these expectations, we are improving the organic revenue outlook in the
Americas to be down 5.5% to 6% for the full year. We are projecting Americas total revenue decline to be
6% to 6.5%, with a slight impact from the divestiture of the business in Colombia.

In Europe, we saw sequential improvement in Q3, and we expect Q4 to be better than the year-to-date
performance we have experienced. For the region, we now project organic revenue to be down 6.5% to
7.5%. Total revenue includes currency tailwinds in the latter part of the year as well as the impacts from
the divestiture of the businesses in Turkey and is projected to be down 4.5% to 5.5% for the full year.

In Asia Pacific, markets were weak before COVID-19, especially in Australia. We expect that along with the
weakness we're experiencing in Korea to continue. With this backdrop, we expect 2020 organic revenue

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

decline of 12% to 13% and 2020 total revenue to be down 12.5% to 13.5%, with a slight impact from
currency.

We are projecting total inorganic revenue for the company to be down 6% to 6.5%. We are raising our
outlook for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $4.75 to $4.80. Although net investments are
assumed to be relatively small in the revised outlook, we remain committed to investing in innovation that
supports our seamless access strategy. This outlook reflects the reprioritization of investment to support
the expected future electronics growth.

Our revised outlook assumes a full year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 13% as well as
outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 93 million. The outlook additionally includes
approximately $1.30 to $1.35 per share impact from impairment and restructuring charge during the year,
most of which have already occurred. As a result, reported EPS is estimated at $3.40 to $3.50. Finally, our
revised available cash flow outlook for 2020 has increased and is now projected to be in the $400 million
to $420 million range.

Please go to Slide 14. Allegion has strong business fundamentals and a proven ability to execute and
adapt to a changing and uncertain market conditions. We have managed the business extremely well to
mitigate the impacts of the ongoing pandemic. We remain ready to serve our customers and meet their
needs for touchless access and healthy environments with our market-leading brands.

We will provide an official outlook for 2021 during our Q4 full year call early next year. But as we think
about the remainder of the year and begin to look at 2021, some key observations that we see are: as
previously expected, commercial and institutional markets will continue to be soft in Q4 and in the first
half of 2021 with a snapback in repair, retrofit and small projects beginning in the second half of next year.

U.S. state and local bond issues continue to be moved ahead and supported by local communities.
Residential end markets are expected to remain strong for the long-term as an undersupply of single-
family homes is corrected. We will continue to manage our cost base to help aggressively mitigate any
volume reductions. Seamless access, software and electronics will drive growth and continue to be among
our top investment priorities. They are our future. Strong cash flow generation will remain a focus with
capital deployment to enhance shareholder returns.

Going forward, Allegion will be leaner and more focused as we navigate the coming months and emerge
from the pandemic. We have implemented restructuring actions during the year that have addressed the
cost base in order to rightsize the business. We will continue to evaluate business going forward and make
necessary changes. Our execution and commitment to driving solid results will remain high.
In closing, Allegion's future is bright. We thank you, and we'll now take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris Snyder of UBS.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Could you just maybe unpack the Q4 guidance a little bit? Just I guess, specifically as it relates to the resi
and the nonresi piece in the Americas?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So we don't provide specific guidance by quarter. You can obviously back into that relative to our full year
guide. I would say, basis of our Q3 performance strong, both in terms of top line and operating income
margin performance relative to the backdrop of what's going on around the globe, I would say you can
kind of see similar type of patterns in terms of both the nonresidential and residential businesses in terms
of what you saw in Q3. But we'll continue to manage the cost to help mitigate any shortfall relative to the
nonresidential business and the margin impact. We do have a mix impact that's going on here relative to
growth in residential and softness in nonresidential business.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Appreciate that. And then maybe just following up on the resi piece. And I certainly understand your
comments on the resi new construction cycle picking up, and we've had low household formations for a
long time now. So certainly, see that view. But I guess, specifically, as it relates to maybe the restocking
cycle, I know there was the Q2 supply chain disruption. Like has that restocking cycle fully been realized
at this point? Maybe what's kind of like the runway there that you see growth just on that end?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would say, as we look at the res segment and the pause that was taken by all suppliers in Q2, we're at
record backlogs and normalizing that will take certainly into early Q2.

Operator

The next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Nice quarter.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

So first off, Americas electronics revenue down mid-single digits is much improved, you gave some
remarks that the trend of touchless access is really happening. Do you expect this business to turn
positive in the fourth quarter? And could electronics provide some offset to weaker underlying commercial
trends in 2021? Or is that a bit of a reach at this point?

David D. Petratis

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Chairman, CEO & President

Electronics will be positive in Q4. As you look at the year, our electronics, especially electronics mirrors our
res and commercial performance, extremely strong -- electronics res extremely strong; somewhat muted
in commercial and institutional. Two reasons for that. The strength in residential electronics is driven
by supply chain strength and an extremely strong position in the portfolio of our products. The Schlage
Encode, the Schlage Connect, our KPL locks are some of the best products on the market.

So where was the growth in the quarter? In Q3, we had a supplier affected by COVID, and we lost a
couple of weeks with that. The demand did not stop, but it affected our ability. And if you normalize that
through the balance of the year, our growth in electronics led by res continues. So feel good about that.

Ryan James Merkel
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

That's super helpful. And then I want to follow up on the 4Q guide, and maybe ask it a little differently. It
seems to imply Americas revenue down mid-single digits year-over-year with flattish margins just like this
quarter. So if I have that right, why is there not more improvement in the Americas business in 4Q?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I would characterize it this way. Entering into Q3, we had stronger backlogs, particularly in the
nonresidential business, some of the projects were delayed and the catch-up and that type of thing. And
so we were able to maybe operate more efficiently from a manufacturing perspective that helped the
margin profile in the business. Two would be in Q4 maybe a stronger negative mix component relative
to the residential-nonresidential sales in the quarter as well as within the channel and product segments
within the nonresidential business.

So there's a lot of things going on there. But quite frankly, we will, as I said earlier, continue to manage
the margin well. I was very happy with the progress we made relative to some of the mitigation on the
cost side, and you saw that with strong overall margin improvement relative to the prior year.

Operator

The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Dave, just coming back first to some of your comments on the channel replenishment that's necessary
in res. And I appreciate that kind of side point on the -- on maybe some of the interruptions on the
electronics side that kept fulfillment maybe capped there. Would you mind quantifying how big of a
replenishment still needs to happen?

If I remember your comments last time, it was kind of through 1Q, now it sounds like early 2Q, so maybe
a bit of a push out there. But how many weeks of inventory or points of demand, however, you want to
put it, does the channel need to kind of get back to normal levels on the res side?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So Josh, I would sort it out in my mind is, we leave Q3 with record residential backlog, number one. As
I think about bringing that backlog down to normal, it pushes us into Q2. It's not inhibited by our ability
for throughput, just with a small disruption. We have had -- we have expanded capacity of our residential
capability significantly.

Demand is good. We've done a good job picking up builders, expanding space at big box. E-commerce
remains extremely red hot, and I believe it's our ability to keep our customers in product that has built
that backlog, I would say, gaining share and a strong suite of electronics that has enhanced our position.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

I'd add one other comment. Allegion's ability to flex that supply chain is impressive of anything that I've
seen in my 40 years of manufacturing.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Appreciate that color. And then just a follow-up. Dave, I appreciate that even going back to April
that you've been cognizant that the current environment probably doesn't support an awesome 2021 for
nonres, I think that's now much more apparent to a broader range of folks. If I kind of take some of your
comments as a time series starting from the first quarter earnings, it doesn't really sound like much has
changed in the outlook as you guys have seen more data come through and have gotten closer to next
year, if anything, some of the bond issuance commentary sounds a bit more supportive than what we
would have known back then. Is that reading it right? I mean I guess how do you feel versus some of
those early observations when we were in the first half of the year, and this is all still fresh?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So barring a rupture, I believe we're lifting off the bottom. I was extremely encouraged by the ABI lift
from 40 to 47. Our spec levels are just slightly lighter than last year. So I think that's a net positive, but I
have also got to be cognizant in our key markets, commercial and institutional, especially institutional, the
priority is around keeping people safe, keeping people socially distance, keeping people capacities properly
managed. So in my mind, they are small projects, break fix, preventative maintenance that gets delay.
And I believe as COVID winds down in Q2, we're going to see a snapback in those types of projects and
things will move back towards normal as we get to '22.

Operator

The next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Dave, just to -- hate to harp on the 4Q commentary, but I just want to make sure I understand it,
particularly in Americas. So it sounds like on the residential side of things, things are very strong, right?
Your backlog is at record levels. electronics is supposed to be up in the fourth quarter. So the implied step
down then in 4Q, is that just nonres is going to get worse in 4Q versus 3Q? And maybe just any color
intra-quarter on how trends played out in nonres would be helpful?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would say, again, back to Patrick's comments, the slowdown, in some cases shutdown in Q2, set us
up for a nice backlog to saw through in Q3. We did a good job in that. Primarily commercial institutional
demand has softened, and we see that in Q4. That's how I describe it from a demand standpoint.

As you look at the margin profile in that, the res demand is extremely strong, but it creates a mix issue.
Our commercial institutional is significantly more profitable, and those factors work through the fourth
quarter.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. I appreciate the clarification. And then I guess just the follow-on question, thinking about
this a little bit longer term. Ahead of the pandemic, you guys were pretty front-footed in discussing some
of the -- not just like supply constraints, but really labor constraints in some of these projects moving to
completion.

I guess, as you think about the institutional or nonres markets and what you have in your backlog, like
how much more visibility do you have, I guess, into 2021? And how much more backlog do you have

11

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

to complete? I'm just trying to understand like how much we've worked through versus what's left to
complete before we kind of head into 2021?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So as I think of 2021, I talked about spec writing. We're looking at incoming order demand, especially
project related and the backlog. Incoming project quotes, again, muted. Our backlog, if you look at it
over 36 months is in the low end of the range. It's not unhealthy, but we would typically go into a softer
backlog at this time of year. But again, it's on the low range. Then you've got to get your crystal ball
out and my crystal ball, the economics that we continue to look at suggest softness, and that's what we
suggest.

The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just moving away from the top line for a second. Very good productivity performance in the
quarter, with the margins up year-on-year, you booked some more restructuring charges. So maybe as we
look at 2021, is there any way that you could describe the sort of carryover fixed cost savings into next
year that should support margins? And any sense around perhaps temporary costs that might flow back
into the P&L? Really just trying to get a sense of any major moving parts to margins next year aside from
volumes?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, Julian, I would characterize it this way. You may recall in the last quarter conference call, we kind of
outlined what we were doing this year. This $80 million kind of cost reduction takeout for 2020 and we
characterized that as kind of 3 components, which was the discretionary, variable, structural, permanent
type of cost savings. And if you look at those specifically on the permanent structural cost savings, to
answer your question, we've been at it pretty solidly, I'd say, over the last couple of quarters.

We're now hitting, I'd say, a full stride in terms of the cost takeout associated with that. We've identified
some additional measures as well that will help us into 2021. So there's carryover benefit, particularly in
the first half of 2021 that will help mitigate some of these variable components that boomerang back next
year.

So I'd look at those, maybe we're a little upside down if you kind of look at those 2 independently and
sum them up. We will continue to evaluate our cost structure going forward and adjust as necessary basis
of future demand. So we're always looking at that. However, we will continue to invest in the business,
that's a core part of our strategy, particularly on the seamless access and growth opportunities associated
with that to really position us well on the growth prospects associated with that going forward as we exit
COVID-19.

So there's going to be some pressure there relative to those components. And then you're going to have,
unfortunately, unfavorable mix associated with strength in residential, better-than-anticipated, and some
continued softness associated with the nonresidential markets.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Very helpful. And maybe my follow-up would be also away from the top line, just on the balance sheet. I
think in the prepared remarks, around cash usage, you'd mentioned that the buyback may be resuming.
So maybe just help us understand the appetite for share buybacks? How quickly you want to get
underway on that? And how attractive M&A opportunities are today?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

So first, on the M&A, I would say, core part of our strategy to continue to evaluate opportunities that are
core in our business, expanding product or market presence important, continue to evaluate where we can
look at assets that help us from a technology perspective, particularly around this whole connectivity and
seamless access and participating in that growth. So we're active looking at various opportunities.

I would say there's fewer assets on the market, specific and core to our business. And so kind of if you
assume that there's limited M&A activity, we would pivot more towards shareholder distribution, which we
-- I just want to clarify, we are in the market and will be in Q4 to help continue to put cash to use for the
benefit of our shareholders and enhanced shareholder returns. We think it's a good investment relative to
where we trade today, and so we'll continue to be active in the market.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would add, Julian, from an M&A position, we can go where we need to go. We've got the dry powder and
firepower. I think it's an enviable position, leaning harder towards electronics, software that accelerate and
add capabilities to our value proposition.

The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I just want to dive in a little bit in institutional markets, specifically, education and health care. If I look
at the bond issuance year-to-date, I think as of September, education bond issuance was up almost 40%,
and health care, I think, was down 2%, effectively flat. So within these dynamics, so in education, the
pushback we're getting is that, okay, so we are going to have new bond issuance in November. My guess,
people will vote for it.

But how -- what are you hearing from your customers on the education side about the fact is that, I
guess, some people they are getting tuition, but maybe they are not getting rents for the dorm rooms. So
how much pressure is education sector under?

And then for health care, right, the issue there is elective surgeries, which are coming back. But how are
the conversations going with the health care providers in terms of whether they get back to normal? So
that's sort of part one. Education and health care, what are you seeing in those 2 verticals into next year?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I've had more dialogue on the educational side. And I'd say, generally optimistic and in line with the
Bank of America Research. As I've had dialogues with a few university presidents, their capital projects
continue to move forward and have funding at the state levels or the private level, depending on the
institution.

I think there's something to recognize within that, though, Andrew, is the small projects, the break fix, the
preventative maintenance, those facility teams are inundated by just the problems of the day in dealing
with students at all levels. So I tend to be net positive. And in that college campus, K through 12, Allegion
will get more than its fair share of the business.

On the hospital side, I see the opportunity. The hospital system has been severely tested, and investment
will go back into that, but it will be second half of '21 and into '22.

And just a follow-up question. Can you just give us any color on what's happening with your market share
in discretionary retrofit market? I know it's been sort of a couple of years ago, been a big initiative. You
guys have done very well. I believe you continue to do well. But any color on what's happening there?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

We continue to execute our ground game in terms of the discretionary, working with our wholesale
partners. A large partner just shifted completely to Allegion opening price point, mid-price point project.
So it continues to be a net positive.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

They'll continue to gain market share slowly and steadily?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. And I would say the command of our supply chain helps us there. When things are locked up because
of challenges in other parts of the world, again, you've heard me say, Andrew, our supply chain is simpler,
and it gives us opportunities to have dialogues. We can keep the flow of product going.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Fantastic. And congratulations on a well-executed quarter.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Andrew.

The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Nice job on the margins. Maybe just -- really the only question I have is just on pricing. As you kind of
look at '21, maybe some choppiness in nonres continuing into next year. Any change in kind of how you
guys think about pricing in kind of the out year? And I'm really just asking because we are starting to see
a little bit of incremental kind of raw material inflation that's kind of popping up here. So any just kind of
commentary on how we should think about price?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

So I would characterize it as solid performance in Q3 and year-to-date 2020. We will continue to push and
remain competitive in the market. You're correct, there's going to be some inflationary pressure associated
with input costs on commodities, things like steel and aluminum. We'll continue to push the price dynamic
to the extent we can and, again, remain competitive. But I would think about it as we're 1%, maybe a
little bit lower realized kind of on a go-forward basis.

ALLEGION PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Just wanted to go back to the kind of the language you used around a snapback in the repair, retrofit
and small projects activity you're looking at or anticipating next year. You talked about that large
mobile project, which will hit next year, but I'm curious today if you're seeing your customers make
those touchless upgrades in the back half of this year? Or if it's still more of a conversation with them
anticipating doing more of the projects next year?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

We can identify projects and early adopters, but the momentum of those projects will pick up once we get
on the other side of COVID. Unless there's a burning need -- when you go in and increase or improve your
infrastructure to touchless, waveless connected, it's a bigger project than somebody wants to take on in
the middle of a firefight.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. No, that makes sense. And then just thinking about earlier when you were talking about the
seamless opportunity, you did use the term, thinking about the readers. As I kind of have historically
thought about Allegion's position in that product, it was smaller relative to one of your competitors, but
how important is having the reader as part of the solution as these customers shift into that seamless
world? Is that some place where you need to get bigger? Or just trying to understand how that works.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So when you think about readers, kind of think about light switches, they're ubiquitous, they're in every
room. Is one light switch differentiate another? And the answer is no. It's important in the sequence, but
what we're really after is to eliminate the card and move that to your edge device, your cell phone. That
is going to happen. That's the opportunity that we're going to exploit, which complements the touchless
environment, it complements higher security levels because you cannot only have one level but even triple
levels of authentication. And you don't ever -- you get immediate, what we call, the arbitrator of access.
With a click of a button access is granted or denied, eliminating the needs of cards, that's our opportunity.

The next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Good quarter, by the way. Two questions for me. First one is, Dave, can you talk about the momentum
or the revenue growth that you're seeing in products that are driving in this post-COVID world with your
touchless, seamless, you talked about contactless, Apple iPhones, et cetera. Now these look like strong
renovation opportunity, so why would you not see continued tailwinds into first half of next year versus
your commentary for a snapback only in second half? And also, can you touch upon how accretive these
tech-heavy products and software is to your margins? And I have a follow-up.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I think you have to put yourself in the middle of a college campus, a hospital, and the prioritization of
their day and their project work in a COVID reality. As I talk to school administrators, it's not -- those
preventative -- small preventative maintenance items, small project, unless it's severely broken, it's
just not part of the priority list. It's about people flow. It's about cleaning surfaces. So when you're in a
firefight, and you would be at the University of Florida today, that projects -- those small projects don't hit
the -- even the radar screen. So that's what I see in terms of this moving into the second half.

Your follow-up or your second question? Did you hear it, Patrick?

So Deepa, on the margin profile, the electronics would be similar type of margin is our traditional
mechanical, but a higher selling price and therefore, more EBITDA. So to the extent we can continue to
push electronics, which we are and we will. That benefits us from an earnings growth perspective.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And my follow-up, Patrick, is more on the residential electronics locks performance. As I mentioned
yesterday, their smart lock business in residential grew high double-digit percent in Q3. Did you see a
similar kind of strength?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Deepa, I would say this, if we didn't have the supply disruption from a supplier, we would have had one of
the strongest residential quarters in the company's history.

The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.

Colton W. West
Longbow Research LLC

It's Colton on for David. Congrats on a good quarter.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you.

Colton W. West
Longbow Research LLC

I guess, can you start by walking us through how the residential point-of-sale growth played out in the
quarter, and any new trends you're seeing there?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would say, impressive strength in the e-commerce would indicate share gains. If we look at point of sale,
we continue to gain momentum and strength, and it's really across all sectors. I don't think the -- when
people are spending more time in their homes, they're thinking about how do I upgrade and improve my
space. I think across DIY, you see that extremely strong trend, one.

I think, two, the rise in demand for single-family home, whether existing or new, we're benefiting from
that. Remember, Allegion tends to be the replacement lock of choice and then we have a suite of electronic
products that may be the best in the industry. And then our supply chain, we have product available, have
been able to provide it to all of those channels. In some cases, our specials are -- lead times are extended
because of the increase in demand, but I think several factors there that are really showing off some res
performance.

I'd add one more, too, and I commented on it. Our ability to take our demand up is as good as I've seen
in 40 years of manufacturing.

That's great. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned some supplier headwinds in the
third quarter related to electronics. Can you give us an update on where your supply chain stands today
for the segment? And if there are any risks that could limit growth in the near term?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

With the exception of that 1 supplier, no disruptions. That doesn't mean the supply chains are not under
pressure, but we tend to produce in region, and that certainly helps us just spend time on the boat. But
it's one of the proud points of Allegion. We've been working on that supply chain even under Ingersoll
Rand. The simplicity of it, the leanness of it, some of the vertical integration that we did over the last few
years as we invest in Allegion has really come back to pay dividends.

The next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Can you break out EMEA and Asia Pacific, just a little bit in terms of -- granted, they're small, but the fact
is that, at some point, EMEA has to grow again. Where -- let's call it vertically and geographically, what
was stronger and what was weaker in EMEA?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I think a very good quarter in EMEA, number one. Number two is strengthen our SimonsVoss franchise,
which will be SimonsVoss Interflex. Our leader there, Bernhard Sommer, really put his foot on the pedal
as we went into the pandemic, had some supply chain strengths that winning in allowed him to capture
projects. I also thought our Interflex business did extremely well, which is access, software, control, time
and attendance. That business under some pressure because of -- they do a very good job of servicing
large manufacturers, especially the auto, aerospace industry, executed well. And I think the numbers
suggest that.

The other one that's hidden, Jeff, is our, what we call, Global Portable Security, excellent execution and
leadership by John Stanley. Think about it, you can't walk into a bike shop today and find a bike, and that
demand has come right into our wheelhouse. We also have been investing in connected technologies that
help the location of your bike platform, won some nice business because of that connected capability in
the GPS business. That would be my comments in -- for the Europe business.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And in the U.S. now that, and I think you eluded to, and you used the word NFC, but I'm
assuming that NFC becomes a key part of the touchless, wireless, 3 levels of authority technology. Are
there -- are you going to be using multiple technologies in terms of getting those projects going? And will
it be mainly around NFC? Or will you be adding various types of Bluetooth to it?

I mean I know I'm getting on in the weeds here, but question -- the question really involves, how flexible
are you going to be in terms of those technologies? And what is -- what are people asking for? Or what
are people negotiating with you for? I just heard the word that Apple has taken Nissan as well and now
it's basically going to be a standard. Or are you getting different types of demand for different types of
wireless technology per either vertical or per type of end user?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

NFC remains important. We're investing and partnering in technologies like thread that you're probably
only person on the phone that's aware of it, the thread technology. And I think we continue to be very

comfortable on our foundation of being open, and making good segmentation decisions that allow Allegion
to grow, but also servicing our customers.

Jeffrey Ted Kessler
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Just as a last follow-up to this, as far as getting this out there, was this at the beginning going to cost
you more to get these technologies? I mean you obviously had wireless technologies coming out into the
marketplace for several years now, but is -- are these new technologies going to cost you more to get out
there? Or this is, as you said before, the ultimate margins remain about the same, where do the innards of
those margins differ from mechanical?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Again, margins consistent at a higher selling price. What fascinates me is our position in seamless access
opens up new business opportunity in terms of helping customers simplify their world. So -- an example of
this would be, at the University of Texas, Austin, where we are the sole supplier on access, they manage
80,000 credentials today.

I can get them out of that business and provide new value propositions, higher level of security that I
think customers will be more than willing to off-load, creating new revenue streams and echo systems for
Allegion.
