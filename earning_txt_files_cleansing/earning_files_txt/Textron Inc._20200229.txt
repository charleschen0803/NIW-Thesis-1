Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Textron earnings conference call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the
conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead.

Eric Salander
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing
future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to
various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief
Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our
website.

With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. First, I'd like to recognize that we're all operating in
extraordinarily challenging times while facing numerous disruptions to our daily routines. On behalf of
our company, I'd like to share our deepest sympathies for all those who have been affected by this global
pandemic, and we join in thanking those who have been working to keep us safe through the crisis,
particularly those on the front lines and the health care community. As we respond to the COVID-19
pandemic in this uncertain time in the world, our #1 priority remains the health of our workforce and
ensuring that we have a safe work environment during this unprecedented time.

Our employees have stepped up across the communities and are constructing plastic face shields and cloth
facemasks at aviation and TSV, producing hand sanitizers at Bell and gathering essential items for those
who need it at Caltex and Systems. We continue to work in understanding and assessing the impacts of
COVID-19 is having on our businesses, but we still have limited visibility in these times, particularly with
respect to how long this crisis will affect our markets. We're implementing actions across the company
to manage and mitigate the impact this pandemic is having on our operations. Given the diversity of our
segments and end markets, the impacts of COVID-19 have had a wide range of effects on our business
operations. For instance, the U.S. government has taken several actions to continue to reinforce the
importance of our nation's defense industrial base and has deemed the defense industrial base as part of
the nation's essential critical infrastructure.

Looking at our defense businesses, Bell and Textron Systems have maintained a steady operational
cadence throughout the health crisis, and we expect them to continue to do so. Bell executed very well
in the quarter with increased revenue from higher military volume and a 14% operating margin. On the
commercial side of the business, we delivered 15 helicopters, down from 30 in last year's first quarter. We
did see several deliveries push out of the quarter, resulting from customers' inability to accept aircraft due
to COVID-19-related travel restrictions.

During the quarter, Bell hit another major milestone in its pursuit of the Army's Future Vertical Lift
programs when it was down selected for the next phase in both of these strategically important aircraft
acquisition programs for the future of Army aviation. On the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program,
the Bell V-280 Valor was one of the 2 competitors selected for the competitive demonstration and risk
reduction phase over the next 18 months, with the expectation that the Army will award a preliminary
design contract in Q4 of next year. V-280 is well positioned entering this final phase of the acquisition

selection process, has now been flying for over 2 years while continuously demonstrating its speed, agility
and versatility in both piloted and autonomous flight.

On the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, the Bell 360 Invictus team was selected as one of
2 competitors with the design, build and testing of a prototype rotorcraft. The Bell 360 Invictus offering
includes the proven high-performance rotor system and fly-by-wire controls from our 525 Relentless in
affordable, sustainable and highly lethal design.

At Systems, while overall operations were strong for the quarter with higher volume across most of our
product lines, lower operating margin of 7.9% in the quarter was comparable to 9.1% was unfavorably
impacted by our simulation product line related to the downturn in commercial aviation. We've announced
furloughs and suspended operations at our simulator manufacturing facility in Montreal as airlines and
trading centers have significantly reduced their outlook for the acquisition of training devices amid this
health crisis.

In the quarter, Textron Marine & Land Systems delivered the first Ship-to-Shore Connector Craft 100 to
the U.S. Navy, and Craft 101 is scheduled to enter builders' trials in the second quarter. Also on Ship-to-
Shore Connector, the $820 million follow-on production contract for the next 15 craft was fully definitized
in mid-April. This is a critical milestone, and we believe demonstrates the Navy's commitment to the
[ ground ]. This now brings the total number of craft to be built at Textron Systems to 25 of the 73 craft
program of record.

At Textron Aviation, we announced employee furloughs in late March to address expected lower demand
for new aircraft and related service activities. In the quarter, revenues were $872 million, down $262
million from the first quarter of last year. We delivered 23 jets, down from 44 last year and 16 commercial
turboprops, down from 44 in last year's first quarter. Entering the quarter, we expect the lower unit
deliveries from both the change in the mix of aircraft sold and the availability of completed aircraft as we
work to recover our composite manufacturing operations following the accident that we experienced at the
end of 2019.

During the quarter, we also experienced delays in aircraft deliveries due to customers' inability to accept
their new aircraft in Wichita based on COVID-19-related travel restrictions. We expect these aircraft will
deliver as the travel restrictions begin to lift.

Looking to the market -- aftermarket. Revenues were down about 3% as compared to last year's first
quarter. Service activity was strong through the first 2 months of the quarter but began to slow in March
as the effects of the pandemic on air travel continued to expand.

Moving to backlog. There was a $290 million decrease from the fourth quarter balance of $1.7 billion,
primarily due to a revised demand outlook from a fractional jet customer resulting from the pandemic. As
government travel restrictions and other social distancing guidelines were implemented, we experienced a
pause in sales activity as face-to-face meetings and demonstration flights became increasingly difficult to
conduct. These actions led to the decline of retail order activity in the quarter. On the new product front,
the Cessna SkyCourier completed engine ground runs in March and is on track for first flight in the second
quarter.

Moving to Industrial. Revenues of $740 million were down $172 million from last year's first quarter,
largely related to lower volume in our Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line. Auto
manufacturers began to shut their factories in response to the COVID-19 crisis at the end of January,
beginning in China. As a Tier 1 industry, Caltex closed their facilities accordingly. In China, the Caltex
facilities have recently come back online and are ramping up based on demand signals from the
customers. In Europe and the Americas, the auto OEMs shutdown began in mid-March and are expected to
last through early May in most cases, with our facilities restarting accordingly.

At Textron Specialized Vehicles, we began employee furloughs in March to address the lower expected
demand across our business. Our ground support equipment business has been impacted particularly hard
as commercial air travel has slowed and airlines have pulled back on equipment purchases. Production has
been suspended, and we will continue to monitor demand outlook.

And outdoor powersports distribution channel, including both retail stores and dealers, has been impacted
by the crisis as consumer spend has significantly slowed and many dealers and stores have been required
to close due to government shutdown orders and other operating restrictions.

Production of the off-road products has been temporarily halted. Golf and PTV are continuing to operate
with some inefficiencies driven by required social distancing guidelines as they work to meet customer
commitments. The team is doing a good job of working through these difficult times.

In summary, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our employees, operations, suppliers and
customers across each of our segments. With the continued uncertainty around the pandemic, we are
confident in the actions that we've taken to protect our workers and maintain our businesses while
continuing to meet our customer commitments.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Revenues in the quarter were $2.8 billion, down $332 million
from last year's first quarter, largely driven by lower volume at Textron Aviation and Industrial. During
this year's first quarter, we recorded $39 million in pretax special charges related to the impairment of
intangible assets at Textron Aviation and Industrial due to economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19
pandemic. Excluding those charges, adjusted net income was $0.35 per share, down from $0.76 per share
in last year's first quarter. Segment profit in the quarter was $156 million, down from $294 million in
the first quarter of 2019. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a non-GAAP measure,
reflected a use of cash of $430 million, which was in line with our first quarter expectation.

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron
Aviation of $872 million were down $262 million from a year ago, primarily due to low volume and mix
of $260 million, largely the result of lower Citation jet volume of $154 million and lower commercial
turboprop volume of $99 million. The decrease in Citation jet and turboprop volume largely reflected a
decline in demand related to the pandemic, disruption in our composite manufacturing production due
to a plant accident that occurred in December of 2019 and delays in the acceptance of aircraft related to
COVID-19 travel restrictions.

Segment profit was $3 million in the first quarter, down from $106 million last year, primarily due to the
lower volume and unfavorable impact of $23 million from performance, which includes $12 million of idle
facility costs recognized in the first quarter of 2020 due to temporary manufacturing facility closures and
employee furloughs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at
$1.4 billion.

Moving to Bell. Revenues were $823 million, up $84 million from last year, primarily on higher military
volumes, slightly offset by lower commercial volume, principally due to delayed deliveries as a result of
COVID-19 travel restrictions.

Segment profit of $115 million was up $11 million, largely on higher military volume, partially offset by
the unfavorable impact of $8 million from performance and other. The performance and other included $25
million in lower net favorable program adjustments, partially offset by lower research and development
costs. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $6.4 billion.

At Textron Systems, revenues were $328 million, up $21 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher
volume across most of our product lines. Segment profit of $26 million was down $2 million as unfavorable
performance was largely offset by higher volume. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1.4
billion.

Industrial revenues of $740 million were down $172 million from last year, primarily related to lower
volume at our Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line, as Scott discussed earlier. Segment
profit was $9 million, down $141 million from a year ago, largely related to lower volume. We also realized
approximately $13 million of unfavorable performance in the first quarter due to manufacturing facility

closures and employee furloughs resulting from the pandemic that was mostly offset by other favorable
performance.

Finance segment revenues decreased $3 million, and profit decreased $3 million.

Moving below segment profit. Corporate expenses were $14 million, and interest expense was $34 million.
During the quarter, we initiated a number of financing activities to enhance our liquidity position, given the
uncertainty in the marketplace. We issued $1.25 billion of debt that included $105 million of commercial
paper, $650 million of 3% 10-year notes to refinance current year debt maturities and a $500 million 364-
day term loan credit agreement that was fully drawn on April 2.

To further enhance our liquidity position, we received $377 million in proceeds from borrowings against
corporate-owned life insurance policies with no [ stated ] maturity. Prior to the onset of the health crisis,
we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares in the first quarter at an overall cost of about $54
million. Consistent with the covenant in our new $500 million term loan, we have suspended share
repurchases until the outstanding balance under this agreement is repaid. At Finance, we have an
upcoming debt maturity in December of 2020 for $150 million, and we expect to refinance that note later
this year.

Within this current environment, we're focused on our cash preservation. We're working closely with our
leadership teams across our businesses on a weekly basis to efficiently manage our working capital and
eliminate discretionary expenses. We're also evaluating all capital not critical at this time.

From a liquidity perspective, we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our obligations despite the
uncertain environment. We understand the importance of managing our cash [ balances and we've taken
actions to enhance ] our liquidity profile. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion, and
we maintained an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1 billion, which matures on October -- in October of
2024.

With that, I'll hand it back to Scott.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Great. Thanks, Frank. While we suspended our earnings guidance for the year due to the uncertainty
around the COVID-19 pandemic, I would like to briefly touch upon the outlook for each segment.

At Industrial, our Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line is obviously reliant on automotive
production recovery. It's still too early to tell how the crisis will impact retail auto sales and ultimately
automotive OEM production. But today, we are experiencing recovery in China. And based on current
industry [ expert ] forecasts and dialogue with our customers, we expect to see Europe and the Americas
resume production in the second quarter with production ramping in Q3 and Q4.

In the vehicle business, TSV has experienced significant disruptions in the markets. Consumer
discretionary aspect of the outdoor powersports business remains difficult, but we are taking actions to
minimize our costs and manage working capital through the downturn.

At aviation, while we continue to take some orders, the normal pace of interaction with customers has
obviously [ been slowed. We've ] suspended most new aircraft production through the end of May, while
continuing to deliver aircraft on existing orders and provide customers aftermarket services and support.
While it will vary by region, we expect to see our sales team start engaging with customers in the latter
part of Q2.

For our aftermarket business, we expect overall flying hours to begin to pick up in Q2, leading to an
increase in activity in our parts and service business in Q3 and Q4. Systems is predominantly defense-
oriented segment and we believe will remain on track to meet our expectations for the year. At Bell, given
the strength of the defense business, we expect performance will be consistent with our expectations for
the full year.

TEXTRON INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

To wrap up, we've demonstrated our ability to execute through significant market disruptions in the
past, and we're confident that we're implementing the necessary actions to address this crisis as well. At
Industrial, we are committed to our strategy we have in place to strengthen our retail channel through our
Bass Pro partnership and Snowmageddon presale event with the -- within the powersports business.

At Caltex, we continue to collaborate with our OEM customers as we invest in new technologies for plug-in
hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles that position the business for ongoing opportunities as
the automotive industry continues to evolve the next generation of cars.

At Aviation, while clearly difficult situation, we do believe this cycle [ has ] fundamental differences from
the challenges we experienced in the 2008-2009 downturn. The secondary market for pre-owned Citation
aircraft is much stronger today as compared to 2008, with significantly fewer aircraft for sale and a
dramatically lower number of aircraft under 10 years old. As such, we do not view the preowned market as
an impediment to the sale of new aircraft.

The private aviation environment is also different in a couple of ways. We don't see the negative
perception associated with the use of private aircraft that was brought on during the 2008 financial
crisis. Conversely, we believe the private aviation will be viewed more positively today from a health
perspective as business travel restarts with the resumption of the economy. We also enter this cycle with
a much stronger and more highly differentiated product portfolio having introduced the Latitude and the
Longitude. Additionally, we have a pipeline of aircraft with SkyCourier and Denali that will help to drive
future growth in new markets.

Our defense businesses are well positioned with our current production contracts in addition to recent
awards on development programs at both Systems and Bell that represent opportunities for significant
growth in the future. At Systems, we achieved important milestones on existing programs like the Ship-to-
Shore Connector program as well as unmanned aircraft and surface vessel programs. Also, we believe the
recent award of a development contract under the Robotic Combat Vehicle medium program, coupled with
awards on several weapons programs, present promising opportunities for future growth in the segment.

And finally, the recent awards on the FLRAA and FARA Future Vertical Lift programs are the result of our
commitment to invest in new products and technologies for future growth. These awards [ will permit ] us
to continue to work with our Army customer to address their specific weapon system requirements and to
support the Army futures command acquisition strategy to accelerate the deployment of these important
programs to the war fighter.
That concludes our prepared remarks.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I just want to start out on a positive note because I'm sure we'll hear tons about aviation profitability later.
But in terms of the down-select for the Future Vertical Lift programs, these were 2 big milestones, how
do you think about the timeline from here? And given the OTA nature of these contracts, how do we think
about R&D? Or should spending levels be pretty consistent?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, it's a good question, Sheila. I think the timelines, obviously, are different for the 2 programs. FLRAA,
which is pretty mature, I mean, we've been flying for over 2 years now on the V-280, I think this phase
that we're entering into under the OTA, the customer has basically, who by the way has very much stayed
totally consistent with their schedules and delivering on announcements and awards and staying on their
timeline, has basically said, this is an 18-month process. So we'd be expecting the next selection and
entry into the next phase in the fourth quarter of next year is a relatively short timeframe. Obviously,
what's important for us in this window is to continue to reduce risk, work with the customer on taking the
foundation of what we've created on the V-280 and making sure that we accommodate the requirements
to turn this into a weapon system. It obviously has to accommodate mission systems and sensors and
weapons into the future.

The other thing working, obviously, in this phase, which is very important for us, we're investing in a
brand-new manufacturing technology center. So we've been able to demonstrate what the craft can do.
Now we have to demonstrate that it can be very affordable and that it can meet the kind of great volumes
that they need when they go into EMD and on into production. So that's what needs to happen here in this
18-month window. And again, I think the customer has demonstrated that they're on track and meeting
everything they've said in terms of timeline. So we feel pretty good about that.

FARA is in a different place. Obviously, this is kind of -- we're starting to go from the paper design and
proposal, for which we were down-selected. We've already started to build critical components for this
program. We'll have a couple of years, a little 2 years to fly this thing. And then it will go through a similar
process as FLRAA went through under the JMR program and have a fly off. So that's out there a few years.
But again, the customer has been great about staying on their timelines. And I think we feel good about
both those programs, which, as you say, are huge opportunities if we're ultimately selected for the next
phase of those programs.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Do we do...

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

R&D. Yes. So I'm sorry, on the R&D part, Sheila, so the -- at this point, so R&D spending at Bell on a gross
basis will be up pretty significantly. Both of these programs are 1/3 Bell, 2/3 customer cost share. So on
a gross basis, we'll see an increase in R&D. But on a net basis, because we're going from largely purely
company funded on these programs to a cost share, you'll actually -- you should see a reduction in net
R&D. And remember, none of this goes through the revenue line. Because of the cost share nature of the
contracts, we'll incur that gross R&D. And then that customer contribution will be netted out against that.

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

And Sheila, the timing and the scope of what were now been awarded is consistent with what was in our
guidance. We had anticipated these down-selection in our guidance.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We have both FARA and FLRAA in our original operating plan.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then if I could ask one on aviation. GD and Embraer were pretty adamant there was no demand
deterioration. But your prepared remarks make sense if you can't meet a customer face-to-face, it's hard
to sell an aircraft. I was just sort of surprised that the backlog ticked down from that fractional customer. I
thought that would be one area that might actually see a pickup in terms of fractional usage?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, it's a good question, and I think that remains to be seen. So look, I mean, it's not a secret. This is
NetJets, right? They're our partner in the fractional market. It's been a great relationship. These guys are
hugely important part of our business in terms of going to market and addressing that fractional customer
base. So what happened, obviously, the NetJets sales force saw the same thing we saw, right, which was
people sort of stopped as the pandemic hit. And so what we've done with NetJets is kind of gone through
-- they are still taking quite a few deliveries this year on both Latitude and Longitude. They have aircraft
out there that are sold and customer commitments, and we continue to operate and work with them. But
they also said, look, until we see the sales turn back on, the aircraft -- other aircraft that we would have
expected to take delivery this year, we're going to take out of the book. So I think what will really happen
here in terms of the fractional market is not unlike our whole aircraft sales force is once the people are
able to get out and engage and continue to work, we'll see how that really plays out.

I think when I talk to Adam, they're seeing a lot of inquiry and a lot of activity in both jet card as well as
prospective fractionals because a lot of customers, and frankly, the good news is a lot of customers who
have not been business aviation users in the past are thinking about what happens when the economy
turns on, and they need to start to get back out on the road to see whether it's customers or suppliers or
factories, plants, we expect that you're going to see a lot of new people come into this. And we've seen
that in discussions with Adam and the NetJets guys. We had the same discussions in the club membership
and managed model with Wheels Up and Kenny Dichter. So I'd say it's anecdotal at this point, but we
certainly -- there's some reason to have some optimism here around the fact that we're seeing a lot of
activity through those channels that are new players, new folks that we are seeing potentially coming into
the business aviation industry.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Just to follow up on Sheila's question. So if you looked at the 0.64 book-to-bill, I mean, how much was
that reduced because of NetJets coming out? Because it would seem like NetJets deliveries were going to
be a reasonably high percentage of the total this year.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

TEXTRON INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

George, we didn't have any other cancellations other than what I just talked about around the NetJets side
of things. So we didn't see other cancellations come out. One of the challenges, of course, is we didn't see
a lot of new stuff go in because sales activity pretty well came to a halt. And look, it's not 0, I mean, and
frankly, even as we come through here in April, deals are getting closed. There's customers out there who
certainly had been engaged with us for some time, who've been looking at the aircraft who probably had
demo rides, and they're now saying, okay, it's time to move and go ahead and put the order in. But it's a
very difficult environment to go out there and develop new customers at this stage of the game until we
can really get out there and get face-to-face, folks can do demo rides, they can get to Wichita and look at
interiors. As you know, it's a pretty involved sales process. But those were -- the contributing pieces were
the cancellations on the fractional side and just, frankly, lack of a lot of new order activity on the retail
side.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

And how many deliveries weren't you able to make because of the travel restrictions?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

It was -- I mean total number of aircraft in jets was I mean there was a Longitude, a couple of M2s, a CJ,
there were a couple of King Airs, 4 or 5 Caravans, a dozen 172s. It was a relatively small number, but it
was pretty much across the whole portfolio. But when you start talking about Longitudes and CJ3s, it's not
trivial from a revenue standpoint.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

And then maybe one for Frank. The Bell margin was particularly high, especially the lower EACs. You said
the R&D, lower R&D offset some of it. I mean do I assume it offset half of it or so? And do the margins
really substantially tick down in subsequent quarters because of just to be able to get close to your
guidance, which is the high end [ up in ] 12%?

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean it was a good quarter for Bell. R&D will continue to increase over time as we move through
the year. And as Scott said, our expectation for Bell overall is that it's kind of on track, consistent with our
original guidance so far.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

But it may require some substantial reductions in subsequent quarters to get down to even your high end
of 12%?

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And as you know, Bell has done better than our guidance for a number of years here, and we'll see
how the year continues to develop.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

And then one last one for you, Scott. Unless I missed it in your commentary about each of the sectors,
you didn't give commentary on Systems. Maybe that's because you don't know where simulation is going
to go or did I just miss it?

Well, I think, George, in Systems, things are generally going very well, right? The Ship-to-Shore
Connector program has hit a couple of important milestones in terms of that program starting to deliver
the craft, getting the milestone of the first sales of 100 across the goal line was very important. 101 is not
far behind it. We continue to work through those issues on the -- I mean there's still more craft to deliver,
obviously, on the development contract. Definitization of the production contract for the next 15 craft was
a very big deal. We're continuing to see increased hours on, for instance, our fee-for-service unmanned
aircraft programs. We've had a lot of key milestones on our unmanned surface vessel programs that's
moving into the next phase, which is very good.

We did win -- again it's a development contract, but an important on the [ RCV ] medium and, as I said,
other weapons programs, GBSD. So I think both the performance under the current programs that we
have are looking very good. The critical new programs that we need to win and execute on are looking
very good. The only soft spot really in the Systems world right now is particularly the air transport market
on the simulation training side, which is, again, we've shut that down, and we just don't have any demand
on the airline side, which is understandable. These guys aren't going to be laying out any kind of CapEx
and doing upgrades and the things that are kind of normal flow business in that business right now. But
outside of that, both current execution, current programs as well as important new wins were quite strong
in Systems in the quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Scott, on aviation, I just want to clarify really what's going on at the moment. It sounds like the plants
are at a low level of activity. And if that's the case, when things come back, do you expect volumes to be
moving back to, say, where they were at the start of the year? Or do you anticipate being a fraction of
what it was previously?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Robert, look, that's the big question. All right. So what we're doing right now, aviation is just completing a
4-week or has just completed a 4-week furlough. We've extended that another 4 weeks. So what's built in
right now is an 8-week shutdown. There is some minimal activity in terms of completing aircraft that were
already under order for delivery. But for the most part, the production lines themselves are shut down.
The furlough included across the whole workforce. We are bringing teams back in and getting the new
product programs for, like Sky Courier are going.

But the reason we're doing this, Robert, is we just don't have good visibility into what that production rate
needs to be for the balance of the year. We always gauge that based on looking at our sales teams and
understanding order flow and what's going on in terms of normal progression of customers moving from
inquiry all the way through to taking an order. And we're sort of -- we don't have that right now, right?
So we're basically doing the furloughs to buy time to see the economy start to pick back up for people
to be able to travel and understand where they are so that we can gauge what do we need to set that
production run rate for the balance of the year. So that's -- I mean that is the big question, okay?

So -- and again, I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic around what business aviation, what role
it plays as you come out of this pandemic, and people do need to travel and they want to do it safely and
from a health standpoint, and they don't know what's going to be going on on the commercial airline side
about how quickly that comes back, what are the routes, availability, all that sort of stuff. So -- and we
certainly see anecdotal things that would indicate that there's reasons for optimism. But you also have to
weigh that against business confidence and people and how do they feel about expending that CapEx to
acquire that aircraft. So this remains to be seen, and that's why we're doing what we're doing, right? So
the furloughs are a mechanism to buy some time and have better visibility so that we can set what we
believe are appropriate levels of production as we frankly finish 2020 and how we think about 2021.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes. Makes sense. And as a follow-up, Frank, you raised some debt against the insurance policies this
quarter. As far as I know, it's pretty unusual. Can you give us an idea of what the sort of cost of debt was
on this debt? And why you went down this avenue versus more plain vanilla stuff?

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Well, we did this back in '08, '09 also. It's a ready source of cash. It's got a slightly [ higher ] cost
to it than kind of a more normal borrowing it was, but we did it at a time, frankly, where we were seeing
very significant dislocations in the financial markets. The Fed had not yet acted the way it's acted. People
kind of were not -- we were seeing access to the markets dry up, and we just wanted to make sure that
we had plenty of liquidity in anticipation of a potential downside to, frankly, what we've seen so far. So it's
a bit of an insurance policy against our insurance policies, and it is a source of liquidity. The reason that
we did it at the time is there is a scenario where if we request that cash value, it can take -- the insurance
companies have up to 6 months to provide it. And so we wanted to make sure that we got in front of any
type of delay if there was really a liquidity disruption in the markets.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Scott, I guess, unprecedented times. I mean how are you -- have you been doing a lot of assessments of
the supply chain? How do you assess the risk or disruptions that you're seeing across your business?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

It's a good question, Peter. And look, I think it's a day-to-day fight, right? I mean, we haven't seen any
major issues. But without a doubt, there's such a patchwork of different rules and degrees of shutdown
in different states that we track this every day. And so we haven't seen anything that's an unsolvable
problem, but we're managing it every day. You have a supplier that's down for a week or so, and we
work around that. So again, remember, for sure, aviation is largely shut down vehicle. I mean a lot of our
stuff has already shut down. But Bell operates every day. Systems is operating every day. We do have
the golf lines. PTV back up and operating. And while we see small flare-ups on supply base issues, we're
able to resolve those. And frankly, that goes for our own operations, Peter, right? It's -- you're operating
under unusual circumstances and some inefficiencies here and there. But I think it's a -- these are tactical
issues. And the guys have done a really nice job of staying on top of it and kind of working through it
every day.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. And just quickly on aviation. Just can you update us where you are on the post the composite facility,
the accident there, where things stand there?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Sure. Look, the guys, again, did a fabulous job. We basically have the composites operation back
up to 100%. So at this stage of the game, we're kind of working on the catch-up activities. We've been
doing some operations in there to catch up on critical components. So there's still work we need to do to
bring all of our sort of in-house organic capability back up to speed, particularly on the autoclaves, but
the composite layup facility and all that detailed work is fully back up and operating, but we're having to
ship stuff mostly across town. Spirit, we're using a lot of their autoclave capacity. So Tom and his guys

have made that available to us. So we're running. We're running in at 100%. So I think that's a problem
that's largely behind us. Although as I said, we still have some inefficiencies because of having to use
autoclave capacity across town that ultimately will get new [ into the place ] and be able to get back to
normal operations. But for now, it's okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Frank, I wondered if you could help me understand the -- in the Bell results in the quarter, the -- I assume
the FLRAA booking, you were able to book some revenue associated with work that had been done to
date. And just maybe help us understand how that did in terms of the results and how we're thinking
about the phasing of revenues and margins from here? Because I imagine that was a big event for those
guys.

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Well, it doesn't impact revenue. What it does impact is net R&D. So again, kind of there's significant gross
R&D effort going on at Bell vis-à-vis both FARA and FLRAA, but particularly on FLRAA, we had invested
in advance of that award and so we did see some benefit in the quarter associated with the award and
effectively the government sharing that offsets then our gross R&D effort that resulted in a lower net R&D
effort. That's why I said kind of earlier that we'll see net R&D at Bell rise as we move through the year as
a result of both increased effort, but also not having some of that catch-up that benefited the first quarter.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

We've got a couple of questions. And just so people understand, this does not go through revenue, right?
It is a cost share. It was in our plan. We still had lower R&D in Q1 because of the -- what we expected
to be ramping, the level of significantly ramping the gross R&D through the course of the year which will
happen to execute on FLRAA and FARA. And our net piece will also ramp through the year as a result. But
it's not something you'll see go through the revenue line.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Okay. All right. That's very clear. And then just as a follow-up, Scott, I wondered you -- I appreciate
the commentary, the differences in the forward outlook for aviation. But if you kind of parse that, how
you're thinking about the forward outlook for jets versus turboprops and how that play out differently, I'd
appreciate the color.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Again, a good question. I wish we had better insight to it. Turboprop was hit pretty early in the year
because we do so much in Asia. And as Asia kind of works their way through this, we're hoping we'll start
to get some better insight into what's going on in the Asian market, which will particularly be impactful, I
think, on the turboprop side of things. On the jet side of things, again, I think if you -- my thought around
this thing, and again, talking to Adam and Kenny and the Wheels Up and NetJets, you see the kind of
inquiry and customer activity that they're seeing.

Most of this, particularly as new people come in to this market, it's most likely they start in sort of that
either charter club membership, jet card, but we're going to see it, and we are seeing some of it in
fractional, and I think ultimately, you will start to see it in managed aircraft, right, where people conclude
that, look, a whole aircraft makes sense for me. And again, it's just like everybody else in this industry.

TEXTRON INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

It's based on how many hours a year are -- do you need to fly to determine what makes sense for you in
terms of which of those kinds of products, if you will, are going into business aviation.

But from my perspective, all these things are important, right? So driving utilization, even if it's in
memberships and jet cards is more flying, which is more service. As customers do more equity based --
and again, whether that's a fractional or it's a whole managed aircraft, again, that's obviously very good
for us. I just -- we just don't know what the timing of that progression looks like. And I'm not sure we'll
get a lot better. We love that we're -- that Wheels Up and NetJets are seeing this kind of activity and new
customers coming into the market. We'll have to give it some time here to see how that sort of trickles
through the whole enterprise, if you will.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Scott, you mentioned how Textron has historically been able to manage through these sorts of crisis and
issues. And certainly appreciate that you're in a much stronger spot, much different spot today than just
over a decade ago. But how are you thinking -- I mean, you're sort of pulling from the history of the
company and your previous experience. How are you seeing about how you want the company to emerge
once this is all done? Is it maybe deemphasizing certain parts of the business deemphasizing others?
Appreciate that defense is clearly a lot more sticky kind of no matter what happens. Just how are you
thinking with the perspective of your long career? How you want things to emerge on the other side?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, look, I think part of where we are today versus where we are is our balance sheet is in a much better
place, obviously. We don't have some of the challenges that we had a decade ago. I think our investments
in new products positions us better than we've ever been. As you play through the cycle, I mean, the fact
that you have the FARAs and the FLRAAs at Bell, that you've got the Longitude just certified, the Latitude
very strong product, things like Sky Courier in the pipeline.

You look at what's going on in our Systems business, the things that we've done around investments in
the unmanned side, both in the air vehicles, the surface vessels and now the investments we've made
here recently both organic and through the acquisition of Howe & Howe on the land side. I just think we're
much better positioned. And then that's going to continue to be those strategies in those businesses is
how do we make sure that we have the kind of product and service that works that are -- make us a more
robust business.

And I mean, this is a cycle that no one ever could have imagined, obviously. But I absolutely believe that
we'll come out of this in a better place than we've ever been. I mean, things that we've been investing
in for years to position us are happening as we speak. I think it's a shame. A thing like a Longitude gets
certified and 60 days later the market stops. But look, that's a transient, right? I mean, this too shall pass.
Things like the FARA and FLRAA down-selects. What's unfortunate is that happened right smack dab in
the middle of a global economic shutdown. But that's -- again, that's a transient. These are programs
that have the potential. And obviously, we need to stay very focused and execute very well with Army
customer in order for us to be the guy that ultimately gets selected to go forward on production, and we
have to keep focused and working hard to make that happen.

But these are -- I see these things that are happening and obviously in the nature of this pandemic is
a very transient thing. Now look, there's other businesses where we will look very hard at, are there
opportunities to consolidate some things, and hey, look, if I got some plants that are closed, are there
more efficient ways to operate and manage. Look we're looking at all those things. So -- but I think the
bottom line is this is a terrible moment in time. And trust me, it's not fun running businesses where your
plants are shut down, but this is a transient. And I think we're in a radically different position than we

were a decade ago. And some of our most important end markets, when you think about the aviation side
is just a total different dynamic coming out of this than coming out of that '08, '09 cycle.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And then just thinking about Bell, which seems to be obviously a good new story in the quarter, the
military is very strong, just thinking about the next couple of years there, though, obviously, know that
the V-22 numbers come down. But I know you've talked about the aftermarket type work bullying that
somewhat. So can you just remind us of the trajectory of Bell military? And then also, what are we seeing
in Bell commercial right now, especially with something like the 525?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

So look, Bell military, obviously, very solid for the quarter, and we expect it to stay that way. We -- as
we've talked about before, we are definitely seeing a transition here over the last year or so, and we'll
continue to see that going forward, where unit volumes are sort of flat to down a little bit. And that's just
a function of the program of record on things like V-22 and H-1, but there's been significant growth in
the aftermarket. Both of those platforms are heavily utilized. The fleets have grown, and the government,
frankly, is looking for us to play a bigger role in sustaining and maintaining and, frankly, starting to
upgrade some of those fleets. So I think we're well positioned for that, and that was borne out here in the
quarter, right? So we're seeing solid growth in the aftermarket on those things, and that will help sustain
that business and keep it, frankly, in a good place as we transition to whatever those next new platforms
may be, obviously, focused very much on the FLRAAs and the FARAs of the world.

On the commercial side of Bell, we do a lot of parapublic and international sales. Those are largely holding
up. Obviously, like all the businesses, sales activity right now is slower on some of the things like a 505,
for instance, which is a shorter cycle sale, a lot more individuals and small corporate-type things, I expect
that to be a little softer, but this is a very small amount of revenue and margins associated with that. It's a
fabulous product, but it will go through a cycle, not unlike a general aviation sort of business. But so much
of the 412, 429, 407 is parapublic, EMS, a pretty well diversified set of end markets, which will be a little
more resilient to a cycle like that. With that being said, we are, of course, looking at those order rates,
and we'll make any production-related adjustments as appropriate. That's obviously a very big service
business as well, which, again, is very solid and was up in the quarter. People are flying in those markets.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Maybe just following up on the Bell question. Have you seen much of an impact? Or is it too soon on what
energy prices have done given oil completely collapsed. Has that had any impact on Bell yet? Do you
expect it to? How are you thinking about that?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Ron, as you know, we don't have a huge part of the business that's oil and gas related. It's -- there's a
number of deals that are sort of in the pipeline that are kind of 412 or 429 related. There's a couple of
things that were, as I said, that were in the pipeline that we haven't heard about yet, but it's because
couple of these countries are just totally shut down. So whether it affects their strategy or not, I don't
know. As you know, a lot of operators, and I don't think this will change in that industry, do put limits on
how many hours aircraft have and ages of aircraft to meet their standards to provide service to the oil
and gas fields. So there is -- that drives demand. I mean, there is regular turnover with a lot of these key
customers.

TEXTRON INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

And remember, Ron, we're not -- today, we don't do a lot of the big offshore stuff, right? It's the Gulf. It's
a lot of the nearshore sorts of operations, and those tend to be the lower cost fields, which I think are
the ones that are more likely to hang in there. I think it's safe to say right now, you're not going to see a
whole lot of deepwater, big dollar investments to get at some of the more expensive oil. So but people are
still producing, and they're still going to have to run their operations. So I mean -- I don't think it's a good
thing for the oil and gas market for sure, but it's not one to which we have a huge exposure.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

All right. Got you. And then maybe just as a follow on, Textron Finance, right, obviously, is a shadow of
what it once was, particularly in the last downturn. But sadly, the golf industry has been put on ice for a
while here. I mean have you seen that impact Finance? Because I still -- there's still some golf properties
kind of wrapped up in there. Has that impacted finance? And how has that impacted E-Z-GO?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So 2 things. So first of all, we have 0 golf in [ TSE ] now. There are no golf properties. The last of
that got sold off, actually an account closed out and gone last year. So we are officially out of the golf
course finance business. So we have no exposure there. Golf, as you know, Ron, the cars themselves
are primarily almost all are leased. So as clubs reach the end of their leases, they do roll and end those
leases. I mean you can do a 6-month extensions and some stuff like that for sure. But the demand in the
golf side of the business right now remains very strong. As you know, we introduced the lithium-ion stuff
a while back, and that's been a fabulous product for us. Demand is very strong. This year, we introduced a
brand-new, we think, market-leading gas product, which is a segment we haven't been a big player for a
long, long time.

We've seen a nice uptick in demand driven by that. So the golf business is running. My only challenge on
golf right now is just build enough golf cars. And the difficulty there is we -- our guys are doing a great
job. They're working. I was down in Augusta a few weeks ago with them, and we're running the golf line,
but what used to be every 2.5 minutes, we could produce a golf car, we're running at about 7 minutes
right now, and that's because of the social distancing, right? We've got our production work cells where we
usually have 3 or 4 folks at every station doing assembly work, I can only have one person in that area at
the moment based on the guideline. So -- but we're running 2 shifts making them and shipping them as
fast as we can.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Springam (sic) [Robert Spingarn] .

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I want to ask a question. This could either be for you, Scott or for Frank. But I wanted to talk about the
fact -- a follow-on from really all the earlier questions. We've talked a lot about supply-side disruption
from COVID-19, what it's been doing in the factories and furloughs. And obviously, it's very difficult to
work through. But I was hoping we could balance this with the demand destruction that might be here.
And I thought it might be helpful to look at your delivery exhibit and focus on jets delivered, which are
down around half first quarter to first quarter and then the same for the commercial helicopters. Can you
quantify or parse out how much is factory shut down? How much was the accident? How much is perhaps
weakness in demand that crept into the quarter defaults or what have you? Can we talk about that?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I can give some color on it. I mean, at aviation, it's -- I mean, it's roughly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, let's
say, right? I mean there's stuff that we expected that we would not be able to deliver based on the
interruptions on our composite facilities which, again, is a transient, and we're back to 100%. We're

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

TEXTRON INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

still playing some catch-up there, but I think we're getting that back under control. There's about 1/3
of it were aircraft where people just couldn't take delivery of the aircraft given travel constraints, and
there is probably another 1/3 of stuff that we would have expected orders that would have closed in the
quarter and aircraft that would have delivered that just aren't closing because we're not out selling. And
I think those largely will -- clearly, the ones that can deliver on travel restrictions will push out into the
subsequent quarter, the order activity needs to pick up as we can get back to sales. And clearly, we'll get
caught up on the impact due to the composite stuff. So I don't want to go through all the direct numbers,
but it's roughly split amongst those things, all of which I think are transient. In terms of what...

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

They're all supply side, right, not being able to show up to pick up your airplane is a COVID-19 problem,
the factory shut down, the accident and so forth. So it sounds like on the demand side, you haven't really
seen it yet other than the cancellation of [ some backlog ]. But has anybody defaulted? We heard from a
competitor that there were some defaults in the quarter.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

No. So just to be clear, I mean, I think, again, we're [ inning ] these things in supply and demand. There
certainly was some lower volume in the quarter because of people reacting when the whole pandemic
thing first got announced, right? Orders that were progressing that you would have expected that you
would close things in normal business and convert to orders and sales didn't happen, right? So there is
certainly some impact in the quarter on the demand side. What that means in the future is hard to predict
because we're really not back doing a whole lot of sales activity.

So on -- and as I said, on the cancellation front, no, we did not get phone calls canceling aircraft. In fact,
we -- calls -- people even in cases where they said, "Hey, I can't get there." And we said, well, look, you
got to put additional cash, and they did, right? So I mean people want aircraft, and we saw that same
dynamic at Bell. So it wasn't a matter of people calling and canceling. It was people not being able to
come pick it up and take delivery. So the only cancellations was -- again, we talked about the fractional
side. And I think that, again, that's -- I don't view -- remember, for us, NetJets is very important. Their
sales force sells a lot of our aircraft. And so if their sales force can't go out and sell aircraft, that's a
problem for NetJets and for us. So I don't see that dynamic of what they're seeing as being different than
the dynamic of my own sales force, right, which is having a hard time engaging in the way they would
normally engage with customers, and I expect that will turn once the sales teams can get back out there
and go about their business.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So what I'm getting at, Scott, is what I'm worried about is that it's not so much that the salespeople can't
logistically get deals done during this thing, but that the demand is actually worse than we think. And I
know you've characterized this period differently than the prior 2 downturns, but it's hard to ignore the
fact that in the prior 2 downturns, the light and mid-jet segments were down 50% over a couple of years.
And I'm just wondering if there's a hidden demand destruction that we're looking at here because we're
going into a period of austerity, which generally accompanies these recession recoveries, people sharpen
the pencil. There's a little less willingness in the Boardroom to buy the airplane. And I'm curious to see if
you're seeing any evidence of that yet?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

No. Look, we're not out there selling. So I mean, we don't. I mean, you might be right. I don't know. For
sure, I'm not putting you on my sales team. But this is the great unknown, guys. And again, all I can do is
your facts and your perspective, if you looked at what happened coming out of '08, '09 are undisputable.
I mean I completely understand. And there were a lot of things that were going on in '08 and '09, right?
You had a massive destruction of wealth. You had huge volumes of aircraft that had been built in the 4, 5

preceding years. So you had tons of virtually brand-new airplanes, only a couple of years old with very low
hours, which were the same model of airplane that you were still in production with that you were selling
against.

And not to underplay, there was a huge political bias in that '08, '09, '10 timeframe of people hiding their
business jets, right? I mean, it was just such a different dynamic. But again, these are all just opinions.
We don't know. And I don't want to -- I want to be very clear. We -- this is why we can't forecast yet and
why we're trying to buy some time to get enough of this behind us to get a better perspective on what's
going on in the market and what that demand environment will look like before we make permanent
changes one way or the other to our production rates. We just don't know. I'm not disagreeing with you. I
mean I understand your perspective. I just don't know.

Robert Michael Spingarn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. And I'm not trying to be overly negative. I am simply looking at what's happened before and the fact
that we -- and it is unknown, but we could be in a period of austerity coming out of this thing, and I would
think that might matter.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, if that turns out to be the case, it will matter, and we will absolutely react accordingly. But as we
sit here today, we just don't know. There's bull cases, there's bear cases, and there's stuff in the middle.
And that's all we're trying to do, guys, is get to a point where we can have a much better fundamental
understanding of what that demand environment looks like to make decisions on how to run the business
going forward.

Next question comes from the line of David Strauss.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Scott, I think NetJets has been out there publicly saying that not only from you all, but total industry
deliveries, they're now looking at roughly 25 this year versus the plan had been 60. Is that decline, I
guess, percentage-wise, roughly in line with what you're looking at versus what your initial plan was with
NetJets?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

I would say that's in line with it. I think what Adam put out is consistent with the conversations we've had
and what I talked about in terms of how we worked with them to revise our outlook and backlog for the
balance of the year. So what they put out there is absolutely consistent with the dialogue that we've had
and the work that we've done to realign that delivery. So as he indicated, look, there are still quite a few
deliveries here for the balance of the year, but it reflects the market as they see it today. And again, I'm
not sure if that's how the market's going to look 30 days or 60 days from now, but it's how it looks today.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And with that in mind, how quickly can you pivot if they come back to you and turn things back on, how
quickly can you pivot and increase deliveries back towards NetJets?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, obviously, particularly for Latitudes and Longitudes, we had a pretty good visibility, again, based
on that backlog and where we're going. So these aircraft are there, right? I mean they're not all 100%

completed, but they are -- and some of them were waiting for some of these composite parts. But we
could clearly increase number of deliveries in those categories of aircraft based on that. So that would be
a problem we would be perfectly happy to work on.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then Frank, any sort of help you can give us with thinking about working capital from here?
Obviously, it was a big use in Q1. I would assume that was mainly at industrial and aviation. But how
might working capital play out from here through the rest of the year?

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, overall, net working capital was not a big use in the quarter. Obviously, cash flow was kind
of -- when I talk about that, I mean, year-over-year. So it was similar in terms of our normal seasonality.
From a cash flow perspective, I think we would expect that we would see some use of cash in the second
quarter, and then we'd be positive in the back end of the year. I mean there are a lot of variables around
this, obviously, given the uncertainty that we've been talking about. But assuming we see some restart
of the economy and businesses get back going and our factory start-up and our expectation, again, is
some use of cash flow in the second quarter and then positive cash flow in the back end of the year and
kind of normal liquidation of inventory reflecting in that as we move through the year. We have certainly
decelerated things coming in. And that will allow for good liquidation of inventory in the back half of the
year.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman.

Seth Michael Seifman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So I think I got one more here. Maybe you spoke, Scott, about Ship-to-Shore at the beginning, I think,
and the number of craft that you built. So with a fair number of those builds and probably starting to get
down the learning curve, is there a cash profile there that we should kind of be aware of in terms of some
collections that you guys can make as those crafts get delivered and kind of when does that happen?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

I don't know if there's anything there dramatic, Seth. I mean, obviously, we've been -- keep in mind, one
of the things is we've been operating on undefinitized contract on the production now for quite some time.
So in fact, about half of the program has been executed under that. So now we're fully definitized, but
there's nothing there that would make it look very different than what you'd expect in terms of revenue,
cash collection. The payment terms are quite standard for a government contract at this point so.

Eric Salander
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Okay. Greg, that will do it for now.

Operator
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your
participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.
