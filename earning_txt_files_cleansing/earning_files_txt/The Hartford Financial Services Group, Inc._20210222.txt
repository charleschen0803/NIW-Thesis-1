Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to Hartford's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Susan Spivak. Please
go ahead.

Susan Spivak Bernstein
Senior Investor Relations Officer

Thank you, Ian. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on first quarter
2021 earnings. This morning, we reported results and posted all of the earnings-related materials on our

official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year.

I'll now turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Thank you for joining us this morning. I want to start by saying that I have never been more excited
about the future of The Hartford. In the first quarter, there were infrequent items that impacted reported
results. However, the underlying performance of our business continues to reflect strong execution on
key initiatives and improving margins. I am extremely bullish about the prospects of growth and further
margin expansion in the second half of 2021 and in 2022. The current macroeconomic environment and
industry outlook favors The Hartford. And combined with the strength of our businesses, we are positioned
to deliver accelerated growth and attractive returns for our shareholders.

I'm now going to turn the call over to Doug and Beth so they can provide some more commentary on the
quarter. After their remarks, I will provide more details on our financial targets that we disclosed here
today. So with that, Beth, I'll turn the call over to you.

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Chris. Earlier today, we reported first quarter core earnings of $203 million or $0.56 per
diluted share. Core earnings were down 58% in the quarter primarily due to the impact of 3 significant
items. First, we recognized unfavorable prior year development in P&C of $223 million before tax. The
largest component of the adverse development was the impact of the settlement agreement with the
Boy Scouts of America that we announced last week. Partially offsetting the unfavorable development
was favorable development in other lines, primarily workers' compensation, package business and

Personal Lines auto. Second, our first quarter results were impacted by catastrophes of $214 million net of
reinsurance. This includes $176 million from the February winter storms in Texas and other areas. Third,
the quarter was impacted by COVID-related excess mortality in Group Benefits of $185 million before tax,
and losses in workers' compensation and financial lines totaling $24 million. Aside from these 3 items, the
performance of our businesses in the quarter remained very strong.

In P&C, our underlying combined ratio of 89.4% improved 3.5 points from the first quarter of 2020,
including improvements in both the loss and expense ratios. In Small Commercial, the underlying
combined ratio of 88.3% improved by 1 point from first quarter 2020. Excluding COVID losses, margin
improvement was largely driven by lower expenses from our Hartford Next initiatives.

Middle & Large Commercial's underlying combined ratio of 95.3% improved 5.1 points from first quarter
2020, also benefiting from Hartford Next. In addition, lower non-cat property losses and ex COVID
workers' compensation margin expansion contributed to improved results. In Global Specialty, the
underlying combined ratio of 89.9% improved 6.5 points from first quarter 2020 due to lower expenses
and loss ratio improvement as rate increases continue to earn-in across the businesses.

In Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio improved 3.1 points to 83.5% as the loss ratio improved
by 3.4 points, driven by continued low frequency in auto. Expenses in the quarter increased by 40 basis
points to 27.1% as the Hartford Next initiatives were more than offset by an increase in AARP direct
marketing costs and the effect of lower earned premium.

Now turning to Group Benefits. As expected, results for the first quarter were significantly impacted by
excess mortality related to the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19. Since the end of last year, the
number of reported U.S. COVID deaths continued to increase, peaking in January and have since slowly
declined.

Results for the quarter include all-cause excess mortality of $185 million, $13 million of which relates to
additional prior year losses. The excess mortality resulted in a reported loss of $3 million and adversely
impacted the core earnings margin by 9.5 points. Based on current declines in mortality and the impact of
increasing vaccination rates, we expect excess mortality in the range of $40 million to $60 million in the
second quarter.

Disability results for the quarter were favorable. The loss ratio for the quarter was 68.4%, down 3.1 points
from prior year and reflected higher claim recoveries and lower disability claim incidences. Top line results
were solid and reflect strong sales and persistencies. And for the first time since second quarter of 2019,
we reported year-over-year premium growth.

Sales of $512 million for the quarter were greater than the prior year and reflect growth in all market
segments. Paid family and medical leave continues to be a focus for us and was a contributor to the
increase in sales. Persistency on the combined employers' block of business was approximately 91%.

At Hartford Funds, core earnings for the quarter was $45 million, relatively flat with the prior year as
an increase in fee income, reflecting higher market levels, was largely offset by higher operating costs.
Mutual fund net flows were a positive $774 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the prior year quarter
included a benefit of $12 million before tax related to the reduction in contingent consideration associated
with the acquisition of Lattice.

The corporate core loss was $60 million in first quarter of 2021 compared to a loss of $64 million in the
prior year quarter due to lower interest expense and lower insurance, operating costs and other expenses,
partially offset by lower net investment income.

Turning to investments. Net investment income was $509 million for the quarter, up 11% from the prior
year quarter, benefiting from strong limited partnership returns. The total annualized portfolio yield before
tax was 3.8% compared to 3.7% in the first quarter of 2020. The annualized limited partnership return
was 21.1% for the first quarter versus 13.2% in the prior year quarter, driven by higher private equity
returns.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities before tax was $2.3 billion at March 31, down from $3.5 billion at
December 31 due to higher interest rates. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 7.4% since
March 31, 2020, to $47.31 and our trailing 12-month core earnings ROE was 10.9%.

During the quarter, The Hartford returned $239 million to shareholders, including $123 million of share
repurchases and $116 million in common dividends paid. Today, we announced that the Board has
increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion, bringing the authorization through 2022
to $2.5 billion. Our expectation is to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion in 2021, subject to market
conditions.

I'll now turn the call over to Doug.

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

Thanks, Beth. Over the past few years, I've shared a series of priorities, providing updates along the
way. To summarize, we have been increasing the breadth and depth of our product offerings, reshaping
our portfolio and investing in new capabilities for the benefit of customers, distribution partners and
our underwriters. The success of those efforts, supported by a firm ex workers' compensation pricing
environment, is producing consistent ex COVID underlying margin expansion, including 4.3 points in
quarter 1.

The global pandemic certainly interrupted the potential for top line momentum in 2020, creating an
important inflection point for 2021. First quarter Property & Casualty written premium grew 2%, driven by
a strong Commercial Lines result of 4%. I'm pleased with our underlying first quarter results and what it
portends for the rest of the year. I'll start with a few headlines before diving deeper into the micro story.

The P&C underlying combined ratio of 89.4% was outstanding. Commercial Lines produced a stellar ex
COVID underlying combined ratio of 90.1% and Personal Lines contributed with an underlying combined
ratio of 83.5%. Small Commercial new business grew 12% during the first 3 months, contributing to our
largest premium quarter ever. Spectrum's momentum continued with new written premium growth of
32%, a record new business level, beating quarter 4 of 2020. April new business in Small Commercial also
look strong, and we are encouraged by the tailwinds of increasing new business formations. According to
the U.S. Census, new business applications were up 62% in the first quarter.

Global Specialty written premium increased 13%, including new business growth of 10%. With
underwriting actions largely behind us, retention has improved across the board. In the quarter, the
breadth of our growth was very strong, led by 18% in wholesale, 13% in U.S. financial lines and 29% in
international. Global Re also had an excellent quarter with gross written premium growth of 12%.

Across the franchise, cross-sell activities have been robust, outperforming our original deal expectations.
Cross-sell premium between Global Specialty and Middle Market business drove $23 million of new
business in the first quarter and $157 million of new business since the Navigators acquisition. This
success has been fueled by our now broadened specialty capabilities as well as deepened relationships
with retail brokers.

Over the last 18 months, we have added nearly 1,200 product lines and over 250 accounts for our
customers that span both Middle Market and Global Specialty books. Further, our newly acquired retail
excess capabilities have generated over $40 million of cross-sell premium. The results have been
remarkable, and we are just getting started.

Although not a part of our original deal expectations, since the acquisition, we have also added nearly $20
million of financial lines premium for our Small Commercial customers. A few years ago, we set out to
develop a broader and deeper product set. With the Navigators team fully integrated, we are delivering a
more expansive set of solutions and realizing the benefits in our top line results.

Moving to pricing. I'm pleased with the continued strong performance. After several years of firming prices
and underwriting actions, we have materially improved loss performance. As a proof point this quarter,

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Commercial Line's underlying ex COVID loss ratio was 56.9%, 2.4 points better than quarter 1 of last year.
Not surprisingly, rates flattened in certain lines as pricing adequacy has improved measurably.

Global Specialty had another strong pricing quarter of 15% in the U.S. and 28% in international. Middle
Market ex workers' compensation rate change of 9% continues to exceed loss cost trend, although down
approximately 2 points from quarter 4, reflecting a very competitive market. Policy count retention is
strong in Small Commercial, up 2 points from the first quarter of last year. In Middle Market, with most of
our underwriting initiatives behind us, policy retention was up 4 points over the first quarter 2020 result.

Turning to Personal Lines. Written premium declined 4% in the quarter, driven in part by endorsements for
lower miles driven, decreases in moving violations and lower new vehicle sales. As the economy continues
to rebound, all 3 of these factors are expected to provide a lift to top line.

In addition, the 2021 launch of our new Personal Lines auto product, Prevail, is critical to improving
new business levels. A contemporary digital experience, flexibility and advanced data analytics are all
important and exciting elements of this new cloud-based platform. Prevail was released in Arizona and
Illinois at the beginning of the month. We are very pleased with the early results and look forward to a late
summer rollout in several more key states. The new home product will hit the market this summer.

As I wrap up my comments, let me recap. We have been advancing toward this moment for the last 5
years, improving the depth and breadth of our product set, acquiring and developing talent, and building
technological and digital capabilities. The marketplace and our top brokers are taking notice. Due to the
ongoing pandemic, we again postponed our annual broker summit meeting scheduled for this coming
June. In its place, over the past 3 weeks, I have joined our leadership team in virtual regional discussions
with nearly every VIP broker and agent of The Hartford. The feedback on our capabilities and frontline
execution is exceptional. We led from the front during the pandemic, transparently managing difficult
issues ranging from coverage and claim to operational flexibility. As one broker commented during the
call, "The Hartford has transformed itself over these last 2 years and has become our go-to carrier." We
are working hard to earn that position across the marketplace. I'm proud of the player we have become,
delighted with the results we have produced, and excited about our future.

Let me now turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Doug and Beth. The iconic Hartford brand was created over more than 200 years ago. It is a
durable source of competitive advantage and a symbol of strength and confidence. Almost a decade ago,
we initiated a strategic plan which focused on 2 key goals: first, to divest low-ROE, market-sensitive and
capital-intensive individual life insurance and variable annuity businesses; second, to focus on businesses
where our market leadership position and long-term sustainable competitive advantages would generate
profitable growth and superior returns.

The first culminated with the sale of Talcott Resolution in 2018. The second goal was amplified by the 2017
acquisition of Aetna's Group Benefits business, which made us the #2 player based on in-force premium.
Then the 2019 acquisition of Navigators enhanced our product depth and breadth across Commercial Lines
and added new wholesale distribution.

Fast-forward to today, The Hartford is an industry leader with a diverse platform of complementary
businesses, producing industry-leading results. As we move forward, we will leverage our capabilities and
focus as we remain relentless in the pursuit of profitable growth. As evidence of our success, from 2018
to 2020, EPS grew 16%, book value per diluted share grew 20% and we produced an average return on
equity of 13%, more than 300 basis points above the peer average.

As we emerge from the pandemic, we are confident that several macroeconomic factors will provide
meaningful tailwinds, positioning our business for accelerated growth and improved returns. First, the
emergence from the pandemic is expected to reduce excess mortality in our group life business and
worker compensation losses in Commercial Lines.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Secondly, rapidly improving expectations for unemployment, which could be below 5% by the end of
this year, and GDP growth in the mid- to high single digits is expected to drive top line growth in our
employment-centric workers' compensation and Group Benefits businesses. An improving economy will
become an additional catalyst of growth across our Small Commercial segment.

Third, as the underwriting environment remains constructive, P&C commercial renewal pricing is expected
to remain strong, thereby expanding margins. Finally, rising interest rates is anticipated to provide an
incremental benefit to investment portfolio yields. This is a favorable macroeconomic environment for The
Hartford to operate and compete in over the next couple years.

In Commercial Lines, we expect top line growth to benefit from strong pricing, rising exposures due to
the economic expansion and investments in digital capabilities. We also anticipate that reduced operating
expenses will continue to drive margin expansion across all our businesses. We are the market leader in
Small Commercial, a highly sought-after market segment.

We consistently generate sub-90s underlying combined ratios, which benefit from strong distribution, best-
in-class products, efficient technology that eases the underwriting process for our agents and customers.
New business sales from the recent launch of next-gen Spectrum product have been building momentum
since the third quarter of 2020, generating a record level of sales this quarter. We are highly encouraged
by our performance in this segment and new business growth potential.

In Middle & Large Commercial, we expect growth to benefit from continued firm pricing, cross-selling from
an expanded product set stemming from the Navigators acquisition, positive traction across specialized
industry verticals and technology investments. I'm particularly pleased with the cross-sell success that
Doug referenced, along with enhanced underwriting tools and capabilities.

In Global Specialty, the business continues to benefit from the robust pricing environment, improving
margins and retail cross-selling opportunities across standard Commercial Lines accounts. This quarter,
Global Specialty produced written premium growth of 13% and the underlying combined ratio was below
90%. The Navigators acquisition is and will continue to be pivotal in driving growth and underwriting
profits.

In Personal Lines, growth is expected to be driven by the launch of the new auto and homeowners
products, improved underwriting efficiencies, and a new cloud-based technology. Personal Lines margins
in 2020 were certainly helped by less miles driven during the pandemic. And as driving returns to more
normal levels, we expect to deliver profitable growth, enhanced by operating and expense efficiencies.

In our Group Benefits business, we anticipate growth to be driven by higher employment levels, strong
new sales, and growth in voluntary and A&H products. This business post pandemic is expected to produce
strong core earnings margins with a more stable mortality trend beginning in the second half of 2021.

Across each of our businesses, improving operating efficiencies and a lower expense ratio from the
Hartford Next program is a critical driver of margin expansion. In the second quarter of 2020, we detailed
plans to achieve $500 million of savings by 2022. To date, the program has delivered $233 million of
savings. Based on the program's success to date, we are increasing our pretax savings to approximately
$540 million in 2022 and estimating in total $625 million of savings in 2023.

With the expectations for strong financial performance and capital generation driven in part by the
improving macroeconomic environment, we have increased our share repurchase authorization by $1
billion. Our expectation for 2021 is to repurchase $1.5 billion and the remaining balance in 2022. With top
line growth across the business, strong earned pricing trends in excess of loss cost, operating efficiencies,
a reduced COVID impact and continued capital management, we are targeting a core earnings ROE of
approximately 13% to 14% in 2022 and into 2023. This ROE plan positions us to meaningfully outperform
our peers.

Before turning the call over to Q&A, let me address the unsolicited bids we have received from Chubb.
Chubb delivered 2 additional letters to The Hartford since we announced the rejection of their $65
proposal back on March 23. The most recent letter outlined an offer of $70 per share in cash and stock.
We have disclosed letters in our Form 8-K filing today.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

The Board reviewed each letter in consultation with its financial and legal advisers and unanimously
rejected each proposal and concluded that engaging in discussions regarding a strategic transaction is
not in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Board has reaffirmed its confidence and
conviction in the continued execution of The Hartford strategic business plan. As a result, The Hartford
is singularly focused on executing against its goals and objectives, and I will not comment further on the
Chubb matter.

As I said from the outset of my remarks, I'm extremely excited about the future of The Hartford and
incredibly optimistic. We remain highly confident in our stand-alone plan. The Hartford franchise has never
been better positioned to succeed and thrive. We expect to continue to deliver industry-leading financial
performance while creating value for all our stakeholders.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan to begin the Q&A.

Susan Spivak Bernstein
Senior Investor Relations Officer
Thank you, Chris. We have time now to take your questions. Operator, could you please repeat the
instructions for asking a question?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So I guess, aside the Chubb offers, your public posture has shifted. And Chris, you're -- I was watching --
or listening to your comments and reading your presentation. Can you give us some -- give us a sense of
maybe what has shifted or what's changed just in the last couple months that give you the confidence to
come out with these higher ROE targets as we think about '22 and '23?

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Sure, Greg, happy to. I think when we built our plan basically in the fourth quarter of 2020, I mean,
we were still in the midst of, I thought, the worst of the pandemic. If you look at mortality trends, they
were increasing. If you look at sort of just the macro environment, it just was a time to still be a little
cautious. But as we got into 2021, and particularly after we completed the first quarter, we just felt it was
appropriate to rethink the future and disclose what we disclosed today, which I think is very positive news.

It's more of a growth story, obviously. It's a margin expansion story coming out of a continued P&C pricing
environment. It's an efficiency and expense story. And you put it all together, particularly with the excess
capital that we have, it really turns out to be a very robust ROE story. And we wanted to tell investors here
in the first quarter.

Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And it makes sense. Yes, I'd like to pivot to Slide 6 of your investor slide deck where you talk about
the Commercial Lines results. And Doug, I know you were talking a lot about price trends. And I was
looking at the rate increase chart. And one of the comments you made is that some of the lines have
approached rate adequacy. Can you give us more color on what's going on in the different segments as it
relates to price, especially in the context of loss cost trends?

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

Sure. So as I think about our markets, and I know you know this, much of the pricing activity that has
occurred in a positive way over the last couple years sits in the Middle Market and the specialty franchises.
So we'll start with specialty. If you think about some of the products that we deliver to the market, we've
seen quite strong pricing now moving into a third renewal. And at some point, as you work your way
through those pricing trends, even from points that needed quite a bit of pricing, we feel like we're in a
much better state.

Loss trends, we're still staying on top of loss trends. But if you think about the specialty lines, we just look
across that portfolio, given our pricing and re-underwriting actions, I think you have to look at them in a
combination sense. We feel very good about our selections and just see strong ROE and strong margin
performance that has improved over the last couple years.

The same is largely true in Middle and Large Commercial. If you go back and look at our trends that
we've shared, particularly ex workers' comp pricing, a strong run over 5 or 6 quarters, coupled with our
underwriting actions, that book is much more rate-adequate today across sectors, across geographies.
And we feel good as we look into the latter half of '21 into '22.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Makes sense. And then the other thing that you announced as part of your earnings release and
preannouncement was this -- the litigation settlement relating to Boy Scouts. I know you probably don't
really want to comment on specific accounts, but there's still the lingering uncertainty regarding business
interruption. Can you give us some sense about your approach to how you deal with these cases as
they come up, whether it's a bankruptcy case or the -- what you're doing from a reserve standpoint for
business interruption? Just because we haven't seen a lot of other news from your competitors. Just give
us -- an updated perspective would be helpful.

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Greg, I would share a couple points with you, one, regarding Boy Scouts and then the second on BI. I
would say Boy Scouts obviously is just a very unique situation. We've been in lengthy and meaningful
discussions and intense negotiations with them for a lengthy period of time that ultimately culminated
in providing what I thought was a fair settlement for all parties. And it really sort of puts this behind us.
Because when you really looked at the risk of these -- some of these policies going back into the '70s,
they were on aggregated risk policies as most of those policies were issued during that time. So if you
think in terms of the nature of the industry, being sexual molestation, it just -- there are not good facts
there.

Now on the other hand, we felt we had prudent defenses and legal postures to ultimately defend
ourselves. But that would have been costly, that would have been lengthy. And as Boy Scouts are trying
to emerge from bankruptcy, there was an opportunity and we seized it to work with them to develop the
settlement that we did. The settlement ultimately still needs to be approved later this year, but we're
optimistic it will get the bankruptcy court approval. So what I would share with you, I don't see anything
else in our portfolio close to resembling what the Boy Scouts exposures are. I feel good about the reserves
that we have for any exposures, but particularly the sexual molestation types of reserves that we carry on
the books today.

On the BI matter, I think why you're not hearing everything is because, quite honestly, it's going pretty
well. I think the vast majority of courts, both state and federal, are interpreting the policy language
as we've anticipated. I think you've heard me say that our policy language is clear, unambiguous. The
virus does not cause physical damage to the property. Shutdowns were governments-ordered for safety
reasons. And I think it will ultimately continue to play out favorably over time. We haven't changed our
reserve posture. We continue to carry expense reserves for litigation. But we do not carry any incurred
losses for business interruption exposures.

Operator

Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first question is on the buyback front. So you guys raised the authorization today and added to
what you're going to repurchase in both years. So can you just give us a sense of what changed for you
to be more incrementally bullish on the capital return over the next 2 years? And then to finance the
incremental buyback to the dividends you're expecting from your subs for this year, have those changed?
Or is it just coming from excess capital at the holding company?

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Elyse, I'll comment on sort of the why and then Beth could comment on the details. So as I tried
to say in our opening, it just -- as we got into this year, just -- we're more encouraged on the economy
and the recovery. You could feel our growth orientation. You could see it in really our first quarter results,
where top line is really moving from a growth side. And when you put it all together, we looked out over
the number of years and we just have greater clarity and certainty that the pandemic is in the rearview
mirror. And we upped our share authorization that the Board ultimately supported.

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Then Elyse, as it relates to funding the share repurchases for this year, it really is a combination of
using cash at the holding company as well as increasing slightly the dividend that we'd expect from the
P&C subsidiary. So we had said about $850 million to $900 million. And we're probably going to be more
in like the $900 million to $1.1 billion for this year.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And so the $900 million to $1.1 billion for this year, would that also be kind of good expectations as we
think about 2022 baseline?

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I would definitely see it in that range to maybe even slightly higher. But yes, that's what we're
thinking about.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then in terms of the commercial underlying margin, you guys laid out a 2 point improvement
target for 2022. Can you help give us a sense of how much of that is loss ratio-driven versus expense
ratio-driven from Hartford Next? And what is the pricing -- Commercial Lines pricing assumptions that you
have embedded within that underlying margin guidance?

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

So I'll start and then I'll let Doug follow up. But as we think about those -- that 2 points, I would say it's
roughly half and half between loss ratio and expense ratio improvement.

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

And Elyse, as we think about pricing, although we did not disclose and will not disclose all the specific
details, generally, as we work our way through '21, we expect to see more of what we saw in the first
quarter. And as we move into '22, we think pricing probably will come off a little bit but still in shape to
deal with loss cost trend in various lines.

Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Does that 2022 guidance assume an inflection within the workers' comp pricing environment?

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

Certainly, in '21 on the written side, it suggests several quarters that look like the first quarter. And then
I think we'll have to see about '22 and '23 as we get there but generally, a stable, slightly improving
workers' comp pricing environment.

Operator

And our next question comes from Mark Dwelle of RBC.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Yes. Just a further question related to the buyback. And I know buybacks are very popular with investors
and usually considered a good use of capital. But I guess, given the share valuation and the growth
options that you seem to have in front of you, why is increasing the buyback the best use of an additional
$1 billion to $1.5 billion of funds as compared to pursuing accretive acquisitions or just other internal
growth opportunities?

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Mark. I would say we have plenty of capital to fund all our growth ambitions. So it's not a, I'll call it,
either-or decision. We have capital to grow. We expect to generate additional capital in the future and --
but I think that the simple fact is we have been, I thought, wise during the pandemic with our capital and
making sure that we can absorb any potential shocks that still might be out there.

And then as it relates to M&A, I think I've been pretty consistent. It's just a low priority for us right now.
And the reason it's a low priority is I really believe we have everything, as I say colloquially, in the building
to compete over the long term. It's maturing it, it's making sure our agents and brokers fully understand
all our capabilities that we've built or added over the years, and that's what we're focused on. And I think
that's an appropriate strategy for where we are in our development right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays.

Tracy Dolin-Benguigui
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Appreciate seeing the written correspondences between The Hartford and Chubb in your 8-K. I mean,
letters are one thing, but there's a human side of the story. Wondering, Chris, if you and Evan ever got in
a room together to actually engage in a meaningful discussion in your due diligence. Why not hear the guy
out?

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I would just share with you, we're still in a pandemic, so that did not happen. And if you really look
at our statements and our messages that the Board has put out, I mean it's pretty clear that we had no
interest in doing that because of ultimately the conviction and commitment around executing our business
plan. So that's what I would say, Tracy.

Tracy Dolin-Benguigui
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. So even virtually speaking, you mentioned the pandemic, that didn't happen?

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

It's been mostly letter correspondence.

Tracy Dolin-Benguigui
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then something else on Chubb, sorry. We dug up your Boy Scouts Association mediation
settlement. And there was a direct mention of Chubb in that report where you would actually get a
settlement discount depending on how Chubb's settlement shapes up. What is that all about?

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Yes. I would just generally characterize it as a term and condition that Boy Scouts agreed to that
ultimately tried to be equitable with all carriers in their exposures and not favor one group versus the
other. So it works as a most-favored-nations type clause.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.

Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So two questions here. The first one, I'm just curious, Beth, on the guidance, what is your interest rate
assumption on the ROE targets? Are you assuming interest rates are up here? How about kind of rates
versus new money yields versus book yields?

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So when we make our projections, we really look at sort of just following the forward curve and what
we would expect to see there. And again, even though rates are going up, just because they're going up in
the near term, we'd expect to see some marginal benefit from that. But really, that comes out in the outer
years, just given the way that our portfolio turns over. And so when I think about investment yield sort of
ex limited partnerships over the next 2 years, I kind of see it sort of consistent with where we are today.

Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Terrific. And then my second question, because I'm just curious, I appreciate you don't want to talk about
the Chubb situation. But I guess, my question is this, what would it take, you think, for the Board to
believe that they've got a fiduciary obligation to talk to a potential acquirer?

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Yes, you're right. Yes, Brian, you're right. I'm not going to talk about it because I think our statements are
clear and unambiguous as far as our intentions, our views. We know our fiduciary duties. So that's all I'm
going to say, Brian.

Operator

And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Crédit Suisse.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Maybe focusing again, I know there's been a lot of questions and good color on the ROE guidance, I think
in the past you kind of -- you said the anchor was around -- it was 12%. And now you're saying 12% to
13%. And if I look at...

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

13% to 14%, Mike.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

13% to 14%, okay.

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

13% to 14%, just to make sure.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. It's been a busy morning. So if I look at consensus, I think consensus for '22, for example, is high
11s, what I'm looking at. And so there seems to be a big delta. So I'm curious if you have opinions on
where -- what the consensus may be underappreciating other than clearly you've upped the buyback
guidance versus consensus this morning.

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's probably the biggest item. So I think you've just got to go back, update your models, put
everything that we talked about into your models today, and I think you will be very pleased.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And so there's -- I guess there's one element that I get at, which I think it's tougher for us to fully
appreciate, and might be kind of on the reserve release side. So you don't think that, that could be an
element that The Street is underappreciating?

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Obviously, we don't project and guide to reserve releases because we make our best estimates every
quarter. But I think some analysts, as you know, do take a view and do their own homework on reserves
and potential releases. And I think those that do their homework and really understand the reserving
philosophy and how we've set our picks over the last couple years will come to a point of view that is most
likely positive.

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

The only thing I would add to that is I do think given the color that we provided on what we expect for
underlying margin improvement in Commercial Lines and -- I think that's another factor to be looked at.
And again, I think we've provided some road map there for folks to absorb.

Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And my last question is on the commercial pricing environment. And I guess if you would like to
comment on Personal Lines too, feel free. But my question is it feels -- you're the second carrier to kind of
talk about rates coming down from very healthy levels. Kind of curious, is it a function of Hartford kind of
being willing to pull off the gas a little bit, too, to enable growth? Or is it more just market conditions are
causing pricing to fall? Or is it a mix of both? I guess one carrier that plays in a little different of a sandbox
than Hartford kind of basically was saying that they're willing to pull off the gas because pricing levels are
healthy and they feel good about margin improvement. So just kind of curious if any color there on the
market dynamics.

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

I would say it's a multifaceted answer. There's geography, there's class, there's size. There are all different
dynamics in it. And what I tried to say in my opening answer to a question is that generally across our
books of business, we are feeling much more rate-adequate today. So that does change our competitive
mode in the marketplace. But it is all driven by line, it's driven by account experience and so -- like it is so
hard to just give you one answer that fits everything. There's a different set of priorities we have in Global
Specialty and you can see the progress we've made there.

And then I will offer that the power that the re-underwriting, retuning these books of business have,
transformed themselves over the past 18 months, is also very much a part of our loss performance today.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

So I would never use the words, foot off the accelerator. I don't think about it like that. What I care deeply
about is our returns by line, our retentions across key customer segments, our segmentation strategies,
et cetera. And I feel right now, when I look across our books, very solid about where we are and how we
move into the latter half of '21 as we manage all of those indicators.

Operator

And our next question comes from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess just a question first just on the Group Benefits guide, the margin guide to 6% to 7% in 2022. I
guess, I'm just wondering why that is still -- it's down versus where your guide was in 2020, consistent
with 2021 ex COVID. But it does seem like you have a bit more expense save. So wondering if you could
unpack that just a little bit.

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Sure, David. I think the simple answer is, we've talked about it in the past, that the year-over-year
improvements and incidences being driven down in recoveries and in favorable developments -- favorable
prior year developments, all is going to sort of revert back to a mean. And what that really means is that
our current accident year, in essence, accident year loss ratios we established, are going to be closer to
ultimate than they were 5 years ago, when they were quite a bit higher. So it's still a margin -- a 6%
to 7% margin in that business still produces a solid double-digit ROE. IRRs are strong. So it's a healthy
margin. But particularly with all the prior year reserve releases, we just don't see that happening going
forward just because our current picks are established a lot lower.

David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay, got it. That makes sense. And then Chris, I guess you spoke to, in response to an earlier question,
just about how there aren't really any product gaps you feel like at HIG. I guess one thing I'm wondering
is coming at it from a bit -- the other side of it and specifically thinking about the Mutual Funds business,
I guess I'm just wondering if you could just remind me what the strategic importance of the Mutual Funds
business is in the context of the broader organization of Hartford. I understand it does produce around
$100 million to $150 million of cash every year. So that's obviously an important consideration. But maybe
just help me think just how it fits strategically with your other businesses.

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I think you got it right. I mean it is a good business. It's a growing business. It's creating shareholder
value. We get nice returns and dividends. It's a high IRR, ROE business. And we view it as an investment.
It's sort of a stand-alone business unit in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. It doesn't take very much
management time. And I think we enjoy the benefits of a business unit that is growing in value, creating
value. And as long as they remain relevant, we're happy to own it. It shares the Hartford brand name with
us. That means something in sort of the independent investment adviser space, so -- but I view it as an
investment totally, David.

Operator

And our next question comes from Jim Bhullar of JPMorgan.

Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So first, I had a question for Chris. On your statement that like a $70 offer is not in the best interest of
shareholders, I'm just wondering if you could discuss what the basis for that is. If you -- like is it based on

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

your earnings power, other offers you could receive or whatever else the basis is for that statement? And
then secondly, for Doug, if you could talk about how you think about workers' compensation loss trends. If
the economy continues to heat up, do you think there's a likelihood of an uptick in losses in that line?

Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO

Jimmy, I'll start. Again, I'm not going to comment. I think our disclosures on this again were crystal clear
as far as what the Board went through and why it decided what it did. And beyond that, I'm not going to
comment any further, Jimmy.

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

On the workers' comp question, Jimmy, I would say this, as we come through the pandemic out the back
side of it, we're watching carefully frequency and severity. We've had our eye on severity for the last
couple of years, just wondering might we see a little bit of a surge relative to long haulers on COVID
or other parts of our platform. But we have not come off our long-range assumptions for loss trend in
either severity -- and yes, we do expect frequency will return to more normal levels as we get out into '21
second half and '22.

Operator

And our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Bank of America.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Securities, Research Division

We've talked in the last couple of calls about how AARP is allowing you to non-renew customers who come
into the pool if they turn out not to be attractive customer types. I don't really detect any change in the
trends in the Personal Lines business. Has that been implemented yet? And is there a way that we'll detect
new customer acquisition coming in as an inflection?

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

Josh, most of those states, we have now implemented that activity effective 1st of the year. It's going
to take a little bit of time for that to work its way in. And obviously it's a big component of our pricing
relative to the new auto product, Prevail, and our homeowners product mid-summer. So we expect in
the future you'll see more impact from not only that but a number of changes we've made in the product
profile going forward.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then on -- if I net out the Boy Scouts charge in the disclosure on favorable development by
line of business, I'm just -- it looks to me it was a very, very favorable quarter for GL. Can we talk about
accident years, how they're maturing and what sort of led to that? And maybe I'm misreading it.

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Josh, I think you're misreading that. We haven't disclosed specifically what component of the
general liability piece was Boy Scouts, but I can tell you it was a significant piece of that. So I wouldn't do
a significant read-through as it relates to more current years for general liability.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Securities, Research Division

But broadly speaking, am I right in saying that it was a very favorable quarter for you? It seems like the
math works out that, that's...

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

For general liability?

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Securities, Research Division

Or broadly in commercial, maybe it's not all...

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, I think broadly in commercial, I agree. If you back out the general liability piece, and you can see
that we continue to have favorable development in workers' compensation and package business. So yes,
I think the trends are pretty clearly laid out in our investor financial supplement.

Joshua David Shanker
BofA Securities, Research Division

And so coming back to the question, what years are really causing this? I mean you don't have to be so
specific. But is there a way of like sort of thinking about how different years are maturing?

Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So for the workers' compensation piece, it's really more in the 2017 and prior is where that
favorability is coming from. Very limited in the current years because again it takes a little bit for those to
season. And I would say the same thing with the package business, it's more 2015 and prior.

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

Josh, I would just add this. Maybe this will help a little bit. We were carrying reserves for BSA prior to
this quarter, right? So we haven't disclosed all the particulars, but you just need to know that we've been
following those activities over the last several quarters, several years, et cetera. That just should be part
of your analysis.

Operator

And our last question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

A question for Doug to begin. I guess, if we're heading into an unprecedented economic recovery with the
reversal of the pandemic and, I guess, possibly government stimulus, can you talk about the risk of other
lines, besides workers' compensation, seeing unanticipated frequency?

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

Meyer, we're watching all those signals, obviously. As we've shared this morning, we think we have
optimism in our top line approach. But clearly, we're watching loss trends and liability relative to
courts becoming more open as dockets fill up and begin to work their way through. We're watching
the automobile market. We expect more cars on the highways, et cetera, so we're watching frequency
there. We're watching across all our lines. We're watching our specialty lines, D&O, management liability,
employment practices, et cetera.

So yes, we have our eye on the frequency dynamic and the severity component as well. This is an
active time. The backside of '21 will look different, we feel, than the first 6 months of 2020. But we're
encouraged and we'll stay vigilant, and we'll adjust pricing and appetite accordingly.

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just a really yes or no question. If we see wages rise, does that translate
into severity on the indemnity component of workers' compensation in your book?

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

Wage, pure wage, without number of employees?

Meyer Shields
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Yes.

Douglas Graham Elliot
President

Okay. I mean pure wage should be a hedge against loss trend, just pure wage, so whether it's merit of
2.5%, 3%. Now if we talk about wages due to number of workers, that is a different dynamic that we will
manage our way through frequency and severity with.
