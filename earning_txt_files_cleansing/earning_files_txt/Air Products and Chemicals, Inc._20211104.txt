Presentation

Operator

Good morning and welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's
call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments
made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved.

Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore.

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Thank you, Christina. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings
Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations
and Sustainability. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO;
Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our
comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are
available on our website at airproducts.com.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement
disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2. In addition, throughout today's
discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we
refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, both on a company-
wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings
per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return
on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial
measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.

Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to
be on our call today. Before we discuss the results, I would like to say that despite the well-known global
challenges in 2020 and 2021, the talented, committed and motivated people of Air Products demonstrated
resilience and resolve and delivered excellent results, and in addition, continue to execute our growth
strategy. I want to thank every one of our employees for standing together, working hard and delivering
for our customers and shareholders.

Now please turn to Slide #3, where you can see some of our key highlights for this year. We delivered
strong EPS this year, achieving 11% compounded annual growth since fiscal year 2014, and we
increased the dividend for the 39th consecutive year. We were again recognized by prestigious raters and
organizations for outstanding sustainability performance, including one we just announced this week, the
EcoVadis for the fifth year in a row.

Our growth strategy and sustainability strategy are one and the same. And to that end, we proudly
completed the asset acquisition and project financing transaction for the $12 billion Jazan joint venture
with Aramco, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra, as we announced last week. In conjunction with
the government of Canada and the province of Alberta, we announced the new net-zero hydrogen
energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This modest-scale energy complex will begin with a
transformative $1 billion net-zero hydrogen production and liquefaction facility expected onstream in
2024.

And just a few weeks ago, we announced the $4.5 billion world-class clean energy complex in Louisiana.
Air Products will build, own and operate this mega project, which will produce over 750 million standard

cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen for local and global markets by 2026. We will also capture and
permanently sequester 5 million metric tons per year of carbon dioxide, making it the largest carbon
capture for sequestration facility in the world.

By combining our core strengths and competencies, we successfully develop, execute and operate these
larger-scale gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen projects to address the significant energy and
environmental needs of the world. This is fully aligned with our higher purpose as a company.

Now please turn to Slide #4. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products,
and our goal will always be to achieve 0 accidents and incidents. Despite the challenging COVID-19
condition this year, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help
protect our own employees, our customers and our communities. We are pleased with the focus by the
team that improved our safety performance in fiscal year '21 versus last year.

Slides #5, 6 and 7, which we have shared with you many times before, includes our goal, our
management philosophy and our five-point strategic plan. These are the principles that we follow every
day, and they will continue to guide us in the future.

Now please turn to Slide #8. As we speak, world leaders are gathered in Glasgow to work on closing the
gap between climate aspirations and climate action. We are actively engaged in this rapidly evolving global
dialogue and committed to ensuring that Air Products is best positioned to deliver on behalf of all of our
stakeholders through this critical period of energy transition. We believe a successful energy transition
requires successful development and execution of large-scale mega projects. Without that, the job cannot
be done. The scope and complexity of these projects require talented people with a variety of skills and
backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team.

This is the higher purpose of our company. We can overcome the world's significant energy and
environmental sustainability challenges with our focus and united people working together to provide real
solutions for our customers.

Now please turn to Slide #9. As I have said before, we believe that hydrogen is one of the energy sources
of the future along with electricity. We are scaling hydrogen production and developing a structure --
infrastructure to ensure this successful adoption as a sustainable fuel. Hydrogen will be the sustainable
fuel of the future. Our customers count on us to deliver this hydrogen produced in a highly efficient
manner.

Meanwhile, we are making significant investments in new facilities to produce low-carbon and carbon-
free hydrogen made from hydrocarbons. By executing on new clean hydrogen projects in Alberta and
Louisiana, we will be a leader in blue hydrogen as well as green hydrogen as we continue to execute our
innovative new green hydrogen project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Now with that background, I'm happy to turn the call over to Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating
Officer, to talk about our major projects. Dr. Serhan?

Samir J. Serhan
Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10, which highlights our key growth projects. We are committed
to our growth strategy and continue to execute and pursue exciting projects around the world. In June,
we announced the world-scale $1 billion net-zero hydrogen project in Alberta, Canada, with the strong
support of the Canadian federal and local governments. This project will use natural gas to make net-zero
hydrogen, which has the same zero carbon footprint as a green hydrogen made from renewable energy.
95% of the CO2 resulting from our net-zero project will be permanently sequestered, and the remaining
5% will be offset by exporting a clean electricity produced by the clean hydrogen. The project provides a
road map for hydrocarbon-based economies to significantly reduce their CO2 emissions.

Just a few weeks ago, we had the honor of joining the Governor of Louisiana and state officials to
announce our world-scale $4.5 billion blue hydrogen project. This will also be the world's largest
permanent CO2 sequestration operation. This project will provide clean hydrogen to our customers along

our 700-mile U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system and also produce blue ammonia, targeting heavy
transport around the world. The pipeline will be able to carry a variety of carbon intensity hydrogen,
including gray and blue.

These 2 projects will use advanced gasification technologies available to Air Products to produce clean
hydrogen while using hydrocarbon feedstock in a sustainable way. Both projects also combine in one
project the 3 pillars of our growth strategy: gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen.

We have made good progress on our Jiutai project, and we expect the facility to be onstream in fiscal year
'23. We also expect the Debang project onstream in fiscal year '23.

Successful execution of the Gulf Coast ammonia project continues with field construction on Air Products'
largest single train, 175 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen steam methane reformer as
well as the related 90 million standard cubic feet per day nitrogen ASU facility and related utilities.
Construction is also progressing well on the 30-mile hydrogen pipeline network expansion to our world's
largest hydrogen pipeline network. The project onstream schedule remains as originally planned for the
first half of fiscal year '23.

We're forging ahead in Indonesia and making good progress despite some challenges with COVID. We
expect to complete this project in '25.

For NEOM, as you can see in the picture on the slide, we are laying the groundwork for the project,
preparing the land and doing detailed engineering. We're even more excited now about this project since
our announcement last year. We're forecasting to export the zero carbon hydrogen in the form of ammonia
in 2026.

In addition to our mega projects, Air Products has also continued to make significant investments in small
and midsized on-site generators in our regional industrial gases business with fiscal year '21 being a
record year for investments in this category. These on-site plants, which typically have project investment
values from USD 0.5 million to USD 50 million, cover a range of technologies from a PRISM hydrogen
generators; PRISM oxygen VSA, vacuum swing adsorption; and small/midsized PRISM ASUs. Specifically,
fiscal year '21 was a record year for investments in our PRISM Oxygen VSA product line, with the new
projects in North America, Europe, India, China and South Korea predominantly supplying several major
glass manufacturers around the world. The Oxygen VSAs are frequently integrated with Air Products'
oxy-fuel burner technology, which help reduce emissions, provide fuel savings, improve productivity and
deliver operational savings for the customer.

Now I'm pleased to turn the call back to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Please turn to Slide #11. As we shared with you last week, we, along with our
joint venture partners, completed the asset acquisition and project financing transaction of the $12 billion
air separation unit, gasification and power joint venture with Aramco, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra
in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, making a significant milestone after the hard work of our people as well as our
customers and partners. The project return is expected to be better than we originally envisioned.

As we said last week, we expect Phase 1 of the project to contribute an annual run rate of $0.80 to $0.85
of earnings per share, starting as of last week. The project is expected to contribute about $1.35 to $1.40
for the first 10 years after first -- Phase 2 closes.

Now please turn to Slide #12, which shows our EPS growth. We remain vigilant and motivated to
deliver excellent financial results, consistent with our strategy. As you can see, we have delivered 11%
annual EPS growth on average since 2014 while laying a strong foundation for our future growth. The
excellent results and key milestones we have achieved this year are just the beginning of our journey,
delivering gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen solutions to the world. I am very optimistic about our
company's prospects, completing -- participating in a very meaningful way in the energy transition.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Now please turn to Slide #13. As a reminder, we share our earnings growth directly with our investors.
Both our EPS and dividend have grown by double digits since 2014. We are committed to deliver increased
dividend while we continue to execute our growth opportunities. We have significant cash flow that
supports our substantial dividend. And as you know, we have increased that now for the 39th consecutive
year.

And finally, Slide #14, as always, my favorite slide, shows that our EBITDA margins are up 1,100 basis
points since 2014. Our margin is down in recent quarters, impacted by higher energy pass-through, which
increases our sales but doesn't impact profits. 2/3 of the margin decline from our peak margin is due to
the impact of higher energy pass-through. But I do want to stress that we are determined and focused on
improving our margins back to around 40% by increasing prices to cover significant increases in energy
costs and by improving productivity.

Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, to discuss our results in more detail. Melissa?

Melissa N. Schaeffer
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Seifi. We have made great strides [ at building ] our growth strategy this year, completing
multiple projects and winning exciting new projects. At the same time, we continue to focus our base
business and deliver excellent results for the quarter and the year. We grew our EPS 8% this year,
overcoming various external challenges and absorbing the cost of additional resources needed to support
our growth strategy. Our distributable cash flow remains strong at $2.7 billion. Furthermore, these large-
scale projects currently under development will substantially add to our earnings once we bring them on
stream.

I share Seifi's conviction that for Air Products, the best is indeed yet to come. This is a testament to the
hard work and commitment of the people of Air Products. And I, too, want to thank them.

Now please turn to Slide 15 for more details on our full year results. Sales grew 17% to more than $10
billion. Volume and price together gained 7%. The 5% volume growth was primarily driven by our EMEA
and Global Gases segment. Although the adverse impact from the pandemic has eased through the year,
it still had a negative impact on FY '21. Price improved every quarter in all 3 regions and across most
major product lines. Overall, price increased 2% and our merchant price was up 5%. EBITDA was up 7%,
approaching $4 billion due to favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income, which was partially
offset by higher costs.

EBITDA margin declined 330 basis points, of which 200 basis points are attributed to higher energy pass-
through, which increases sales but negatively impacts margin. ROCE was 160 basis points lower. The
increase in the denominator from our additional $5 billion of debt raised last year reduced ROCE by about
300 basis points. Adjusting for the cash on our balance sheet, our ROCE would be 14.2%. We expect
ROCE to improve as we deploy the cash and bring projects onstream.

Now please turn to Slide 16 for a discussion of full year EPS. Our full year adjusted EPS from continuing
operations was up $0.64 or 8%. Price net of variable cost was again strong, favorable $0.34, the fourth
consecutive year of double-digit EPS net price improvement. Volume was flat as acquisitions, new plants,
merchant recovery and higher sale of equipment activity were offset by lower contribution from Lu'An.
Different business mix caused volume to have a positive impact on sales but minimum impact on profit.

Our costs were $0.46 unfavorable, primarily due to the addition of resources to support our future growth
and higher planned maintenance costs. Currency was favorable $0.35, primarily driven by the Chinese
RMB, euro, British pound and South Korean won. Our equity affiliates also had strong underlying business
results, adding $0.23, with several joint ventures reporting stronger medical oxygen sales.

Nonoperating income was $0.16 favorable, primarily due to lower pension expense. Interest expense was
$0.12 favorable due to the $5 billion of debt to support our future growth projects. Our effective tax rate
of 18.9% was roughly equal to last year, and we expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2022.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Now please turn to Slide 17 for a brief discussion on our fourth quarter results. Compared to last year,
sales increased 22% to more than $2.8 billion. Volume, price, energy pass-through and currencies were
all up. Volume improved 9% as strong hydrogen and merchant demand and new assets more than offset
reduced Lu'An contribution.

Prices were up again with improvement in all 3 regions. This is the 17th consecutive quarter of year-
over-year price gain. Overall, prices were up 3% in total, which equaled a 6% increase for the merchant
business. We experienced significantly higher energy costs in our merchant business this quarter. The
situation is particularly challenging in EMEA due to the extremely high natural gas and electricity costs.

Our onsite business, about half of our total company's sales, has contractual protection from energy cost
fluctuations. We are actively executing additional price actions across product lines to recover the higher
energy costs impacting our merchant business.

EBITDA climbed 11%, exceeding $1 billion mark as favorable volume, price, currency and equity affiliate
income more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points primarily due to higher
energy pass-through, which negatively impacted margins by about 300 basis points. Sequentially, sales
were up 9%, supported by 5% stronger volumes and 1% higher price. EBITDA grew 7% sequentially as
better volume, price and equity affiliate income more than offset higher energy costs.

Now please turn to Slide 18. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.51, which is $0.32 or 15% above
last year. Volume was a favorable $0.19 and price, net of variable costs contributed $0.04 as our price
increases exceeded variable cost inflation driven by higher power costs.

Like the prior few quarters, our plans to add resources and strengthen our organization to support growth
have increased our costs. We also saw higher costs due to disruptions across the supply chain in all
3 regions. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.06, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and
British pound. Equity affiliate income added $0.09 on strong underlying business results. The $0.04 of
nonoperating income was primarily driven by lower pension expense. The effective tax rate of 18.1% was
130 basis points higher than last year due to the last year's higher share-based compensation benefits and
a tax benefit associated with the PBF acquisition.

Now please turn to Slide 19. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash
flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.7 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $12
per share. From our EBITDA of about $3.9 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note
that our maintenance capital is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global
headquarters, which is essentially now complete.

From the distributable cash flow, we paid $0.45 or about $1.3 billion as dividends to our shareholders and
still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow,
even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends
and capital deployment.

Slide #20 provides an update of our capital deployment. As we discussed last quarter, we've extended our
time horizon another 5 years to fiscal 2027. We see tremendous project opportunities beyond 2022 and
the investment potential far exceeding the original capacity of $15 billion.

Based on this updated view, we see our capital deployment potential reaching approximately $34 billion
through fiscal 2027. The $34 billion includes roughly $10 billion of cash and additional debt capacity
available today, almost $17 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and about $7 billion already spent.
We still believe this figure is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which
generates additional cash flow, and therefore, additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on
managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating.

So you can see we have already spent 21% and have already committed 67% of the updated capacity we
show here. I should note that this is as of September 30, so it does not reflect the closing of the Jazan
Phase 1 but does include the Louisiana project.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Before I turn the call back to Seifi, I would like to share with you that we plan to reorganize our reporting
segments starting in Q1 of FY '22. Our EMEA segment will be separated into Europe and a Middle East and
India segment to reflect the addition of the significant Jazan project in the Middle East segment and to
provide more visibility for our geographic regions. In addition, our Global Gases and Corporate segment
will be combined. We will provide historical resegmented financial information before the year-end.

Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you very much, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #21 for our Asia results. Sales increased 6%
compared to last year on 5% favorable currencies and 1% positive price increase, the 18th consecutive
quarter of year-on-year price improvement in this region. Volumes were flat with new plants, mostly
outside of China, offsetting the lower Lu'An contribution. Regarding Lu'An, there is no change for the --
from the previous updates that we have given you. The plant continues to operate at full capacity despite
the coal shortage in China. As I said last quarter, under the interim supply agreement, we are recognizing
reduced fees through fiscal year '22 before we return to the full year fee in 2023.

This quarter, China's effort to reduce energy usage and intensity, the so-called dual control had a modest
adverse effect on our results. It reduced some merchant customers' demand and caused isolated
disruptions in operations. We continue to monitor this developing situation very closely. In the long term,
though, we do see positive growth opportunities as China continues to focus on reducing its carbon
intensity.

EBITDA for this region grew 3%, supported by favorable currencies and price. Costs compared unfavorably
primarily due to higher variable energy costs, resources needed to support project and start-ups, the
timing of China government incentives last year and the disruption called by its dual control policy to
reduce energy consumption. Sequentially, EBITDA and margins were lower as higher costs more than
offset better volumes. Price is up but rounded to 0.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan to talk about our Americas results. Dr. Serhan?

Samir J. Serhan
Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 22 for a review of our Americas results. Sales increased more
than 20% versus last year, and EBITDA posted another double-digit gain. Volume grew 3%, primarily
due to better hydrogen and merchant demand. Although Hurricane Ida interrupted our U.S. Gulf Coast
operations this quarter, our team worked very hard to limit the impact to our business. While most of our
merchant products have returned to pre-COVID levels, our hydrogen volume has increased but has not
yet fully recovered. Demand for jet fuel, which consumes more hydrogen on a unit basis compared to
gasoline, is still lagging. Also, the industry continued to use more light sweet crude, which requires less
hydrogen. We are confident in the long-term growth of hydrogen demand, particularly in the U.S. Gulf
Coast.

Price for the quarter was again strong. The 4% gain for the region was equivalent to 10% on the merchant
business. Price was better across all major products. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year
price improvement. Energy cost pass-through drove a 15% sales increase with the much higher natural
gas prices. EBITDA was 16% ahead of last year as positive volume price at our equity affiliate income and
lower maintenance costs more than offset higher inflation. EBITDA margin was 230 basis points lower.
However, energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by approximately 500 basis
points. In other words, EBITDA margin would have been significantly up excluding energy pass-through.
Sequentially, energy pass-through drove margin 250 basis points lower.

Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa
region results. Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales jumped
33% versus last year and EBITDA was up 14%. Volume was strong, increasing 14%, driven primarily by
improved hydrogen and merchant demand and new assets.

Our liquid bulk partially recovered from the pandemic, but packaged gases and hydrogen are still below
pre-COVID levels. Price increased for the 15th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major
product lines and subregions. The 4% price gain for the region corresponds to a 6% improvement for the
merchant business.

Consistent with what most consumers and businesses are experiencing, our European business faced
unprecedented energy cost escalation this quarter. Supply chain-related interruptions further exacerbated
the difficult situation. Our team has done an excellent job coping with these challenges, executing pricing
actions and keeping our customers supplied.

As Melissa said, our onsite contracts allow us to pass through the higher energy costs. For our merchant
business, we continue to work hard to recover the recent cost increases through additional pricing actions
already underway.

Currencies were favorable 3%, primarily due to the strong British pound versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA
was up 14% to about $230 million, primarily due to the strong volume, while better price, equity affiliate
income and favorable currencies offset most of the energy cost increase. EBITDA margin was down 560
basis points, with higher energy pass-through responsible for about 400 basis points. The remaining
roughly 150 basis point reduction was mainly attributable to unfavorable costs, partially offset by
favorable equity affiliate income and better volume.

Compared to prior quarter, sales climbed 8% primarily due to pass-through, while positive price and
volume were offset by unfavorable currencies. Operating income was 3% below last quarter as the positive
price and volume were more than offset by higher costs. Meanwhile, EBITDA was 8% higher due to the
inclusion of positive equity affiliate income.

And as Melissa mentioned, we will separate the current EMEA segment into 2 segments, Europe and
Middle East and India, starting next quarter.

Now please turn to Slide 24, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as
well as central costs. Sales and profit were up on higher project activities. We continue to add resources to
support project development.

Please turn to Slide 25, Corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate
costs. Corporate segment sales were higher this quarter, driven by increased project activities as we
continue to execute multiple large LNG and other projects, but profit was lower on higher corporate costs.
Sequentially, sales and profits were better than last quarter. Again, as Melissa said, we will combine Global
and Corporate starting next quarter.

Now to provide closing comments, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you very much, Simon. Air Products continues to deliver consistent results despite significant
ongoing challenges in the world. Our volumes, price and profit all grew in 2021, overcoming the pandemic,
the storms, supply chain disruption and rising costs globally. I truly believe that we have become an even
stronger company and fully expect to deliver significant earning growth as the economies around the
world recover and our projects come onstream.

Now please turn to Slide #26. For fiscal year 2022, our earnings per share guidance is $10.20 to $10.40,
up 13% to 15% over last year. For quarter 1 of fiscal year '22, our earnings per share guidance is $2.45 to
$2.55, up 16% to 20% over last year, and will include about 2 months of the Phase 1 of the Jazan project.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Seifi, you had a couple of delays in your projects, most notably, NEOM and Indonesia by roughly a year.
Can you just talk about why those projects are being pushed out by a year?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

David, I wouldn't call them delays. I mean these are mega projects. And when we announced them,
we give you our best judgment about when they come onstream. But all of these projects need to be
permitted, they need government approvals and all of that. So each time we had a call, we give you our
latest estimate of what we think these projects will come onstream. So right now, our best estimate for
these projects are the dates that we have given you. If we can move them forward, we will tell you. If
there's further delays, we will let you know. Because as I said, we cannot forecast everything because we
are dependent on getting significant permits for a lot of these projects.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Understood. And just on the CapEx increase ex Jazan, can you just talk about the pieces of that $500
million to $1 billion increase? How much is maybe Alberta, how much is Louisiana, et cetera?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Alberta and Louisiana are not going to consume a huge amount of capital next year, but it is all
related to the projects that Dr. Serhan mentioned. I mean people focus on our mega projects, and
obviously, we are delighted to talk about it. But don't forget, we still have a base business, which is very
resilient, and we are doing many, many, many projects.

Actually, as Dr. Serhan mentioned, last year was a record year for our small and midsized projects. We are
getting our fair share of the market on those projects. They are going to be executed, and they require
capital.

Operator

Our next question, from John McNulty with BMO.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So Seifi, with the huge in spike energy prices that you saw over in Europe, and I imagine maybe even a
little bit in Asia as well, I guess, can you speak to how quickly you can offset it with regard to price? Is it
something where, look, you automatically kind of immediately put it all in? Or is it something that has to
ease in over the next few quarters? I guess, how should we be thinking about that?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

John, as you know very well, we have 2 parts to our business. On the onsite, they immediately go in
because that's just pass-through. Our merchant side and packaged gases business, some of it has
clauses, but a lot of it don't have clauses. And therefore, we need to go and increase prices and invoice
the customers and convince them that energy prices have gone down -- gone up. And then there is a

competitive environment. Some people try to use this as an excuse to get market share and all of that. So
we need work to do.

But what has compounded our issue in terms of being able to recover them fast enough is that the rate of
energy increases. I mean, if energy increases, we do forecast these things. But what happened in Europe
in the month of August and September was something that -- it was impossible to forecast that things
would go up 200%. So as a result, we are lagging in terms of price increases in our merchant business,
especially in Europe. But our team is doing a fantastic job. They did a great job in September and October,
but there is more work to be done. So we will be delayed about a quarter maybe.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. So a quarter to kind of catch up on that? Okay.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And then I guess when thinking about your margin target, where you expect to get the margins back up to
kind of that 40% range, give or take, admitting that the rest of it really is more energy pass-through and
doesn't -- isn't really a reflection of the business, I guess, can you speak to the timing of when you think
you can get there? Is it something where we can kind of see the margins approaching that type of a level
by the end of 2022? Is it going to take longer than that, I guess? And what are some of the measures that
you really have to kind of enact in order to get back to those 40%-type levels?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

John, as far as I'm concerned, I'd like to see those margins back there next time we talk in January. I
mean we don't like to see our margins go down. Therefore, the pricing actions that we have put in place
has a lot to do with that because it's all about -- the margins are all about pricing. The volumes are the
volumes. The margin is how much profit you make per unit of volume.

So we need to catch up with the energy costs. And our goal is to catch up with it as soon as possible. So
when you say -- my target is we're able to report that our margins have gone back up to 40% in -- by
next quarter or the quarter after that. How much of it we achieve is obviously going to depend on the
efforts of all of us over here, but we are doing our best to get there as soon as we can. And we also intend
to improve productivity, absolutely.

Operator

We'll go to our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just to follow up on the previous question, can you talk about the level of price increases that you're
seeking today in various regions to keep up with this energy inflation? And do you think the pace of
realization could differ versus history?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Kevin, what it means is that -- I mean, obviously, the pace of price increases, you have seen what
we have done in the past. It's about 18, 19 consecutive quarters that you're getting for our merchant
business. We are getting 3%, 4%, 5% price increases in different regions around the world.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

So now -- before, we've been increasing prices to improve our margins. Now we have to increase prices to
maintain our margins. And therefore, there is a significant sense of urgency on that. And how successful
we are, we're going to report that to you next quarter. I don't want to forecast that because there is a lot
of activities that we do and a lot involved. But the fact is that energy prices have gone up, and we need to
recover that from -- by increasing prices. Everybody needs to do that. I mean there is global inflation. And
if people can't deal with that, they are going to see their margins go down. And at the same time, we need
to also continue to work on our productivity goals. And our people know that, and we are all very focused
on that, Kevin.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Seifi, I wanted to ask your opinion on a high-level question related to clean hydrogen. One can look at this
business and recognize it's got vastly different growth potential than, say, atmospheric gases and different
capital requirements, different technology, discrete assets, et cetera. And you could look at multiples for,
let's say, lithium producers or other high-growth businesses. And they're quite high today. And so that
might argue for separating the business at some point in time.

On the other hand, you've got a lot of benefits of integration, including inexpensive cost of capital and
a high-quality balance sheet. So as you consider all of those things, how do you think about how the
business might develop over time and whether or not it will remain within the portfolio on an integrated
basis for the long term?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Kevin, you are asking me a very intelligent question. My answer to that is that our commitment
is to create value for our shareholders. If at some point in time what you are suggesting is significant
opportunity for significantly increasing shareholder value, we would obviously consider that. But I don't
want to give the impression that we want to do anything tomorrow.

And besides that, we need to kind of demonstrate the success of the hydrogen business in all of that. So
the question that you're asking is a very good question; and b, as a company, as a Board, always look
at those options. Now when we would act or if we act on it depends on the circumstances, depends on
the market, depends on the development of the hydrogen business and all of that. So sorry to give you a
general answer, Kevin, but I'm sure you appreciate what I'm saying.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I do and sorry for putting you on the spot there, but certainly welcome those thoughts. Much appreciated.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you.

We'll go to our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just wanted to drill into your guidance a little bit. If I understood it correctly, Jazan is in the 2022 guide. If
you back out that 11 months' worth, it seems like kind of a mid-single-digit EPS guide. Is there anything
that you are expecting that is a particular headwind in the year? Or are you just being conservative here?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Steve, first of all, thanks for your question. I'm very happy that you are breaking it down the way that you
are breaking it down. We are showing that -- first of all, I think we should get credit for Jazan. At the end
of the day, that's part of the company, and we are increasing the EPS 15%. But if you want to look at it
that way by saying, "Okay. I know you have done that, but the base business looks like it's growing 6%."
Well, that is the way we see the world right now because the base business, Kevin, as you know better
than I do, is dependent on the growth of GDP or industrial production. And I'm not sitting here getting too
excited about prospects of GDP or industrial production gold anywhere in the world.

I mean everybody likes to say that COVID is over, now everything is growth. China, the biggest growth
engine that the world had last quarter grew only 3%. Europe, GDP and industrial production is not going
anywhere. In the U.S., not that much happening. And Latin America is not going anywhere. So I think
within the circumstances and then considering all of the issues about energy costs and then -- that we
need to recover, all of the issues that is related to supply chain, which is affecting our ability to move
helium containers around the world, that's the real issue.

And then all of the fundamental supply chain that I mentioned and the overall economic activity, these
are all real issues. Our job is to give you a guidance that is reasonable. We gave you a guidance for fiscal
year 2021. The average of that was 902.5, and we delivered 902 despite the hurricanes, which we didn't
forecast, despite the power outages and all of that.

It's our job to have a balance. We know the business very well. It's our job to look at growth things, look
at the other things and put it all together and give you the best judgment that we have at the time we
give it to you. And right now, our best judgment is that, yes, you're right, that overall, our base business
is going to grow about 6% or 7%. I hope it does better, but I -- we are responsible for giving you a
responsible forecast rather than daydreaming about the fact that everything will be fine. And COVID hasn't
gone away either. So sorry to give you a long answer but -- Steve, but I hope that helps.

Steve Byrne
BofA Securities, Research Division

It does. And I did want to ask you a question about your blue hydrogen outlook. When we drill into
the Alberta and Louisiana projects, it seems to us that a majority of the capital is really to produce
incremental hydrogen supply more so than it is for carbon sequestration or capture. And if that's a fair
assumption, what, in your view, is the key driver for that outlook for needing incremental hydrogen supply
in these regions? And is it driven by renewable fuel?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Kevin, there is 2 fundamental dynamics. We are talking here about 2020 -- the time that we have, so
2026, when these projects are going to come on stream. Number one, we do need increased hydrogen
demand on our -- on the pipeline because we have new customers that are coming on. And we foresee
ourselves sold out on that, and therefore, we need additional hydrogen in the pipeline.

The second thing is that we think there will be significant additional customers if we can give them
blue hydrogen, and they will convert and get the benefits of that. But then a significant part of their
production, especially in Canada, is going to be liquid, which is going to go for mobility where we see
people converting to hydrogen for their mobility and the program they have.

Then in Louisiana, the massive amount of hydrogen that we are making, a significant part of that or
part of that, we haven't given you the details until we figure out all of the details. But fundamentally, a
significant amount will be converted to blue ammonia, which will be exported, and you know where the
destination of that export is. That's basically in Japan, where they have no other choice. But how is Japan
going to decarbonize? They don't have oil. They don't have gas. They don't have nuclear, and they don't
have shallow water to do any kind of windmills offshore. So they need to import their energy. And the best
form of energy to import is import blue ammonia where the CO2 has been captured and to burn it in their
power plants to generate electricity so that then they can use that electricity to drive their cars and all
that. So that is the thinking that we have in terms of the outlet for the blue hydrogen.

Does that help, Steve?

BofA Securities, Research Division

Very good. Yes.

Operator

And we'll go to our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

First question is just Dr. Serhan talked about 2021 being a record year for the investment kind of in that
midsized CapEx for you guys. So when we look at that roughly, how accretive is that to '22 and '23 going
forward? Is that significantly a bigger jump than normal? Or how should we figure that into our model?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, it will be accretive as we go forward. I mean all of those projects that he's talking about take 2 or
3 years to build. So '21, we got the project, so it will be '22-'23. It will start having an impact on our
results in '24-'25. Those things are not something that you turn it down right away. They still need to
be engineered and built. But he is absolutely correct that we had a very good year on those midsized
projects.

We don't usually talk about that, but we decided to talk about it this quarter because I was just getting
concerned that people are under the impression that the only thing we like is mega projects. No, we are
committed to our existing business, and we are getting more than our fair share of the existing business
on the smaller-sized. And our people are doing a great job in getting those projects and executing them.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then, Seifi, you had made a comment that there was some disruption in your
business in China, in particular. Was that power being cut off to your plants? Was that power being cut
off to your customers where they couldn't run? Can you break that out a little bit more? How were you
impacted, where you had to shut down your operations there?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

First of all -- and let me just characterize. Those disruptions in the fourth quarter was not material. They
weren't that much. We felt obligated to mention them because there were a few incidents, but they were
not material. Now are they going to be material this quarter or the next quarter? We have to wait and see.

And then the other thing is that we have 2 kinds of business, as you very well know. We have the onsite
business. The onsite business, we will only shut down our plant if the customer is forced to shut down.
Let's say, it's a steel plant and they say, "Shut down their steel plant. The customer doesn't need oxygen."
They have to shut down the power plant.

Then we have our merchant business. Our merchant business, we rarely shut down our merchant business
because we are not a dirty business. So they don't specifically say, "Shut down the ASU." It's mainly the
customers that they shut down, which affects us.

We'll go to our next question from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

I wanted to first start with the blue hydrogen projects that you have announced and using the
technologies of ATR and POX. And I think you commented earlier that there's a competitive advantage of
gasification that's at play there. I was hoping you could talk about that a little bit more, especially after
we've heard from peers saying that they too can offer both technologies and even capture 95% of the CO2
through SMR.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'm very happy that you're asking me the question because the blue hydrogen projects that we have
announced, we are using new technology in Canada and another technology in Louisiana, where we can
capture 95% of the CO2 sequestered.

When it comes to the SMR, what happens in an SMR? When you take the natural gas, you have a steam
methane reformer. You take some of the natural gas directly into the process, goes over a catalyst, and
you break down CH4 to CO and hydrogen. And then you shift it, you have hydrogen. And the CO becomes
CO2, and it goes up at the atmosphere. You can capture 95% of that. Sure.

But then you use a lot of the natural gas to burn -- to heat up the tubes, which contain the catalyst. That
is combustion, like a combustion in a furnace or in a power plant. Theoretically, you can capture that CO2,
but it will cost you an arm and a leg to capture that. So making the statement that I can capture 95% of
the CO2 from SMR, sure, you can capture the CO2 in air, too. But the issue is that, is it cost-effective or
not. So what we are saying is that the technology that we have makes it possible to capture the CO2 in a
cost-effective way.

But I mean you have to put a lot of equipment on the SMR to capture the CO2 from combustion.
Theoretically, you can say, "Yes, I can put special boxes and do that." And I really don't want to comment
on what our competitors say. They have to defend what they say. It's their business. But from our point of
view, when we put carbon capture on SMRs, as we have done, and we actually operate the biggest one in
Port Arthur, everybody can go and take a look at it. We have the CO2 capture on the process part because
that is economical. We can capture that and use it for a [ financial ] recovery. But on the combustion part,
we don't do that because that becomes cost-prohibitive. Can it be done? Yes, sure. Anything can be done
at a cost.

I hope that helps, Marc.

Marc Gregory Bianchi
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's helpful. Earlier, Dr. Serhan mentioned, I think, some increased confidence on NEOM versus last
year. I'm curious what's behind that statement. Is there anything to say about perhaps customers being
signed up? Or what's driving that statement?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

I can have Dr. Serhan answer that, but he's not going to make any comments about customers. But he
can tell you why he feels better about the project as compared to before. Dr. Serhan?

Samir J. Serhan
Chief Operating Officer

Thanks, Seifi. As we communicated before, this is really a first-mover project in this world-scale for
production of green hydrogen. And I can tell you, we have around maybe 30 different work streams going
in parallel in developing, optimizing, producing products, improving the cost. And that's really where this
additional confidence coming that we really feel that we have a very good solution, very, very competitive.
And we are targeting for 2026 that we need to have it onstream. It will be competitive, very low carbon
intensity, and it really meets the specifications that are being imposed in the different countries in the
world.

Michael Dwayne Harris
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is actually Mike Harris sitting in for Bob. Just curious, is there a scenario where Lu'An could return to
full fees before '23? And then on -- I guess, on the other hand, what is the likelihood that, that production
could become permanent?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

I understood the first part of your question, and that thing is that the agreement that we have with them
-- the plant is running at full capacity. The agreement we have with them in terms of structure of the fees
and so on, that is not going to improve in 2022 versus what we have right now. It will improve in 2023.

The second part of your question, I wasn't sure I heard it because you got -- there was a disruption on
what you said. Can you just repeat the second part?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

I'd be curious to get your thoughts on in the long term, not obviously where things are today, but if you
think in the medium to long term, what do you think the cost of carbon is going to be? And maybe on a
regional basis, you could talk about it. And to the extent you want to discuss what you're assuming when
you think about looking at a new project, that might be helpful, too.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Vincent, you're asking a very, very insightful question. I mean, right now, different parts of the Board
have put different numbers in place. I mean in California, they have put $200, right? Per ton of CO2, you
get an incentive for that. Canada is talking about $50 to $100 per ton. Other parts of the world that we
have exposure to, that -- the number is somewhere between $100, $50, $75, $150. It's all over the place.
I think that the way we look at these projects and all of that, we try to kind of look at the profitability on
the basis that we don't get too much of these kind of things because we don't want to rely on government
subsidies every time we do something. But overall, these numbers are all going to develop based on the
commitments that people have made.

And fundamentally, what is going to happen, Vincent? If people are going to -- I mean I see a great
deal of fascination, all of these promises being made at Glasgow. But if you add up all of those things,
the amount of carbon credits that you need in order to meet the requirements becomes gigantic. And
therefore, in order to generate those things, customers need to start using these low-carbon energy
sources. And therefore, you have to have real incentives for people to convert from diesel for ships and
trains and planes and all of that and steelmaking to really shift to clean energy. And that one, a little bit of
incentive is not going to do that.

So I think if the governments are serious to achieving those goals, they have to put in steep incentives to
incentivize people to actually do that. So the prospect of that is very encouraging for our business. But we
have to see how it develops, Vincent, as we go forward. Is that okay?

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Seifi, I was looking at your project commitments, and I didn't see any commitments in the electronics area
through 2026. Is that something strategic where Air Products is moving away from the electronics area in
favor of other opportunities? And when you look at your $4.5 billion or so in CapEx for next year, can you
talk about what the big chunks that you're going to spend on?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Jeff, one of the reasons that we wanted Dr. Serhan to talk about is smaller facilities and all of that was
because my concern about the fact that the question that you just asked. We are winning our fair share
of business in electronics. We are doing some very big projects for people like all of these big electronic
manufacturers like Intel, like Samsung, like TSMC and all of that. You don't see it. You don't highlight them
because they are not mega projects, but we are winning our fair share of those. So we are not -- that is
actually one of the sectors we are very focused on. We are very strong in Asia Pacific, where most of these
projects are happening, and we are definitely on top of that.

Now in terms of the breakdown, I will hesitate to give you the breakdown because then people know
exactly these projects. We have [ bondage ] projects. We have [indiscernible] and all of that. But believe
me, Air Products has been and continues to be extremely focused on the electronics sector. And I can

Operator

We'll go to our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Seifi, I'll ask one quick question. What's happening globally when you look at the narrative about COP26
in a move towards decarbonization and less investments in fossil fuels, do you see a scenario where
fossil fuel prices just keep going up as a result, similar to what has happened in Europe? And if that does
happen, hypothetically, how do your projects in China and other parts of the world fare in an environment
of higher energy prices?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, P.J., thank you very much for asking a very excellent question. The thing is that there is no question
that if hydrocarbon prices go up, like the oil price having gone up, that does help some of the existing
projects that we have in China. I mean, right now, one of the reasons that Lu'An is operating at full
capacity despite the very high price of coal in China is because -- what are they doing? They are taking
coal and they are making diesel, and they are selling the diesel fuel at higher prices because the oil price
is $84 a barrel.

So in a roundabout way, if hydrocarbon costs go up, it helps those kind of projects. But then the other
interesting part is that if hydrocarbon costs go up, then the cost of renewable energy compared to
hydrocarbons becomes even more attractive. So you would say that it's easier to convert a truck driver
from diesel to hydrogen because now the diesel is costing more. So in a funny way, if actually hydrocarbon
prices go up, it will help our strategy in terms of focusing on renewables. Does that make sense, P.J.?

Yes, that does. But does it impact your coal gasification plants?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

It helps us because the coal gasification plants are producing chemicals, which are competing with
production from oil. I mean the whole reason that China is using a lot of coal or Indonesia wants to use a
lot of coal or India wants to use coal is because they want to use coal to produce chemicals so that they
don't have to pay foreign currency for the oil they import. So if energy prices go up, coal prices are in the
ground. Therefore, that would help.

Any other questions or that's...

Operator

It appears there are no further questions at this time.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. With that then, I would like to thank everybody who was on the call. We very much appreciate your
very good and insightful and sometimes difficult questions, but that's the way it is. We do appreciate that.
