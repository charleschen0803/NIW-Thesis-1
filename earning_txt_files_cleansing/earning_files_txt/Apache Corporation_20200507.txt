Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Apache Corporation First
Quarter 2020 Earnings Announcement Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's
conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.

Gary Thomas Clark
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's First Quarter Financial and
Operational Results Conference Call.

We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive
Vice President and CFO, will then summarize first quarter financial performance. Clay Bretches, Executive
Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Planning,
Reserves and Fundamentals, will also be available on the call to answer questions.

Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted
for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our
first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website
at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our
website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call
are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.

Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and
assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the
supplemental information on our website.

And with that, I will turn the call over to John.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Good morning and thank you for joining us. As we review our first quarter results today, many Apache
employees around the world are continuing to work remotely as part of our COVID-19 response. I would
like to wish all of them and those of you who are doing the same good health as we work through a very
trying time. I also want to acknowledge and thank the Apache team for their dedication and hard work
in the face of a very challenging economic and operational environment. They are successfully and safely
delivering day-to-day business activities in the face of a sudden and unprecedented change to life as we
knew it. My heartfelt appreciation goes out to every one of our great Apache employees and contractors
as well as our partners and stakeholders. The global economy and the energy industry have been deeply
impacted by COVID-19. As we navigate this crisis, Apache's primary priorities are keeping the health and
safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate paramount in our decision-making and
preserving the inherent value and optionality of our diverse asset base for the long term. Thus far, our
efforts have been successful, and we are very fortunate to have seen only a few isolated COVID-19 cases
throughout the organization. We acted quickly to close offices and implement work-from-home processes
as well as stringent operational protocols in the field. We also have in place contingency plans to ensure
continuity in the event Apache incurs a more widespread or sustained impact.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

In the rest of my prepared remarks, I will discuss the primary actions we are taking to preserve the
value of our assets and protect our balance sheet, summarize our long-term objectives, which have not
changed, and lastly, comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2020.

While the current crisis is much more severe and complex, some key lessons learned from the 2014
oil price collapse are informing the decisions we are making today. In late February, we communicated
our initial 2020 budget at an assumed WTI oil price of $50 per barrel. This seemed appropriate given
prevailing supply and demand fundamentals and strip pricing at the time. In early March, OPEC+ failed to
reach consensus on supply cuts. And it became apparent that COVID-19 would cause an unprecedented
amount of demand destruction.

Apache responded to the oil price drop associated with these events quickly and decisively. On March 12,
we announced a plan to reduce activity in Egypt and the North Sea and to eliminate all U.S. drilling and
completion activity. This resulted in a $650 million decrease in our 2020 upstream capital budget, which
is now down nearly 55% from 2019. We also announced a 90% reduction to our dividend, thus preserving
$340 million of cash flow on an annualized basis and strengthening our liquidity. To protect cash flow from
further downside price dislocation, we entered into substantial oil hedge positions primarily for the second
and third quarters, which we believe have the most volatility risk. We implemented deeper cost-cutting
measures announcing on April 1 an increase in our estimated annualized cost savings to $300 million,
up from $150 million a month earlier. Apache benefited from the significant progress already made on
our organizational redesign, which commenced in the third quarter of 2019. This enabled us to make the
incremental cost reduction decisions confidently without compromising safety, asset integrity or our ability
to resume activity when warranted.

Finally, we have conducted a thorough price sensitivity analysis and operational evaluation of all producing
wells across the company, which is now informing the methodical and integrated approach we are taking
to rolling production shut-ins and curtailments. This process will enable us to preserve cash flow in this
distressed and volatile price environment and protect our assets. All of these actions were carefully
planned and none were taken lightly. While very difficult, they were necessary to preserve liquidity and
ensure ample runway to return to a more sustainable and profitable price environment.

Next, I would like to reiterate our longer-term objectives, which still hold true despite some of the short-
term impacts of the current situation. First, Apache will budget conservatively, aggressively manage
our cost structure to ensure free cash flow generation and prioritize debt reduction to strengthen our
balance sheet. We will maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio and continue to invest for long-term
returns rather than production growth. In the Permian, we will continue building economic inventory
and maintain optionality. And in Egypt and the North Sea, we will flex activity to preserve free cash flow
generation. Lastly, we will continue to enhance our portfolio through exploration. Our recent success,
offshore Suriname, is a prime example of this strategy, and Block 58 remains a clear priority for Apache.

As we look to the remainder of 2020, there are a number of fundamental uncertainties. The most
important of these is the timing and magnitude of a recovery in demand for oil as supply response alone
cannot solve this problem in the short term. For Apache, the best course of action is to aggressively
reduce our cost structure, protect our balance sheet and manage operations to preserve cash flow. Our
diversified global portfolio gives us the ability to optimize capital allocations as market conditions change.
Just as we did following the oil price crash in 2014, we have left intact a higher proportion of international
capital investment, which offers better returns than the U.S. in a lower price environment.

To wrap up, Apache is taking the necessary steps to manage cash flow and protect our balance sheet.
We have ample liquidity and a long runway to carry us through to a better price environment, and we'll
maintain the flexibility and capacity to increase activity in a thoughtful manner as conditions warrant.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our first
quarter and 2020 outlook.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Thank you, John.

My remarks this morning will provide a few more details on first quarter 2020 results and our outlook
for the remainder of the year. I will also comment on the strength of Apache's liquidity position, which is
more than sufficient to bridge this significant and potentially prolonged downturn. As noted in our news
release issued yesterday under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a first quarter
2020 consolidated net loss of $4.5 billion or $11.86 per diluted common share. These results include items
that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are noncash impairments totaling $4.5
billion. Impairments were driven primarily by the impact of weak oil prices on the carrying value of our
proved properties. Most of these impairments were in legacy vertical developments in the Permian Basin.
Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were a loss of $51 million or
$0.13 per share. G&A expense in the quarter was $68 million, which was considerably below our guidance
of $120 million. Some of our stock award programs are cash settled, and each quarter, accounting rules
require us to mark-to-market the accrued liability for these awards based on changes in our share price.
Typically, this has not been material, but it resulted in more than a $30 million reduction in G&A expense
for the first quarter due to the significant drop in the share price during the quarter.

Capital investment and operating costs in first quarter were also below guidance as a result of the
spending reduction efforts we have instituted. As with G&A costs, there will be more significant impacts
in future quarters. Apache's adjusted production for the quarter was below our most recent guidance.
Reported gas production in the Permian Basin was materially impacted by commercial arrangements at
some gas processing plants where the operator takes volume in kind as reimbursement for power costs. In
lower gas price environments, like in the first quarter, the impact on reported volumes can be significant,
in this case, approximately 24 million cubic feet per day. Permian oil volumes were also below guidance
caused by the rapid reduction in activity due to the oil price downturn.

As we look to the remainder of 2020, our full year upstream capital investment program will be around
$1.1 billion, approximately 60% of which will be in our international businesses. For the second quarter,
upstream capital investment will be approximately $230 million, a sharp reduction from the first quarter.
With respect to other typical guidance items, there are many uncertainties on a forward-looking basis. As
such, we are not providing second quarter guidance, and we are removing the full year 2020 guidance,
which we provided in February. In terms of production volumes, we are in the process of implementing
a shut-in and curtailment program, which is already impacting second quarter volumes. The size and
duration of this program will depend on many factors and is therefore difficult to forecast at this time.

In closing, I would like to touch on our substantial liquidity position, our efforts to protect that position and
how we will put it to use. When this downturn began, we quickly implemented actions to match spending
reductions with the deteriorating oil price environment. As a result of those actions, Apache can achieve
free cash flow neutrality for all of 2020 at an average WTI oil price in the low 30s. The original plan for
2020 required a WTI oil price closer to $50. Our goal is to achieve cash flow neutrality in order to minimize
drawing on liquidity to fund our day-to-day operations. We entered this downturn with a tremendous
liquidity backstop. We have a $4 billion revolving credit facility, which matures in March of 2024 with a
1-year extension option. Following our credit downgrade by S&P, we posted letters of credit for North
Sea abandonment obligations, utilizing a sublimit in the credit facility specifically established for such
purposes. This currently reduces the availability on the credit facility by $800 million.

In terms of debt, one of our key financial goals for the year was to generate free cash flow to reduce
leverage through debt repurchases. This remains a longer-term priority that is more challenging for the
near-term given the price environment. Over the last 2 years, we eliminated $1.6 billion of debt in the
near-term maturity window through paydown and refinancing efforts, leaving only $937 million of bond
maturities over the next 3 years. Absent refinancing or retaining free cash flow to retire these bonds, we
will use the revolver to pay them down. Conservatively assuming all 3 years of debt maturities go on the
revolver, we would still have $2.3 billion of remaining liquidity to manage through this downturn.

In summary, we have taken significant and decisive actions to preserve liquidity, protect the balance sheet
and retain asset value for the future. These recent steps, combined with those of the last few years, give
us sufficient capacity to bridge to a more sustainable and profitable price environment.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

And with that, I will turn the call back to John for some closing remarks.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the durability of our production base in
a reduced spending environment. At planned 2020 capital investment levels, our adjusted international
production should be roughly sustainable from 2019 to 2020 on an exit rate basis, assuming no material
curtailments or shut-ins. In the Permian, where we have eliminated activity for the remainder of the year,
the unknown magnitude, timing and duration of our curtailment and shut-in program makes it premature
to provide a high confidence near-term outlook. I would note, however, that approximately 1/3 of our
Permian oil production comes from legacy vertical wells that have a base decline rate of around 10%.
Hence, our overall Permian oil decline rate is significantly [Audio Gap] basin average. As we look ahead to
2021, our Permian decline rates will moderate, and the capital investment required to sustain year-over-
year production volumes will fall significantly. We will provide more details around future production as
price volatility recedes and we have more visibility.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I appreciate that you can't talk in great specificity around the trajectory for Permian production. But can
you kind of frame it in terms of what it could look like if you split out the legacy vertical versus kind of the
shale? I mean just very wide goalposts as it were?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I mean, Bob, I hope things are going well. I'd say, in general, we've got 2 pieces there. And our
conventional is 1/3 of our oil production in the Permian. And as I said there at the end, it's got kind of a
10% decline rate. The other 2/3 is unconventional. And I will say that we have been running a pretty flat
pace. If anything, we moderated our activity pace in 2019, it was down from 2018. So we're going to be at
a little lower unconventional decline rate just because of the pace relative to our percentage as compared
to most. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

And on that legacy vertical, are there any -- what's the inventory of wells that have just gotten to the
point where they're not economic in sort of a 2- to 3-year recovery window? When -- would you abandon
those? Or do you just not have that many in the portfolio?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think -- and I'm going to let Dave talk a few minutes on the process we've gone through on the
shut-ins because it's something we've really put some time and effort into. But I think the important thing
to know is, is that we've taken a very, very methodical approach. I think we've shut-in around 2,500 wells,
produce an average of about 3 barrels a day and about 150 barrels of water a day. We've done this in a
way that we can kind of roll the wells and preserve the asset integrity. So we feel pretty good about being
able to bring those back. Cost structure is coming down. But we're going to manage near term for free
cash flow. And we'll leave things shut-in as long as it makes sense.

But Dave, why don't you give some color and, Clay, maybe on the shut-in process that we've gone
through?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development Planning, Reserves & Fundamentals

Sure. Thanks, John. And Bob, thanks for the question. And Clay will jump in here in a second. But as
John said, it's a pretty robust process. And it involves operations, it involves our production of reservoir
engineers, our land team to understand any lease obligations, marketing to understand existing contracts.
And then our planning group and asset teams to really, really stress some of the economic parameters
on the wells. John gave you some numbers on wells that are currently shut in. We would anticipate as
we go through May and into June, those numbers likely increase. But you can see the kind of wells that
we're shutting in. There's another bucket of wells that when they break, we're opting not to fix them. And
we've dropped our workover rig count by 80% since the beginning of the year and really tightened up the
economic criteria in this market for those -- to justify working those wells over.

And so the bucket that John talked about, most of those wells are wells that were overtly shut-in, but
some of those are wells that we've opted not to repair. I think when you think about would any of these

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

wells be permanently shut-in? That's a function of longer-term price. But because we have a methodical
process, because we have a reservoir production facility engineers involved in the process, we're shutting
these wells in, in a -- with the anticipation that they'll ultimately be brought back online. So we're doing
the right kind of chemical treatments before we shut them in. And Clay can talk about that in a second.

Some of the other considerations, when you're thinking about the economics here, wells that produce a
little more gas than others like they get a benefit in today's gas market. And then when we think about
our Permian exposure, we have some marketing agreements where a meaningful percentage of our
Permian production goes to Corpus on the EPIC pipe and are exposed to Brent-linked pricing. So we have
a number of considerations there.

And finally, for me, the other thing that we're doing, our subsurface teams of engineers and geologists
have taken this opportunity to do some interference testing in some of our unconventional plays. As we're
deferring some production, we found historically that interference testing is one of the best ways to really
understand well spacing and well placement in these 3-dimensional and conventional plays. We're doing
some of that starting imminently. And again, we feel very confident that when things get better, we're
going to come out of this a whole lot smarter than we were going into it. A probably longer answer than
you wanted, but I'm going to pass it over to Clay to add some color.

David Clay Bretches
Executive Vice President of Operations

Yes. Sure, Dave. This is Clay Bretches. And let me pile on a little bit with what Dave was saying and
actually add some color. Dave was talking about the shut-in wells and the reduction in workover activity,
and that is all true. And that's all something that is temporary until we bring those wells back on. In the
meantime, while we do that, we have to make sure that we focus on preservation. And so we make sure
that we preserve and pickle the wells to reduce as much corrosion as is possible. We also have to preserve
the surface facilities and make sure that our tanks are preserved properly, that our rotating equipment is
preserved so that when we do come back and flip that switch and it's time to produce again, all of that
production can come back on.

And one of the things that we talk about, and John has alluded to this many times, a lot of times when
you shut-in wells, especially for a long period of time, you have a lot of surprises when you turn them
back on. Some of them are good and some of them are bad. The bad side and what can happen is you
can end up with a lot of corrosion if you have not done everything in your power to make sure that you
preserve those when you shut them in. So we're taking great pains to make sure that preservation is
going correctly.

Now the next thing I want to talk about is cost structure. And in the opening remarks, John mentioned
that we're looking at a $300 million reduction, which is up twofold from the $150 million that we had
announced a month earlier. And so I wanted to give some color on that because most of this is permanent
cost reduction and a change of the cost structure. You heard Steve talk about how we could operate as
we go forward from what prior to this great reduction in oil prices was a $50 oil world, we can go now to
a $30 per barrel oil world. And so a lot of this has to do with the initiatives that we were already engaged
in, about $150 million worth, which was announced after the end of the year. The $150 million was largely
G&A associated with our headquarters functions and with our various technical functions in our offices, in
our Houston and Cairo and Aberdeen Midland offices. But with the reduction in oil price, we had to take
a lot of action to find other permanent cost reductions, and we did. And so what we see now are these
permanent cost reductions. A lot of that has to do with field employee reductions, contractor reductions
in the field. A lot of supply chain initiatives. Our supply chain group has been doing a great deal of work
in order to get new contracts. And these contracts are more long-lived than what we believe to be this
temporary reduction in prices. And so we've been able to get some really good contracts, renegotiate
those contracts and take advantage of the price environment that we're in right now.

And then the last thing I would mention, and I think this is really, really important because this is a
bottoms-up approach. But we went to our offshore installation managers. We went to our area operations
managers in the field and the onshore. And we asked them for their initiatives and how they could reduce
cost and how they can reduce cost in a meaningful way. And it was a very thoughtful process, and a lot of

9

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

work has been done to identify areas where we can reduce costs, whether it means reducing redundant
activities, reducing field offices, automating processes that heretofore were more manual in nature.
Those are the actions that we're taking. And it's led to this significant increase in these permanent cost
reductions that we're now pushing up to $300-plus million.

So I'll turn it back over to John.

Operator

Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Yes. I appreciate that you guys probably won't -- don't want to speak about this and don't laugh on my
pronunciation, the Kwaskwasi, I think, the one that's currently drilling. But I wondered if you could -- if
there's anything that you could offer about maybe what you guys have continued to learn from your first 2
discoveries there, offshore Suriname, Maka and Sapakara West, as you continue to analyze the -- whether
it be the cores or the fluid samples or whatever else you might care to share.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Charles, thanks for the question. We remain very excited about Suriname. I think most importantly,
now that we're 2 for 2 on both Maka and Sapakara from the wells and actually 2 for 2 in both the
Campanian and the Santonian formations, we've proven we've got an active hydrocarbon system. It's oil
with some gas condensate in some of the shallower Campanian zones in both Sapakara and Maka. But
we're very excited. You look at the distance between the wells or separate features, we're now drilling
Kwaskwasi. As you mentioned, it is another separate feature. It's actually in between the 2. And then we
will be moving back to Keskesi for the fourth well, which is on the other side of Sapakara. So I think it just
shows there's not just 1 feature out there. We've got 1.44 million acres. The block is highly prospective.
We're only in 2 of what are now 8 play types. And things are going very well. So we're excited about
what's in front of us. We're currently working the plans with our partner, Total, on the appraisal program
for Maka. We're due to submit that to the government of Suriname later this month, which we will do.
So we're anxious to kind of push forward there. We're also working on the plans at Sapakara. And it will
follow sometime later this summer. So we're very encouraged things remain kind of on track, and it's
turning out to be everything that we hoped it could be. So a very strong petroleum hydrocarbon system
that's got a lot of charge.

Charles Arthur Meade
Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. And then going back to your prepared comments, I know you guys just gave a really lengthy
and detailed answer about these -- the shut-ins, but I just want to clarify something. When you talked
about the rolling curtailments in your prepared comments, was that specific just to these 2,500 vertical
Permian wells? Or is that also happening in other parts of your portfolio, whether it be horizontal Permian
or international?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I mean, I think that today, Charles, we have around 2,500 wells shut-in. All of the fields are going
to be handled in a rolling way and -- or they're going to be pickled and done very methodically. So
we're working through that based on what we think is the best way to operate those. And so it's a very
methodical approach. As Dave mentioned, one of the things we're also doing is we've really thought
through what data we can collect and how we can do it. I mean you don't have the luxury when you're
running a program, sometimes of taking the time and doing the interference tests and the things that
really help you understand spacing and pattern alignment and so forth on the unconventional side. So
as Dave mentioned that as we get into June, the number is going to grow a little bit, but a lot of the May

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

stuff's kind of already cast, but we're taking a very bottoms-up, a very detailed approach, and it will be
designed to protect the wells and also learn as much as we can because I think that will help drive our
capital efficiency when we do kind of get back to work.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

John, I got a couple of follow-ups, I guess, and maybe I'll kick off with Suriname. Your -- my
understanding is you've got 120 days from when you disclosed the discovery to the government. So that
would put you actually right around now. So I'm interested to know are we really end of the month, are
we imminent? And can you give us some scope as to what you're looking to do in the appraisal plan in
terms of drilling or further interpretation of seismic or whatever that might look like?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Actually, we've got the obligations or we have 24 hours to make a discovery notice. And then we
have 30 days to submit the official discovery report, and then that clock starts. So we actually are going
to be the end of this month, Doug, when we do submit the first plan. So there's actually the 30-day
window between discovery and the official discovery notice. It's probably the 30 days that you're missing
in there. Yes. We're -- our partner and us are both continuing to do lots of things. As you know, with now
2 penetrations down on the seismic, there's a lot of work we're doing, which I think will be informative.
A lot of reprocessing and things that we'll continue to do throughout the process. And really, some of
the work we're putting into the appraisal program is how we design it to gain as much information as we
need to make the proper decision. So we'll be in a position to submit something later this month to the
government, and then they've got a 30-day period to respond back to us. So it's all systems go.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Well, thank you for closing the gap for me. I -- the 30 days I was indeed missing. But I guess if I could
just press you a little bit on this. Our view at least is that you're sitting on the depositional center here.
Can you at least give us some idea what the feature looks like relative to what we've seen next door
because I think there's still some debate as to whether there's a viable development here. So anything --
any color you can offer in that?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would just say that the features are very large. That's all we've said. And that's why we're working
on the appraisal plans on how we want to appraise them. But the nice thing is, is they're large and you've
got obviously stacked pays, both that we've already discovered thus far in both the Campanian and the
Santonian. So it's not disappointing in any way on that front, and we're excited about it.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

My last one, if I may, is just changing geographies completely to Egypt. One of the things that I guess
continues to not get a lot of attention is the extraordinary exploration success rate you're having there,
94% I guess this last quarter end. Can you just walk us through what the go-forward plan is in this lower
oil price environment? And it might actually be a question for Steve because I'm really interested to know
how the PSC allows you to hold up your volumes in this very low oil price environment in the context of
cost recovery barrel -- legacy cost recovery entitlements that you have? So any kind of color on the go-
forward plan and the volume support you can get from the PSC would be helpful.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

CEO, President & Director

Well, Doug, thanks for noticing Egypt. Yes. We're -- you look at that program, I think what you're seeing is
the early fruit from the acreage we picked up, the seismic we shot, we spent the last several years, in fact,
we're still shooting a very, very large acreage. We reshot a lot of our old existing seismic. The previous
shoot was done I think in 2013. So a lot has changed on that front. And you're seeing the fruits with some
of the discoveries that we've announced this year where we have infrastructure tie in. We have some very,
very impactful targets yet to drill that we're excited about this year on the exploration front. And so what
you're seeing is we've high graded the capital. We've ratcheted back a little bit in Egypt. It's the area
we've ratcheted back the least though, as we've said on the international side. It's also an area that we'll
want to put capital in kind of first as you start to put capital back because we just -- it's -- what you've got
is you've got 6 million acres, you've got multiple basins. And the difference between it and an area like the
Permian, you've got as much stack pay, but you've got conventional rock. And so that's what differentiates
it.

The second thing I'll say, and Steve may want to add some color, but these PSCs were designed and
created in a much, much lower price environment. And so the way they work -- things work very well in
the price environment we're at today. And so that's how and that's why Egypt continues to be an area that
we can lean on. And it's really one of the advantages to having an international portfolio. You've got Brent
pricing. You've got the PSC structure, and it's not just the loan unconventional treadmill that you have in
the Permian.

So anything, Steve, you want to add on the PSC?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I just -- Doug, what I'd do is I'd maybe point you to the supplement. We've got a page in there on
Egypt volumes that breaks it out pretty clearly. And what you'll see is when you compare gross production
volume to the net production volume that goes to the concession holders, us and Sinopec. You'll find --
the vast majority of the barrels actually still go to Egypt, which is the way it ought to be when you've got
a drilling program, as John was talking about, that is just highly economic when you can -- we can drill for
the cost of these vertical wells and you get the types of oil rates that you can get out of Egypt. So Egypt
does end up with the vast majority of the volume. But what that does allow is that when you're in a very
low oil price environment like today, we do get first call on cost recovery barrels. And so those barrels --
some of the barrels move from Egypt over to the concession holders in order to get cost recovery. And
cost recovery, it will vary -- we've got 25-, 26-some-odd concessions there, different PSC contracts. And
all of them are slightly different from each other, but they're pretty similar.

And the way cost recovery works is during the period, which is a quarter, you will get full recovery through
oil volumes or gas volumes for all of your in-period expense costs. And then you also get a quarterly share
of amortization or depreciation, if you will, on historic capital. And the PSCs do vary slightly, but most of
them are either a 4-year or a 5-year amortization of the capital spend. So every quarter, you do have a
pretty significant hedging benefit from the PSC effect, if you will, a built-in hedge. And so that's why you
see our adjusted barrels went up in the first quarter from fourth quarter because of the price roll, and
you'll see that again most likely in second quarter from first.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

That's what I was getting at, Steve. Could you put some order of magnitude on the bump given the oil
price?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Can you give us some order of magnitude to the bump given the oil price?

No, we're not going to give that at this point in time. I think you could probably do a rough calculation of
-- from fourth quarter to first quarter with your assumptions on what prices will be in the second quarter.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

It seems those are a pretty big number that's why I was trying to get it from you.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

But it's a very nice benefit of the PSC structure. It does -- in a high oil price environment, it cuts the other
way, obviously. It's a double-edged sword, but in a low oil price environment, it does provide a very nice
natural hedge.

Operator

Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson from Stephens.

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Looking at the other permanent cost reductions that you guys discussed earlier in the call, can you just
talk about what the split between those is, U.S. versus international? And then the savings that achieved
to date in those permanent cost reductions, have they been more skewed to 1 region than the other?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I'll start out, Gail. A lot of those -- we started I mean -- and we were fortunate in that we started kind of
an operational redesign last September. So we were 6 to 7 months into a total revamping of our operating
model where we were closing some offices and really centralizing a lot of functions. What this enabled us
to do in mid-March was just take a much, much deeper cut. And so a lot of those cost savings are going to
be G&A related. They're kind of across the board. A lot of it even on the corporate side. So a big chunk of
that is geared towards the overhead side and the G&A side.

Secondly, the cost-saving efforts have been kind of across the board. And I can let Clay give a little bit of
an idea on the operational split, but you've got a lot in the Permian is where probably the lion's share of
that is, and then other things we're doing in the North Sea and Egypt. I'll say one thing, with some of the
COVID protocol that we put in place, we're doing a lot more screening. We've kind of reduced down the
critical folks that we need on the platform. So we're actually adding some things in some areas, too, as
we've gone to a very specific approach.

But any color, Clay, you want to give on the splits?

David Clay Bretches
Executive Vice President of Operations

No. I think you nailed it, John. As far as the order and where we're seeing the biggest cost savings, U.S.
being the largest, we saw significant savings with the permanent closure of the San Antonio office and a
lot of the reduction in expenses that we had in the NAUR region. But we also have seen a lot of reduction
in expenses in the Permian Basin, excluding NAUR. So we're seeing good reductions there. Same thing
in the North Sea. We've had some reductions there as far as both head count and contractor head count,
that's been substantial and ongoing. And then in Egypt, we're really starting to pull the covers back on
Egypt and understand that better. So we think that there's some low-hanging fruit there that we can go
after and attack. So we're not through cutting costs at this point. We think that there's -- there are other
costs initiatives that we can gain from, and we're working on that right now.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Executive VP & CFO

Gail, this is Steve. If I can give a little bit more color on that as well. We talk about $300 million of
identified sustainable cost reductions so far. And that's both in G&A and OpEx. So as John said, we had
started the G&A focus last year. And so we're ahead of the OpEx side. OpEx started really in earnest with
the oil price downturn. On the G&A side, G&A reduction so far are more than 2/3 of the $300 million
identified. G&A will include costs in the corporate center, obviously, but also G&A-related costs in the
regions. And not to confuse things too much, but the G&A goes to 3 different buckets on our financial
reports. A portion of it will show up in G&A expense on the P&L. Some of it shows up in LOE because it's
allocated that way, and then some of it will go to the capital program. So it will show up in CapEx, but
it's all dollars of reductions in spend regardless of where it goes. And then in addition to the sustainable
reductions, which, as I said, are approaching about $300 million identified, there will be some costs that
we've identified and begun the process of just deferring things that can just wait until a later point in time.

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. And then looking at -- in the quarter, you guys made a solid profit on purchased oil and gas. How
should we think about this going forward?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So this is the first quarter where we have separated out the purchase -- the sale of purchased oil
and gas and the purchase costs of purchased oil and gas. And the reason for that is because this is the
first time that it's become material to our P&L, and it's become because of the pipeline, the long-haul
pipeline transport contracts that we've entered into. And this just gets down to the basics of how we run
the business. We -- the product that we produce, we sell in basin. Just as a general rule, we sell all of the
hydrocarbons in basin. We have a marketing organization who -- amongst the many other things that they
do, one of the things they do is they help us keep basin pricing connected to the larger, broader market.

And we obviously had some events over the last few years that we're disconnecting the Waha and El Paso
Permian pricing from NYMEX, Henry Hub, Houston Ship Channel type of pricing. And so the marketing
organization recommended and we took them up on it of helping pipelines like GCX and PHP go from
concept to FID and to reality with GCX now. So we actually entered into contracts on those pipes, and
then we helped them get across the line. Of course, we also took an equity option, which Altus Midstream
owns now in those pipelines. But getting those contracts in place helped the pipelines get built. And then
the marketing organization now manages our exposure to those transport contracts. And what you see
is the -- on our P&L now is the effects of marketing organization. Purchasing product in-basin or along
the pipelines, it's not necessarily at Waha or El Paso Permian. It could be anywhere along the pipeline
or where they have access to the pipeline. And then selling it at the other end of the pipeline or in other
offload locations along that pipeline. And so they basically manage that exposure through purchasing and
selling product. And since it is becoming material now, we need to separate that out. And you see that the
marketing organization made $22 million in the first quarter on that primarily because of the differential
for most of the quarter between Waha and Houston Ship Channel.

Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Scialla from Stifel.

Guillermo Huerta Gallego
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

This is actually Guillermo stepping in for Mike. My question is a follow-up of the previous question on that
24 million cubic feet per day impact from a processing contract. And maybe you could provide additional
color onto what it may look like going forward?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Yes. So the most important thing to understand on that is that it has no economic impact. So we've got
a contract where we have to have gas processed to make it -- to get it to pipeline spec. And we have a
contract with a third party. And then the third party charges us a fee plus power costs. And this is very
typical of these types of arrangements because power can be a pretty variable cost. And in order to
not take the risk of fluctuations and volatility in power cost, they just pass it on as a means of pricing
the contract. And so what this gas processor does with us, and they do it with many other parties too
because, like I say, this is a very typical term in these types of contracts. They take in-kind portion of the
gas that flows through the plant, and then they effectively take the revenue from that gas as payment
of the power costs. And because of accounting rules, we can't report that as produced volume because
it doesn't belong to us. It effectively belongs to someone else. And so that's the only reason why it's
just -- if we didn't have this contract -- this term in this contract, we would report more volume, report
more revenue, but then we would have an equal amount of more processing costs on the P&L. It has a 0
financial impact.

Guillermo Huerta Gallego
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. So is this impact expected to continue about the same amount going forward?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

It'll -- it fluctuates with gas pricing. And so it will -- if you can predict gas prices, then you'd be able to
predict the volumes. It's because gas prices got so low this quarter that the volume went so high. This will
-- this may -- it occurred last year also in the Permian area. And it certainly will occur in the future most
likely, but it's not a norm.

Operator

We're going to take our next question from Jeanine Wai from Barclays.

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

My first question is on activity and maybe trigger points for pricing. The operating cash margin in the U.S.
continues to lag the North Sea and Egypt pretty meaningfully. And I know the U.S. is kind of a mixed
bag of operating sub areas, but at what oil price would you consider reactivating activity in the Permian?
And we're just asking because to us, the trigger price might be a little different for you than others given
Apache's strong international portfolio and maybe wanting to maximize cash flow because you've got to
continue to fund Suriname and then you've also got the debt maturity coming due.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Jeanine, you actually answered your own question, but we will -- I mean if you think about our priorities,
first thing I'll say is we will be slower to go back to work than we were shutting things down. And we're
going to be very methodical with it. Our priorities are going to be, one, debt; two, would be dividend.
As you start to think about capital, we're going to continue to maintain the exploration and the appraisal
program in Suriname. Egypt would sit next and then you kind of get into the DUCs in the Permian, North
Sea. And then we'd start thinking about the rig lines in Permian.

The nice thing about our unconventional acreage is, most of it we don't have any lease obligations. It's not
going anywhere. We're not losing anything in that option. So it's all just a function of timing. And I think
for us, we want to be very methodical. If you look back to how we kind of went back to work post the '15,
'16 shutdown, and we've kind of been through this drill before as we went from 93 rigs before by second
quarter of '16 at that time period. We started the latter part of '17 ratcheting back up and went to an 8-
rig program and -- on the unconventional Permian side. And we've been scaling back a little bit. So I think
we'd want to see higher, longer deck. And definitely, the advantages we have is the portfolio, and we're
going to be managing cash flow. So that's it.

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Well, really appreciate the detailed response there. That's very helpful. My second question, the
follow-up, is regarding the debt maturities and adjusting those over the next 3 years. Do you have an
estimate of what price oil needs to average in order to pay those off strictly out of free cash flow? And
maybe we're just getting a little too cute here. I know it depends on a ton of different factors that may not
be known today, so maybe an impossible question. But any commentary you might have around the free
cash flow trajectory for Apache would be helpful. I know that you can pay the maturities of the revolver,
and you can fall back on that, but that might not be ideal.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Jeanine -- yes. We're not going to give a lot of guidance or insights into free cash flow in the out
years. So all I'd say is in 2020, we're basically running free cash flow neutral with the current capital
program. If you -- we're running that at about $30 WTI. And so if you take the dividend reduction, the
capital spending we're on right now, the pace of capital spending we're on right now, the cost reductions,
the $300 million of cost reductions, then we're at about a cash flow neutral WTI price of about $30. John
indicated that reducing debt is certainly one of our highest priorities for future free cash flows. We've
indicated in the past that our sensitivity to dollar movement in oil prices is somewhere in the $50 million
to $60 million range. So you could probably use those and get to a solution point on what it might take to
be able to pay down $937 million of debt over the next 3 years.

Operator

Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.

Neal David Dingmann
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Just another one. You guys talked a little on Egypt, and my question is more just on Egypt than North
Sea specifically. Just wondered, John, how do you guys think about maintenance caps there? I know that
you're probably spending more there in Egypt than the maintenance cap. But I'm just wondering, could
you talk about how you view that now as those become more efficient and potential free cash flow of each
-- let's just use sort of the strip-ish prices?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Neal, when we look at those 2 areas, we've typically needed $700 million to $800 million or so to kind
of hold them flat. Combined, and those are -- that's net -- our net portion of the -- for the JV in Egypt with
Sinopec. So when you think about that, we're slightly under that level this year with the reductions. We've
shaved a little bit of that back. But as I mentioned, we've really high graded the inventory in Egypt, and
we're seeing some strong results coming out of there. So that's going to help us with that number. And
then secondly, we've got the luxury of some really nice tie-ins and the timing of those that came on with
our Garten 2 well and so forth, and we've curtailed that well a little bit given price volatility and things
there. So slightly under but in kind of an improving picture in terms of what it takes to maintain those 2
areas.

Neal David Dingmann
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just quickly moving over to Perm. You all mentioned in the release that you thought you'd
have about 70 DUCs. I'm just wondering, is there a sort of level that you're comfortable taking this down
to or just before you bring rigs back? Or just wondering how you think about that count?

16

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

No. That number is just the result of where we were in the program and when we kind of picked up the
reins. I mean we -- it was easier to shut down the completion crews. So that's the first thing we did was
shut the crews down. It took a little bit of notice time on the rigs. As we mentioned, I think we're on our
last well in the Permian as we speak. And so that was purely just a result of kind of where we were. It's
more than we typically would carry because of the shutting the completion crews down first, which is
going to give us a little bit of DUCs to bring on when we decide to put -- come back to them. We'll have
about 15 in Alpine High and the rest are in our Midland Basin unconventional and a handful of those are 3-
mile laterals. So it will give us some uplift when it's time to put some capital back to work.

Operator

Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And I know you've given a lot of bookends in terms of how to think about Apache here going forward. But
just so I'm understanding it, I mean the goal is, as you kind of go through 2020 into 2021 at this point,
based on your current activity level, it seems like you're not spending in -- at maintenance levels when
you talk about that $30 per barrel price sort of resiliency, too. And I'm just curious, like if you brought
yourself to more of a maintenance production mode in each of the areas, what does that price indicator
look like?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean you've got the brackets there, Scott, because we were going to grow slightly with where our
budget originally was, which was geared around a $50 WTI. As we've said now, we can -- kind of cash flow
at $30, but we are going to decline. We're below maintenance levels in the Permian. And so that will come
down. And international is going to be kind of flat, relatively flat. So it's somewhere in between there in
terms of if you were going to call it generate free cash flow and actually keep our volumes flat.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. It's fair enough. And obviously, in Suriname, you've got your things you're submitting to the
government at this point in time. What can we expect from Apache over the course of this next year
in terms of like how we're going to hear new information and what the plan is leading into potential
appraisals? Is it once you get the government response back, you'll have a press release? Or can you give
us a sense of how you're going to report new information to us over the balance of this year?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean that's something we'll work through with our JV partner. I mean, typically, we -- you submit
the appraisal program. It's kind of a work plan. And then we'll go execute that. So we're not in a position
right now with our partner where we're announcing what that entails. We've got a couple of years to do
the appraisal program and before we have to make a decision on FID. And so we want to go about that as
quickly as possible, but we've kind of balanced -- you're going to have to balance that as you get into back
half of this year or early next year with when we start.

Scott Michael Hanold
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Does the current oil price environment impact the FID decision at all much?

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

I mean right now, the good news is that you look at Suriname, you look at the timing of it, you're 4 to 5
years realistically from discovery to when you'd have production online. I think that all of us would look
through to seeing a better price environment. I don't know what the recovery shape is going to look like
more near term. But I think as we get out the time frame where Suriname comes into play and we've seen
no wavering from our partner, and we're fully committed as well. So I think it's something that stays on
track, and it's actually something that we can fund. And our JV is beneficial to our capital profile spending.

Operator

And in the interest of time, we're going to take our final question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

First on -- there's been a bit of an improvement in expectations for natural gas prices into 2021, and I just
wondered what it would take natural gas price-wise, if anything, to either shift or increase capital in the
gassier parts of the Permian, Alpine High or other areas within the portfolio.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, what I'll say, Brian, is it really boils back down to economics in the portfolio, right? So it just goes
to show you, a year ago, we were talking about curtailing gas, and here we are now curtailing oil in the
basin. So it just shows you how quickly things can change. We like having a portfolio. We like having
a commodity mix that gives us levers of where we can put capital and have options, whereas if you're
saddled to being a pure play and one commodity stream, that's what you're tied to. So I'll just say it'll --
the projects will have to compete as we start to put capital back to work. And a lot will hinge on how the
products are trading relative and what the view of them longer term is at that time. So right now, your
gas, your wells and things that have higher -- are more economic right now than the straight oil wells,
which is a total flip from where we were.

Brian Arthur Singer
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up is with regards to hedging strategy. Apache was unhedged in 2019 and
into 2020. And I think there's -- maybe I'm mischaracterizing, but there's been more of a preference to
depend on the movement in capital spending versus the pluses or minuses of hedging. There have been
some hedges that have been added recently, and I just wondered if you can talk more philosophically
about -- if there's been any changes to how we should think about your hedging strategy going forward.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I mean, I think philosophically, no. We came into this unhedged. We saw a lot of short-term volatility in.
And so we really put the hedges in place, swaps Q2 collars and 3 and 4 of the few swaps in Q3. We put
those in as protection to the downside scenario as you work through what was a shutdown, but not a
philosophical change. I don't know, Steve, if there's anything you want to add on the hedging?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, John. I'll always take the opportunity to talk about our philosophy on hedging. So no, it hasn't
changed, Brian. We believe that the best hedge is the ability to have flexibility in your activity. I think the
current price environment proves that. So we think the best hedge is the ability to ramp down activity,
which is what the industry needs to do right now and associated with that to get cost levels down as
low as possible. There are times when we do believe we need to engage in hedging activity. We had one
of those in the past when we had commitments that couldn't be avoided where we had to build out the
midstream at Alpine High. We've got one now where you've got a period where oil prices are getting into
a range where costs just can't be cut low enough to maintain free cash flow. And so that's why we entered
into the hedges as we saw what was happening, we knew second quarter was going to be very, very

APACHE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 07, 2020

painful. You could see that coming, and that's why we hedged the vast majority of our volumes for second
quarter mostly with swaps, all with swaps. And then we've hedged a little bit less for 3Q and even less
still for 4Q. And those have been a combination of swaps and some collars. So we just -- we generally just
believe that we have a preference to refrain from financial hedging. We -- as I spoke about earlier, with
Egypt and coming in the future with Suriname, we do have some natural hedges already in the portfolio.
And it's -- I'll just point out that nobody ever asks us why we didn't hedge after prices run up. They only
ask when prices have run down. So we just -- I'm sure just one of those oddities of the environment that
we're in right now.
