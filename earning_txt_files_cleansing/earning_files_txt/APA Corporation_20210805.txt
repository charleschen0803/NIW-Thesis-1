Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the APA Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I will now hand the conference over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Gary Thomas Clark
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Financial and
Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John
Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results
and 2021 outlook. Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice
President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President, Development, will also be available on
the call to answer questions.

Our prepared remarks will be approximately 12 minutes in length and the remainder of the hour allotted
for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review
our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations
website at investor.apacorp.com.

Please note that we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between
these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can
be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting
practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest
in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.

And finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and
assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could
cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the
supplemental information on our website.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA
Corporation's second quarter results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021.

The company is making good progress on several key initiatives. We generated nearly $400 million of free
cash flow during the second quarter. And at June 30, held approximately $1.2 billion of cash, which will be
used primarily for debt reduction.

In May, we reached an agreement in principle with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation to modernize the terms of our production sharing contracts. The final
draft of which has now been completed and will move to Egyptian Parliament for ratification in the fall
and then to the President for his approval. We are pleased with the progress thus far and believe that this
modernization will return Egypt to the most attractive area for capital investment within our portfolio, and
we'll put Egyptian oil production back on a growth trajectory.

In Suriname, as announced in our press release last week, we drilled a successful appraisal well in the
Sapakara area, moving us closer to our goal of sanctioning the first commercial oil development. We
are generating strong results from our DUC completion program in the Permian. And during the second

APA CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

quarter, we closed 2 smaller scale Central Basin platform asset sales as we continue to optimize our
portfolio.

On the ESG front, APA continues to deliver on our key initiatives and safety metrics. Most notably, at the
beginning of the year, we established an ambitious goal of eliminating routine flaring in the U.S. in 2021,
and I am pleased to announce that we will achieve this goal in the third quarter.

This is the result of adding compression where appropriate, setting clear expectations and rules in the field
and improving hydrocarbon processing at location. These efforts have also helped to drive down our flaring
intensity, which is tracking well below our goal of less than 1% for the year. We are also making great
progress on our water initiatives. In the U.S., we are currently at 3% freshwater usage, which is also well
below our goal of less than 20% for the year.

Turning now to operations. Total adjusted production exceeded our guidance in the second quarter, with
the U.S. benefiting from better-than-expected performance throughout our Permian Basin DUC completion
program. This more than offset lower international volumes where higher oil prices impacted Egypt cost
recovery volumes and we experienced extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital
investment was below our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to timing, while LOE was slightly above
expectations. Our full year outlook for these items remains unchanged.

In the U.S., we placed a total of 27 wells online in the Permian, including 5 at Alpine High. In aggregate,
these wells are significantly exceeding internal expectations driven by a combination of optimization
initiatives. This effectively completes our backlog of Permian DUCs, so you will see fewer well connections
during the second half of the year. You'll also see Permian production come down a bit in the second half
of the year as our current pace of drilling and completions is not sufficient to offset the initial declines from
the DUC completion program.

As previously planned, we added a second Permian Basin rig in late June, which will enable a steadier
pace of completions. In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled 3 operated wells and are pleased with the
results thus far. We are evaluating the addition of a third drilling rig in the U.S., as previously noted, which
would put us on a path to sustained oil production. Given strong oil prices and the recent improvement in
natural gas and NGL prices, all of our U.S. asset areas are attractive candidates for this rig addition.

In Egypt, we have increased our rig count to 8 and continue to build high-quality inventory across our
expanded acreage footprint. Facilities expansion constrained our ability to connect wells in the first half
of the year and contributed to a decline in gross production during the second quarter. As we wrap up
our facilities work, well connections will increase significantly in the second half of the year and gross
production will begin trending up.

In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig and 1 platform rig crew. During the second quarter,
production was impacted by compressor downtime, extended platform turnaround work and third-party
pipeline outages. Some of this carried over into July. And when combined with planned maintenance
turnarounds at barrel, will lead to only a modest production increase in the third quarter. Once we
conclude this heavy maintenance period, production volumes in the North Sea should return to more
normalized levels in the fourth quarter.

In Suriname's Block 58, we are running 2 rigs. Upon completion of drilling operations at Sapakara, the
Maersk Valiant will mobilize to the Bonboni exploration prospect, approximately 45 kilometers to the
north. Following Bonboni, the Valiant will return to flow test the Sapakara South-1 well. Drilling activities
continue at the Keskesi South-1 appraisal well with the Maersk developer.

On Block 53, where APA is the operator and 45% working interest owner, we recently signed a contract
with Noble Corporation to secure a drillship that will commence exploration operations in the first quarter
of 2022.

Before turning the call over to Steve, I would like to comment on our outlook for the remainder of the
year. Oil prices year-to-date have averaged well above our original budgeted level of $45 WTI. And more
recently, gas and NGL prices have also begun to significantly exceed budgeted levels. This has created a
very welcome amount of incremental free cash flow and will enable substantial progress on debt reduction

this year. More importantly, our 2021 capital program will remain unchanged at $1.1 billion, even if we
decide to add a third rig in the U.S. later this year.

In June, we opened our Houston and Midland offices and began welcoming back the majority of our
office staff as permitted by regional guidelines. It has been great to see more in-person collaboration in
settings that we took for granted prior to COVID-19, and we will remain diligent with our protocols to keep
employees safe.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the second
quarter and our 2021 outlook.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting
principles, APA Corporation reported second quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $316 million or
$0.82 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings.

Excluding the second quarter impacts of divestiture gains, movements in our tax valuation allowance,
mark-to-market derivative losses and other smaller items, adjusted net income was $266 million or $0.70
per share. Most of our financial results were in line or better than guidance this quarter, with just a few
minor exceptions.

As we've discussed in the past, we continuously review our portfolio for the right time to monetize assets
that no longer compete for funding. In the second quarter, we closed the sales of 2 such packages in the
Central Basin platform. These were mostly lower margin conventional waterflood assets, which we're
producing roughly 2,500 barrels of oil per day. Proceeds from the sales were $178 million.

As we look forward to the rest of 2021, we are updating some of our full year guidance items. We are
effectively increasing U.S. production guidance by 4,500 BOEs per day and decreasing international
adjusted production guidance by 14,500 BOEs per day compared to the midpoint of the previous
respective ranges. This net decrease of 10,000 BOEs per day for the full year reflects the strong
underlying performance of our U.S. assets, but it also captures the impact of a few offsets, the unplanned
operational downtime in the North Sea, the impact of higher oil prices on Egypt cost recovery barrels and
the recent Permian Basin asset sales. We are reducing full year DD&A guidance by $125 million, which
reflects a combination of price-related reserve additions and the impact of our changing production mix
with lower North Sea volumes and higher U.S. volumes.

Finally, other than an increase to our expected U.K. tax expense due to strong commodity prices, there
are no material changes to the remainder of our guidance for the year. On a longer-term perspective,
one of our most important strategic goals is to return to investment-grade status, which will require a
significant reduction in debt. In the near term, progress towards this goal takes priority over the capital
program, which, today, is still below a sustaining level of development capital. In other words, we are
willing to under-invest slightly in the short term to build balance sheet strength and financial resilience for
the longer term.

We entered 2021 anticipating a multiyear process of debt reduction. With this price environment, we're
making significant progress more quickly than we thought possible. In the first half of the year, at an
average WTI price of $62, we delivered upstream-only free cash flow, which excludes dividends received
from Altus Midstream of $860 million. Assuming current strip prices for the second half of 2021, upstream-
only free cash flow for the full year is expected to be around $1.7 billion. The vast majority of this cash will
be available for debt reduction.

The rating agencies will ultimately decide when we return to investment grade, but we will clearly make
significant progress in 2021. With meaningful progress on debt in sight, we would remind everyone
that we have a strong portfolio of investable inventory, and it would be prudent to at least increase
development capital to a production sustaining level. We estimate this would require around $1.2 billion of
annual investment versus the $900 million we are investing in development capital this year.

APA CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

At this investment pace, and assuming prices remain flat with 2021, as we look out to the next several
years, APA is capable of generating upstream-only free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion annually.
This is all based on our current portfolio of assets. And to highlight what the current portfolio can deliver,
this analysis assumes no further investment or future benefit from Suriname and no free cash flow uplift
associated with Egypt modernization, which is still pending.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

One for Steve and one for you, John, if that's okay? Steve, thank you, first of all, for clarifying the more
than $1 billion of free cash flow. It's much appreciated.

The question I have is sustainability of that. The key thing for us is the value of the base business, is
how long you can, just in that cash flow, you said for a significant amount of time. Can you put some
parameters around that, so we can kind of back into what the market isn't paying for? And I've got a
follow-up, please.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Doug, and let me actually put some parameters around the whole $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of free
cash flow that I talked about in my prepared remarks.

And John said it gets confusing because of the same numbers. But John talked about 2021 being $1.7
billion of free cash flow, and that's based on first half actual prices plus the second half strip, and that is
our internal most current outlook for the business for the full year.

In 2022, we say $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of free cash flow, and that is sustainable for a run of years, and
we can talk about that a bit. I'd put 2 caveats on that. Number one, we're not attempting in any way to
give guidance for '22 and beyond at this point in time. That's a hypothetical case. But I want people to
understand that, that's a very realistic case. We know our inventory today better than we've ever known
it. And we put together a realistic case based on what we would actually invest in, in the current price
environment.

As I said in my remarks, it is focused on the current portfolio. So we've kind of chosen to eliminate
the noise associated with Suriname. It doesn't have any future Suriname CapEx. No future Suriname
production or free cash flow. And just to be clear, we don't want that to be -- to come across as any
reflection on our feelings about Suriname because that doesn't reflect that at all.

The prices that we used in that case are exactly the same as the 2021 prices because I didn't want those
to affect the comparability of the results. The CapEx, as we know, 2021 is $1.1 billion. In our hypothetical
case for '22 and beyond, it's $1.2 billion. There's a difference though. The $1.1 billion includes $200
million of exploration spend, which is mostly focused on Suriname exploration and appraisal. So there's
only $900 million of development capital in there.

The $1.2 billion for '22 is all development capital. And we've talked about a number slightly lower than
that, $1.1 billion is sustaining capital development -- capital spending. That was when we were talking
about sustaining oil production volume. The case that we've put together now sustains -- the $1.2 billion
sustains BOEs on a per day basis. So it actually is full production sustaining for a run of years that's
adding capital to -- mostly to Egypt and to the U.S.

Under this case, there's a slight decline in volume from '21 to '22 on an annualized basis, but then it's
sustained from 2022 forward. So some people might be wondering, okay, you're spending $100 million
more of CapEx and you have a lower volume, but free cash flow is roughly the same from '21 to '22. How
do you do that?

First, there's debt paydown assumed in that. So there's less interest expense. Because we are going
to pay down somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion of debt, a little more than that, including

APA CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

what was on the revolver at the beginning of the year. And then the other thing that people may not fully
appreciate is that the forward look. Our production mix is changing. The spending will create a decline in
gas volume and growth in oil volumes. So again, prior case, we talked about was a lower capital because it
was just sustaining oil volume. This one is sustaining total volume, but growing oil relative to gas.

And again, a reminder, that doesn't include anything in there for Egypt PSC modernization, which is going
to be meaningful. The specific question that you had about the -- how long this is sustainable. If we want
to get into the inventory, I'd let David Pursell take that. I'll give him a chance to make a comment here
quickly. But this is -- when I say for a run of years, I'll stick with the comment I made last time you asked
me this question, Doug, and that is this is at least for 5 to 10 years that we can see out into the future.

Dave, you have anything to add?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

I would just confirm the -- it's well beyond -- it's in that kind of 10-year window, well beyond 5 years. And
once you get beyond 10, it's hard to think about anybody paying for that inventory. But it has absolute
sustainability to it.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

I really appreciate that because that's kind of what I was really trying to get to. I'm going to -- I love the
tip of the hat to Egypt should be significant. I'm guessing you're not going to answer that question, so I'm
going to go to Suriname, John, if you don't mind.

When you saw what we said about this, it seems to me that if you're 2.5 miles away, with pretty much the
same thickness on the formation and your oil target in Sapakara. You're going to start to get some idea
of the tank size. I will like to know that we had a chance to speak with the head of Staatsolie, who talked
about this as being, "massive."

So I wonder if you could just offer any thoughts on resource scale at this point, maybe a little bit of an
explanation to why not forecast at that time. Why do you have to come back to it?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Now Doug, I appreciate the question. I mean we are in the middle of the appraisal. And as we said, we
have not flow tested Sapakara South. Unfortunately, just to clarify, the testing equipment on the Valiant
is damaged, and that's why. Otherwise, we'd be flow testing that thing now. But it's going to take some
time to repair that equipment, and that's why the ship is going to sail on up to Bonboni and get on to the
exploration well that we're excited about.

But we need flow tests there, and we're in the middle of appraisal. So we have not put out volumes yet.
I mean clearly, we're fine-tuning things and working with things. And we've talked about this being an
important step towards potentially an FID, but it's just a little bit premature to get into areas and those
things until we gather a lot more data, and we'll do that as we continue to appraise and analyze what
we've collected. But we're clearly excited about it. Having 30 meters of 1 blocky sand that's full base, high
quality is the type of thing that you can build around because you've got your H there, but there's a lot
more to do here and a lot more to appraise.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

John, are we out the launch on our current model, 0.5 billion?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Repeat that. You cut out on me, Doug, I did not hear.

APA CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Sorry. Are we out to launch on our tank model to suggest order of magnitude with no oil-water contact?
You could be sitting on $0.5 billion on that prospect?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I'm just not going to comment at this point. We've got more appraisal. I appreciate the question, and I'm
going to stick to where we are. It's early. We're appraising. And -- but we're clearly excited about it. And
-- but I'm not going to comment on your question there.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.

John Christopher Freeman
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

The first question, I just wanted to clarify one thing on Egypt. So if you had the 5 rigs last quarter, you're
now running 8 rigs. When we sort of think about the PSC being approved, and obviously I've been vocal
again on this call about that would -- once it's approved, that's going to see an increase in activity.

I'm just trying to make sure that I'm using the right baseline, so that the incremental 5 rigs to 8 rigs -- I
always -- I know there was always some incremental activity planned in the second half, but is the 8 rigs
the baseline that we're supposed to use ahead of PSC? Or was there any maybe additional rig or 2 that
was added sort of in anticipation of the PSC being approved? Just want to make sure when I'm thinking
about 2022 modeling, that I'm using the right starting point.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean, clearly, we're taking some steps that we've agreed with them. But in terms of your baseline
for capital in those items, I think we're in the fairway to stay where we are.

Dave, anything you want to add?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

John, I think it's a good question. We've said, I think, hinted in the past that we think we need 8 to 9 rigs
to keep oil production flat in Egypt. And I think you'll see the 8 rigs get us pretty close to that. And then
we'll see what -- where we go after modernization. But I think John and Steve both talked about post
modernization could put us on a path to grow in Egypt.

So rig sustain, that's, I think, is a pretty good baseline on your model.

John Christopher Freeman
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up, and it's in conjunction, Steve, with a detailed response you gave
to Doug's question when sort of hypothetically thinking about 2022. So if I take what you just said on
Egypt and the 8 rigs were already have sort of maintained levels and we'll just assume something north of
that. So like Egypt post PSC would be growing the North Sea.

I previously talked about 1 rig 1 platform can kind of maintain volumes with that 55,000 to 60,000 range.
Obviously, first half of this year due to the extended maintenance, you're a good bit below that. So just
by default, the North Sea is going to be up a decent bit in '22 versus '21. And then the Permian, it sounds
likely -- the base case sounds like it would be to add the third rig in the Permian at year-end '21, which

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

APA CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

gets that back to sort of a flattish sort of a sustained sort of profile. So ex [ turning ] on the light, just
hypothetically thinking about those regions, right.

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. I think directionally, John, that's about right. Most of the most of the increased capital will be going
to Egypt and a bit to the North Sea -- I mean to the U.S. as well, probably not a whole lot of additional
capital in the North Sea, if any, but it'll be better production in the North Sea simply because of the
downtime that we've had this year, which is both planned and unplanned has been pretty material for
second and third quarter.

But again, I'll just remind you, John, that this is a hypothetical case. We're not trying to give any type of
guidance or rolling out specific capital plans for 2022. That's still ahead of us for later this year. We'll talk
about that some -- probably with third quarter earnings.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I might be over interpreting this, but the fact that the Maersk Developer is going to come back and
appraise Keskesi South. Does that mean that if you get a successful result on the well test, that's all the
information you'll need on Sapakara to move it forward to FID? Or would you expect more appraisal wells
there?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

At this point, Bob, it clearly needs to come back. We need a flow test. But I'll just say, we still are
appraising, and we may need more appraisal. And so I wouldn't read into it anything more than that.

Robert Alan Brackett
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. Just -- so there's multiple opportunities to move forward in the appraisal pipeline?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Correct.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla with Stifel.

Guillermo Huerta Gallego
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

This is actually Guillermo stepping in for Mike. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color
on the CBP asset sale? Do you foresee to monetize more noncore assets like this one? Are there any other
assets in the U.S. that you would want to increase your presence on?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I mean I think we've always looked at the portfolio as something that's kind of in flux. We're always
looking for things that make sense to monetize. I'd characterize what we sold is pretty high-water cut,
higher lifting costs, some properties we've had in the portfolio for quite some time. And quite frankly, it's
time to move those along the food chain to somebody else that will put more focused attention on them

APA CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

and, quite frankly, a little cheaper cost structure. But at this point, nothing major as planned, as always is
the case. We like to report on these after we've done things, but we're constantly looking at a number of
things. So -- but nothing major planned at this point.

Guillermo Huerta Gallego
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

That's helpful. And my follow-up, maybe on inflation. Are you seeing inflation in the drilling rates? You're
planning to add that third rig, so I was just wondering you would foresee a more expensive rate on that
additional rig?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I think in general, on the inflation side, we had a lot of our key items secured for this year. I think you get
into the -- into 2022, and we are seeing some uptick in things that are around the commodities people,
things like that. But I don't know, anything particular, Dave, on rig contracts you want to comment on?

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. I think if you're looking for places for inflation, the completion side, pressure pumping and frac
is where you'll see more inflation. We have that dialed in to our forward. Anything that has to do with
commodities, whether it's steel or on LOE with chemicals and diesel usage, you'll obviously price inflation
there. But for -- when we look at our forward plan, we think we have it adequately captured.

Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

I guess 2 quick ones, if I could. First, just on sort of capital allocation, how you're thinking about things.
My question is, I guess, once you obviously start ramping up in Egypt, is that going to simultaneously
then would that take capital away from the U.S. and others? Or I'm just wondering could you talk about
the thoughts about when that happens? Kind of how you view that activity versus what you're thinking
domestically?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

I mean I think we've got a pretty good base run that we're running right now, and that's where we've
been. We've been pretty consistent. We did pick up the first 2 rigs early this year. We added a second rig
in the Permian. We had a rig that drilled 4 wells in the Chalk in East Texas in the U.S. But -- and North Sea
has been pretty constant. Egypt, we've kind of moved from 5 or 6 rigs up to 8. But in general, pretty level
loaded, pretty constant, and I think it'll be pretty consistent. As building blocks going forward, you will,
post modernization, see some changes to Egypt, but it will not impact cash flow or the capital in the other
areas in a negative way.

Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. I assume that is good to hear that, John. And then just a follow-up for you, Steve. To me,
given what appears to be a strong transparency you continue to have with free cash flow, when do you
all think about, I don't know, either call it notably or materially boosting dividends or free cash flow in
addition to that -- your solid debt repayment program that you continue with?

I mean I think the first priority is exactly that. We came in to this year with too much debt, and we plan
to pay that down, as Steve's made very clear. I think once we make progress there, then you can start to
think about the dividend, but the first priority has been the debt. And clearly, we're on a much faster pace
there than we would have envisioned at the start of the year.

But anything you want to add, Steve?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

No. Neal, I'd just say that when do we think about it, we think about that all the time. And we do realize it
is a -- it's important and we need to do that. And so I'm sure with the amount of debt paydown that we're
going to accomplish this year, we'll be talking about that in due course. It's certainly moving forward, not
backwards.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

John, 2 quick questions.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Okay.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

First, the second quarter effective tax rate on the adjusted operating earnings seems low. Is there any
one-off items in there? Or what contributed to that? It seems like less than 30% effective tax rate.

Secondly, just curious, I mean, I think a lot of people will argue, U.S. still have too many operators in
the U.S. shale. We don't need all the operators. So wondering that for Apache. Does it make sense that
for you to try and to fund a company with the nearby the land position? And for my last Q, joint venture
and put everything together, everyone still have their equity ownership, so no one's paying any equity
premium to anyone. But by doing it this way, you can drive much better efficiency and cost improvement
than individually, perhaps, that the company could be able to do. So is that something that you guys will
entertain or you think that doesn't make sense for Apache?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'll let Steve address the effective tax rate question first, and then I'll come back to your -- the
second part.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Paul, I think I understand the question around the effective tax rate. What -- as you'll recall, we
have put a 100% valuation allowance on the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryforward in the
U.S. on the balance sheet. You normally carry a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet. And we've put a
complete valuation allowance on that, reducing that asset on the balance sheet to 0, even though we do
have a pretty significant tax net operating loss carryforward.

And what we do in periods of time like this, in the second quarter, when we have booked income in the
U.S. and we would normally recognize a tax expense, we release enough of that valuation allowance just
to offset the tax expense for that quarter. And you'll see that -- you'll see the $60 million in our non-GAAP

reconciliation from net income to adjusted earnings in that -- in the appendix in our supplement. So that'll
have the effect of lowering the effective tax rate quite a bit.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I see. So as long as that we have this core commodity prices and U.S. is earning a fair amount, we should
assume the effective tax rate will be substantially lower than what, say, under more normal tax rate will
suggest?

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Correct.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. We do.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

And Paul, your second question, it really just boils down to value. I mean I think the nice thing about our
assets, we've got high working interest. We now have 2 rigs operating in the Permian. I think it boils down
to scale, efficiency and value added. And in some areas, that could make a lot of sense. Some areas, it
may not make sense.

But we're open to looking at things is always the case. But today, I think we like where we are. We like
the pace. We like what we're doing. I think our wells are very competitive, and the performance is very
strong. And I think we're putting attention on the right assets within our portfolio today for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens.

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

When you guys -- want to discuss about Alpine. With the scenarios you laid out and keeping now
equivalent volumes flat, is it fair to assume that Alpine potentially gets more capital on the '22 forward
time frame? And how -- can you just talk about the 5 DUCs that you're completing? And how those
compare to previous wells?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'll let Dave touch on the DUC performance on those. And as Steve outlined, Gail, it's holding BOEs
flat, but we actually are going to be growing oil and offsetting some of the gas in those cases. So I'll let
Steve handle that, and then Dave, you can talk about the Alpine DUCs.

Stephen J. Riney
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Gail. So just to be clear, again, we're not trying to say what exactly our capital program is going to
be in 2022 and beyond. The hypothetical case that we use did not contain funding of additional drilling in
Alpine High. So it's more oil-focused than gas-focused, thus gas volumes going down into the future, oil
volumes going up.

But we look at that all of the time, certainly with gas and NGL prices improving in the recent months and
could continue to improve. That will be something that we will evaluate. And as we finish up this year and

roll into next year, we'll get into the actual capital program for 2022, which very well could include some
capital for Alpine High.

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. And Gail, on the performance, so we've completed 7 DUCs just to level set, 2 early in the program
and 5 kind of more in the meat of the program. The wells -- I think all the wells are meaningfully
outperforming our expectations and prior well results for offset wells that we would have completed
in the 2019 time frame. So very excited about the results. The last -- the most recent 5, still early.
They're producing. They've cleaned up, and they're producing well, but we want to continue to watch the
performance curve before we spike the ball.

Gail Amanda Nicholson Dodds
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Great. And then just on the exploration front, there's a tremendous amount of potential on Suriname, but
you've also had success in other areas, like the tertiary in the North Sea with -- along with Guyana that
you disclosed earlier this year. I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about exploration outside
of Suriname over the next couple of years.

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Tracey, I'll let you...

Tracey K. Henderson
Senior Vice President of Exploration

Gail, I think we are very excited about Suriname, as you mentioned. And I think we'll be looking for other
opportunities. I think we are in a very opportunity-rich environment for exploration. So it's early days.
I've been with Apache now just right at 2 months. So we'll hear -- you'll hear more about that as we go
forward. But definitely, we'll be looking at other opportunities.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just wanted to follow up a little bit on Suriname here. You guys mentioned that you're in the process
of picking up a rig to drill a well, Apache operated on Block 53. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit
more information about that. Is this kind of a mandatory well to hold the block? Is this kind of a one-off
exploration well as you folks see it? And I guess, is it just kind of a short-term rig deal as a result? And
what would be the rough capital net to at Apache to go and execute that?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Leo, we've actually got 1 rig or 1 well required to continue to hold the block. And so we've got to spread
a well by June of next year. And we're excited about that. I think there's a lot of prospectivity in Block 53.
In terms of where you look. Where the costs are going today, well costs are probably going to be close to
$100 million would be my guess for gross. And we've got about 45% working interest in there. But I'll let
Tracey talk a little bit about what we see exploration-wise is we've got both slope and more of a deepwater
setting on Block 53, like we do at Block 58.

APA CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

Yes. leveraging on what John just said, we -- it's certainly not a one-off exploration or seen as a
mandatory well. I think what we've learned is an incredible amount with the exploration wells that we've
drilled across 58. And the petroleum systems within the basin continues right into Block 53. So we're
actually very excited, and we see some prospectivity that's very analogous to what we've been drilling in
Block 58 and what we've just seen with some of the recent appraisal wells. I think we've learned a lot,
and those learnings will be leveraged into what we see in Block 53, because we do see very analogous
systems.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful color. And I guess just given kind of the substantial plans that are existing in Block
58, which I assume is going to involve at least a couple of rigs every year for the next several years. And
I know you have to get a well done by June, but can you give us a sense of -- if you are successful here in
Block 53, is this kind of just another leg of the stool where this can kind of be a block that has concurrent
activity over the next couple of years in parallel with Block 58? How do you think about the success case
here?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean the nice thing is we've got 2 partners here. We've got 45%. So I think it gives us a lot of
optionality as we start to think about it. We are the operator of Block 53. We did do the joint venture
and handed over operations in Block 58 to Total. But I think it just builds up more optionality and more
flexibility for us to look for different ways to continue to advance, some longer-term, very meaningful
programs.

Leo Paul Mariani
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just lastly on this potential for the third rig that you've talked about
here. Obviously, you decided to add some activity in Egypt. And I think you guys have strongly alluded to
the fact that a third rig can kind of show up in the Permian.

Just trying to get a sense of what's kind of the decision point there? Is it really just about sustained higher
commodity prices in the year-end? And if that occurs, is that third rig pretty much kind of coming for next
year to try to hold BOEs flat with oil up and gas down a little?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Well, we have not made a decision on a third rig. I want to make that really clear. It's not in the budget
this year. I think it's important because we've been underinvesting below sustaining levels to kind of
articulate what it would take. And as Steve said in his prepared remarks, we're prioritizing debt pay down
and the balance sheet first, which is why we've been underinvesting. But the third rig would be required
to get to a sustaining level in the U.S., and so we've got pretty attractive options for that. So that's why
that's framed that way. But it is not a foregone conclusion that we're bringing it. We have not made that
call and capital remain at the $1.1 billion for 2021.

Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

My first one is just a follow-up on U.S. upstream. Obviously, throughout the first half year, U.S. volumes
have been more than offsetting the planned and unplanned international downtown, which you see more
about in the full year guide as well, even net of the CBP sales.

APA CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 05, 2021

So just hoping you could talk more about what you've been seeing in non-Alpine High Permian now that
we're through the first half of the year and how that might influence capital allocation within non-Alpine
High Permian specifically.

David Alan Pursell
Executive Vice President of Development

Yes. Jeoffrey, this is Dave. Good. Thanks for the question. We're seeing a meaningful uplift in our
performance on the Permian DUCs outside of Alpine as well. And it's -- we're optimizing on the number of
different variables. We're excited about that program.

And so when we -- I think Steve talked about it in his prepared remarks. When we look at our U.S.
portfolio, we have multiple places where they could compete for the capital for that third rig, and that
would be the chalk. It could be in third rig in the oily Permian and possibly the third rig in Alpine. So we're
evaluating those, but we're very excited about the performance that we've seen in the improvements that
we continue.

Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then second, just to try on the Egypt PSC modernization and understanding you can't speak
to specific terms. Is there anything you can share at this time? Maybe just on what mechanics are in flux
that'll help to increase capital allocation to that region?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

No. I mean I think you just got to look at it in terms of modernizing. It's -- we've got a lot of concessions.
We'll be collapsing those merging joint ventures. I mean there's a lot to do there administratively that's
going to make it easier and it will effectively keep us from trapping capital. But we're not in a position to
elaborate more than that today. It's going through the approval process and we should be in a position to
talk about it later this year for sure.

Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Pickering Energy.

David Martin Heikkinen
Pickering Energy Partners Insights

Thanks for the -- that little framework. It is helpful and we won't hold you to it for your budget. One of the
things that we're curious about, and on the gas side, have you all thought about joining any of the, like,
oil and gas methane partnerships or certifying your natural gas or moving in any of that direction to really
quantify the improvements you're showing around emissions?

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think we're a member of one, Future. I think what our approach has been to take real tangible
projects and steps that we can take. We're in the middle right now, working on our sustainability report,
which will be coming out later in the year, like we always do. And so we're monitoring all those things.

I think the key for us is trying to focus on what are the material things we can do in our business that are
going to lower those emissions and drive performance, right? And so those are the things we're focused
on.

David Martin Heikkinen
Pickering Energy Partners Insights

And as you think about your operations globally, would you move towards quantifying carbon equivalent
emissions per barrel for the North Sea, Egypt or your U.S. operations?

measure those and take those steps. And then we'll just be making the -- determining how -- what's
the best way to show it and the best way to quantify it and also how to attack it. In the end, it's about
lowering emissions.

At this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to John Christmann.

John J. Christmann
CEO, President & Director

Thank you. So before ending today's call, I'd like to leave you with 3 points. The first 2 of which are
important catalysts. First, we are very encouraged with the progress in Suriname and look forward to
having further results later this year.

Second, the PSC modernization in Egypt will have an immediate positive impact for both the country and
APA, and we are very pleased with how things are progressing. Finally, the free cash flow capacity of our
base business is robust and sustainable, and this will materialize in returns to investors.

Thank you for participating in our call today. Operator, over to you.
