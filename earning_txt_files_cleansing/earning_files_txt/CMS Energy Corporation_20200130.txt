CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CMS Energy 2019 Fourth Quarter Results. The earnings
news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's
website in the Investor Relations section.

This call is being recorded.

[Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning
at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through February 6. This presentation is also being webcast and is
available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor
Relations. Please, go ahead.

Srikanth Maddipati
VP of IR & Treasurer

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief
Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please
refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially.

This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most
directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.

Now I'll turn the call over to Patti.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Sri. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on our year-end earnings call.

This morning, I'll share our financial results for 2019 and our 2020 outlook. I'll discuss the roll forward of
our 5-year capital plan and provide an update on key regulatory matters. Rejji will add more details on our
financial results as well as a look ahead to 2020 and beyond. And of course, we look forward to the Q&A.

For 2019, I'm excited to report adjusted earnings of $2.49 per share. We were able to achieve another
year of adjusted 7% EPS growth, despite record storms and a variety of headwinds throughout the year.
Thanks to our unique operational capabilities that enable us to adapt to changing conditions by managing
the work and driving out costs through our lean operating system, the CE Way.

For 2019 results in the books, we're raising the lower end of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance from $2.63
to $2.64, giving us a range of $2.64 to $2.68, with a bias to the midpoint, which is up 6% to 8% from the
actual result we achieved in 2019. As we roll our plan forward 1 year, it reflects an additional $0.5 billion
in our 5-year capital plan at the utility, which supports our long-term annual adjusted EPS and dividend
growth of 6% to 8%, and is in line with our previously announced 10-year $25 billion customer investment
plan.

While there's been a lot of recent discussion around ESG, it's a topic that is not new to us. Our continued
success at CMS is driven by our commitment to deliver on the triple bottom line of people, planet and
profit. We don't trade one for the other. So while 2019 marked our 17th year of industry-leading EPS

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

growth, it was also a remarkable year for our commitment to people, our customers and coworkers and
our planet.

Our customers awarded us our highest J.D. Power customer satisfaction scores ever, and named us #1 in
the Midwest for residential gas. Those satisfied customers were served by a highly engaged and diverse
workforce. Our accomplishments on the planet include reaching a settlement in our integrated resource
plan, the announcement of our net-zero methane emissions goal by 2030 for our gas delivery system and
restoring over 1,500 acres of land in our home state.

Our ability to meet our triple bottom line is underpinned by world class performance, and we delivered
our best ever customer on-time delivery metrics; eliminated more than $20 million of waste through the
implementation of the CE Way, settled our electric rate case for only the second time in our history, and
received a gas rate case order that allows us to invest significantly in the safety and reliability of our large
and aging gas system.

Although 2019 has been another excellent year of solid performance and record achievements, we are
still dissatisfied. We'll continue to keep improving as we work to deliver our financial and operational
commitments year after year.

Now every year, you'll see the ups and downs that come our way, as illustrated on Slide 6. And every year,
our unique capability of adapting to changing conditions enables us to deliver the results you expect, year-
end and year out.

In 2019, we were met with challenge after challenge as storm restoration costs, surpassed our full year
budget to 6 months into the year. But we don't make excuses for storms or other weather-related impacts
on revenue. This is what I love about our model, where we ride the roller coaster for you, so you can
enjoy the smooth and predictable outcome highlighted by the green line.

This model has served our customers and view over the last decade plus, and we'll continue to utilize it
going forward. I feel compelled to give a shout out to the entire CMS Energy team for the tenacity and the
agility they demonstrated in 2019. Given the headwinds we faced and challenges we overcame, I could
not be more proud of the results and thankful for the efforts of my co-workers.

Like we do every year, we're celebrating on the run and moving on to our next set of priorities and setting
new goals. With 2019 behind us and as we prepare to deliver in 2020, we'll continue to make progress
on ensuring the safety of our gas system, driving customer satisfaction and delivering on our clean
energy plan. The goals we've set for ourselves in 2020 are ambitious. And as always, they're fueled by
the continuing maturity of our lean operating system, the CE Way. Our ability to execute on our capital
plan and make the investments our system needs will depend on our ability to see and eliminate waste,
wherever it is.

As we continue to mature in the CE Way, we are creating a culture, where all of our co-workers are both
motivated and able to fulfill our purpose. World class performance, delivering hometown service. These
simple words mean a lot to us.

Our systems capital demands at the utility continued to grow. And to that end, we're rolling our capital
plan forward an additional year, which will increase the spend over the next 5 years to about $12.25 billion
and supports rate base growth of 7% over that period. This increase reflects the continued ramp-up in
annual capital investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve the safety and reliability of
our systems as well as increased investments in solar generation assets agreed to in our IRP, which was
approved by the commission last year.

It's worth noting that only about 15% of these projects over the next 5 years are above $200 million,
and about 75% of those projects are addressed in multiyear commission orders such as the IRP, which
mitigates risk and provides more certainty around execution and regulatory outcomes.

We'll also remind you that our 5-year customer investment plan is limited, not by the needs of our
system as that stretches vast and wide across the great state of Michigan, but instead, by balance sheet
constraints, workforce capacity and customer affordability.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Looking now towards regulatory matters. With the 2016 energy loss fully implemented, and with the
benefits of tax reform addressed in recent commission orders. Our regulatory calendar for 2020 is much
lighter than in recent years. Last year, we agreed to stay out of an electric rate case and the strategy
served us well as we were able to capitalize on some of the cost performance efforts by leveraging the CE
Way.

Now we'll have the opportunity to funnel some of those cost savings back to our customers and offset
some of the capital investment need. Coupled with our efforts to ramp our energy efficiency savings to 2%
by 2021, we'll keep customers' bills affordable. We anticipate filing our next electric rate case by the end
of this quarter.

In December 2019, we filed a request in our gas rate case for $245 million of incremental revenue,
including a 10.5% ROE and an equity ratio of 52.5% relative to debt, as we continue to focus on the
safety and reliability of our gas delivery system. This case builds on the order in our last gas case, where
nearly all of the capital investments were approved because you would expect the needs of our system
haven't changed that much in just 1 year.

In conjunction with our gas case, we also filed our 10-year natural gas delivery plan, which provides a
detailed look into the long-term needs of our gas delivery system and supports our 10-year capital plan.

We're thankful for the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan that allows for timely rate orders
and forward planning. And the commission's commitment to working with us to continuously improve the
safety and reliability of our system.

I'll remind you, regardless of changing conditions around us, our triple bottom line and simple business
model have served our customers and investors well and allows us to perform consistently year in and
year out.

As highlighted on Slide 10, our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver the consistent premium
results you've come to expect year after year after year. And this year, you can expect the same.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details, I'd like to share the wonderful
news that Travis Uphaus from our IR team and his wife, Maryland, welcome their seventh child, Mara
Christine Uphaus on Tuesday morning. So we are wishing the Uphaus family our very best from our
headquarters in Jackson, Michigan.

As Patti highlighted, we're pleased to report our 2019 adjusted net income of $708 million with $2.49 per
share, up 7% year-over-year.

Our adjusted EPS excludes select nonrecurring items, including estimated severance and retention costs
for our co workers at our corn coal facilities, which is scheduled to be retired in 2023 as well as the
recognition of an expense related to the potential settlement of legacy legal matters. 2019 results of the
utility were largely driven by constructive outcomes from our electric rate case settlement in January
of 2019, and the gas rate order we received in September, which were partially offset by heavy storm
activity, particularly in the first 3 quarters of the year. Our nonutility segments beat guidance by $0.02 in
aggregate, largely due to low-cost financings at CMS energy and solid performance from EnerBank. As
we review our full suite of financial and customer affordability targets for 2019 on Slide 12, you'll note
that in addition to achieving 7% annual adjusted EPS growth, we grew our dividend commensurately and
generated approximately $1.8 billion of operating cash flow.

Our steady cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy over the years, continue to fortify our
balance sheet, as evidenced by our strong FFO to debt ratio, which is approximately 17.5% at year-end
and required no equity issuances in 2019. Lastly, in accordance with our self-funding model, we effectively
met our customer affordability targets by keeping bills at or below inflation for both the gas and electric

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

businesses, all while investing a record level of capital of approximately $2.3 billion at the utility. Moving
on to 2020. As patty noted, we are raising our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance from $2.64 to $2.68 per
share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth off of our 2019 actuals.

Unsurprisingly, we expect utility to drive the vast majority of our consolidated financial performance, with
the usual steady contribution from the non Utility business segments. One item to note is that enterprises
EPS guidance is slightly down from their 2019 results, given the absence of a gain on the sale of select
assets in the second quarter of 2019. All in, we'll continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS
growth range at year-end. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2020 EPS guidance range as
you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 14, we plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to
an estimated $0.06 of negative variance, negative year-over-year variance, given the cold of the normal
weather experienced in 2019 to the benefit of our gas business.

We anticipate that cost reduction initiatives, largely driven by this EU [indiscernible], and other expected
sources of year-over-year favorability such as lower storm restoration expenses after an unprecedented
level of storm activity last year, will fully offset the absence of favorable weather in 2019. It is also worth
noting that we capitalize on an opportunity to fully fund our defined benefit pension plan earlier this
month, which provides additional nonoperating cost savings and EPS risk mitigation.

Moving on to rate relief. We anticipate approximately $0.17 of EPS pickup in 2020. As mentioned during
our Q3 call, about 2/3 of this pickup has already been approved by the commission in the gas rate order
we received in September. And the approval of our renewable energy plan in the first quarter of 2019.
We'll expect the final order in our pending gas case in October of this year, which effectively makes up the
balance of our expected rate relief driven EPS contribution in 2020. While we plan to file an electric case
in Q1 of this year, the test year for that case will start in 2021. Lastly, we apply our usual conservative
assumptions around sales, financings and other variables. As always, we'll adapt to new conditions and
circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of meeting our financial and
operational objectives, to the benefit of customers and investors.

As we work towards delivering our 2020 EPS target, we remain focused on cost reduction opportunities
within our entire $5.5 billion cost structure, the core components of which are illustrated on Slide 15. For
well over a decade, we have managed to achieve planned and unplanned cost savings to mitigate entry
year risk and create long-term headroom in our electric and gas bills to support our substantial customer
investments at the utility.

As we look to 2020 and beyond, we continue to believe there are numerous cost reduction opportunities
throughout our cost structure. These opportunities include, but are not limited to: the expiration of high-
priced PPAS; the retirement of our coal fleet capital-enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas
distribution systems; and the continued maturation of our lean operating system, the CE Way.

These opportunities will provide sources of entry year risk mitigation as well as a sustainable funding
strategy for our long-term customer investment plan, which will keep customers' bills low on an absolute
basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan, as depicted in the chart on the right-hand side of
the page.

Moving on to weather-normalized sales. As we have discussed in the past, economic conditions in Michigan
remained positive, particularly in our electric service territory, which is anchored by Grand Rapids, one of
the fastest-growing cities in the country, as evidenced by the statistics on the upper left-hand corner of
Slide 16.

And when it comes to Michigan's economy, we are not passive participants. In fact, in addition to directly
investing billions of dollars throughout the state annually, we collaborate with key stakeholders across the
state to drive industrial activity through our economic development efforts. These efforts have attracted
nearly 300 megawatts of new electric load in our service territory since 2016. And in 2019 alone, the
contracts we signed will support over 3,600 jobs and bring in more than $1.5 billion of investment to
Michigan. A prosperous Michigan, supported by our economic development efforts, offers multiple benefits
to our business model. In the near term, it drives volumetric sales, which support our financial objectives.
And the longer term, it creates headroom in customer bills by reducing our rates.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

As mentioned in the past, we also continue to see the positive spillover effects of stead industrial activity
on our higher-margin residential and commercial segments over time in the form of steady customer
count growth and favorable load trends.

As you'll note in the charts on the right-hand side of the slide, we've seen average residential load growth
of 1% and 1.5% for the electric and gas businesses, respectively, over the past 5 years, when normalized
for weather and our energy efficiency programs.

To summarize our financial and customer affordability targets for 2020 and beyond, we expect another
solid year of 6% to 8% adjusted EPS growth, solid operating cash flow growth, exclusive of the
aforementioned discretionary pension contribution and customer prices at or below inflation.

From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit metrics. And as
you'll note, our equity needs are approximately $250 million in 2020, due to the previously noted deferral
of our equity issuance needs in 2019. We expect our equity needs to be roughly $150 million per year in
2021 and beyond, which can be completed through our ATM equity issuance program, which will likely file
along with our shelf during the first half of this year.

Our model has served our stakeholders well in the past as customers receive safe, reliable and clean
electric and gas at affordable prices, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial
performance.

On Slide 18, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions.
As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation, the probability of large
variances from our plan are minimized. There will always be sources of volatility in this business, be they
weather, fuel costs, regulatory outcomes or otherwise. And every year, we view it as our mandate to do
the waring for you and mitigate the risk accordingly.

And with that, I'll hand it back to Patti for her concluding remarks before Q&A.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Rejji. Our investment thesis is compelling and will serve our customers, our planet and our
investors for years to come.
And with that, Chad, would you please open the line for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

A couple of questions on the year. So did you -- Rejji, did you say that that small asset sale gain from
Enterprises was in the second quarter. Is that correct?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

That's right.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Can you just give us a little more description of what asset it was? And what you saw in the rationale
figure?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Oh, absolutely. So Enterprises specifically dig, had some transmission-related assets of the informal
parlances switchyard assets, which they sold to ITC Transmission in the second quarter. And so we booked
a gain of roughly $16 million or $0.04 in Q2. That was part of our plan throughout the year, which is why
you'll see sort of an aberrant trend between our '19 actuals and what we anticipate for 2020.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. I may be wrong, but I think you're breaking EnerBank out separately now for the first time.
I'm happy to get the incremental disclosure, but can you just give us the rationale for that? And then I
have one more question.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, happy to. So EnerBank this year, and they had a wonderful year, as Patti noted. They hit about $2.6
billion, a little over $2.6 billion in assets, which is in excess of 10% of our consolidated asset threshold.
And so we chose to report out the segment at this point.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great. My final question is, the decision to fund the pension, how much in sort of in dollars did you top
off the pension? And can we think about the financial benefit of that being sort of the delta between the
financing costs and the expected pension return?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So starting with your last question first. Yes, we did take into account, and you should assume that
the EPS-related pickup is net of the funding cost. And so we anticipate about $0.05 of earnings per share
upside attributable to that.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

The amount -- and you'll see this in the appendix, is a little over $530 million. And so that allowed us to
fully fund our in-active defined benefit plan.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And that was funded off from a parent infusion? Or from off of the actual operating company balance
sheet?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

The latter. So we did a term loan in the interim at consumers energy, and it's interesting. It's -- the
term loan funding of that was about $300 million. We actually had a little bit of excess cash flow that
we allowed -- that allowed us to put -- to fund it with a bit of excess cash, which also helped the EPS
accretion attributable to that.

Operator

The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So perhaps just kicking off first. As usual, we're focused on the CapEx and the upward trend. And I see
down on the upwards of $0.5 billion increase here as you roll forward. Can you talk a little bit about the
upside trajectory? I suppose, if you take that $0.5 billion in just kind of the latest single year in isolation
roll forward, and you continue to give that, you end up somewhat in excess of your kind of 10-year plan.
So obviously, you've talked about this a little bit. But perhaps this might be an opportunity to elaborate a
little bit?

And then I'll probably -- the second question at the same time. DPE had some pushback on their latest
process on procurement in their IRP. Any leads with respect to your ongoing efforts on the renewable side,
specifically? I just want to clarify that.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'll take the first part, and I'll let Rejji take the second part, Julien. The capital plan, the $25 billion
capital plan does have fluctuations year-to-year, some -- and you'll see we've got a 5-year look in the
appendix of the deck. So you can see the -- what the plan is by year. And we do have some opportunities
in that $25 billion. And we talked about that after the third quarter. There's certainly demand for additional
spend on electric reliability and grid modernization and our gas business. And as always, we're working to
balance the competing demands for capital internally, having our internal capital battles, if you will, but
also making sure that our bills remain affordable, making sure that the capacity to do the work is possible.
So that we have a good credibility with our regulators that we do what we said we're going to do. And so
the upside that you see in this first 5-year forward adding additional year is the natural fluctuation, but it
all supports the $25 billion plan. And that supports our 6% to 8% growth trajectory.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Julien, you also just asked about what could allow us to -- I think, if I heard you correctly, just dip
into those upside opportunities. And as Patti and I have talked about in the past, the constraints are
primarily customer affordability. And so that is the primary constraint on whether we'll be able to dip
into those upside opportunities of $3 billion to $4 billion in that 10-year plan as well as balance sheet
constraints and potentially workforce capacity. And so over time, as all of those potentially move favorably,
we'll consider recalibrating. But for now, that's where the plan sits.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Now getting to your second question related to, if I heard you correctly, again, the feed wasn't all that
good. But it sounded like a potential reaction to, I think, the ALJ's decision and DTEs integrated research
plan. Needless to say, we're not going to speak for DTE on their regulatory filings. But if you're asking
whether that has an impact on our IRP and the execution of our IRP? The answer to that is no. We
obviously just concluded the RFP? Well, first, we got approval for our IRP in mid last year, and we just
concluded in September or deep into Q4, the request for proposal for the first tranche of 300 megawatts
of solar. And this is part of a longer-term effort to really build out solar-generating assets to the tune of 6
gigawatts by 2040 in this first tranche of, call it, 1.1 gigawatts that were approved in the settlement. We
just did about 300 megawatts this year. We'll do another 300 megawatts in RFP in September this year
and the balance of 500 megawatts in 2021, half of which will be rate-base, half of which will be PPA. And
so we're in execution mode. And obviously, we'll look to file a new IRP in June of '21 for the settlement. So
we're -- that's where we stand on that.

Operator

The next question will be from Michael Weinstein with Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I just wanted to confirm that the extra $500 million of capital spending that's planned for the next 5 years,
is not part of the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities, right? Because the total 10-year plan
didn't really change that much.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

That's right, Michael. You've got that right. This is just the 1-year roll forward, so it shows the modification
in the plan.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. So this is a -- is it an acceleration of spending that you would have done in the second 5 years of
that 10-year plan, basically?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

No. It's right in line with our plan. It adds some additional, the IRP solar that was approved as well as
some additional electric reliability. And really the -- you can plan on fluctuation between the gas, the
electric, the renewable parts of the spend as the years go forward so that we can optimize that capital
spend to the benefit of customers. And again, mitigating the challenges that Rejji articulated around
affordability, balance sheet. We're always just working the plan to have the highest-value capital year after
year.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Right. And also, I wanted to confirm that there's no incremental equity need from any of that, either?
Obviously, it doesn't look like the plan changed at all in equity. And that this is it's all ATM and internal
programs, right? There's no block equity?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

That's correct.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Okay. And one thing I would -- maybe you could talk a little bit more about is, you discussed a little bit
about new -- and the attraction of new commercial and industrial customers in your territory. And can you
discuss the potential impacts on electric load and on your industrial customers as electric vehicles gain
traction across the supply chain for the auto industry?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. The -- I would say the industrial load that we're seeing being added, actually ends up being very
unrelated to automotive. Michigan is more and more diversified. We've had some big ag customer
additions and some pharma additions. And so I would say, if anything, we're seeing some diversification in
Michigan in our makeup of our industrial rate base.

But I would also say -- or our industrial customer base. But I would also offer on the EV front, that as the
Chair of the EEI, Electric Transportation, as the co-chair of that committee, I've had an opportunity to
really get exposed to some of the national fleet operators. We had Amazon, for example, at our National
EEI Meeting in January, talking about their ambitions to electrify their fleet. I see that as a big opportunity.

Load growth for electric per capita certainly has not had significant increases. In fact, it goes down in
many cases as equipment gets more efficient, lighting gets more efficient. And I see this fleet potential to
be actual load growth potential in the future as their ambitions materialize.

Now I will tell you, it's not going to sneak up on us. Because with their -- first of all, they need to have
electric transportation at the fleet scale available, the actual vehicles, the trucks, et cetera. And that
development cycle is not fast. But then we'll be working with them to site their charging stations and
make sure we maximize the benefit to the grid and minimize the addition to peak demand. So I think it's a
great opportunity, frankly, for the industry, and Michigan will certainly be participants in that.

The next question will be from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.

Praful Mehta
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Congrats on a good quarter.

Thanks, Praful.

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Praful.

Praful Mehta
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

So maybe, first, a more big-picture step-back question. Utilities clearly have been doing well in the current
stock price environment and CMS clearly doing well, too, given the execution. Do you think there is
any use of that currency from your perspective, M&A or otherwise, that you think you can look at? Or
execution is primarily the focus at this point?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Praful, our position on M&A versus organic growth has been consistent for some time, and we are
fully focused on executing on our capital plan. We've got enough to do within our walls. And as I've said in

the past, we're planning 1x book to fund those capital investments. I'd rather do that than pay a premium
for somebody else's CapEx backlog. So we are acutely focused on executing on our plan.

Praful Mehta
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Fair enough. Makes sense. Then just quickly on the operating cash flow. When you're looking at the slide
17 and you say, up 100 from the 2020's $1.7 billion, just can you walk through that? What's the increase
that you're kind of seeing in the long-term plan?

And I guess connected to that, I also saw increased NOL utilization on Slide 23. So I just try to understand
a little bit of the drivers around the operating cash flow?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Praful, as you may recall, prior to the enactment of tax reform at the end of 2017, we were on this
very healthy trajectory of about $100 million of year-over-year or at least year versus prior year budget,
OCF accretion per year. And it has to do with just the very nice fundamentals of this business. I mean,
we're investing capital, growing rate base, getting solid customer receipts. And I'll give full credit to our
folks who manage working capital very well on our team as well. And so it's just a nice healthy byproduct
of all of that good work there. And so the only reason we paused slightly was just due to tax reform and
the cash flow degradation effects of that.

So we basically took a 2-year pause on that level of growth. And so we guided in 2018 at $1.65 billion.
We managed to exceed that. And again, we guided in 2019 of $1.65 billion, and managed to exceed
that again. And so now we feel like, again, relative to what we budgeted, the prior year, we'll be back on
that sort of $100 million per year increase, starting this year in 2020. And so that's what we have in the
forecast. And we feel very good about that, particularly given the magnitude of the capital investment
plan, our ability to manage our costs. And again, just execute well on the working capital front. And so we
feel like we have a very nice glide path to continue on that trajectory.

Now as it pertains to NOLs and credits, we obviously had a significant remeasurement going back to tax
reform on our NOLs. We still think we've got a little bit of utilization left of what's remaining. But then
also, we still have quite a few business credits that we've accumulated over time. And we expect modest
accretion of that, just given some of our efforts on the renewable side. And so that's where you see still
a decent amount of, I'll say, a combination of NOLs and tax credits. And so at this point, we don't expect
to be a federal taxpayer until, call it, 2024. There's a modest amount that we'll pay in 2023 based on our
forecast, but really not a partial taxpayer until 2024.

Is that helpful?

Praful Mehta
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Yes. That's super helpful. And then just finally, in terms of storm impacts and storm costs. Is there any --
in the current rate case filing, is there any plan to change what gets recovered? Or what is allowed to be
recovered in terms of storm cost?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. In our next electric grid case, certainly, we want to reflect the average service restoration expenses.
And what we've been recovering in rates is less than what we've actually experienced on the last 5-year
average. And so we want that to be reflected. But we also want and believe that with the age of the
system that our increased spend in both the fundamental reliability of the system, we've been increasing,
both the actual spend as well as the requested spend. We think there's a lot of justification for that to
keep up with the age of the system. And so we'll continue to ramp the reliability spend. But we also want
accurate reflection of the operating expense associated with service restoration. While, frankly, at the
same time, we're working to reduce the cost of every interruption by making our processes more efficient,

And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just on -- just a couple of questions. On your annual CapEx guide in your disclosures, that's closer to
the back of the slide deck, there's some -- obviously some shuffling of spend between 2020 and 2021.
Can you just remind us what actually drove this? And can you maybe talk a little bit more about the new
CapEx you're introducing towards the back end? More -- really more specifically on the mix between gas
and electric?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Shar. Happy to take that. So a little bit of the shift that you probably have noticed between
what's we're expecting or what we were expecting in 2020 in our prior 5-year plan that we rolled out in Q1
of last year and sort of this 5-year plan, it has everything to do with just the timing of the rate case in the
4 test years. And so this current vintage, now that we're a year smarter, reflects the magnitude of spend
we expect in 2021, and that aligns nicely with the gas case that's pending, that we filed in December of
last year. And with the electric case we'll likely file in Q1 of this year. And so that's really why you see that
shifting between '20 and '21.

And what we've always said, and this remains true to form is that, the absolute amount or the quantum
of capital we anticipate spending on a 5-year period, 1-year period, is always pretty consistent. But the
composition does change over time. And sometimes you get shifts in two years. And so that's effectively
what you're seeing.

And then for the outer years, I think Patti did a nice job summarizing this, is just, we're just basically
losing 2019 from the prior vintage enrolling in another year. So going from a '19 to '23 plan to a '20 to
'24 plan. And as part of that roll forward, you're seeing an expansion, more of the solar generation will do
attributable to the IRPs or taking on that sort of final tranche of, call it, 250 megawatts that will rate-base.
And then you couple that with additional spend in both our electric distribution reliability-related capital
investments as well as gas infrastructure spend. And so those are kind of the pieces you're seeing in the
back end of that 5-year period.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it, got it. And then, sorry -- and then Patti, just started to be a dead horse on this, but I just have a
follow-up on that incremental capital opportunities you guys have been highlighting. It seems like you're
managing O&M well. You have bill headroom that continues to improve. The economic backdrop remains

14

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

strong in your service stories, you kind of highlight. You do have sort of balance sheet capacity. So I'm
kind of curious, as what are the drivers that we are missing as far as as you look to pull forward some of
that spend? Is there anything else outside of just managing towards that 7% growth target that midpoint?
Is it a function of trying to find the optimal capital projects internally? So what's sort of the offset skills
drivers? Because it seems like the drivers seem to fit towards you accelerating spend versus not.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. One thing I'll tell you about our 10-year capital plan, I think some people might argue that it's
impossible to have a 10-year capital plan because conditions change so much or you don't know enough
about the future. I can tell you, our 10-year capital plan has a significant amount of meat on the bonds.
And what we intend to do is make sure that we are able to execute the work that we have committed to.

And so I'll tell you, the ramp-up of capital requires a significant operational and ability to execute and
prepare the workforce. And when we hear nationally about constraints on ability to attract talent and to
build out a workforce. We have to attract the workforce to deliver all that work. And so -- that -- we want
to make sure is well-timed and well planned, so that we do precisely what we said we're going to do.

And it's also important that from an affordability standpoint, that our customers are able to pay and would
value for -- value the investments that we'll be making on their behalf. So really, customer affordability
continues to be front of mind. And as an operator myself, I want to make sure my team is ready and
prepared to execute the work that we commit to. It's easy to write a number in a spreadsheet, it's another
thing to go dig the trench and lay the wire and roll the trucks. So we've got to make sure that we're ready
all the way around.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. So the human capital aspect, it's a bit of a concern.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

You bet.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Our next question will be from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.

Jonathan P. Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

So I was going to ask you about the shift in the CapEx from '20 to '21, and I think you've addressed that.
So thank you for that. Just one other issue. Now you're giving this breakout of Enterprises and a bank and
the parent's, which it sounds like you'll continue to do that going forward, given the size. But should we

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

think, Rejji, about the parent roughly consistent going forward with this number you're showing for 2020?
Or is that going to move around out in the 5-year plan?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Well, it should increase over time, Jonathan. Because keep in mind, that's largely, at this point, interest
expense at the parent, and we have $12.2 billion of capital investments that we're going to be funding
over this period. And so obviously, we do the best we can in terms of getting low interest rates realized in
our debt financings. But we just assume what the new money we'll be raising that, that interest expense
should come up over time or increase over time. And so we do expect that segment to increase. Every
now and then, we overachieve, of course. [indiscernible] and his team have been very good at getting
financings at lower rates than anticipated. But conservatively, we'll assume that, that segment does
increase.

Jonathan P. Arnold
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. So you can just basically financing of a portion of the underlying growth. I think that said, I really
wanted to ask on the CapEx.

Operator

And the next question will be from Ali Agha with STRH.

Ali Agha
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

First question, Rejji or Patti. Can you just remind us again, as you're looking at the sales data, roughly
how much on an annual basis, does energy efficiency sort of take away from the sales numbers?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So -- and this is -- it has been basically come out of the new -- well, I can't call it new so much
anymore, but the 2016 Energy Law, Ali. And so we have a 1.5% year-over-year reduction target that
we get economic incentives on. And so you take the prior year's load and then you reduce that by 1.5%,
and we do that through all of the nice programs we have and rebates on LED lightbulbs and things of
that nature. And so that's where, historically, we've been for the last few years. Our current 5-year plan,
and we've been very public about this is part of our RFP, was to expand those energy waste reduction
programs. And so we're on a glide path to get to a 2% year-over-year reduction. And so that will be about
2% of our prior year's load. And so I just want to reemphasize that we do get economic incentives on
those programs. And so historically, that's been a run rate of, call it, $34 million pretax, combined electric
and gas. And so as we glide path to that 2%, that amount of pretax income will crest at about $47 million
towards the latter years of this plan. And we anticipate about $41 million in 2020 alone as we glide path
up. And so we anticipate, again, 1.5% to 2% reduction in load as part of that. And remember, it also gets
trued up in rates as we file new cases. And so that is also something worth noting.

Ali Agha
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And so just to be clear, if I look at the numbers for calendar '19, as reported, weather-normalized
was negative 1.4%. If we adjust that for LED efficiency, then it should be relatively flat. And I know you're
sort of on an apples-to-apples basis, looking at that being up 1%, I believe, in '20 and perhaps beyond
that. So can you just talk a little bit more about that dynamic you had load growth going up to 1% and
beyond?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Happy to. And we actually tried to get in front of that question because it comes up quite a bit, by offering
this new Slide 16 in the presentation. But you're thinking about it, Ali, the right way. And so if you look
at that sort of blended weather-normalized electric load for 2019 versus 2018, 1.4% down, think of that
as flat. I'll also note, what's embedded in that 1.4% is a reduction in volume from a very large, low-
margin customer. And so when you back out the effects of the large low-margin customer, our weather-
normalized sales goes from 1.4% down to about 0.5% down. And then if you take out the effects of
energy efficiency, well, now you're up 1%. And you can look across all of our channels for electric and
see that trend, which we think is not the right way to think about it. So residential flat. So again, you
normalize for energy efficiency, you're up 1.5%. Commercial, down 1.1%, you normalize, you're up 0.5%.
And we have seen those organic trends in our customer counts, just to make sure that we're not being too
scientific here. And so we feel quite good about that, and think there is a very healthy economic growth
in our service territory, and particularly with the high-margin part of our supply chain -- or sorry, our
customer segments.

Ali Agha
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Got you. And one last question. I know, as you mentioned that the 2016 Energy Law is fully implemented,
et cetera. Anything of note in this year's legislative session for us to keep an eye on that may be relevant
to you folks or something that you guys are keeping an eye on as well?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

No, Ali. I would suggest, particularly here in Michigan, the -- there's nothing really being driven by the
elections this fall, certainly, the presidential election is going to be a big distraction. We do have our
whole house -- state house, of course, has 2-year terms and our congressional districts have 2-year
terms. And so there's reelections. Our governor did her say at the state last night and she doubled down
on her commitment to fix the dam roads here in Michigan. That's our slogan, not mine. And so we're
happy to support the investment and infrastructure. And frankly, as we do more road repairs, it's a great
opportunity for us to collaborate with our Department of Transportation and our construction work here in
Michigan to do our investment and infrastructure at a lower cost for all citizens.

So I would say nothing though new from a legislative agenda here in Michigan.

Operator

Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

On the gas case, I was wondering if you could lay out some of the -- hate to use the word contentious,
but some of the more debatable issues that you see coming up there. And in particular, the ROE and the
decision to go with the higher request?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, a couple of things, Travis. First of all, as I mentioned, we have this 10-year gas -- natural
gas delivery plan that we filed with our case. And that plan has been well vetted with -- and actually
collaborated with our staff at the commission and its development in aligning on our priorities. One thing I
can firmly applaud our commission for their commitment to being able to see long-term plans, so they can
make better decisions in a 1-year case.

And so this 10-year gas plan we filed has a lot of meat on the bones, and I feel very good about it. You
can look at our last case and see the -- over 90% approval of the capital that we requested is a good
indicator that, that work that we have committed to doing is the work that the commission would want us
to do as well. So we feel good about that.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Now on the ROE. Of course, we feel justified in 10.5% ROE ask. And so we always make sure that we have
adequate justification for that. It yields about a $25 million impact. If you take the [ 10.5% to 9.9% ].
And so we recognize that the commission has a job to do. They've made it clear that they recognize that a
healthy ROE is important to the utility, low-cost of capital is important for the benefit of customers and the
utility. And so we look forward to seeing what the final outcome of that rate case will be. But what's more
important, I think, is we really take an eye on it, is the volume of capital and the alignment with the staff
and the commission and the work that we're doing.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. You anticipated my question on the ROE, so I won't ask that delta number. But broadly on
the Enterprise and EnerBank and -- especially Enterprise, what's your 3-year strategy? Any updates to
that here in the last quarter or 2?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the plant at Enterprises has been pretty straightforward for some time. And so obviously, a
dig drives the vast majority of the financial performance of Enterprise's. And we really have tried to
derisk that business and its future earnings potential quite a bit through the energy contracts that
we amended and extended about a year or so ago. And then we've also locked in a good deal of our
capacity, open margin over the next few years as well. And so we feel like there should be pretty steady,
predictable performance at enterprises. I'll also note, we've done a few of these contract of renewable
opportunities, over the last sort of 1.5 years. And so we will look to be opportunistic, if those -- if we find
nice opportunities with third parties, where we can get attractive returns, creditworthy counterparties and
basically have to describe very little terminal value to projects like that. And so we'll look to do those from
time to time. But again, we expect the 3-year forward look to be pretty straightforward.

Travis Miller
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And any of those contracted renewables in the CapEx plan right now?

The next question is from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

In fact, I've got one near-term and one long term. First, in the near term, if you could elaborate, Rejji, you
gave a lot of good color on the demand trends by class. Are you able to estimate, like how much of the
impact, particularly industrial is related to tariffs and trade wars? And then what are your assumptions for
load growth embedded in the 2020 guidance?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So we have, I'll say, for 2020 guidance, we are fairly conservative in our position both in 2020 and
also over the course of the 5-year plan. And so for electric. And again, if you got to keep it -- take into
account that we have the energy efficiency programs embedded in that. We're assuming about, call it, flat
to slightly declining for electric. And so that is our working assumption for a really 2020 and beyond.

And I'd say gas, flat to maybe slightly up based, from trends we're seeing there. And so that's our current
position. In terms of industrial activity, clearly, we've talked in the past about the diversified nature of

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

18

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

our industrial customers in our electric service territory. And I'll just remind that folks at about 2% of
our gross margin equivalent comes from the auto sector. And so yes, of course, we do have exposure to
companies that may have some level of exposure to export/import markets, the trade war, whatever you
want to call it. But at the end of the day, a lot of the margin we generate comes from our residential and
commercial customers, and we continue to see very nice trends there.

And so the industrial activity, we're obviously very supportive of it through our academic development
efforts. We do think it's important to Michigan, and our efforts on the residential and commercial side. But
really, the vast majority of our sales were driven by residential and commercial, at least the margin there,
and we've seen good trends.

The only other data point I'll leave you with is that 1% change in our industrial estimated growth probably
drives about $0.05 of EPS. And so there really isn't a significant impact when you see variation in the
industrial class because it's much lower margin.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Right. Makes sense. Okay. Good. Next longer-term question. You continue to point to the midpoint of
the 6% to 8% range. And obviously, you've been delivering 7%, so that's probably not a surprise. My
question is, you show rate base growth of 7%, excluding the upside opportunities on CapEx. You have
some incremental EPS growth from things like the energy efficiency and demand response incentives as
well as EnerBank growth. My question is, what would prevent you from hitting the high end of the range
going forward? Is that equity dilution or any other factors?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Well, I'd say, number one, we're always balancing the ability for our customers to afford the product so
that we have a sustainable plan. And I'll also offer -- and you can see from our track record on years when
there has been some favorability. On the year when we could have delivered more than the midpoint.
We reinvested in the business. And so one of the key components of our success here is our consistent
performance that you actually can set your watch to that you can rest at night. That's our goal.

And so the idea that we would start to fluctuate in pursuit of a higher target. Really is not consistent with
our commitment to delivering as you would expect, year after year after year. And actually -- so even at
this stage of the year, we're thinking 2 years out, not just next year. And so we're always looking for ways
to pull ahead expenses, reinvest favorability for the benefit of the consistency in the long run.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Sounds good. I'll speak in the last one. Patti, no story of the month? Any quick one you can throw at us?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Let's see. Yes, there's many of them. Here's one. Let me -- just off the top of my head. We had a team
at one of our service centers, really looking at their meter management process. And when we went out
to talk to them, Garrick Rochow, our Head of Operations, observed that this team has had this problem
of meter inventory and how they were managing that inventory. And because they have these teams
called fix it now teams, which are empowered work teams right on the ground level, focused on driving
the business. They had identified this issue with their inventories of meters and identified a $2 million
savings specifically the benefits -- that can be actually parley to other service centers to change their work
process. This CE Way is becoming embedded in our organization and the ability to teach our coworkers
to see and eliminate waste and improve their process. It reduces what we call their own human struggle
when our coworkers see human struggle that they can reduce. It often parlays into dollars, makes their
job easier to do, makes them more committed to the ownership of the company. And it's another good
example of our real savings that get driven by real people who do the real work, and I could not be more

Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.

Gregg Gillander Orrill
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

With the renewable's CapEx that you've outlined on Slide 22. Can you maybe comment on how that
contributes to rate-base growth? Or is a portion of overall rate based in the plan?

Rejji P. Hayes
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Greg, what that's comprised of, it's the combination of renewable spend. And certainly, in the
near-term portion of this 5-year plan to get to the RPS -- or sorry, renewable portfolio standard of 15%
by 2021 as per the Energy Law. So that's the components you'll see in sort of the 2020, 2021 time frame.
And we have good projects in the pipeline that we think will allow us to get there.

And then the latter portion, as we've talked about in the past, is part of the IRP-related renewable spend.
And so again, as we start to execute on this 1.1 gigawatt tranche, half of which will be owned, half of
which will be PPA-ed or contracted, that's what's making up the balance of that.

In terms of the rate-base component, we have of the $1.8 billion of capital, we plan to spend in aggregate
over the 5-year period. It probably drives about -- or probably represents about 6% of rate base, or
thereabouts. So not all that significant at this moment. But over time, we will expect that to grow. So --
but the vast majority of the spend, as we've talked about in the past, is wires and pipes. We think that's
where -- if you really want to get the biggest bang for the buck, it's really in the investment in the safety
and reliability of our system, both in gas infrastructure and electric infrastructure. And so that's where you
see the vast majority of the rate-base spend and the rate-base growth accordingly.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION FY 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

So -- and I apologize, if this has already been asked. But with the natural gas distribution plan filed, given
such a long-term look, effectively by program, when would you expect really, if at all, to file for another
IRM or another multiyear mechanism? I mean, just given the detail by category in this filing, along with
the IRP and the EDIIP. It certainly seems like you are potentially positioning consumers to work with the
commission toward a mechanism of some kind in the 2020s.

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

I would offer this, David. I have mixed feelings about the -- or long-term plans. Because the reality is,
the system is dynamic, the demands are dynamic. One of the great strengths of our plan, as I highlighted
in my prepared remarks, is that we've got a lot of flexibility. This large percent of our spend, under $200
million, the ability to file every year, simple concrete filings that are part of a long-term plan, allow us to
adjust when conditions change. And there's no big-bet strategy that we have employed for over a decade
now, has served us well in our ability to be flexible. And so when you lock in a 3-year filing on a system
like the gas system where you can have dynamism, maybe you've got new regulations, maybe there's
an incident somewhere else in the country that reprioritizes our system and our investment strategy. I
personally like the flexibility of an annual filing that allows us to go ahead and adjust as necessary.

Now the simplicity of a filing if you've got multiyear plans, certainly can be appealing. And if our
commission was leaning that way, and they really preferred that, then, of course, we would work with
them on that. But I think the idea that we're dynamic, and so is our plan, has more relevance to our
ability to deliver consistently.

David Neil Fishman
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. And then the other item, just on the filing, I thought you guys did a good job
of breaking out your expectation for kind of cost reductions, starting in 2021, kind of through the 2020s.
We've heard a lot about on the electric side, the potential fuel cost savings in O&M, but I was wondering
if you could kind of elaborate a little bit following kind of the extensive review? What kind of buckets or
drivers and trajectory you're seeing at the natural gas side and the 2020?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say the natural gas side, it's all about the efficiency of getting the work done. And with every
dollar of capital, there's still associated O&M that comes with that. So when we can make our capital more
efficient, we can make our O&M more efficient. So we continue to work on our unit cost, on driving our
unit cost, on reducing waste from our -- the ability to execute work. Our leak backlog and leak response
is a large O&M expense, and so when we make the capital investments that reduce vintage services and
service lines and vintage mains, for example, we're able to reduce operating costs. And we just completed
also a large capital project on our automated meter reading for our gas meters.

The next question will come from Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint.

Andrew Levi

Just on EnerBank, obviously, Rejji, we've discussed kind of the company before. Just what are your
thoughts as far as the pros of keeping at -- first the pros of potentially not keeping it?

Patricia Kessler Poppe
President, CEO & Director

Andrew, EnerBank is really a value part of the CMS family. They had a great year. And that's really what
we think about EnerBank. They were a great contribution here last year and in many years in the past.
