KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn
the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.

Richard D. Kinder
Executive Chairman of the Board

Thank you, Michelle. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you, as we always do, that KMI's earnings release
today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial
measures. Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures
on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our
earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions,
expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and
described in such forward-looking statements.

Now every quarter, I open this call by talking about our financial philosophy at Kinder Morgan. I always
mention strong and consistent cash flow and explain how we use that cash flow to pay a healthy and
growing dividend, internally fund our expansion CapEx needs, keep our balance sheet strong and
opportunistically buy back our shares I believe our shareholders understand and appreciate the strength of
our cash flow even if there are varied positions on what we should do with it.

But in a broader sense, if we examine what owning a share of KMI really amounts to, I've come to believe,
as the largest shareholder, that we are receiving a very good and growing yield on our investment, while
at the same time, getting an amazing optionality on future developments. Let me explain that optionality.

We have entered the energy transition field with what I consider to be solid investments that Steve and
the team will discuss further, and our cash flow gives us the ability to pursue those opportunities in size
if and only if the investments achieve a satisfactory return. And I believe that if we so desire, we will be
able to attract new partners at a time of our choosing, whether public or private, to participate in those
opportunities with us on terms favorable to KMI.

I also firmly believe that there is still a long runway for fossil fuels around the world, particularly for
natural gas. If you read carefully the latest studies from the IEA, OPEC and from various other energy
experts, you will see projections that fossil fuels will continue to supply the majority of our energy needs
for at least the next quarter century, and that natural gas will be at the forefront of fulfilling those needs.

If these projections are anywhere close to accurate, a company like Kinder Morgan with significant free
cash flow will find significant opportunities to invest in this core business where we have substantial
expertise and a huge network that can be expanded and extended. So this is another option that you
receive as a KMI shareholder.

I would add that the events of this fall throughout Europe, Asia and North America demonstrate that
the transition to renewables is going to be a lot longer and more difficult than many of its proponents
originally thought. In short, while the world makes the transition, the lights need to stay on, homes need
to be heated, and our industrial production needs to be sustained.

Finally, we always have the option of returning dollars to our shareholders through selective stock
repurchases, in addition to the healthy return we are providing through our dividend. This is why I say
that an investment in KMI provides you with a nice locked-in return with this dividend and then provides
really good optionality for the future.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

CEO & Director

All right. Thanks, Rich. I'll give you an overview of our business and the current environment for our
sector as we see it. Then our President, giving will cover the outlook and segment updates. Our CFO,
David Michels, will take you through the financials, and then we'll take your questions.

Our financial principles remain the same. First, maintaining a strong balance sheet. A strong balance sheet
helps us withstand setbacks and enables us to take advantage of opportunities. Over the last 2 years,
we've seen both sides of that coin. Coming into 2020, we were better than our leverage target, and that
helped us when we were hit with the pandemic-related downturn.

Then this year, we saw the other side where our extra capacity, created as a result of our outperformance
in the first quarter, gave us the ability to take advantage of 2 acquisition opportunities. We see both of
those acquisitions as adding value to the firm.

Second, we are maintaining our capital discipline through our elevated return criteria, a good track record
of execution, and by self-funding our investments.

We are also maintaining our cost discipline. We have always been lean, but last year at this time, we were
completing an evaluation of how we were organized and how we could work even more efficiently. We
implemented changes resulting in an estimated full year run rate efficiencies of about $100 million a year.
In that effort, we were aiming for something beyond efficiency, greater effectiveness. And we can see that
coming through in the functions we centralized under the leadership of our Chief Operating Officer, James
Holland. We are already seeing the benefits in project management and other functions.

Finally, we are returning value to shareholders with the year-over-year dividend increase to $1.08
annualized, providing an increased but well-covered dividend, strong balance sheet, capital and cost
discipline, returning value to shareholders. Those are the principles we operate by, and we have done so
regardless of what is in fashion at the moment.

We have accomplished some important work so far in 2021, which I believe will lead to long-term
distinction. First, we're having a record year financially, attributable to our outperformance in the first
quarter. We've continued to execute well on our projects with our 2 interstate gas group projects coming
in ahead of schedule, as noted in the press release. And we have continued to find new opportunities with
a small net increase in our backlog this quarter.

Second, we completed the 2 important acquisitions, the larger one, Stagecoach, showing our confidence
in the long-term value of our natural gas business and taking our total operated storage capacity to
700 Bcf. We believe in the long-term value of flexibility and deliverability in the gas business. That was
demonstrated last winter, and we are seeing it with the recent tightening in the natural gas markets here
and abroad and in our rates on storage renewals.

Third, we've continued to advance the ball on the ongoing evolution in energy markets and in our ESG
performance. As things stand today, 69% of our backlog is in support of low-carbon infrastructure. That
includes natural gas, of course, but it also includes $250 million of organic projects supporting renewable
diesel in our products and terminals business units and our renewable natural gas projects.

Repurposing and building assets at our current terminal locations to support the energy sources of the
future. Importantly, too, that 69% is projected to come in at a weighted average 3.6x EBITDA multiple of
the expansion capital spend. So we're getting attractive returns on these investments.

Further, our DAS team has now concluded 3 responsibly sourced gas transactions. Those are low
emissions along the chain from the producer through our transmission and storage business. We'll soon
be publishing our ESG report, including both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, we have incorporated ESG
reporting and risk management into our existing management processes, and the report will explain how.

In the meantime, Sustainalytics has us ranked #1 in our sector for how we manage ESG risk, and 2 other
rating services have us in the top 10. This is increasingly a point of distinction with our investors, our
regulators and our customers.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

With all of this, our projects, these commercial transactions and our ESG reporting and risk management,
we continue to advance the ball on ESG and the evolution in energy markets without sacrificing returns.
We continue to focus on the G governance in ESG as well. These things are all important to our long-term
success, and we have advanced it all significantly on all 3 in 2021.

We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low-cost operations that are safe
and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. As always, we will
evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.

Kimberly Allen Dang
President & Director

Okay. Thanks, Steve. And so I'm going to start with the natural gas business unit for the quarter.

Transport volumes were up about 3% or approximately 1.1 million dekatherms per day versus the third
quarter of '20. And that was driven primarily by increased LNG deliveries and the PHP in service. And then
some -- those increases were somewhat offset by declines on our West pipes due to the declining Rockies
production, pipeline outages and contract expirations.

Physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipeline averaged 5.1 million dekatherms per day. That's a
3.3 million dekatherm per day increase versus the third quarter of '20 when there were a lot of canceled
cargoes. Our market share of deliveries to LNG facilities is approximately 50%.

Exports to Mexico were down in the quarter when compared to the second quarter of '20 as a result of a
new third-party pipeline capacity added during the quarter. Overall, deliveries to power plants were down,
as you might expect with the higher natural gas prices.

Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 4% in the quarter compared to the third quarter
of '20. But for gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So
compared to the second quarter of this year, volumes were up 5%, with nice increases in the Eagle Ford
and the Haynesville volumes, which were up 12% and 8%, respectively.

In our products pipeline segment, refined product volumes were up 12% for the quarter versus the third
quarter of 2020. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels, which we used the third quarter of 2019 as a
reference point, road fuels were down about 3% and jet fuel was down about 21%. You might remember
that in the second quarter, road fuels were basically flat versus the pre-pandemic number. So we did see
some impact of the Delta variant during the quarter.

Crude and condensate volumes were down about 7% in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2020. And
sequentially, they were down about 4%.

In our terminals business segment, our liquids utilization percentage remains high at 94%. If you exclude
tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is approximately 97%.

Our rack business, which serves consumer domestic demand, are up nicely versus the third quarter of
'20, but they're down about 5% versus pre-pandemic levels. Now if you exclude some lost business and
a rack closure, so trying to get volumes on an apples-to-apples basis, volumes on our rack terminals
slightly exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Our hub facilities in Houston and New York, which are more driven
by refinery runs, international trade and blending dynamics, have shown less recovery than our rack
terminals versus the pre-pandemic levels.

In our marine tanker business, we continue to experience weakness. However, we've recently seen
increased customer interest. On the bulk side, volumes were up 19%, so very nicely, driven by coal,
steel and petcoke. Bulk volumes overall are still down about 3% versus 2019 on an apples-to-apples
comparison. But if you just look at coal, steel and petcoke on a combined basis, they're essentially flat to
pre-pandemic levels.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

In our CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 6%. CO2 volumes were down about 5%. But NGL
volumes were up 7%.

On price, we didn't see a benefit from the increase in crude price due to the hedges we've put in place in
prior periods when crude prices were lower. We do, however, expect to benefit from higher crude prices
in future periods on our unhedged barrels and as we layer on additional hedges in the current price
environment.

We did see NGL price benefit in the quarter as we tend to hedge less of these volumes. Compared to our
budget, we're currently anticipating that both oil volumes and CO2 volumes will exceed budget as well as
oil, NGL and CO2 prices. Better oil production is primarily driven by reduced decline in the base production
and better project performance at SACROC.

So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas transport volumes primarily from LNG exports. Seeing
increased gas gathering volumes in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville on a sequential basis. Product
volumes are recovering versus 2020. However, road fuels were down about 3% versus pre-pandemic
levels versus flat with pre-pandemic levels last quarter as we likely saw an impact from the Delta variant.
Versus our budget CO2, crude oil production is outperforming and we're getting some nice help on price.

We're still experiencing weakness in our Jones Act tankers and the Bakken has been a little slower than
we anticipated in bringing on new wells. But our producer customers have indicated that they'll continue
bringing on new production with some wells being pushed into 2020.

With that, I'll turn it over to David.

David Patrick Michels
VP & CFO

Okay. Thanks, Kim. So for the third quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which
is $1.08 annualized and 3% up from the third quarter of last year. This quarter, we generated revenues of
$3.8 billion, up $905 million from the third quarter of 2020. We had an associated increase in cost of sales
with an increase there of $904 million, both of those increases driven by higher commodity prices versus
last year. Our net income for the quarter was $495 million, up 9% from the third quarter of '20. And our
adjusted earnings per share was $0.22, up $0.01 from last year.

Moving on to our segment and distributable cash flow performance. Our natural gas segment was up $8
million for the quarter. Incremental contributions from Stagecoach and PHP were partially offset by lower
contributions from FEP where we've had contract expirations and lower usage and parking loan activity on
our EPNG system.

The product segment was up $11 million, driven by continued refined product volume recovery, partially
offset by some lower crude volumes in the Bakken. Terminal segment was down $13 million, driven by
weakness in our Jones Act tanker business, partially offset by the continued refined product recovery
volume -- or excuse me, volume recovery we've seen there.

Our G&A and corporate charges were higher by $28 million due to lower capital spend, resulting in less
capitalized G&A this quarter versus a year ago, as well as cost savings we experienced in 2020 as a
result of the pandemic. Those are partially offset by cost savings we experienced this year due to our
organizational efficiency efforts, as well as lower noncash pension expenses this year versus last.

Our JV DD&A was lower by $30 million, primarily due to lower contributions from Ruby Pipeline. Interest
expense was favorable $15 million, driven mostly by lower debt balance this year versus last. Our cash
taxes were favorable $37 million, and that was due -- mostly due to 2020 payments of taxes that were
deferred into -- in the second quarter into the third quarter. For the full year, cash taxes are expected to
be just slightly unfavorable to 2020 and slightly favorable to our budget.

Sustaining capital was unfavorable this quarter, $64 million, driven by spending in our natural gas
segment. And that's only slightly more than we budgeted for the quarter, though for the full year, we

7

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

expect to be about $65 million higher than in budget with most of that variance coming in the fourth
quarter.

Total DCF of $1.013 billion or $0.44 per share is down $0.04 from last year. Our full year guidance is
consistent with what we provided last quarter, with DCF at $5.4 billion and EBITDA at $7.9 billion.

Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter at 4.0x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and we
expect to end the year at 4.0x as well. This level benefits from the largely nonrecurring EBITDA generated
during the first quarter during the winter storm Yuri event. And our long-term leverage target of around
4.5x has not changed.

Our net debt ended the quarter at $31.6 billion, down $424 million from year-end and up $1.423
billion from the end of the second quarter. To reconcile that change in net debt for the quarter, we
generated $1.013 billion of Bcf. We paid out dividends of $600 million. We closed the Stagecoach and
Kinetrex acquisitions which collectively were $1.5 billion. We spent $150 million on growth CapEx and JV
contributions. And we had a working capital use of $175 million, mostly interest expense payments in the
quarter. And that explains the majority of the change for the quarter.
For the change from year-end, we've generated $4.367 billion of DCF. We paid out $1.8 billion of
dividends. We spent $450 million in growth CapEx and JV contributions. We had the $1.5 billion
Stagecoach and Kinetrex acquisitions. We have $413 million come in on the NGPL sale. And we've had a
working capital use of $600 million, mostly interest expense payments. And that explains the majority of
the change year-to-date. And that completes the financial review. So back to you, Steve.

Question and Answer

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Okay. We'll open it up for questions now. [Operator Instructions] Michelle.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Shneur Gershuni from UBS.

Shneur Z. Gershuni
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe to start off a little bit here. You've been very active the last few quarters on the acquisition and
capital front with respect to RNG [ renewals ] and so forth, sort of expanding on your energy transition
plan. You've added to the backlog and so forth.

But like there have been fewer updates on the carbon capture side. A lot of companies and peers that
made some major announcements recently to have models on carbon capture and sequestration. Is
Kinder planning to pursue carbon capture as aggressively as these announcements that we've seen. Just
wondering if you can sort of give us an update on kind of the strategy you're approaching. You talked
about some commercial arrangements last time. Just some broader thoughts if you may.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Sure. Yes, we are involved in and pursuing carbon capture opportunities. I won't express those in terms
of comparisons to others and the announcements they've made. I want to be really clear about this. We
view this as an attractive opportunity, but it will take some time to develop. And I think that's important to
understand.

The 45Q tax credits, as they were finalized at the beginning of this year, do make economic certain
investments primarily related to capturing the flu stream off of ethanol facilities and gas processing
facilities and primarily those in West Texas, which are adjacent to our existing CO2 infrastructure.

So there are some things to work through here, and let me give you a few examples. One is you have to
get the underground injection permits. That's a long drawn-out process today that should get shortened
up in Texas, in particular. In the legislature last time, they gave the Railroad Commission primacy on that.
They have to go apply for that at EPA. But that will shorten up the process from a 5- or 6-year process to
something much more brisk, I would think.

And then the other thing to think about is just the pipe itself. So the pipe, it's more -- much more efficient,
far more efficient to move CO2 in liquid form. That requires high-pressure, special purpose pipe, which we
have. 2,000 PSI through the pipe. That's not something that you can achieve with a repurposed oil or gas
pipe.

Now we've looked at this, and we think it is -- and for certain applications, particularly smaller volumes,
shorter distances, there are potentially some repurpose opportunities. I think the breakeven cutoff there
is like 350 a day or less in order to make that more attractive. But otherwise, you need some specialized
facilities to move it efficiently and to inject it into the ground. And so we think we've got an advantage
in that. We got to get the permitting shortened up and we got to get customers who are nearby our
infrastructure in the boat if you will. But it's not a tomorrow thing. It's probably not a next year thing. It's
something that's going to take a little bit of time to develop, but we are in active conversations.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Great. No, I appreciate the color there, Steve. Maybe just for a follow-up question. Given the challenges
with securing natural gas by many customers during which [ you're sort of hearing ] during the first
quarter. You've got higher gas prices right now as well also. Are you seeing interested or actual contracting
activity around your system, say in Haynesville, or any of your pipeline and storage assets more broadly,
where we can see some potential growth, where you sort of take this spot environment that's pretty juicy
right now and sort of convert it to some longer-term contracts?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. We have signed up some incremental business in Texas, and we have also been able to, particularly
on our flexible storage, we have seen rate increases, pretty good rate increases. Because I think
everybody got a bit of a wake-up call on the underlying value of storage.

And we are working on additional incremental business. We have talked publicly with regulators and others
about a project that would add additional delivery capability in the state of Texas that would help support
more power and human needs, loads even outside of what is really our current more active market area.

But we think, too, that we're seeing that really across the country that as things tighten up in these
markets, people are putting value, as they should, put value on firm deliverability. And let's face it,
supply hasn't quite kept pace with demand, particularly as export demand has grown, power demand has
come off a little bit, as Kim mentioned, but it's fairly strong. And industrial demand is strong, residential
commercial is seasonal. But the demand has outstripped supply. And the producers are working on it,
but it hasn't come back as fast as it came back, for example, when we merged out of the 2015, 2016
downturn.

So the value of deliverability, firm deliverability, as you get more intermittent resources in the generation
stack, as people look at winter coming, as people look at the experience we just had, we think that, that's
going to be attractive, and we're seeing that in real transactions.

Operator

Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse.

Spiro Michael Dounis
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Steve, I asked you about gas macro last time, and I didn't think I'd ever ask you again, but here we are at
$5 to $6 gas. And so it seems like a lot has changed since August. So we just love refreshed thoughts on
that front in terms of what you think it's going to take to kind of normalize prices here. To your point, we
haven't really seen that supply response yet. What do you think that's going to take? What are producers
telling you they need to see and when?

And then alternatively, Kim, you mentioned that some of the power plants have taken less deliveries
because of the higher pricing. Is demand disruption is something we need to worry about at these price
levels?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Okay. We'll start with the first one on the gas macro, and I'll call on Tom to fill in on this here.

As Kim mentioned, we are starting to see some sequential improvement -- sequential quarter, Q2 to Q3,
and there's been a lot more lively conversation, I think, with producers who are bringing some rigs in and
starting to share some development plans.

We've had some timing shifts in the Bakken, as Kim mentioned. But generally speaking, I think it's the
case that producers are responding. But again, not responding as quickly as they did in the last downturn.
And as many have reported, you're seeing the publicly traded producers continue to be exceedingly

10

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

disciplined about coming back in. They're enjoying the higher prices, but not responding as much out of
their concern about capital discipline.

However, I think something on the order of half of the rigs in the Permian now are owned by private
players. And so the supply will come back, whichever capital source drives it. This has been coming back a
little bit slower. Tom?

Thomas A. Martin
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

I think you covered it well.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

And then on the -- you want to talk about power demand and at current pricing?

Thomas A. Martin
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes, I mean we have seen some degradation in power demand due to higher gas prices, but not as much
as you would expect and certainly not what we have seen in prior years. And a lot of that has to do with
coal retirements and just the need to backfill renewable power on an intermittent basis. And so again, a
slight decrease, but not significant. And we still see, as Steve said, power customers wanting to sign up
for a services to firm up their gas or power capabilities on a longer-term basis. So I think that all looks
good for the future.

Spiro Michael Dounis
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. That's helpful color. Second one, just maybe getting your latest thoughts around capital spending
going forward kind of on a multiyear basis. Historically, you guys have talked about $2 billion to $3 billion
spending in any given year. And then, of course, with the pandemic and the slowdown, I think that fell to
sort of $1 billion or less was kind of the new number.

But since then, we've seen the outlook kind of dramatically improve, especially when you consider a lot
of the energy transition opportunities in front of you that Rich mentioned earlier. And so just wondering,
how do you think about an appropriate level of growth CapEx or M&A spending, however you want to think
about it going forward, that sort of keeps you within your target leverage and also allows you to grow the
dividend?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. So when we sort of adjusted the outlook from $2 billion to $3 billion to something lower, we adjusted
it to $1 billion to $2 billion. and we still think that, that's a pretty good estimate. And this year, we ended
up on the expansion capital front under $1 billion, as you mentioned. So we were at about $800 million for
this year.

And look, this is a function of kind of what -- what kind of activity there is out there. A lot of the -- some
of the new origination did come in the renewable diesel area and the renewable natural gas area, as we
talked about earlier, but we continue to have 53%, I think of our backlog, is for natural gas. And so we still
think the $1 billion to $2 billion is about right.

I think it is 2 points here. One, really big mega projects. It's no secret to anybody. Those are harder to
permit and build. But a lot -- on the other hand, a lot of the growth is on the Texas and Louisiana Gulf
Coast, the growth in gas demand that we expect. And we're just starting to hear a little bit more from
Permian players about the need for another pipeline. They don't need it right now, but their time frame
on when it might be needed out of the Permian has moved up a bit. And so those discussions are very
advanced. It's just kind of a function of current prices in both crude, and to some extent, natural gas.

But really huge projects, I think, are probably not as likely to get done or permitted. And so we think the
$1 billion to $2 billion is still probably about right, building off our existing network at attractive returns.

Richard D. Kinder
Executive Chairman of the Board

And let me just emphasize, as Steve said so many times, that we're going to be very disciplined in this
approach to spending capital, make certain that these are satisfactory returns. And I agree with the kind
of range Steve was talking about that as we've explained, we have a lot of uses for our capital, and we're
going to be very judicious about how we use it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I want to touch on carbon capture a bit more here. And just wanted to get your thoughts on how you think
this can unfold. And do you think that the hub concept is really needed to kind of move forward efficiently
kind of what the University of Houston and Rice and Columbia have discussed in their papers? Or do you
think that stand-alone projects on carbon capture can move forward by themselves?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Well, we're exploring the stand-alone projects. I mean, we're open to discussing other larger opportunities
as well. And perhaps, given that we know how to build, own, operate CO2 pipe, perhaps participating in
the transport piece. But again, for all the reasons I said before, I think there's a lot of wood to chop before
we see those bigger projects come through. Jesse, anything you want to add there?

Jesse Arenivas
VP, President of CO2 & President of Energy Transition Ventures

Well, I agree. I think the stand-alone probably will be quicker. As you said, multiple parties would have to
come together on the hub concept.

Jeremy Bryan Tonet
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful there. And then as far as it relates to what Kinder could do going forward, do you
see it mostly just organic growth off your footprint? Or do you see kind of the 2 projects that already have
commercial backing and are moving forward that are servicing ethanol production in the CO2 in the upper
Midwest, is that the type of thing that Kinder could get involved with? Or just kind of sticking to your own
asset base?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Again, no carbon capture here. Yes, we've looked at some. And again, I just want to emphasize, look,
I think carbon capture and sequestration, if we're going to meet climate objectives over the long term,
it's going to have to be part of the picture and some work is going to have to be done there. But I'm just
trying to set expectations at a rational level at how quickly we think that's likely to unfold and where we
think the first projects get done.

And so there's a focus on our existing network, but we have had discussions with people off the network
about the potential to capture and sequester carbon. Those things are still in early stages, but they are
things that we would explore if the returns were good.

Michael Jacob Blum
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to go back to, Rich, your opening comments.You referenced, potentially, I think private investors
perhaps partnering with you to invest in the business. Can you just expand on that comment? Are you sort
of suggesting public markets may or may not be there, so you might be looking at other sources capital?

Richard D. Kinder
Executive Chairman of the Board

No, what I'm saying is that we think we are creating real value as we move toward critical mass in our
Energy Transition Ventures group. And at some point, at the time of our choosing, when we feel we
have critical mass and still have significant growth opportunities, which we think are there in the space,
then I was saying that we believe and the Board believes that we would have the opportunity to partner
with public or private ownership on terms that we think would be very favorable to us. We think this is
a platform that deserves and will receive a lot of investment interest when it gets to be the appropriate
time.

Michael Jacob Blum
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay, got it. Totally changing gears. I wanted to ask a little bit about the EOR business. Just given the
increase in oil prices, I guess, have you been able to lock in higher price hedges going forward? And are
you thinking about that business any differently in terms of allocation of capital given the higher prices?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Jesse.

Jesse Arenivas
VP, President of CO2 & President of Energy Transition Ventures

Yes, we continue to layer on favorable hedges. Last quarter, we've been able to really lift the back end of
our hedge profile, so that's a positive. We are seeing some organic growth within our existing assets as
prices increase. So we think that will continue.

Operator

And our next question comes from Tristan Richardson from Truist Securities.

Tristan James Richardson
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just a follow-up on gas storage comments and your commentary there on positive signs of renewals.
Could you just generally frame up for us where contracted capacity is today or relative to nameplate, or
capacity available today for potential customers that as you say are waking up to the value proposition of
gas storage?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Well, you got to think of it in several buckets. I mean, one I mentioned that if we got it under contract,
we are looking at a storage expansion opportunity, specifically in Texas. We have storage that's rolling off
and renewing every year. We try to keep that fully under contract or pretty fully under contract. As that
happens, we're expecting -- well, we are seeing, and we're expecting we'll continue to see those values
improve.

But I want to make a further point about the bucketing here. Really flexible storage like we have about
30 or 40 Bcf of that in our Texas Intrastate business. Stage coaches are a pretty flexible storage asset as
well. That's where the value is really appreciating the most. If you think about some of our shorter-term

13

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

storage-related services like park and loan, in a backward-dated market, there's not as much opportunity
to park gas for customers. And so that shorter-term business gets a little more limited.

But in the aggregate and in the overall outlook, storage is becoming more valuable in our judgment. And
that's what made -- and we're seeing that, and it's also what made the acquisition opportunity, which was
somewhat fortuitous, but made it attractive to us.

Tristan James Richardson
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Helpful, Steven. And then switching gears. A small piece of your business, but can you talk a little bit
about the bulk business getting closer back towards 2019 levels. And can you talk about just some of the
dynamics we're seeing with both commodity inflation and supply dislocation? Do you see some of this
backdrop as a [ part ] -- tailwind from bulk business either on the pricing side or the capacity utilization
side?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

John Schlosser.

John W. Schlosser
VP & President of Terminals

Sure. We see most of the growth in the coal area where we were up 40% on the quarter, and on the steel
area, we were up 38%, which kind of mirrors what you're seeing from an international standpoint. U.S.
production was up 39% and exports were up 45%. So we've been following along to that. We're back at
our Pier IX facility, which is where the predominance of our export business is on the coal back to 2019
levels as we stand today.

Operator

Our next caller is Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.

Keith T. Stanley
Wolfe Research, LLC

So having closed the Kinetrex deal now, can you just give an update on, I guess, the opportunity set
you see in RNG and whether you think that'd be a significant part of your capital plan over the next
several years, either through acquisitions and organic growth? And then relatedly, can you just talk to
any progress or developments in the voluntary market that you're seeing as you try to term out a RIN
exposure there?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Sure. So Kinetrex, the 3 projects, as I believe Kim mentioned, that they -- that came with the deal, if you
will. Those were all under contract, under EPC contract, et cetera. At the time that we close, that's been
kicked off, those are on track.

In terms of the opportunity set, there are hundreds of landfill opportunities, but there are other
competitive players out there. We think we bring some scale to that business. The returns are attractive.
The capital commitment is $25 million to $40 million essentially per installation.

I guess what I'd say, Keith, is it's a little early to tell right now when and how much, okay? We're keeping
a very close eye on it. There's a lot of interest. There's shadow backlog, if you will, customer discussions
underway on a significant number of additional landfills. But there's work to be done commercially and all
of that from here to there.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

But it's very economic. And we've got some scale, we believe, to help commercialize this maybe more
quickly than others. So optimistic, but hard to quantify the when and the -- or the -- yes, the when and
how much right now.

The voluntary market, we have good, real conversations with real counterparties who are interested in
buying in the voluntary market, that means about the RINs value and without the RINS volatility, and --
but at very nice returns that are -- that would be locked in. And so I think that market is real because of
the ESG commitment and the net zero commitments that people are making. Their interest in doing --
using renewable natural gas is strong.

And so is the interest in the transport market. I mean, when you think about the technological and
economic barriers of electrifying heavy duty trucking, compressed natural gas and even LNG is an
attractive alternative that helps some of the big fleet operators meet their climate objectives and do so at
attractive prices.

And the other thing I would mention is we sell our RINS not quite exactly at the time we generate them,
but we've pretty much sold our RINs inventory for the year and at prices that are better than what we
have in the acquisition model.

Operator

Our next caller is Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America.

Chase Mulvehill
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess so the first question is really around LNG. You've got the 2 Bs a day coming online for LNG exports
over the next 12 or 18 months with [indiscernible]. Could you maybe walk through kind of how do you
think this is going to impact your transport volumes and then you're going to get some pull-through on the
G&P side. I know that you said you got about 50% market share. So should we expect about 50% market
share on the incremental 2 Bs that come online the next 12 to 18 months?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Tom.

Thomas A. Martin
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes. I mean, so we do have incremental projects that we're serving. We don't have contracts with both
of those facilities, but we certainly have a lot of business with Cheniere. And as their capacity grows,
we certainly have commitments to grow with them. We do have other projects that we are in active
discussions on projects that we believe will be FID-ed probably some time next year, and we think we'll
get our share of that capability as well. But that isn't in our backlog right now.

Chase Mulvehill
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay, right. And then one follow-up, just sticking on the LNG theme and kind of thinking about LNG and
responsibly-sourced natural gas. Are you having LNG operators request responsibly-sourced natural gas
as a feedstock? And today, is actually responsibly-sourced natural gas getting a premium out there in the
market today?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

The transactions that we've done, there hasn't been a premium to date, but I think the interest has
really escalated here of late. And the LNG customers are interested in the overall carbon content of their
cargoes, and that includes methane emissions.

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

And what they would tell you and what they've told us is sort of we are not their problem. Their problem
is just making sure that they have producers who are using the right completion techniques, et cetera. But
there is interest in that, particularly as they're trying to place cargoes in Europe, and they're very focused
on it, and we are working closely with them to make sure we do our part. But it is very much a point of
interest with our LNG customers.

Operator

Our next caller is Gabe Moreen from Mizuho.

Gabriel Philip Moreen
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I'll only ask one because I know everyone [ wants to ] ask your team. But around the $64 million
emissions reduction project on the ship channel, I'm just curious kind of the evolution around that,
whether that's -- there's going to be a return on that project. And ultimately, is that something that's just
specific to the HSC? Or can you take what you're doing there and apply it to some of your other hubs as
well? And is there interest in doing that?

Kimberly Allen Dang
President & Director

Yes. I mean it's a project where we've got existing vapor combustion units and we're replacing those vapor
combustion units with vapor recovery units. And so there is an economic return. The economic return
comes from as we capture those vapors, then we can sell that product. And then the other, the vapor
recovery unit is a little less intensive for combustion, and so there's natural gas savings.

So there is an economic return associated with the lower cost of running the equipment and with the
volumes that we are recovering, and that gets us to a nice economic return. We haven't counted anything
in the returns for the emissions reduction, but we are going to get 72% reduction in the emissions from
that facility on this project -- from this project.

Gabriel Philip Moreen
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

And Kim, maybe I can just ask a slight follow-up to that. Is the Board starting even to sort of put a price
on CO2 sort of implicitly when you're discussing that project?

Kimberly Allen Dang
President & Director

We have not put a price on CO2 when we're discussing projects. It is a nonquantitative consideration, but
the projects need to -- on a quantitative basis, need to clear the hurdle.

Operator

Our next caller is Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I have 2. First of all, can you talk a little bit about timing for either the Permian or the Haynesville, of
when you might think either basin -- or what your customers are saying about when either basin would
need new long-haul capacity? That's question one.

Question two, steel prices are through the roof, labor's up a good bit. How should we think about if new
kind of larger pipelines are needed for 1 or 2 basins, what cost inflation means for kind of potential returns
or potential tariff levels?

KINDER MORGAN, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2021

Okay. Yes, I mean on the Permian takeaway, what we had talked about before is kind of the need
being there in kind of 2025, call it. And now that's probably, at least based on some conversations with
customers, maybe moved up a year.

Now Michael, I just want to point out, need and contract signatures can sometimes be 2 different things
and occur at 2 different points in time. And so I think it's going to be -- we'll be having commercial
discussions and we'll see whether the real commitment demand is there. And we'll see how that plays out
really probably over the next year or so. Tom, on the Haynesville in terms of the timing there?

Thomas A. Martin
VP & President of Natural Gas Pipelines

Yes. So there is 1 project that is FID that will be in the market in 2023. So that will help relieve some
takeaway pressure. And then we think there is a need for some expansion projects sometime in the same
mid-2025 to 2028 time frame for additional Bcf for sale.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

And then on your question on steel costs and the like, yes, they have absolutely gone up. We were looking
at some information on hot rolled coil, which is what goes into the pipe mill to make pipelines. That's up
3x year-over-year. It's up 90% or so year-to-date. But the thing about it is that there is capacity in the
world market. It's that we've got a current dislocation. And the view would be, and you see to the extent
people are willing to go forward, that it starts to come down.

But in any case, we've been here before in terms of needing to protect us from escalation in steel prices.
We've included in past projects steel trackers; sometimes we needed them, sometimes we didn't. But --
and the other thing we're doing really across the board on materials is when we're evaluating a project for
approval, we make sure to ask, has this been updated for current equipment materials and steel prices
so that we make sure that we get that priced into the deal. To your real question, I don't think it is an
obstacle to getting an additional long-haul pipe done.

Operator

Our next caller is Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

Colton Westbrooke Bean
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

So just looking at terminals. I think the release [ provided ] the Jones Act fleet was a key driver of
some of the softer margins there. Have you seen counterparties exercising those renewal options? Or
do you expect mostly spot exposure as we look at 2022? And then just a related question, should we be
expecting any additional idling to cut OpEx there?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Okay. John.

John W. Schlosser
VP & President of Terminals

We don't expect any additional idling. We were -- we're able to kind of weather the storm through COVID
with no impact. It hit us this year like it hit the entire industry. 25% of the capacity of roughly 45 vessels
was idled at any given point this year.

We had 2 that have been idled all year. And rough rule of thumb is $3 million per quarter per vessel.
We've been able to recontract all of the other vessels as the year has gone on, or put them in spots for
a short period of time until we were able to get those recontracted. Our exposure, if you look kind of
forward into '22, is about 22% of the fleet days.

Great. I appreciate that update. And then maybe switching gears here. Just checking on hydrogen,
obviously, a longer-term opportunity. But we've seen a number of pilots, and I think just this morning,
had a larger scale production announcement. So are you seeing any requests for blending on the
transportation network as we look out a few years?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. And we're having conversations with customers about that. It is, as you pointed out, it's still a bit
of an economic challenge. That doesn't mean it won't happen, but it does mean that you have to have
something that will cover those economics like the ability to pass it through to a retail customer in a utility
context or something like that. Again, this is one of those things presumably will be, but we're still in the
early innings on it right now with pilots and experiments and announcements, but not -- we don't have
real concrete commercial activity at this point.

Operator

Our next caller is Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global Security.

Sunil K. Sibal
Seaport Research Partners

So my first question was related to a clarification on your opening remarks. I think you mentioned that
in the Bakken, the volume pick up has been somewhat slow. Did I hear that correctly? And if so, what in
your mind changed that trend? Obviously, the commodity strip is fairly strong looking forward.

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes. So I think that dynamic is changing. In terms of producer plans to continue to add wells to our
system, they're absolutely doing that. And the rigs are running, and they are drilling and getting the work
done. I think it was just that the connections were a little slow or the wells that we put online were a little
slower than what we had anticipated for the year. But it's still, we think, robust growth opportunity for
those assets both on the gas and the crude side.

Sunil K. Sibal
Seaport Research Partners

Got it. So it's just a matter of time. So the second question is related to the volatility [indiscernible]
pipeline. Obviously some of the contracts there have rolled off. And I was curious if you're seeing the
impact of this spreads widening on that pipeline? And how should we think about that asset going
forward?

Steven J. Kean
CEO & Director

Yes, not particularly on Ruby. From time to time, there's some activity there, depending on what's going
with the pipelines coming down -- what's going on operationally with the pipelines coming down from
Canada, but no change in our outlook there. And no change in our update -- on our view on Ruby, which
is we are going to make as Kinder Morgan, an economic decision for Kinder Morgan shareholders when the
debt comes due.
