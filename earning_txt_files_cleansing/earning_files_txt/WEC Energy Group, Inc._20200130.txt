WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Year-end
2019 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]

Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than
historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to
change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are
made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements,
factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.
During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share
unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions
and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at
wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.

And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2019.
First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have
Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO; Scott Lauber, Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, our Controller; Peggy
Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Tony Reese, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior
Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.

Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release
this morning, we reported full year 2019 earnings of $3.58 a share. And I'm pleased to report that we
delivered a record year on virtually every meaningful measure of performance, from customer satisfaction
to a swift recovery from severe July storms that caused extensive damage to our system.

As we review our financial results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. In fact, our ratio of holding
company debt to total debt now stands at 28%. That meets our 30% goal. In 2019, we also eliminated
a regulatory asset for transmission costs, and we continued to leverage the benefits of tax reform for
both customers and shareholders. In addition, we worked effectively to settle our Wisconsin rate reviews,
which represent approximately 70% of our regulated assets. We also took our environmental efforts a
step further. We set a new goal in 2019 to reduce the rate of methane emissions from our natural gas
distribution system by 30% per mile by the year 2030. Our ongoing work to modernize Chicago's natural
gas delivery network is key to achieving this goal. And we continue to analyze our climate-related risks
and opportunities. In fact, a recent Moody's report focused on the risk exposure of regulated utilities to
heat stress, water stress and extreme rainfall. I'm pleased to note that WEC Energy ranked among the
lowest risk companies in our sector.

During 2019, we also reached a number of significant milestones in our infrastructure segment. The
Coyote Ridge Wind Farm is now in service in South Dakota and will contribute a full year of earnings in
2020. As you may recall, Coyote Ridge consists of 39 turbines, with a capacity of roughly 97 megawatts.
We invested approximately $145 million for our 80% share of the wind farm, and we're entitled to 99% of
the tax benefits. As you know, a significant portion of our earnings from this facility come in the form of
production tax credits.

Project has a 12-year offtake agreement with Google Energy, LLC for all of the energy produced. We also
announced back in September that we will acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Thunderhead Wind
Energy Center for $338 million. Invenergy is developing this project in Nebraska, we expect it to be in
service at the end of 2020. The site will consist of 108 GE wind turbines with a combined capacity of 300

megawatts. The project has a long-term offtake agreement with AT&T for 100% of the energy produced.
We expect Thunderhead will qualify for production tax credits and 100% bonus depreciation.

Then earlier this week, folks, we announced plans for another new development. We've agreed to acquire
an 80% ownership interest in the Blooming Grove Wind Farm for $345 million. Invenergy is developing
this project in Illinois, with commercial operation expected to begin by the end of this year. The site will
host 94 wind turbines with a total capacity of 250 megawatts. Blooming Grove has a 12-year offtake
agreement with affiliates of 2 multinational companies that are investment grade. We expect that
Blooming Grove will be eligible for 100% bonus depreciation as well as production tax credits.

Overall, we're very encouraged about these investments in renewable energy, which will serve strong
businesses for years to come. We expect the return on these investments to be higher than our regulated
returns. Of course, we're being very selective as we vet future projects. We're only interested in projects
that achieve our financial return metrics and do not change our risk profile.

Now let's take a brief look at the regional economy that's supporting our company's longer-term growth.
Wisconsin's unemployment remains near record lows for the state, and we continue to see strong
economic development projects in the pipeline. Foxconn is moving forward with its plan to create a high-
tech campus in Racine County, south of Milwaukee. Work on a Generation 6 fabrication plant for liquid
crystal display screens is progressing. The fab, which spans about 1 million square feet is now enclosed,
and work is beginning on the internal structures. Foundations are also in place for a high-capacity data
center. In addition, Foxconn has announced plans for a smart manufacturing facility. Construction crews
began lifting the exterior walls into place for the smart manufacturing plant earlier this week.

Based on public data, we estimate that Foxconn's investment in Wisconsin over the past 2 years has risen
to approximately $500 million. Turning a bit further south, in the Kenosha area, Uline has announced plans
to invest $130 million in 2 new facilities and bring approximately 350 new jobs to the area. Uline, as you
may know, is a leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging supplies with headquarters here
in Wisconsin. In addition, Milwaukee Tool has announced another expansion. Milwaukee Tool will invest
$100 million in a large multipurpose campus, northwest of the city in Menomonee Falls. The company also
committed to adding 870 jobs in Wisconsin by the year 2025. These are exciting times. We look forward to
more economic development and opportunity across the region.

Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more insight on our operations and our regulatory calendar. Kevin,
all yours.

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Gale. First, I'd like to share some good news. Our largest subsidiary, We Energies, was named
the most reliable electric utility in the Midwest for the 9th year running. Wisconsin Public Service also was
recognized for the first time for outstanding reliability performance.

Now I'll briefly review where we stand in our 4 state jurisdictions. As you'll recall, in March of last year, we
filed a proposal with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to set customer rates for We Energies
and Wisconsin Public Service. And in August, we entered into settlement agreements with the Citizens
Utility Board of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and Clean Wisconsin. On December 19,
the commission issued its written order affirming those settlement agreements and setting the rates for
the next 2 years. New rates went into effect on January 1.

During 2019, we also continued to make progress in developing solar generation for our regulated
businesses in Wisconsin. You may recall that in Wisconsin, we're planning a total of 300 megawatts
of utility-scale solar capacity, the first facilities of this size in the state. We've broken ground on 2
solar projects for Wisconsin Public Service, Two Creeks and Badger Hollow I. Our share will total 200
megawatts with an expected investment of approximately $260 million. Both projects are scheduled to
begin producing energy by the end of this year. And this past August, at We Energies, we filed with the
Wisconsin Commission for approval to acquire 100 megawatts of capacity at the Badger Hollow II solar

park. The projected investment would be $130 million. We expect to receive the commission's decision
this spring.

We also see efficient natural gas storage, another important part of our regulated business strategy.
In particular, Wisconsin needs more natural gas peaking capacity at the highest demand times on the
coldest days. We're continuing to evaluate site plans for 2 liquefied natural gas facilities to help meet
our customers' needs during the winter peak. We expect to invest approximately $370 million in these
projects. If approved by the Wisconsin Commission, construction is expected to begin in the summer of
2021.

Turning to Illinois. We continue making progress on the Peoples Gas System modernization program. This
program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern,
safe and reliable. We're approximately 28% complete with our replacement of outdated corroded natural
gas piping, some of which was installed more than a century ago. We continue to project an investment of
$280 million to $300 million per year on average in this program.

Now let's turn to Michigan. In 2019, we completed our new natural gas-fired power plants in Michigan's
Upper Peninsula, on time and on budget. These plants are now providing a cost-effective, long-term
power supply for our customers in the Upper Peninsula. With these new units operating, we were able to
retire our older, less-efficient coal-fired plant at Presque Isle. This resulted in significant operations and
maintenance savings and reduced CO2 emissions.

Taking a broader look across our business, we continue to focus on operating efficiency and financial
discipline. As a whole, we exceeded our 2019 goal to reduce our day-to-day operation and maintenance
costs. Our goal was a reduction of 4%, and we actually achieved a 7% reduction. We have set a goal to
further reduce our O&M by an incremental 2% to 3% in 2020 as well.

And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Kevin, thank you very much. As you'll recall, ladies and gentlemen, our 2020 guidance is in a range of
$3.71 a share to $3.75 a share. This translates to an earnings growth of between 6% and 7.1% of our
2019 base of $3.50 a share. Recall that $3.50 a share was the midpoint of our original guidance for 2019.

And finally, a word about our dividend policy. In its January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the
quarterly cash dividend to $0.6325 a share for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 7.2%. The new
quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.53 a share. This marks the 17th, count them, 17th
consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target
a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now. So I expect our
dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.

And now with details on our 2019 results and our outlook for 2020 is our CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Thank you, Gale. Our 2019 earnings of $3.58 per share increased $0.24 per share compared to 2018,
a 7.2% increase. In 2019, we benefited from additional capital investment, production tax credit and
continued emphasis on cost control. While all of our utilities met their financial goals, our Wisconsin
utilities earned their fully allowed ROE, and customers will see the benefit going forward through the
sharing mechanism. We posted the earnings packet to our website this morning and includes a comparison
of fourth quarter and full year results. My focus will be on the full year, beginning with operating income
by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.

Referring to Page 10 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2019 was $1.530
billion as compared to operating income of $1.470 billion in 2018, an increase of $63 million. Recall that
as part of our previous rate settlement in Wisconsin, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to

offset the growth of certain regulatory assets. The plan continued through year-end, and as we expected,
the transmission escrow asset balance at We Energies was eliminated. My update will focus on changes
in operating income by segment, excluding the impact of tax repairs and our adoption of the new lease
accounting rules.

Starting with the Wisconsin segment. Operating income increased $42 million net of these adjustments.
Lower operation and maintenance expense resulted in approximately $105 million increase in operating
income, driven by efficiencies and effective cost control across the enterprise. This positive impact on
operating income was largely offset by a few items. First, lower sales volume due to primarily cooler
summer weather conditions accounted for approximately $26 million decrease in operating income.
Second, depreciation and amortization increased $35 million as we continued to execute on our capital
plan. And finally, operating income was reduced by a $22 million tax item that flowed through operating
income. This was fully offset by a reduction in tax expense.

In Illinois, operating income increased by $36 million, primarily as a result of our continued investment
in the safety and reliability of the Peoples Gas System. Operating income at our other state segment
decreased $3.5 million.

Turning now to our Energy Infrastructure segment. Operating income in this segment was up $800,000,
driven by additional investment in our Power the Future plan. As expected, the Bishop Hill Upstream and
Coyote Ridge Wind Farms did not have a material impact on operating income. Recall, a significant portion
of earnings from these wind farms come in the form of production tax credits, which are recognized as
an offset to income tax expense. These production tax credits contributed approximately $0.08 per share
to our earnings for the year compared to $0.01 in 2018. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other
segment increased by $12 million. This variance reflects a $5.3 million gain that we recorded in 2018
related to the sale of a legacy business as well as an impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019
on assets that we inherited from the Integrys acquisition. Combining these variances and excluding the
impact of tax repairs and the new lease rules, consolidated operating income increased $62.8 million.
Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $128 million, a decrease of $9.1
million as compared to 2018. Our earnings from ATC decreased by $19 million as a result of the recent
FERC order addressing the MISO complaint. Going forward, we are recording ATC earnings assuming a
10.38% return on equity. This includes a 50 basis point adder for our participation in MISO.

Other income net increased by $32 million, driven by investment gains associated with our benefit plans.
Note that these investment gains partially offset the benefit expense included in our operating segment.
The remaining increase relates to the nonservice cost component of our pension and benefit plans.

Our net interest expense increased by $53 million, mostly due to higher long-term debt balances to fund
the capital investment. This excludes the impact of the new lease guidance. Our consolidated income tax
expense, net of tax repairs, decreased by $42 million. The major drivers were production tax credits from
our wind investments and the 2018 tax reform item that I mentioned earlier. Our 2019 effective tax rate
was 9.9%. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, our 2019 effective tax rate would have been 20.6%.

Looking forward, we expect the 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%. This includes
the effects of the unprotected tax benefits that are being refunded to customers following our recent
Wisconsin rate decision. Excluding these benefits, we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between
20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2020. Our projections show that we'll
be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our capital plan.

Turning to our cash flow statement. Our FFO to debt was 18.5% in 2019. Looking ahead, we expect FFO
to debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k)
plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Total
capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.5 billion in 2019, a $112 million increase from 2018.

Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2019,
our utilities were serving approximately 10,000 more electric and 14,000 more natural gas customers
compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on Page 13 and 14 of
the earnings packet. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 2.8%

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

7

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

compared to 2018. And on a weather-normal basis, deliveries were down 1.7%. Natural gas deliveries in
Wisconsin increased 2.6% versus 2018 and by 1.8% on a weather-normal basis. This excludes gas used
for power generation.

And now I'll briefly touch on our 2020 sales forecast for our Wisconsin segment. We are forecasting a
slight decrease of 0.5% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine. We
project the Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries to increase by 0.7%. This excludes gas
used for power generation, and of course, both of these projections are adjusted for leap year in 2020.

Finally, let's look at our guidance for the first quarter of 2020. Last year, we earned $1.33 per share in the
first quarter. As you recall, this included approximately $0.04 related to the colder-than-normal weather in
2019. Factoring in this and the 16% warmer-than-normal January, we project first quarter 2020 earnings
to be in the range of $1.32 per share to $1.34 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the
quarter. And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman
Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we're continuing to perform at a high level, on track and focused on
delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now to open it up for the
question-and-answer portion of the call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

So let me -- just a couple of questions here. You guys are backfilling this infrastructure capital budget
relatively fast, especially with last week's acquisition. What's the spending shape look like given sort of
these recent opportunities, i.e. is there any opportunities to provide upside to your current guide? Or is
this just kind of an acceleration of that spend? And then, Scott, I know you mentioned on the cash tax
position being a partial payer. But does that include last week's acquisition. Just wanted to get a little bit
of clarity there.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, Shar, we'll be happy to answer those questions. First, I would view our announcement this week
on Blooming Grove as basically an acceleration of the 5-year plan. If you kind of look at what we've
accomplished so far with what we believe are very high-quality projects, we're almost -- we're about 38%
already in terms of the projects that we've agreed to acquire. We're at about 38% of the spending we
projected in our 5-year plan. But I would view it as an acceleration. And I will tell you why. Our 5-year
plan, which projected about $1.8 billion in this particular segment of capital spending essentially was a
happy marriage of the high-quality projects that we saw, that we really had a strong interest in, coupled
with our ability to utilize all of the tax benefits. You put all that together and it kind of shook out at $1.8
billion. So Scott, I would view this as an acceleration.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Right. It's just a timing. And when you look at the tax position, and we say a very small taxpayer, it's
going to be under $15 million, $20 million, but because of the tax rules, there's still some tax payments
that are made. But as you know, we're slowly starting up with the PTCs work into 2021, then [ 2022 ]. So
that will not be a full taxpayer in 2021. But still, when you look at our 5-year plan, a lot of capacity on our
tax side.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

And Shar, remember, this particular wind farm doesn't come into service until the very end of 2020.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Right. Got it. Okay. And then just on the regulated renewables. There's obviously a lot that you're doing
there. Can I just get a sense on how this could impact your decision to exercise the West Riverside option
to purchase maybe up to 200 megawatts of that plant. Is there sort of a read-through on that option? And
whether you would exercise it?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

No, I wouldn't do any read-through on that. That is still something that we're analyzing, still something
we're taking a look at. As we continue to review our demand forecasts, our needs, the impact of
renewables, but that is still something that's on the table, Shar.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just lastly, Gale. It's a little bit more of a policy question. I mean, obviously, we had a
commissioner announcement last -- a couple of weeks ago around the resignation. So we're obviously
likely going to see a bit of a democratic shift with Evers appointment. Is there kind of any read-throughs
that we should be thinking about from a policy standpoint, as looks like the majority may change.
Business as usual? Or could this kind of accelerate some of the solar decarbonization plans that are out
there?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

My own sense is, I would look at any additional appointments to the commission largely as business as
usual. But I will say and remind everyone that the Governor has appointed a climate task force. He's
announced an aspirational goal late last year to basically have carbon-free electricity by 2050. And this
task force on which our company is represented had its actual first meeting just a week or so ago. So
during this year, I think you will see some policy recommendations related to decarbonization coming
out of this task force. In many ways, the Public Service Commission would, in all probability, need to
implement some of those policy changes if they were adopted. But the policy shift that I would see
coming, if there is one, would really come through the Governor's task force on climate change, if that
makes sense to you.

Operator

Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Your stock hit par today. Congratulations.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Thank you. Greg, does that mean we're looking for a bogey or what does that mean?

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

We'll talk about an over or under on the end of the year offline, Gale. I'm happy to wager with you. Can
we unpack the O&M performance a little bit because it really is quite impressive. If I look at Page 8 of your
release, I think what you're telling me, I should be looking at the O&M as adjusted for impact of the flow-
through of tax repairs, right? Like that's like the clean number?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, that's correct...

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And it's down dramatically. And all the more so, I think, because when I look at the rabbi trust activity
that, that's basically offset in O&M by an offsetting adjustment in O&M. So if I adjusted for the rabbi trust
activity, the O&M comparison would be even better than it looks. Is that -- I think that's correct. And if
so, can you unpack for us what the sort of structural savings are -- that are now flowing through on a full
year basis from the activities you pursued, they're sort of permanent benefits. And I think there's more to
come with the investments you've made in your investment in technology and things like that. So I'm just
wondering, a, what's the structural improvement in O&M? Where do they come from? And b, what's the
follow-on from continued activities on that front?

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Be happy to. Let me frame all of this for you, and then we're going to let Scott and Kevin weigh in on
some of the details. But we did have an exceptional quarter in terms of continued efficiencies across the
business. And there are a couple of factors that I think are important here. The first is that during 2019,
we saw essentially pretty much a full year benefit of the implementation of our ERP system across the
entire enterprise. So that was helpful. And we're continuing -- as people get used to that new system,
we're continuing to see efficiencies and benefits that we thought we would. And then compared to Q4 of a
year ago, compared to Q4 of 2018, for example, there were significant O&M savings related to the closure
of coal-fired power plants. Remember in -- we basically over the last several months and 1.5 years or
so, we've retired 3 older, less efficient coal-fired power plants. The units at Presque Isle up in the Upper
Peninsula, Michigan, were the latest to be retired in the spring of 2019. We have the Pulliam plant near
Green Bay retired, and we had Pleasant Prairie retired. So we're seeing -- in the fourth quarter, we saw
O&M benefits flow-through from no longer having to incur O&M for the operation of those plants. Then
we had some of our technology investments continue to kick in. And as Kevin said, we are projecting
additional O&M savings that we think we're going to gain here, and we're on track to gain in 2020. So
Scott, Kevin, anything you'd like to add.

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Yes, you mentioned the ERP. But if you look at the common platforms across our system in the fourth
quarter of this year, we'll complete our customer information system to have that across all of our
companies. We have already seen even this past year some savings from what we had in place
already. But in addition to that, through last year and focusing on the future, just looking at process
improvements. So as we look across our jurisdictions, do benchmarking, we're looking at common
standards and where it makes sense to have a proactive and similar approaches across our system. That
has produced some positive results for us on O&M reduction and will continue to.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Scott, anything to add...

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

I don't think there's anything else. It is across the enterprise, though. Everyone has O&M takeout,
opportunities and efficiencies to gain.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

And we're doing that, Greg, which I'm very pleased about, and I thought we would be able to. We're
doing that while increasing customer satisfaction. So that's one of the reasons I mentioned earlier in my
remarks, as we track our operational and financial performance, we had a record year across virtually
every meaningful measure of performance.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Right. So there is an incremental improvement on run rate O&M as you get to the sort of fully baked
savings from the coal plant closures. And then there's incremental O&M benefits, but from the -- that you
think you'll get from the ERP and also from the rollout of the CIS, amongst other things.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

You've nailed it. That's exactly right.

Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So just following up on Greg's question here. I think that's really germane. Can we dig in a little further as
to the prospects to sustain these levels of cost reductions? I mean, they're really quite dramatic. I mean --
I think Greg emphasized it enough, but the point being, how sustainable are these just given how outsized
they appear to be relative to the balance of the sector, not just on a trailing basis, but prospectively for '20
here, as you think through the balance of your planning period. And maybe even to push the point a little
bit further, how identified is it just -- not just in '20, but through the balance of your financial period that
you're forecasting in terms of these levels of reduction?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, I'll take a stab at that. Certainly, Scott can add anything he would like to and Kevin as well. Let me
say this. We believe, and I think our track record demonstrates that the kind of cost savings that you saw
that we continue to believe we're going to continue on a downward path, those are very sustainable. We
wouldn't be publicly committing to them if we didn't think we could absolutely sustain them. So again,
we took 7% of the day-to-day O&M out of the business in 2019 and the 2% to 3% projected reduction in
2020. And again, we're doing this, I think, in a very, highly planned and deliberate way. And a good chunk
of it is coming really from 2 areas. One, we mentioned before that we're getting the full benefit of now,
and that's the O&M takeout from the closure of less-efficient coal-fired power plants, but the other is the
investment in technology. So my view, guys, would be highly sustainable.

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Gale, I'd agree. We just mentioned a couple of things that we're doing, but let me add one more on
the customer service side though. We have and are investing in our AMI infrastructure, and we've seen
savings from having that in place to reduce the roles of truck that will continue, and we'll see those
opportunities ahead in the coming years. Also, leveraging technology like mobile apps, as an example. As
we get that out into our customers, we'll be able to have more interaction with our customers and give
them opportunities to pay their bills online, minimize paper billing, things of that nature. So I would agree
the sustainability of that is built into a lot of what we're doing, customer service side, especially with the
things that I just mentioned.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Let me, if I can please, to jump in a little further. What about the compounding nature of that trajectory.
2% to 3% is impressive, but through your forecast period, do you anticipate compounding of that
trajectory? And then perhaps the really relevant second question is, you've done it before, how do we
think about the cadence of rate cases? And I know we're getting out a little bit, but just given the scale of
cost reductions here, certainly, the question doesn't seem too early in terms of -- across any one of your
jurisdictions given the enterprise-wide cost reductions that are contemplated here. I mean, i.e., pushing
them out.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

I'm chuckling because we just got through the rate reviews for 70% of our regulated assets.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I know. I recognize that, but then the cost reductions are incredible.

Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just one more on the O&M. What do you guys assume for earned ROEs now that you've got this kind of
different sharing band where you could overearn a little bit before you get back to customers. Where does
this -- these O&M savings targets put you on an earned ROE basis?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

We're assuming, as we have in the past, that we earn the allowed rates of return in each one of our retail
jurisdictions.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Sorry, just to clarify. Is that like at the electric utilities, the 10% or up to the 10.25% that you can
do before sharing.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Right now, we're assuming 10%.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Okay. And then over to the sales growth. So I think for 2020, electric, you're forecasting down a
little bit. And if we go back to some of your EEI slides, there's supposed to be a tick up in the next couple
of years and more so as you get into '22, '23. Can you just give us some color around key milestones that
we should be looking for on economic growth that's going to bridge that from down a little bit to up closer
to 1%?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, happy to, Michael. First of all, the uptick that we continue to project, this is a pretty slight uptick. But
the uptick that we're projecting in the 2022, 2023 time frame is really driven by the amazing economic
development projects that I talked about a little earlier in our remarks. We have not seen any slowdown

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

in terms of the number of economic development projects, the amount of new construction, just the
continuing economic growth in the pipeline of projects that are being announced here in Southeastern
Wisconsin, in particular. So we still feel pretty confident about the uptick in the longer term. The shorter
term, meaning for 2020, is really driven by, like, for example, the large industrial segment. It's really
driven by the interviews that our people have with our key account customers and feedback into our
projections. It's also driven a bit by weather normalization. Remember, we had 2 warmer-than-normal
summers back to back. So you look at weather normalization, you look at conservation, you look at real-
time feedback from our major industrial customers, and you put it all together and it's like [ ragu ], it's
in there. That's what comes out. So in total, a very modest decline, I believe, Scott, 0.5% is what we're
projecting on retail, absent the mine.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Correct. So a very modest decline. And once again, the projections that we have in the investor book are
really the only projects that we have -- that we know. It doesn't include the residential and secondary that
we expect to come from it. It's just the known projects that have actually started turning dirt already. So
it just takes a while to build a building and start using it. So we expect those that are still on track to be
coming. And like Gale said, our forecast is really out there talking to our customers and really fine-tuning
it. And the information we have here is the best information we have.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

And we're still projecting, even though with a modest 0.5% decline, we're still projecting 6% to 7% EPS
growth.

Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.

Praful Mehta
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Congratulations on the quarter. So maybe just -- I guess, the O&M point has been already debated and
answered, so appreciate that. I think on the energy infrastructure side, the $1.8 billion that was planned.
You said you accelerated it with this latest acquisition. Do you expect with the tax appetite being what it is
further down the road, do you expect that size to increase through the 2024 time frame? Or do you expect
the $1.8 billion to still be the cap?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

At the moment -- again, we'll continue to look at this. But at the moment, I would view this as an
acceleration and the $1.8 billion for the 5 years is still what we are looking at.

Praful Mehta
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Got you. And then when we think about the tax appetite, and you've said that you'd be a small taxpayer,
how should we think about that tax paying capacity in the '23, '24 time frame. Is that -- you still a small
taxpayer at that point? Or is that capacity increasing over time?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Well, when you still look and you work everything in, we would still be a small taxpayer getting into that,
being out in that frame of time if we execute on all these capital projects. Largely because of some of the
tax rules that are out there. You still have to be a minimal taxpayer for some of the reasons. But we need
to execute on all these capital projects to get to that level.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Given the tax rules, as Scott said, it's highly unlikely that we'll ever, in a sustained period of time, get to
absolute 0. So when we say modest taxpayer, for example, I think Scott mentioned, $15 million to $20
million this year. So I hope that puts things in context for you.

Praful Mehta
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Yes. No, it does. And I appreciate that. And then -- and just finally, in terms of credit and the holdco debt
side, I think you started by saying you've got improving credit and your holdco debt is now down to 28%.
Is there any target we should be thinking about around the holdco debt level? And also the FFO to debt
kind of credit that we should be thinking more longer term?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

We'll have Scott answer that. We do have an internal cap on where we want to go and where we don't
want to go with holdco credit -- holdco debt, I'm sorry.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes, so we look at that holdco to total debt, it's down to 28%. Our target is to keep it below 30%. Now if
there's an opportunity, one year, it may pop up or down. But -- and we feel comfortable with those ranges
in our forecast here. And the FFO to debt in that 16% to 18% range. Now last year, we hit 18.5%. But
remember, we were at a sharing opportunity at Wisconsin utilities, and that money will go back eventually
to customers. So next year, it may be on the lower end of that range, but still within that 16% to 18%
range.

Gale E. Klappa

And that range, as you know, well supports our current credit ratings.

Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Just want to elaborate on the contracted infrastructure projects. So as of now, what percent of 2020 EPS
will come from that segment? And let's assume the 5-year plan stays at $1.8 billion, seems like the bias
might be to the upside, what percent of earnings would be coming from that segment in 5 years?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, I can get -- well, I can give you the number for this year and, obviously, we can do a little bit of
public math here. But long story short, we got in 2019, about $0.02 a quarter of earnings from our
infrastructure investments. Given the addition this year of full year earnings for Coyote Ridge, which went
into service at the end of 2019, I would expect about $0.03 a quarter. Scott?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

So actually about $0.03 a quarter. And remember, the other projects we announced are in December of
next year, so some impact, but not a lot.

Okay. And then bigger picture, how big are you willing to let that segment be? Obviously, they're high-
quality contracted assets, but they're not the regulated rate base construct. So do you have sort of a
mental feeling of how big that could be as far as earnings mix?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, we do have. At the moment, I would say that our internal plan would hold that segment of our
business down to about 10% of our earnings.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Very good. Then just one last one on that same topic. Is -- you said you've accelerated the
spending, but you're not increasing it. What's the limiting factor of why you're not increasing it? Is it
balance sheet, opportunity for specific projects? Is it that 10% ceiling you just mentioned? How do you
balance those?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

It's the happy marriage between the quality projects that we see in the pipeline that we are very
interested in and our tax appetite. So you put it all together, and the $1.8 billion shakes out to something
that we can -- we think we can both add quality projects to achieve and maximize our tax position.

transmission projects have a long gestation period. So I wouldn't expect there to be some kind of a knee-
jerk reaction in the first 30 or 60 days, particularly with all the appeals going on and the uncertainty of
what the final result will be.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Exactly, Gale. And we're recording at 10.38%. Remember our long-term plan, we were assuming 10.2%.
So 10.38% is a little north of that.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. And I may have missed this before, but where do you guys stand in terms of dividend payout
ratio targets? And what's the future growth rate for dividends? Is it just going to track along with EPS at
this point?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes. The plan -- our policy is to pay out in a range of 65% to 70% of earnings. So a dividend payout ratio
that is 65% to 70% of earnings. As I mentioned earlier, we're right smack dab in the middle of that range
right now. So we would project that dividend growth would be in line with the growth in earnings per
share.

Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with GS.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. I actually have several. They're all gas related, and I'll just kind of rattle them
off. First of all, your gas demand forecast of, I think it's 0.7%. Can you remind me when the last time you
did sub-1% gas demand growth in Wisconsin? That's the first question. The second question is, where do
you stand on the permitting and regulatory approval for the gas LNG facility in Wisconsin that you talked
about a couple of months ago or a while ago? And then finally, any incremental thoughts on the need for
new gas-fired generation, either as partly transformation or just meet demand growth?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

All right. We'll be happy to try to tick those off one by one. I think weather normal, we were at 1.8% on
retail gas. So we had a 1.8% growth in retail gas consumption on a weather-normal basis in 2019. You
could probably go back in terms of when were we last below 1%. Whatever year that gas -- natural gas
prices got to double digits, I think we did not grow meaningfully at all in terms of natural gas demand
from the retail side of the business. Scott?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes, exactly. And when you think about it, yes, we've had 3% to 4% growth; last year was 1.8%. But now
what we're really forecasting is really the customer growth aspect, not assuming any more conservation
but also assuming that people don't turn their houses from 69 to 74. People are going to stay comfortable.
We've also seen a lot of conversions in the last couple of years from industrial for their own environmental
goals to go -- convert from coal and oil to natural gas. So you only convert once. So basically, our forecast
now is based on customer growth.

generation?

Mix of gas versus coal-fired?

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Yes, just in terms of thinking about new gas generation needs.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, as you know, we have an option with Alliant to buy into, at some point between now and, say, 2024,
a portion of their new gas-fired combined cycle that's being built right now. That option is still on the
table. We haven't made a final decision. Beyond that, we don't have any plans to propose any construction
of new gas-fired generation. And of course, regardless of whether we add gas-fired generation or not, the
percentage of gas-fired generation in our total mix will be going up and coal will be coming down, as we've
already retired about 40% of our existing coal-fired generating capacity.

I'm already losing the bet so far this year, Gale, but it's one of those bets in truth I'd be happy to lose.
But anyway, I just wanted to go back to the comment on what your expectations are as they sort of bake
into your earnings growth aspiration, the 5% to 7%. You said that you're targeting the authorized ROE
without -- and not assuming that you maximize your opportunity to get into the higher end of the range.
Should we assume that the midpoint of your guidance represents earning the authorized return and sort of
like the high end represents the ability to achieve other factors like earning that extra 25 basis points? Or
if I'm not thinking about it correctly, could you give us some guidance as how you're thinking about that
opportunity and what it might mean for your earnings outlook?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, great question, Greg. Everybody in the room is nodding their head. You've got it. If we were modeling
it, as we know, you would be, we would assume fully authorized rate of return gets us to the midpoint of
the guidance and then upside from there if we were to get into sharing.

electrification of heating and everything else. And obviously, the view from the Upper -- the Upper Midwest
winter is a little bit different than places like California. But do you have any view on where this is all going
in terms of natural gas infrastructure spending? And you guys are kind of the experts at the turnarounds
of the turnaround business there.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, it's a very good question. And I think you are correct. In the less -- in the warmer climates, in the
more temperate climates, there's clearly a push by some of the more active environmentalists to not
only move away from coal, but now we have a beyond gas campaign that we're seeing. For us, I think,
Michael, it comes back to pure practicality and the recognition that if it's 40 below in the Upper Peninsula
of Michigan, a heat pump is simply not going to keep your house warm, or even if it did, it would be so
incredibly expensive that you simply couldn't deal with it. So for our Upper Midwest area and with the
market share that we have for home and commercial heating with natural gas, I just don't see a major
turn away from that for many, many years to come. I think the other piece of it is natural gas heating.
Natural gas furnaces continue to get even more efficient. And there are better ways, I think, in terms
of running the economy and continuing to reduce CO2 emissions. And if you look now at -- across the
U.S. and in the Upper Midwest, the #1 contributor to CO2 emissions is no longer power generation, for
example. It's transportation. I think the low-hanging fruit here in terms of continuing to decarbonize
the economy, particularly in a region like the one we serve, is not moving away from natural gas home
heating, it's actually electrification for vehicles. Kevin, I don't know if you have any view on that.

Joseph Kevin Fletcher
President, CEO & Director

Gale, I think you summed it up very well. The other thing that I just will add is, as technology continues to
evolve on the gas side, we'll continue to be in a part of that and looking at it. But I think you summarized
our position and our philosophy very well.

One item I wanted to make sure I understood because this is the line item, and I just wanted to make

how it's funded, its duration and kind of how it replicates itself over its life?

Gale E. Klappa

Sure. We'll be happy to take a stab at it. I'm going to let Scott do that. I will say this. We have to make
sure that all of you don't look at the rabbi trust in isolation because in many ways, the rabbi trust is -- the

important point to remember. Scott?

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Yes, that's exactly it, Gale. So the rabbi trust is really set up by Integrys, and we inherited that investment
vehicle. And that is related to some of the deferred compensation that individuals from Integrys had
earned through the years. So what the rabbi trust does is -- what we do is we try to match the best we
can the expense of the deferred comp that's in the utilities with the investments in this rabbi trust. So
if the rabbi trust goes up $1, usually the deferred comp expense goes up $1 or vice versa. So it's really
trying to match that. We have those funds that are tied up specifically for the deferred comp. So there's
nothing else we can use for them. So we have to do it, and we thought the best thing to do was try to
mirror and match the hedging as much as possible. Like Gale said, though, you can't look at it in isolation.
Just for accounting purposes, that has to be on this line how it's recorded.

Gale E. Klappa

And Vedula, so far -- and again, we've inherited that in 2015 with the Integrys acquisition. So far, our
strategy -- our matching strategy, if you will, has worked exceptionally well.

Vedula Murti

So as I think about this, is the variance here tied to stock market performance of Wisconsin equity --
Wisconsin Energy's equity specifically? Or what creates the variances both up and down in this?

Gale E. Klappa

All right. And again, we'll let Scott give you more detail. But long story short, we know what investment
options are -- people who've got the deferred comp are in. In other words, we know what investment
options they've selected. We can blend that with our investment options in the rabbi trust.

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. And a lot of the investment options are dealing with equities in the deferred comp. And that's what
we're trying to match it, the best we can, it's not perfect, but the best we can with equities in the rabbi
trust. And so far, the correlation has been pretty high.

Gale E. Klappa

guidance range, about the variance going forward there?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

We can certainly give you the comparison of what we achieved in terms of the infrastructure segment
earnings in 2019 versus our projection in 2020. And as I mentioned earlier, the infrastructure segment
gave us about $0.02 a share uptick in earnings each quarter during 2019. And with the addition of Coyote
Ridge Wind Farm in South Dakota, which went commercial at the end of last year and will give us a full
year this year, we would expect $0.03 a quarter from the infrastructure investments in wind.

Yes. So given the fully diluted share count, it would appear then that, that variance should be something
similar, not as dramatic year-over-year?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Yes, that's exactly right.

Vedula Murti
Millennium Management LLC

Okay. And it's only about 3 weeks to pitchers and catchers. So how are the Brewers?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Brewers are interesting. They're kind of reshuffling the deck a little bit, just signed a pitcher yesterday.
But I'm more focused right now on 41 and 6 for the Bucks.

And your last question -- I'm sorry, your next question comes from Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint.

Andrew Levi
ExodusPoint Capital Management, LP

So just kind of following Michael Weinstein's questions and just on kind of natural gas. I guess, and you've
kind of answered it already, but just -- also just in the context of like ESG and obviously, ESG seems not
to be favoring natural gas. So maybe just explain how you deal with that? And then separately, I agree
with everything that you had said earlier about nat gas. Just kind of looking at kind of the landscape. And
if you look at LDCs or companies that are very heavy natural gas, their stocks have not done as well of
late and the multiples have come down. And so I'm just wondering kind of where your head is at? And
at the right price, would you add gas distribution customers to your mix beyond what you have already?
Obviously, you have a large LDC in Illinois and a smaller one in Wisconsin.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, good question, Andy. You never say never, but let me put it this way. At the right price, obviously,
fitting the 3 criteria that we've talked about for acquisitions, I mean, we would always take a hard look.
I would, though, because you recognize if you're making an acquisition of any kind of company, LDC or
not, you're basically making a very long-term bet. Our assets, as you know, are very long-lived assets. So
would -- and I'm saying this just theoretically, if an LDC in Northern North Dakota came up for sale at the
right price, we probably would be a lot more interested in that than if it was in San Diego.

Andrew Levi
ExodusPoint Capital Management, LP

I understand. And just as far as ESG and how you kind of, you think maybe -- obviously, that's -- it's an
evolving idea or investment basis. Do you think as far as natural gas, they've gone for an update, but it
may not be the right way to look at it and there are other things to focus on, on the ESG side?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Well, again, a good question, Andy. My sense, and we've done dozens of ESG visits. Right now, and I
think for the foreseeable future, the ESG focus for infrastructure companies like ours seems to be heavily,
heavily focused on CO2 emissions and what your plan is to basically decarbonize the generation fleet. That
swamps any other kind of discussion that we've had with any ESG-oriented investor. And again, we've had
hundreds of these discussions over the course of the last couple of years. In fact, everyone now, whether
you are ESG-focused or not, everyone is beginning to ask ESG questions. But I would say that in 99 out
of 100 meetings, the real focus is on -- is really on CO2 emissions. And there, we've got a great story
to tell. The other thing that I would point out, and we're one of the first utilities in the country to set a
methane reduction goal. And I think you're going to be seeing -- because the climate scientists, as you
know, really believe that methane emissions are far, far more potent, perhaps 25x more potent than CO2
as a greenhouse gas, I think you're going to be seeing some increasing focus on methane emissions. And
there, the kind of upgrade work we're doing to modernize the natural gas distribution network, particularly
in Chicago, is really important. So those are the kind -- that's the flavor of what we're hearing in our ESG
visits today, Andy.

And your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So let me ask you something here. Just to follow-up on Vedula's question. The rabbi trust, if I understand
your answer, basically is offset by deferred comp expense. So there really isn't any net income benefit
of any significance you see driving earnings going forward or in terms of results for 2019? Am I
understanding you correctly?

Scott J. Lauber
Senior EVP & CFO

Correct. 2019 may have been an anomaly because we had so much O&M coming out of the utility that we
were into the sharing. But for the most part, there's no benefit from that at all. But it would have been a
small amount.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

And nothing, Paul, that we're planning on in terms of benefit for 2020.

WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Okay. And then in terms of Foxconn. There's some local articles about the Evers administration looking at
renegotiating the tax benefits because of, I guess, the way the Foxconn thing has been sort of rolling out.
And I was just wondering if you had anything to share on that? Or what does that mean in terms of the
outlook for the -- for Foxconn to economic development contributions that you guys have been expecting
last year.

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

Right. Good point. And let me just reiterate first what I mentioned in our prepared remarks, in that over
the past 2 years, Foxconn has invested already over $500 million in Wisconsin. I can tell you -- again,
I've said before, focus on what's going on in the campus rather than the media reports, but I can tell you,
I was actually with the Governor yesterday. He and I appeared together at an economic development
conference here in Milwaukee. And he went out of his way to say that he believes his responsibility is to
help make Foxconn successful in Wisconsin. So again, that's as of 9:30 yesterday morning and a very
definitive comment from the Governor himself.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. Great. And then just finally on the wind transaction with Google as the offtake. But that's for the life
of the project. Is that correct?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

That would be a 12-year offtake agreement.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

That's 12 years? Okay. And then just generally speaking, given the credit quality of Google and stuff,
just to make sure I understand this. The -- that's a better rate of return that you're getting. You guys
perceived -- you guys expect to get a better return associated with that project than what you're getting
in your regulated business? Do I understand your guys right on that?

Gale E. Klappa
Executive Chairman

You understand this absolutely correctly. And the experience that we've had so far with the other
infrastructure investments that are operational, the experience in 2019 is proving that out.

All right. Well, folks, that concludes our long conference call for today. Thank you so much for
participating. If you have any other questions, we're always available. Please contact Beth Straka at (414)
221-4639. Take care, everybody.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now
disconnect.
