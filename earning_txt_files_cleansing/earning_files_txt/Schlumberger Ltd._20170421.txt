Thank you, Patrick
Following the review of our first quarter results from Simon and Patrick, I will next provide you with an updated business outlook
But before I do that, I would like to say a few words about the Cameron Group as we just passed the 1-year mark since the closing of the transaction
Over the past 12 months, we have successfully implemented the first phase of our integration plan, which included 3 main themes: first, the colocation of 1,700 employees into joint facilities around the world; second, combining Schlumberger and Cameron businesses to deliver enhanced offerings to our customers, such as our new Testing & Process systems product line; and third, bringing together Cameron and Schlumberger technologies, for instance, in hydraulic fracturing and in OneDrill and by launching as many as 32 integrated R&D projects to further expand our integrated technology offering
At the same time, OneSubsea, which is now in its fifth year of existence, has firmly established a leadership position in the subsea market through the pore-to-pipeline approach, as seen by the higher rate of project awards in recent quarters as well as their industry-leading operating margins
Overall, the entire Cameron integration program has exceeded the ambitious first year of synergy target we set and delivered approximately $400 million in operating income synergies as well as $600 million in new orders
The first quarter results from the Cameron Group were, again, very solid
And I would like to complement the entire Cameron organization and the integration team on a job well done, where they have jointly ensured that the largest transaction Schlumberger has done to date has turned out to be a great success
Turning next to the business outlook
We maintain our constructive view of the oil market, and we made further inventory growth in the second quarter, driven by the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts put in place in January
At present, the region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is North America land, although investment levels in the Middle East and Russia are also expected to remain resilient this year
However, for the rest of the world, which still make up more than 50 million barrels per day of oil production, we are heading towards a third year of significant underinvestment, which increases the likelihood of a medium-term supply deficit as produced reserves are not replaced in sufficient volume
In particular, the market continues to focus on headline decline numbers that suggest that production is holding up well, while a closer examination of the underlying data clearly shows that the rate of depletion of proved undeveloped reserves is rapidly accelerating in several key non-OPEC countries
The current level of underinvestments is most visible in exploration, where the record-low investments, including both drilling and seismic, led to a total amount of industry discoveries of less than 5 billion barrels in 2016 versus a produced volume of over 30 billion barrels, dropping the industry-wide reserves-to-replacement ratio to 32%
Still at present, there is no clear sign of any general increase in exploration spend, with the one exception being Mexico, where we are seeing an increasing interest in the offshore multiclient surveys we have acquired over the past two years
Looking next at our business outlook by region
The recovery will clearly be led by North America land, where investment levels are expected to increase by 50% in 2017, leading to a strong increase in activity and an overdue correction to service and product pricing
Through the organic and inorganic investments we had made in our North America land business in recent years, we are very well set up to take a leading position in serving our customers in the coming growth cycle
In drilling, we have built a market-leading position by expanding our offering through the Smith and M-I SWACO acquisitions and through a broad organic R&D program targeting the North America land market
As drilling complexity continues to increase with even longer laterals, our purpose design technologies are starting to have a significant impact on our customers’ drilling performance
One example of this is the strong uptake of our AxeBlade drillbit, which by itself has demonstrated a record 35% increase in rate of penetration for Matador in the Permian
Furthermore, our PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable technology continues to be sold out for a third successive quarter and in an 80-well campaign for Parsley Energy in the Midland and Delaware basins
This technology contributed to a 17% reduction in the average drilling time per well and a 30% reduction in the drilling cost per lateral foot
Both of these examples show the performance potential new technologies hold in the North America land market and demonstrate the growth opportunities for our drilling offering as we continue to prepare for the introduction of our OneDrill platform in the second half of this year
We are also starting to see strong growth momentum in North America land for our market-leading Artificial Lift offering, where we recently also acquired a 49.9% stake in the HEAL technology from Production Plus Energy Services based in Calgary
HEAL, which can be used in wells together with our ESP plunger lift and rod lift offering, reduces fluid slugging, depresses form generation, contains solid and separates gas, which altogether improves production and reduces the need for workovers
We are presently at the introduction stage of this exciting new technology, which, over the first 140 installations, have delivered an average production increase of 45%
Within our hydraulic fracturing and completions offering, we have also made significant investments in recent years, including the development of a fully automated surface delivery system and also by acquiring our own sand mines and the associated vertically integrated distribution system, which will greatly improve our full-cycle returns
In terms of well productivity, the market offtake of our geoengineered completions continues to grow, and the offering is delivering significant value for our customers, as seen by the 18-well program we recently completed for Lonestar Resources in the Eagle Ford Shale
Here, we optimize drilling, stimulation and completion plans across the long laterals, supported by our drillbit formation BroadBand Sequence diversion technology
As a result, the wells produced up to 86% more hydrocarbon per 1,000 feet of lateral compared to offset wells in two other fields
With proppant prices and distribution costs now starting to rapidly increase, we are also expecting to see a recovery in the use of our HiWAY technology, which reduces proppant use by 40% and water use by 25%
Building on this broad technology platform, the pending OneStim JV with Weatherford will give us the required scale in terms of both hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions technologies to drive efficiency and market penetration in all the unconventional basins in North America land
At this stage, the regulatory filings have been completed
And as we await the required approvals to close the OneStim transaction, the integration teams are making all the necessary preparations for a successful day 1 of the new company
Looking next at Latin America
The flat sequential revenue in the first quarter was a long-awaited positive confirmation that this market has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle
Going forward, there are emerging positive signs for our business in the region, including opportunities for new commercial models in Brazil as Petrobras continues its assets divestment program and as a new focus is brought to mature land basins
In Argentina, new plans to bring stability to natural gas prices should lead to higher investment levels
And we are also excited about our recent agreement with YPF for a joint development in the Vaca Muerta Shale
In Europe, CIS and Africa, we see strengthening activity in the North Sea, Russia and the Caspian region in the coming quarters as the winter season ends and new projects start up
In Africa, we expect some activity improvement in the North as we start up a small-scale land operation in Libya after being shut down for the past three years
While we see a slow but steady improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa over the coming quarters, driven by a mix of land activity in Chad, Congo and Ethiopia and a limited number of deepwater start-ups in Congo, Guinea and the Ivory Coast
In the Middle East, activity will continue to be driven by the GCC countries
However, we do not expect significant sequential growth from this region over the coming quarters
While in Asia, we will see the normal seasonal recovery in China
Overall, it’s clear that activity in the international market has reached bottom in all regions
But even though we see positive signs in many countries, we expect only moderate sequential activity growth in the coming quarters
This slower recovery, lingering pricing pressure, means that we will likely face another challenging year in the international markets while we expect an acceleration of the activity growth towards the back end of 2017 and into 2018. With this market backdrop, we continue to actively position Schlumberger at the forefront of an industry that needs to evolve
We do this by proactively managing our base business and responding to ongoing pressures of commoditization by tailoring our offering, resources and service performance to changing market conditions
In parallel, we constantly look to expand our opportunity set in a period where the industry, in many ways, lacks overall direction
This includes driving a broad and very active M&A program, engaging with existing and new customers to establish closer collaboration and more aligned business models and also expanding our offering from technical support to now also taking a financial position alongside our customers in applicable projects, all with the aim of generating more activity for our 19 product lines
As we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for the industry players that are ready and able to think new and to act new
Thank you
With that, we will open up for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Good afternoon
So given that you guys are holding your call from the Kingdom, the board meeting was held in the Kingdom as well, I’d love to hear kind of what – as you and the board talk about strategic focus over the next several quarters but also several years and talk about the implementation of those strategies, what are the key kind of top 1, 2, 3 items that you or that Schlumberger is most focused on in the near-term and especially given your broad international focus? And I think we understand where you stand in North America
Well, if you are asking about in particular in Saudi Arabia, let me first say that the board has spent actually a full week in Saudi Arabia, in between Jeddah, Riyadh, Shaybah and Dhahran
We have visited the KAUST University, a range of government institutions focused on science, technology and innovation
And of course, we spent a lot of time with our largest customer, Saudi Aramco, both at their headquarters in Dhahran and then in their field operations in the South in Shaybah
Now the board had a particular interest in broadening its understanding of both the Vision 2030 for the country as well as the In-Kingdom Total Value Add program, which is also very important, and in particular, how Schlumberger continues to actively support these programs and also how we further strengthen our position in the kingdom
Now as part of our visit, we also have the privilege of meeting His Excellency, Khalid Al-Falih, to discuss the state of the oil market, which was also very useful for our board to do
Now everywhere we went, we had been met by exceptional hospitality, and the board was actually very impressed with everything that we saw and everything that is going on in the kingdom
So this has really served as a further extension of our understanding of all the details that was going on in the country, and that is helping both the board and the senior management team, which was also here to further adjust and, I would say, accelerate our plans of investment in the country
Yes
So just to be clear on what the fund is, so this is a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers
And this is basically to enable closer collaboration and alignment with our customers
It is also there to facilitate and support additional E&P investments and also for us, very importantly, to secure preferred supplier agreements for our products and services for whatever these investments that we facilitate
So this is the overall driver behind it
Now we understand that many of our customers do not see a need for this, but some customers do, and the key principle for us that this fund and these investment opportunities is open to all customers
So the basic thing here is that it’s simply aiming to enable growth and in the base business
Now the scope of the fund, again, is relatively open
We will evaluate each project based on its stand-alone merits
We haven’t, at this stage, set the limits for the size of the fund
But I think importantly as well, they are also open to possibly co-invest with third parties
And obviously, the fund will be subject to the same, I would say, governance and risk management processes that we have for the base business, and ultimately, all the investment decisions will be approved by our CFO
So it’s something that is in place to facilitate further growth for the base business
I think that’s the best summary of it
Thank you, James
Good morning
Yes
I think we need to separate the JV from our current hydraulic fracturing business in North America land
The JV will obviously include all that business when it’s closed
But as of now, we continue to manage our business in a stand-alone fashion while we are preparing obviously to close the JV as soon as possible
So I will comment briefly on our plans for activation of capacity for the base business today, and I’ll have Patrick give a few comments around the OneStim JV and the plans post-closure
So if you look at the situation today on our fracking business, we’ve always said that as soon as we have a clear pathway towards profitability, we will start actively reactivating our idle capacity
This point in time – actually past in the first quarter, so towards the back end of the first quarter, we actually started actively reactivating our idle capacity
And this process is going to accelerate in the second quarter and also going into H2. So based on the current plan we have at this stage, we plan to have our entire idle capacity from the Schlumberger side deployed during the fourth quarter of this year
So this is the current plan of reactivation
We are getting, I would say, significant traction on pricing
We are actively hiring people both for the wellsite operations and for the vertical integration part, including the transportation side of things as well
And I think the balance we have between the insourcing of our vertical supply chain, together with still a very close working relationship with our suppliers – and just to be clear, we are not looking to fully vertically integrate
We will have a certain amount of our capacity vertically integrated, and we will continue also to work closely with our suppliers, both on the sand mine side as well as transportation and distribution
So we will continue now in the coming quarters to actively redeploy
And obviously, when we close the OneStim JV, these resources and these businesses will all be combined in OneStim, which will then just continue on the same process
So Patrick, you want to say a few words about where we stand on OneStim and plans?
Patrick, do you want to cover that?
Next question
Well, I’ll say, going back to what I mentioned about the fund, Ole, the fund itself is there to facilitate growth in the base business
So the way we look at the fund is that if we do make investments alongside our customers, these investments will need to meet the return criteria that we have overall as a company and also the base business that we get associated with the project
Through preferred supplier agreements, we’d also obviously need to meet the same return criteria
So I think the way to look at the fund is that we have a strong balance sheet
We have strong cash flow, and we have a fair bit of cash on hand
And what we are doing on a selective basis is looking for investment opportunities to facilitate more base business for the company
Our revenues are still at around 50% of what they were eight, nine quarters ago
And we are trying very actively to make sure that we can get baseline growth not just in North America land, but also globally
And given the capability set we have as a company, in particular around subsurface understanding and drilling and completions, we see this as a very good way of a thing to drive, I would say, short and medium-term activity
But very importantly, these contracts that we enter into here could have durations of 10 to 15 to 20 years, which will also provide us with a very good baseline of activity and earnings throughout the coming cycles as well
So I don’t think there should be a huge reason for concern around the capital intensity
We have capital available to invest, and we are trying to invest this wisely into projects that have good returns stand-alone but also that facilitates growth opportunities for the base business
Patrick, why don’t you talk about Cameron? I’ll cover Borr when you’re done with that
So Ole, let me just comment quickly on Borr then
So – and as you’ve seen, we made a $221 million investment to take a 20% stake in this new company
There are several drivers behind the investment, but the main driver is really to create a platform where we can collaborate closely with Borr to offer performance drilling offshore in shallow water
We see this as, I think, a significant opportunity for Schlumberger and also for Borr to offer this new type of contract model, which is now heavily used on land but also now to be used in shallow water
Just for the record, we are also open to work with other and offer drillers on the similar type of performance contracts
Now back to Borr, Borr also represents a significant potential market for Cameron drilling, both in terms of BOP, sand and drilling packages
And I would say lastly, looking at the company and the plans going forward, we also expect this to be a very good financial investment
So this is the main rationale behind investment
Thank you, Ole
That’s a good question
So I would kind of split it into 2. When it comes to the onetime cost of reactivating, yes, we will have some impact of that in the coming quarters
I would say the – but the underlying incrementals that we’re aiming for is going to be around this level
But we will be subject to some additional activation costs, I would say in the – probably in the second and the third quarter, which might, for those 2 quarters, basically deliver slightly lower incrementals overall
But the underlying, I would say, drive we have between getting customer price increases and driving efficiency through scale as we reactivate and also managing our supply chain, underlying, we are aiming for those type of incrementals, which we have talked about for the company for the past couple of years
We will have some headwinds around onetime reactivation costs in the coming quarters
But beyond that, we are looking to manage at this level
And first of all, let me just clarify that we have several SPM projects in Ecuador
And the issues we are discussing are only pertaining to Shushufindi, right?
Now just to give you some background on Shushufindi, we are now in the fifth successful year of operations there
And in between the Shushufindi Consortium, which we lead, and Petroamazonas, the state oil company, we have a very solid governance model, and we have annual budgets and annual production targets, which are set and agreed
And if you go back for these 5 years, we have exceeded all these production targets
But what has happened is that with the lower oil price, this has led to cash flow challenges for Petroamazonas
And they are also selling the oil that we produce from the Shushufindi field
So they are basically then falling behind on our payments, and this is really the key issue
So the proposal they have made to address the payment issues is not acceptable, and the situation over the first quarter has been further aggravated by the fact that they have imposed also production constraints on the outputs from the Shushufindi field
So bottom line, we find this treatment of a partner, who has made significant investments in the country, somewhat disappointing
But still, we are very confident that the issues are going to be resolved, either amicably by – or by using the dispute resolution provisions that are in the contract
So that’s kind of where we are
How long it’s going to take to get it resolved, I can’t say at this stage
But we are ready to sit down again and continue discussions, and there have been a number of meetings and discussions over the past couple of months
We are ready to continue these discussions as soon as the imposed production constraints are lifted
Yes
So I wouldn’t use the word weakness, David
I think the – we have a slight decline in overall activity and revenue in the Middle East
Obviously all declines in Asia that weighs in on the overall EMEA numbers
So I don’t think there’s anything that concerns or so worries us that should concern or worry you
But we are not seeing any significant growth in the coming quarters
We are slightly down, like I said, sequentially [indiscernible]
This is more around, I would say, project mix…
…priorities and so forth, right? So I would say the underlying business in the Middle East is very resilient
There are strong and clear plans in each of the countries we operate here
And so no major worries
It’s just that there is no, I would say, significant steady sequential growth either in Q1 or in the coming quarters, just a very steady resilient base business
Yes, we see the same as you
And so there hasn’t – so far of significant FIDs, plans being discussed of the things going on offshore
We – if you look at jack-up utilization, I think there is a slight uptick on it
So I think there’s probably some early signs that we’ll get some light work coming our way as an industry in the next couple of quarters
But in terms of bigger projects, I agree with you, we haven’t seen anything yet
So I think the main thing here is, I think for the IOC customers to basically get a better medium-term view on oil prices, and obviously, the positive uptick we’ve seen over the past couple of quarters is a good thing
But I would assume that I’m also looking for what the floor could be and maybe awaiting potentially what OPEC is going to do as we go into the May – the late May meeting around whether they extend the production cuts or not
So I agree with you
I think the increase in offshore activity or shallow water activity is probably more going to be a second half of the year event, leading into 2018. So with that, though, it’s still very important for us as a company to at least secure the work that is coming out of projects that are being FID-ed
And that’s why we are very happy and excited, the fact that we landed the Mad Dog 2 project, for instance
Thank you
Good morning, Jim
Okay
Well, I think first of all, the multistage completion offering that Weatherford brings into the JV and also combined with ours will have a complete range of both open-hole and cased-hole solutions
Now if you look at where the market has been heading, I would say in the last 3, 4, 5 years, it has been gradually moving more and more to plug-and-perf with less, I would say, open-hole completions and sliding sleeves
There’s still more of that type of completions in Canada compared to what you have in U.S
So I would say that we are basically set up for – if the market continues the current trend towards more plug-and-perf in cased hole or whether there is a reemergence of the open hole, right? So I think we have a very good balance, and we can go either way
I think it’s going to come down to well performance productivity and completion costs in terms of what’s going to govern this, but we are adjusted well in either way, Jim
Thank you
Thank you very much
Well, there – and there, the question came
Well, I would say that in the second quarter, first of all, at the high level, we are expecting to see a continuation of the main trends that we saw in the first quarter
And then if you break our North America and international, for North America, we expect solid top line growth in Q3. And this is going to be driven, again, by what we saw in Q1 as well: further growth in the rig activity; for us, additional pricing and market share gains in directional drilling; and also, as we talked about earlier on the call, an acceleration of the capacity reactivation in fracking
Now underlying incremental margins, as I commented on earlier, should be solid
But in Q2 and probably Q3 as well, they’re going to be partly offset by some of these onetime start-up costs that we are having
And also, in the second quarter, we are as usual also footing the cost of the Canadian breakup
But overall, I would say strong top line growth and decent earnings growth for us in North America in the second quarter, with some small headwinds around the start-up costs
Internationally, as I said earlier, we have reached bottom in all markets
But for the second quarter, we only see, at this stage, flat underlying activity in Q2. So the – really, the only growth that we are going to see in the second quarter is going to be limited to the seasonal recovery in the North Sea, Russia and China
Now on the Cameron side, revenue is also expected to be more or less flat, where we are seeing solid growth in the short-cycle businesses of surface and V&M
But this is going to be offset by the slowing decline now in the long-cycle businesses of OneSubsea and drilling
So if you combine all of these, I believe that a sequential EPS growth of around 15% to 20% between Q1 and Q2 is a reasonable expectation
Yes
I would say, like I said, the underlying activity internationally, Q2 isn’t showing any great signs of improving
But we will have at least the seasonal recovery in some of the key markets to help us
In terms of the pricing, we are still seeing continued pricing pressure on new tenders, but at the same time, some of this, we are looking to offset by exiting our unsustainable contracts
We still have some of these contracts that we are looking to resolve either by shutting the contract down or by getting the pricing increases that we need in order to make this a viable business proposition for us
So yes, I would say in principle, the Q1 should be the low end of earnings for the year in international market, with still only limited growth in Q2 but more of an acceleration in the second half of the year
Well, the investments in the equity of Borr Drilling should bring a return on investment or capital employed, which is accretive to the company
That’s why we made the company – that’s why we made the investments
And for future investments, that’s, again, what we are going to look for when we spend cash on this type of investments
Hand in hand with that is also obviously the revenue opportunity that this brings
And with this, like I said, we’re going to focus in on two things
With that big fleet of jack-ups, this is a very good market potential for Cameron drilling, but even more importantly, what we are really driving at here is to introduce performance drilling in the offshore markets
So this is just one example
But when we make these investments, there will be synergies and business opportunities and revenue opportunities associated with them
The investments will stand on their own 2 feet, and we aim for them to be accretive to our return on capital employed for the company
But they all need to be associated with the business opportunities for the rest of the company
Thank you
Well, obviously, if you look at the commercial environment at this stage versus the commercial environment three years ago when the project that we are currently executing were bid, it’s obviously more challenging
So to think that we can, I would say, achieve the exactly same margins on these latest projects that we are currently delivering on OneSubsea, that might be challenging
But I would say for all the bids that we are making and the contracts that we ultimately secure, we have very clear return expectations on them, somewhat lower than what OneSubsea is currently operating at
But we are still looking for this to be a very good business for us going forward, and continuous improvement – for instance, OneSubsea is showing and the plans they have in place going forward as well to even further improve the way they execute projects
There should also be opportunities for the projects we bid and secure at this phase to have potentially margin upsides as we go forward
So it’s a tough business, but I would say I’m very pleased with how OneSubsea is navigating the commercial environment and also executing and delivering on the projects that we take on
Well, we – as we said earlier, we will continue to be reporting them, announcing them separately for the year
But starting next year, we will drop this
This is normally our style
For the first year after the acquisition, we continue to incur them and announce them
And from there on, they become part of our ongoing run rate of cost
Thank you, Waqar
So just before we close this morning, I’d like to summarize the three most important points that we’ve discussed
First, the only region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is North America land, where activity has been growing for the last few quarters
And in line with our profitable growth strategy, we have begun redeploying our idle capacity in pressure pumping, and we will accelerate this in the second quarter
Through the organic and inorganic investments we had made in our North America land business over the past seven years, we are very well positioned to take a leading customers as they expand their activity in the coming year
Second, the performance of our international areas in the first quarter confirmed our belief that activity has now reached bottom in all regions
And although we see positive signs in many countries, both on land and offshore, we expect only moderate sequential growth over the coming quarters
The slower speed of recovery, together with the lingering pricing pressure, means that we expect another challenging year in the international markets in 2017 before a clearer acceleration of activity in 2018. And third, as we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for the industry players that are ready to think new and to act new
Thank you very much for listening in
