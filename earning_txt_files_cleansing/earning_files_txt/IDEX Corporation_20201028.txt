IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Greetings and welcome to IDEX Corporation's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Yates. Thank you. You may begin.

Michael John Yates
VP & Chief Accounting Officer

Great. Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting
Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining our discussion of the IDEX third
quarter 2020 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial
and operating performance for the 3 months ending September 30, 2020. The press release, along with
the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at
www.idexcorp.com.

Joining me today is Andy Silvernail and Bill Grogan. Additionally, Eric Ashleman, our President and recently
announced CEO of IDEX, will be joining us as well.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Before we dive into our -- Mike? Before we dive into our
third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment and talk about the leadership transition we announced
yesterday. After 12 wonderful years at IDEX and nearly a decade as Chief Executive Officer, I'm stepping
down as Chairman and CEO in mid-December. I'm delighted that the Board of Directors has selected our
President and COO, Eric Ashleman, as IDEX's new CEO effective December 15, 2020. Eric is a uniquely
capable leader who was a clear choice for the role. He and I have worked closely together since I joined
IDEX. We worked side-by-side to establish our strategy, build our culture and deliver value for all of our
stakeholders. Eric brings extensive knowledge of our business, deep insights into our markets and a
passion for bringing out the best of our people.

My decision comes after deep reflection. Leaving IDEX has been the greatest privilege of my career. It's
a significantly different company today than when I joined in 2009. We've accelerated our transformation
from an acquisition-based holding company into a high-performing global enterprise that improves lives on
a daily basis. With this strong foundation, IDEX is positioned for continued growth and value creation.

So it's a good time for change for 2 reasons. First, IDEX is ready. We've led a remarkable company
through this pandemic crisis. Our mission has never mattered more. Our culture and financial position
have never been stronger and our team has never been more capable. To that end, we're fortunate to
have Eric as the next IDEX CEO. He's a proven leader who has delivered excellence for our shareholders
and our broad stakeholders for the past 13 years.

Second, I'm ready. For the last couple of years, many of you have asked me about my career thoughts.
I've always said that I love IDEX, but I thought 10 years is about the right shelf life for a public company
CEO. I could never have dreamed what we would accomplish over this span. We've built an organization
that advances and saves lives of millions of people around the globe. We have created a highly engaged
organization that is among the best in the world. We've impacted our communities through compassion
and generosity with the support of the IDEX Foundation, and we have delivered for our owners, producing
total shareholder return of greater than 530%. For me, personally, I'm excited for a new phase of life that
brings along new challenges and opportunities for me and my family. I'm going to become Chairman, CEO
and an owner of Madison Industries, one of the world's largest private companies. This new opportunity
offers a chance to build another great organization and make positive change in the world over a very

IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

long horizon. I'm confident now is the right time to pass the torch and welcome IDEX's next generation of
leadership.

On a personal note, Eric has been a true partner and a dear friend to me. And I'm confident that this
transition to CEO will be seamless for our company, employees and all of our stakeholders. As this is my
last earnings call, I want to say how grateful I am to have worked alongside our incredibly talented team
in the last 12 years. It has been an honor to serve as Chairman and CEO and to be part of a company
like IDEX. I also want to thank all of our investors and analysts on the phone who are with us today for
the support through the years. The future of IDEX is very bright. We have reached new levels of industry
leadership and sustained value creation, and we will do so again under Eric as our CEO.

As Mike mentioned, Eric is joining Bill and I for the earnings call. Bill and I will walk through our
assessment and analysis and view of the future as we normally do. We'll then turn to Q&A, and Eric will
join the conversation and talk about the future. I'll now turn to our results for the third quarter.

We continued to see a strong sequential rebound in orders with September 2020 topping the same month
last year. That's a good sign. I want to thank all of our people around the globe who have risen to the
occasion. In a year no one could have predicted, our people continue to shine. So to all of the IDEX team
members listening on this call, thank you.

A time like this truly tests the culture of a company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live
and believe? If so, you'll be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is this kind of company, and
it's serving us well. Because of the protocols we put in place, the disruptions we've seen in our operations
have been limited. We have protected our people within the workplace, and we will do so even if the
COVID trends are moving in the wrong way.

We continue to focus on solving our customers' greatest challenges, many of which have shifted this
year. That has reinforced the need to stay close to our customers even when we have to remain socially
distanced to understand their needs. Bill will walk through the details shortly. But as you've seen, our
organic sales were down 12% year-over-year, falling at the better end of our predicted range. Importantly,
organic orders were down only 5% and continued to improve sequentially, a trend that is continuing in
October.

Being a diversified company helps a great deal in times like these. While certain sectors like energy
continue to struggle, other aspects of the economy are booming. This diversity gives us strength, limiting
our exposure to any one sector. The financial controls we put in place early continue to serve us well.
We are delivering strong profitability and exceptional cash flow. As we have pivoted to growth, we have
ramped up our capital spending and investment to support some really exciting initiatives. We've also seen
activity in the M&A market start to pick up. While those pillars of safety, business continuity and liquidity
are all still part of our pandemic operating focus, it is time to aggressively play offense.

I'm turning to Slide 7. That increased focus on playing offense has us involved in some exciting new
opportunities. A variety of our businesses are producing new solutions for cleaning and disinfecting public
spaces. One shining example is a sprayer that uses electrostatically charged particles to envelop a surface,
not just hit the side facing the sprayer. We anticipate solutions like this will continue to be in demand, not
just during this pandemic, but for years to come, as public demand for cleaning and disinfection will be
forever changed by this period of time.

We also have an exciting new opportunity to partner with customers to develop a highly accurate point-
of-care solution for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Our IDEX Health & Science team is hard at work
ramping up with public health experts increasingly predicting that the coronavirus will be like influenza,
remaining in circulation even after vaccines are widely available. We anticipate this will be a significant
new program for our company for the foreseeable future. I'll share more about that in a moment.

We also continue to see machines used in production of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. In-sourcing
critical API manufacturing is a key initiative for several countries. And last quarter, we shared how our
Microfluidizer processors are a key technology for manufacturing vaccine adjuvants. Vaccine adjuvants
are an immune stimulator added to many vaccines commonly used today. By using adjuvants in a

IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

vaccine, the body can often produce a better immune response to the antigen while also allowing vaccine
manufacturers to be able to produce more doses of vaccine with less antigen. Our team was excited
to recently deliver machines for use in producing advanced supplies of one of the leading vaccines in
testing today. We are also working actively with other vaccine manufacturers as the world prepares for
unprecedented rates for production and distribution of this critical piece of the puzzle for solving the
COVID-19 crisis.

I'm moving to Slide 8. In Health & Science, our products are being used to help and enable rapid, highly
accurate testing for COVID-19. Our thinXXS microfluidic cartridges are a key technology used to diagnose
COVID-19 infection in the point-of-care molecular market, which allows testing to be done near the patient
versus being sent to a laboratory. Our technology enables the miniaturization of complex laboratory
workflows by integrating pumps, valves, sample, reagent management and signal detection in order to
provide a simple workflow for the operator of the instrument. This instrument operator only needs to add
the patient sample to the cartridge, insert it in the instrument and then push a button to run the test.
Our microfluidics capabilities allow for high-volume production and consistent repeatable results that are
needed to combat COVID-19.

In addition, IH&S has optical filters and several diagnostics instruments that are used for COVID-19
testing. We provide various critical components designed in in vitro diagnostic instruments used for
COVID-19. We have the gassers, pumps, manifolds, and fluidic connections in these IVD instruments that
typically analyze blood samples. We also have both optics and fluidics assemblies and next-generation
DNA sequencers being used to analyze COVID-19 to better understand the virus and track its spread. I'm
proud of how our businesses have answered the call over the past 2 quarters and work closely with our
customers to innovate and deliver critical solutions to the marketplace.

All right. I'm moving to Slide 9. We provided an update on the state of our primary end markets. We
saw sequential improvement in most of our end markets with some of our more challenged markets,
including auto and dispensing, recovering faster than we anticipated. In Fluid & Metering, the broader
industrial softness and the volatility in oil and gas has continued, though we did see a pickup in daily order
rates in the month of September, which provides optimism as we close out the year and we head into
2021. The significant capital investment by our customers continues to be on hold, pending a broader
market recovery and reduction in global economic uncertainty. Our water business has continued to
show resiliency, impacted only by timing delays in some municipal projects. As we called out last quarter,
agriculture has performed well as growing optimism and investment held up in the quarter.

In Health & Science, semicon has continued to outpace our expectations and was strong sequentially
and year-over-year. Our sealing business recovered nicely in the quarter due to the resumption of
activity in the auto market. Additionally, the product innovations I discussed earlier helped generate
positive momentum for us in multiple end markets, including industrial. On the other side, in analytical
instrumentation and some aspects of IVD/BIO, we continue to see that as medical industry is focused
on COVID-19, other investments in lab equipment were delayed, and we've not yet seen the activity
materially pick up.

Moving to Fire & Safety/Diversified. We saw sequential improvement in most of our markets. Recovery
in auto and retail were big stories, driving a rebound in our BAND-IT and dispensing businesses. Fire &
Rescue continued to see strong performance, but we have been impacted by production delays at OEMs,
pushing projects out and extending lead times for municipal deliveries. Backlog in these businesses
continue to be strong, and we're working closely with our customers to monitor delivery schedules and
assess the impact of COVID-19 on future year municipal budgets. Previously funded projects continue to
go and demand for our new products in these businesses has been strong.

We are overall optimistic about the market recovery we've seen in the third quarter and we continue to
believe that the diversified nature of our businesses has helped mitigate the impact of the global economic
decline. Our dedication to our customers and ability to respond and innovate quickly has continued to
generate momentum for us to combat market declines. As we head into the fourth quarter, we expect to
see a pickup in order rates, particularly in our day rate businesses, as an indicator of further recovery.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

Okay. I'm moving to Slide 10. I want to provide some additional context to the organic order trends we've
seen over the past 2 quarters. We saw a broad rebound in order rates in the third quarter, recovering from
organic declines in as much as 23% in the second quarter to organic growth in the month of September.
All of our segments participated in this trend. FMT organic orders improved each month, driven by
strength in agriculture and stabilization in industrial as well as a slight pickup in energy. HST was driven
by recovery in the auto market and targeted new product initiatives as well as the positive momentum in
semicon and pharma that I mentioned earlier.

Finally, Diversified's organic orders saw dramatic improvements at BAND-IT and dispensing as auto and
aerospace businesses opened back up and capital spending returned in the paying markets. On top of the
year-over-year improvements, we also experienced sequential increases with FMT, up 12%; HST, up 6%;
and FSD, up 11% versus the second quarter.

With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter.

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 12. Q3 orders of $570 million were
down 3% overall and 5% organically. As Andy just mentioned, we saw a broad bounce-back in order rates
across our businesses and monthly sequential improvement in organic order rates throughout the quarter.
Third quarter sales of $581 million were down 7% overall and down 12% organically. Industrial energy
markets remained challenged in the quarter and were the main contributors of the organic declines. As
mentioned before, we saw a recovery in the auto and dispensing markets as well as continued strength
in semi and pharma that helped offset those headwinds. Coupled with the benefit of new applications and
innovations we have made in response to COVID-19, we're able to drive organic sales to the top end of
our previous estimate.

Q3 adjusted gross margin declined 190 basis points to 43.3% primarily driven by lower volume, the
dilutive impact of acquisitions and business mix, partially offset by price and the continued impact of
cost control actions we have taken. Gross margin was up 70 basis points sequentially versus the second
quarter.

Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, down 210 basis points from the prior year, mainly
driven by lower volume leverage and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring actions
and discretionary cost controls. We also saw sequential improvement in op margin, increasing 200 basis
points from Q2.

Our Q3 effective tax rate was 14.4%, which was lower than the 18.6% in the prior year due to discrete
benefits associated with the recent changes to the global intangible low tax income regulations. This was
a multiyear true-up going back to the start of tax reform and will only have a minor benefit on our rate
going forward.

Third quarter adjusted net income was $106 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.40, down $0.12 or
8% compared to prior year EPS. When compared to our second quarter year-to-date tax rate, the reduced
ETR increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.11 in the quarter.

Finally, free cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, down 7% compared to the prior year and was
128% of net income, a conversion rate higher than last year. The strong performance was a result of the
significant focus and discipline on working capital management. The teams continue to drive our DSO
lower and improve our past due rate as well as increase our inventory turns. We continue to demonstrate
our ability to drive cash flow conversion in excess of net income.

Moving on to Slide 13. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we continue to take the necessary
steps to manage cost to mitigate the significant impact of reduced volume. Our adjusted operating
income declined $23 million in the quarter. With organic sales down $75 million, we would have expected
a negative impact on operating income of approximately $45 million at a roughly 60% contribution
margin. This $45 million was offset by $25 million of executed operational initiatives; $7 million from the
impact of restructuring actions taken in Q4 of last year and the second quarter of this year; $13 million

of discretionary cost control items; and $5 million of price and net productivity that was partially offset
by $6 million of negative product and business mix primarily associated with FMT. The $13 million of
discretionary cost actions in the quarter was lower compared to the $15 million we referenced last quarter
primarily due to modest increases in spend to support and service our customers as well as some targeted
investments we made in growth initiatives.

Overall, our teams continue to do an exceptional job of managing cost to mitigate revenue declines. As
Andy discussed earlier, we have ensured that we are well positioned to pivot to offense and continue to
invest in initiatives to generate growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn it back
over to Andy to summarize our Q4 expectations and provide some final thoughts.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Bill. I'm on Slide 14, everyone. As I mentioned earlier, we are firmly what I have called
Phase III of the pandemic response, living with the virus. I'm proud of how our teams have adapted and
innovated in this environment. Our teams have embraced our mission and our values and have been
diligent in executing our COVID-19 playbook. We maintain optimism that the market recovery we've
experienced will continue, and we've seen the benefit of the proactive steps we took at the end of last
year and throughout the early phases of the pandemic, positioning IDEX to remain strong while taking
advantage of new opportunities.

We expect that revenue in the fourth quarter will be down between 3% and 5% organically based on our
current backlog position and expected daily order rates. We are in close contact with our customer base
and we continue to look for signs of confidence in capital spending that will be the catalyst for sustained
recovery. We continue to make strategic investments in our business to support further long-term growth.
We remain disciplined in our effort to manage costs.
To conclude, this quarter was a great display of the strength of the IDEX business model from the
resiliency of our base business to our ability to respond to challenges quickly and deliver innovative
solutions to our customers. I continue to remain optimistic about our prospects to come and think about
coming out of this crisis even stronger than when we entered it with new opportunities for growth on the
horizon. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats to Eric, and we wish Andy all the best of luck.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Deane.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Thank you, Deane.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

First question would be for Eric. And look, no one should be surprised that you were picked to take the
helm based upon your role as COO for a number of years and most recently as President. So you've
had the opportunity to be part of the leadership team for a number of years, but you've also had the
opportunity to make your own assessment about the opportunities at IDEX. So I'd be really interested in
hearing, just at the outset, what kinds of changes might you be considering or just at least the areas of
focus that you think you would be taking initially. And I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about your commitment
to the 80/20 business system.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Sure. Sure. Thank you, Deane. It's great to talk with you, and great to talk with everybody here. I'm
excited to get going. Look, I think as we think about focus and priorities, I want to make sure that we all
appreciate that this is a story of continuity alongside purposeful evolution. So I have worked for Andy for
12 years. Everyday he's been part of IDEX, I've essentially reported to him.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

And for the last 5 years, I've served as the COO of the company. And so side by side, I mean, we have
been partners in all the major decisions that we've made along the way that have evolved the company to
where we are today. And that certainly includes 80/20. I mean that is at the cornerstone of what we call
the IDEX Difference. And so maybe less appreciated is the evolution, the organizational evolution that's
happened alongside all of that.

So in these 5 years, I mean, we've been very, very deliberate to work on developing other voices that are
now part of the senior team and have been. Frankly, our group executives joined our senior team over a
year ago. And I looked down the table here at Bill. Bill was my original operating partner in finance. So
this is a team effort. It has been a team effort. And so the strategy that's in my head is the same one that
we've been working on all these years. Now that being said, look, the world is definitely in a dynamic spot
now.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

There's a pandemic in front of us. There's things like digitalization that are happening all over the place,
and we've got to think of things like aggressive capital deployment and how we're going to work all of that
in this environment. So those priorities were here before. This day, they remain very firmly in front of me
as we go forward. And I absolutely am an advocate of 80/20, it's a way of thinking as much as it's a part
of the operating model.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's great to hear. And just second question would be more along the lines of the issues at hand, and
I'm especially interested in getting some more color on these COVID business products and service
opportunities. I know you've sized it at $25 million to $100 million. Maybe you can give us some additional
color about the potential time to revenue. And will this all be organic in terms of the investment? Might
there be any JVs, acquisitions along the way? But if you can start with time to revenue.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes, sure, sure. So look, there's multiple phases. I mean, this is no doubt a dynamic world. I mean, this
-- most of these applications didn't exist in our minds sooner than March of this year. So we have some
elements and components that are -- that they're moving now. They're part of the fight today. They're
embedded in our sales numbers that you're looking at. I would say that the bulk of the opportunities and
some of the things that we talked about here today, they're a little further out. They are compressed
development cycles. They're very, very active now. And we would see a lot of them starting to get some
initial market traction in early 2021. But some very, very important milestones along the way that we're
working with, with different partners and customers to bring those to bear. They are organic in nature
now. Certainly, as things continue to develop and evolve, that inorganic opportunities to make them bigger
and more impactful would be something we'd absolutely consider.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. Again, congrats to everyone, and Andy, all the best, and you'll be missed.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thank you.

Operator

Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Eric, congratulations, very well deserved. Andy, it's been a good decade. All this working with you, it's
been a pleasure.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Mike.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

You're going to do awesome at Madison, obviously, but we'll miss you here. Eric's going to be a great
replacement, but we'll definitely miss you. So thank you. Thanks for everything over the years.

So with that, first question. I know the partial answer to this, but just want to confirm. With Eric, you
taking over, I'm guessing the willingness, desire and ability to push forward on the M&A strategy doesn't

IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

really change. So just confirm that and give any thoughts on how you're thinking about the funnel as we
sit here today, actionability and ability to convert.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. Well, absolutely. The focus remains very, very high on that front. I mean, ultimately, IDEX was built
that way, through acquisitions. So I think as the pandemic unfolded, obviously, things froze up in the early
days. We've seen things free up now. The process is -- you might imagine, is quite different. I mean we're
-- none of us are in airplanes. We're doing a lot of it remotely and virtually, but we've adapted just as
we've adapted our businesses in that way.

And I think as we look forward, this is an area of huge focus for our teams. The group executives, one of
the big reasons we brought them on to our senior team, is so frankly, we could get more hands on the
opportunity itself. And so we're looking aggressively. I think we're looking for properties that are -- they've
got to be good IDEX businesses. That's something that we're always going to keep firmly in our sights.
You could imagine in times like this, that this is a complex operating environment, and businesses that
might not be able to handle it quite as well but are very, very differentiated would be something that we
think we could bring a lot of value to.

And so we're considering that as an extension of sort of our normal course and the normal filters that
we use as we think about businesses we'd like to own. But I can assure you, it absolutely remains a
fundamental piece of the day and a priority for us.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then secondarily, good to see the sequential trends continue into October here. Maybe some initial
thoughts on next year and how you're handicapping things internally. Obviously, one of IDEX's mantras
is to be able to adjust and adapt to whatever the environment looks like. But how are you thinking about
linearity trends into next year? And any kind of thoughts along those lines at this point?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Mike, maybe I'll just touch on it first and then let Eric go deeper on it. So really, no real difference
from how we thought about it last quarter. If you look at the sequential improvement that we've seen
go back from second quarter -- or first quarter or third quarter -- second quarter, third quarter, and that
sequential gain, and we're now in that 3% to 5% down, but the last really tough comp will be Q1 of next
year. And I think we'll know a lot more going into that quarter. But I will say going into the fourth quarter,
we always look at the backlog load, and that gives us the confidence level. And we're at the higher end
of our normal backlog load going into the quarter. So that's a really good sign. It gives a lot of support
around that 3% to 5% organic. First quarter will be a tough comp, and then -- but if you keep thinking
about the sequentials and you think about that acceleration, that puts us in a good spot for the entire year
as you think about it. I know, Eric, you put a lot of thought into this as we're prepping for our budgets and
going through strat plan.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. Yes. And absolutely, Mike, you know us well. I mean we stay agile and reactive along the way.
That always serves us well. So as we think about the variability that's still in front of us, at least in the
next quarter or 2, until we get a handle on where the pandemic is going to go, I mean we've set up an
operating cadence that allows us to course correct and adjust really, really well. And so I mean a good
example of that, you can see in our opening comments. I mean we've got -- we've taken the structural
actions where we need to really fast. In fact, we took some of that even before the pandemic first showed
up in the early spring. And at the same time, we've been able to rally and pivot resources around the
opportunities that we outlined as we talked about fighting the pandemic. That's the way we do business,
and it works equally well for things on the downside because of more variability or opportunities that are

Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats, Eric. And I echo everybody's comments, Andy. It's sad to see you go, but best of luck there.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thank you.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just kind of reflecting back over your tenure, Andy. As you had this vision for IDEX when you first took the
helm, how far off have you veered off of that vision? Obviously, very successful still. And then also, what
surprised you over the years most with the enterprise as you went through that tenure?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I guess, Allison, you're asking that question at a good time. You can imagine I'm pretty reflective
right now about everything we've done together. I think that the early kernels, I'll remember back, and
the folks from IDEX who are listening to this call, they'll remember, we had a global leadership meeting
in March of 2012. And when you look at what Eric just referred to as what we internally call the IDEX
Difference, which is around great teams, 80/20 and obsessive focus on the customer, we started laying
those kernels out then. And from there, they grew.

And what you found was that as that kernel grew and you dug in deeper, you saw that the levers that
really matter are actually very few. When you get right down to it, the levers that matter are very few.
And Eric and I have had about 10,000 conversations over the years in offices and airplanes and conference
rooms and at each other's houses talking about how to make that real and talking about how do you get
these big concepts that sound like, frankly, stupid corporate speak down to the people who actually do
the work, and that's where we dug in really deep. And so the levers that matter, the first thing is, do you
have a mission that people care about, right? Do people actually care about the work that they're doing

12

IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

and how they're impacting the world? And when you get a compelling mission, it aligns everybody really
quickly.

Second is do you have good businesses or bad businesses? I've been in good businesses. I've been in bad
businesses. And Eric, I know, has been in some pretty bad ones, too. And those are instructive, right?
Because bad businesses, you spend a lot of time on problems that you can absolutely, frankly, never fix.
And so position yourself into good businesses, and that means acquisition and it also means that approach
to 80/20 all along because within any business, there are the great business and there's bad business.
And you got to work through that on a constant basis. And you got to move resources, right? You got to
move resources to the things that matter most, where profits really exist, where you have a differentiated
position.

The last -- or the next one is great teams. We -- one of the interesting things about IDEX, we have 45
businesses. We have 45 corner offices. And we've seen time and again, when you put a great leader in,
it is like a light switch. It's not slow. It's fast, how -- what they do with the business. And if you combine
that great leader and leadership team with a great business, there's a magic that happens there that
is just incredible. And then I'd say the last thing is process discipline. And if you think about this as
an exponential equation, right, and you bring process discipline to bear for us, that happens to be the
elements of the IDEX Difference, that really is the formula or the equation that Eric and I and the team
have been putting together for years and years and years.

Allison, in terms of some of the learnings, they all go into those buckets. If I could go back in time and
pull -- and change a couple of things, look, there have been times when I moved too slow with leaders
who weren't getting it done. And I've learned that you can't do that, right? People either buy in or they
don't. It's very hard to convince somebody that they should do something that they are opposed to out of
the gate. And so you've got to get people who are excited and you've got to ride those horses.

Asset choices. Look, I really do believe that in this next phase of life, and Eric is incredibly well positioned
to do this, acquisitions are going to matter a lot. And we've made some really good asset choices. We've
made a couple of bad ones. And again, kind of like choosing good and bad, when you choose bad, it hurts.
And when you choose good, it's amazing what they do. And I'll just -- I'll reference one. The first business
we bought -- that I bought as part of IDEX was PPE and that was in 2010, I wasn't CEO yet. And it was
a little business in England. And what you saw there were all the elements of what makes IDEX special.
And we've gone from that little business in England to a $300 million platform that is just an incredible
part of our business. That's the model that I think we need to follow here going forward. And so Allison, I
appreciate the question. It definitely is a reflective time.

Allison Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And just turning to today, comment around sort of living with the virus makes sense. Is that
reflected in sort of your current order trends that you're seeing from customers? We're just seeing
Germany going back into a lockdown here. Just trying to, I guess, better understand how you're thinking
about that potential volatility here with the resurgence happening at this point.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Well, I'll take that one, Allison. So look, I think ever since the pandemic started here, I mean, we've seen
that volatility enter our order book, and we always kind of have 2 ways that we delineate it. We've got
kind of that everyday replenishment cycle that happens in a lot of our component businesses. And then
honestly, as long as the system is on, it stays pretty constant. And so irrespective of border closings and
other things, it generally has held up pretty well. What tends to move on us is -- are a little bit more
project-intensive businesses, larger units of measure, and they're very much affected by the view of the
world around us. So I think as we see this, no doubt, I think this next wave will be different than the one
we saw in March because everybody kind of recognizes the economic consequence of that. And everybody
has done a better job of tooling their organizations up to be able to live with it and coexist with it. So
we're expecting more volatility as the cases go up, but I don't see that it should knock us off the trend

path that we're on as we just continue to live with it, and that goes for IDEX. That goes for any other
business.

Next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. I echo everyone's comments. Congrats to everyone. So question on the COVID-19 opportunities you
identified, the $25 million to $100 million. I assume that's kind of an ongoing run rate you're looking for.
I guess, organically, what sort of spend is associated with going out to get that revenue? And what sort of
defines the high and low end of that range?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

So maybe I'll take a first shot at that. I would say we've made some initial investments in the quarter
from an investment perspective. As we've worked with our customers to get some of these things, get
some traction on early development. Obviously, we've invested in some capital to support some initiatives
relative to tooling, and some of these opportunities relative to that range could be sizable. Obviously,
we've got multiple partners with each of the applications, all the volatility we've talked about. Who's
ultimately going to end up winning is one factor. And then two, the commercial viability of whoever wins
in the marketplace will also be another variable. So that's why it's a wide range for now. Obviously, Eric
highlighted, we're spending a ton of time on these initiatives across several different businesses. And I
think we'll have more visibility coming out of the year and early first quarter and be able to size that up a
little bit better for you when we talk about 2021.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Got it. And then maybe just another -- just a quick question on M&A. Would you say in the last 90 days or
so, the actionability in the pipeline, the actionability in the funnel is actually getting better? And what are
you seeing from a multiple standpoint?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. Well, certainly, the actionability, I think, is quite a bit better. I think everybody has found a way to
actually do the work in a remote way. In many ways, everybody else has kind of got their head around
the fact that this is going to be with us for a while, and yet things are going to continue and business is
going to go on. All of that helps. And then, of course, there's -- it seems like there's ample liquidity as well
for certainly for us and for others. So the actionability is high. The process is slightly different. I would
say on the valuation, there's not a lot of change. It's high. It's high, and I think it's a long-term view. And
certainly for the businesses that we're going to be attracted to, they have tremendous long-term potential.
And so those out years, if anything, we're looking at, we're anticipating are going to be strong, and the
sellers are -- have a firm belief that, that's the case as well.

Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Nathan.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Just getting on to a few questions here on maybe some of the red dots on the end markets, energy and
the analytical instrumentation. Just like to get your thoughts on the potential timing of recovery there.
I mean, energy is probably a little bit longer than the analytical instrumentation side. But I think, Andy,
you talked about focus on the vaccine taking away from maybe some sales there. Looks like maybe we're
getting towards a point where a vaccine is going to be out and available and production facilities will be
put in place and maybe some of that focus moves around. So just any thoughts you have on timing of
recovery in both of those businesses?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll touch on it first and then -- and let Eric kind of go from there. The interesting thing is both Eric
and I were group executives in charge of that business at one point. So we both know it really well. Look,
I think what you're seeing here -- it's counterintuitive, what's happening in that marketplace, right?
Because if you look at analytical instrumentation, one would think that immediately because there are
health-related issues, that it should be growing. The reality is that a lot of the stuff that happens in that
big AI space is being pushed away right now because priorities are going over to other spend. It's very
much our expectation that as we get into, I don't think any later than the midpoint next year, that, that
starts to improve. And so obviously, we had a lot of confidence. It's a really good business for us. So Eric,
your thoughts?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. It's certainly the same thing. And then of course, there's a consumables dynamic there that's kind of
out ahead of us. We're generally making the componentry for the equipment. So even as things recover,
there's a little bit of a lag there as you go through a consumable stream and then into the actual devices
themselves. But I agree with that.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Any comments on the energy market and potential pace of recovery there?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. Well, on the energy side, of course, as you know, we tend to be more downstream and associated
with things like custody transfer and mobile applications. And so less resilient -- or less tied to the
wellhead and places like that. And so I think ultimately, we've seen a little bit of improvement here now.
I mean, obviously, that took a hard hit initially, and some of this is probably pent-up demand that's
coming back. But I think it's going to be a while. It's going to be a while for the energy markets to kind
of sort themselves out. Often, when you get it down to where we do business, it depends on things like
building trucks for mobile fleets that actually do the work of custody transfer. And so those are the kind of
decisions that have to be made, the confidence that has to be there. But certainly, we're much happier to
be a little further down the stream than up in the front of it.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And given that -- sorry, go ahead.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

So maybe the only thing I'd add is we talked about a specific initiative we had in energy relative to last
year, that was a huge initiative for us. Obviously, that business this year has seen significant contraction,
which is, I think, weighing on FMT a lot more than we had expected coming into the year. So just as folks
have poked around a little bit on why FMT's margins and volumes are down a little bit more, with our run
rate business improving, that was fairly large for that group.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

And that, of course, has a political question associated with it as well.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Exactly.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Is vehicle miles traveled really the best indicator we can look at for the energy business?

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Let me jump in on that one. One of the problems with any of these kind of big macro things is we actually
do business in a lot of these micro areas. And so if you're going to make a big energy call, of course, that's
going to influence us. But if you think about our business, we're at the micro level.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Do you feel like the cost structure in those businesses that are struggling the most is aligned with
demand now? Or are there targeted cost actions that you can take here?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

So look, we're taking the opportunity now to make some of those actions. We opened up a factory down
in Oklahoma, actually ahead of the pandemic. It's been a big assist to us. We intentionally built that with
some extra floor space for any potential. And we're leveraging that now. We're doing some structural work
around the footprint of the company because I think this is a good time to think about sort of taking a
down situation and creating competitive advantage out of it. And by moving some of the structure around
the way we are, it actually allows us to augment or increase some of the innovative potential we have in a
business while at the same time, doing the right things on just base administration. And so yes, we're --
we have pretty active efforts underway in this area right now.

Thank you, Scott.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

This is maybe more -- the first question is maybe more of a question for Bill, the more who's -- I'm certain
is more of a mathematician than me. But could you walk us through the organic flow-through of 37%
and then the total flow-through of 53% on the operating income walk? I guess I'm having a little trouble,
math-challenged that I can be, on how we get there on $3 million of income, but maybe I'm just not
understanding it.

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So maybe we'll start with that. So on the acquisition and FX piece, that's $3 million of income on
roughly $30 million of sales. So only a 10% contribution from that aspect, which is extremely dilutive
to the overall margin. So when you exclude that and you just look at our core business, like-for-like last
year versus this year, right, our -- the cost actions and the things we've done within our core business
materially reduced the organic flow-through to -- from what we'd expect of 60% down to less than 40%.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Got you. That makes a lot of sense. So next question is same for you again here, Bill. What does the $13
million of discretionary look like in the fourth quarter? And then sort of what are you looking at as sort of
the reversals for next year with sales now starting to get better?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I mean we've targeted -- once we get back to normal run rate levels, obviously, discretionary expense
relative to doing business post COVID will be different. But adding back about 2/3 of that on a consistent
basis going forward, we ramped up our spend slightly in the third quarter, probably up slightly again here
in the fourth quarter with increased volumes. So although it will never come all the way back, if you're
doing modeling, I assume roughly 80% of that cost coming back on a longer-term basis.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's great. One other question, if I may. The $25 million to $100 million range, which we've all
been talking about, I didn't hear you say kind of where you are on that spectrum right now. I can see how
really you're focused on the areas that really are kind of for keeps area, so that does become part of the
organic. But where are you on that curve?

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Well, with revenue year-to-date, obviously, we're on -- we're below the low end. That's a full year run rate
on an annualized basis. So we've got some wins that we started to experience, obviously, in the first half
of the year that have continued on here in Q4. I think some of the items that will ramp us to the top end
of the range are things, again, we won't have full visibility here until we get into 2021.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And just to think about what those triggers are, right? So some of them, as Bill said, they're already
there. We're already winning. It's already in the base business, so to speak, right?

You won't lap that until the second half of next year for the most part. And then you've got some big
digital events, right? So the work we're doing on COVID testing, the work we're doing on vaccines, as I
said last quarter, if those go in the right direction for us, they are huge wins, and we'll get to the top end
of the range fast. But if they don't, they're not there. So I caution anyone to build those into your models,
that the top end of that range, until we have the -- know whether we're aligned with wins and whether
that has momentum.

Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

First, congrats to Andy. Appreciate all the years of insight. And best of luck to Eric. I wanted to come
back to the order trends. The improvement is encouraging. Were you able to spike out how much of that
improvement was market versus share gain? And I imagine you had some of the COVID opportunity wins
in September, October orders. Any color you could give us there?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. So look, I think from -- a big piece of that is general market recovery because so much of what we do
at IDEX is a broad basket across a wide variety of industries. But no doubt, when we can see and isolate
the places where we know we're winning share, one of which we talked about here in the COVID story --
chapter in terms of some components that we already have placed that are helping that fight. But I would
say that the bulk of what you're seeing here in the near term is sequential recovery of industrial markets
that we participate in.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. Got it. Great. And then just wanted to shift back to the comments on the muni budgets and some of
the work you're doing there. Do you expect a lagged effect into next year as the backlogs get monetized,
they need replenished? And just curious what some of that work that you're doing on budgets in those
particular businesses is informing about the outlook there next year.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. I would say, I mean, there's always a little bit of a lagging element in the municipal markets, and it's
not ubiquitous. You have some towns and municipalities that are pretty aggressive, and they're thinking

through now the consequences and the actions. In some cases, that actually accelerates some work as
they're trying to spend money that they have available. I'd say the bulk of most of the market that we're
interfacing with is stuck in the same variability that we are and are trying to imagine what could be in
front of them as we go into 2021. Open questions of in the case of the U.S. federal support or whether
or not it comes or doesn't. So I think there's going to be a lagging element there that we're thinking
about. But we're very close to our customers. We kind of do this town-by-town jurisdiction by state,
province and municipality. And so for us, it ultimately turns into a series of pins on a map, a bunch of
discrete discussions that generally sum up the way I've described it, but we navigate through that field of
opportunity as we go.

Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.

Robert Cameron Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

Andy, thanks for the reflections on a great run. It was a wonderful distillation, and Eric, on the comments
on continuity and evolution. And I'd like to -- if I can encourage just a little bit more of that. Really, my
question is, given all that you and the organization has done with margins, the success of 80/20 and how
margins have come up, it does seem like you're going to add more value to pools of capital you acquire
versus what you might have expected 7 or 10 years ago. And so does that mean that acquisitions could
have a larger role in the future? Eric, you touched on this briefly. And then do you have specific sort of
changes you're making to the organization to push that along, if so?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. Sure. I appreciate the nature of the question. I'll take it. Yes to both questions. So as we've become
more evolved internally and it's better understood, frankly, the impact of all of the work that we've done
around 80/20 and the IDEX Difference, and we've seen us apply it to our own businesses and things that
we've acquired along the way, it makes us more confident about what we can do in the outside world.
And so we've been very, very purposely thinking about that. We've built it into the modeling that we do
as wherever -- as we're looking at IDEX-like businesses on the outside. And again, from an organizational
perspective, a lot of the work that, certainly, I've been working on in the last few years, is to get a number
of leaders ready to begin to spend a significant amount of their time on this work. So we're doing that in
the background.

And then I think going forward, look, as we said earlier, the valuations are high. Our discipline remains
very, very tight and focused. And so we're going to have to spend the time beating the bushes to find
these kind of opportunities, get them in front of us and analyze them thoroughly, and that's going to take
some resources as well. So one of the things we're thinking about as the world improves and things lever
up is making some purposeful investments to support the continued evolution of this work and keeping it a
very high priority.

Robert Cameron Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

Okay. That's a helpful answer. And then just if I can just add on one small one on the back of it. I mean
do you expect, as you do all that, that you'll have a consistent cadence on acquisitions and flow? Or you're
obviously not -- you're still relatively small and can be opportunistic. So are you thinking it can steady out
a bit? Or is that not part of the goal and just take opportunities where they come? And I'll stop.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Well, I mean, I think there's always been a little bit of a sine wave, at least in the time that I've been
here. It seems like wins break and it tends to come in clumps. And so I think we're prepared to have
it continue that way. I mean we think about resourcing in a way that would support it. So maybe
intentionally level loading, it wouldn't be something that we would do as a purposeful way to sort
of balance things out because what it might do is actually cause us to think about opportunities in a
different way than we actually should. So I think there will still be a little bit of kind of, time to time, some
clustering that we will see, but we set up the organization, and we certainly have the capital resources to
be able to handle it that way.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Yes. I wanted to just -- I hear your comments on backlog going into the fourth quarter kind of at the
higher end of what it normally might look like. And I think Allison touched on this earlier. But are you
kind of like haircutting a little bit with what you're saying or, at least internally, how you're talking to your
people in terms of budgeting about just some of the stuff you're seeing over the last week in countries
starting to shut down? Like how are you thinking about deployment of growth capital and things like that
near-term with some of these kind of more recent developments?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Well, so look, I think we have a general approach here that is -- it's very agile, very reactive. And to be
honest, this -- what we're going through and what we're seeing here now, we planned for this back in
March. I mean as soon as people started to recognize that there would likely be a second [ wave ], we
built that into our thinking. So the fact that we're in it now, yes, we're definitely very cautious about the
variability that's out there. We're super hesitant, unless we have to do it, to put in kind of fixed cost back
into the business given this environment. So let's treat it variably if we can. But I have to say that while
it's certainly concerning for all of us as citizens, in many ways, we sort of set this up as a planned event
that we thought would be here. It is here, and we're going to stay as variable and agile as we can as we
go through it.

IDEX CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2020

And Eric, you're taking over an organization that's in a really good spot. And if you can replicate what's
happened over the last 10 years, I think you'd be pretty happy with it. But just curious. You're taking over
an organization that's still -- that is like twice the size in terms of revenue as when Andy did. So what kind
of different things you have to think about just given the size of the organization and what's happened
over the last decade?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Yes. I know. Thanks. Well, certainly, I mean, this is a well-positioned company in a great spot. I will take
that. I know it presents opportunities along the way. The bar is high, and we need to continue to raise it,
but I'm very, very thankful that it's in the state that it is now. That being said, as we go forward, there's
things that we've talked about. We're certainly more of a global company today than we were even back
when Andy joined. I think that even the things we've -- we think of acquiring and we have acquired, the
unit of measure is a little larger. We know that the story that Andy talked about with our sealing business,
we've done the work to integrate that and bring it together with other like businesses. And that will, no
doubt, continue to be a chapter for us as we go forward. And that's complex work that takes certain skill
sets that we've been building for. So as I said in the very beginning, I see an awful lot of continuity at play
here to keep this company in a great position and take it forward. But there are those little nuances along
the way that I think are appropriate that we have in mind that are going to take it to the next level.

Operator

Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Congrats, Andy and Eric. And good luck with the new moves.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Thank you.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Thank you.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

So first off, were you guys had -- the commentary is very interesting on the HST segment with the $25
million to $100 million opportunity. So how do we -- I hesitate to -- like you said, put that in the model at
this point. But I guess, what are some headlines? Or what should we be tracking to see if the likelihood
of this is going forward? Or is there something that we cannot know that you guys would have to know
internally and wait for another update?

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Well, look, I think there's a few environmental things that we can all track. This is -- we're making an
assumption here that, as Andy said in the beginning, that we're going to coexist with this virus for quite a
while. So even the vaccines that are planned to be here, we're anticipating that they're not going to wipe
out necessarily the virus that's out there, and there's going to be a continual need for testing of this type.
So I think all of us tracking the requirements, the necessary nature of the kind of work that we're doing
on both fronts, is an environmental factor that would support this, but they're very specific. I mean these
are -- this is really specific technology, science and commercial adoption that has to happen here. And as
Bill said, I think, certainly, we'll give you an indication along the way when we reach different milestones

and it's starting to find its way into our sales stream -- order and sales stream. So I think there's a slight
environmental component, but a lot of it is very specific for us.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Yes. Okay. Okay. And with regards to the orders in the quarter, so it's nice to see those trending in the
right direction exiting the quarter. Were orders in any specific segment surprising to you throughout the
quarter in how they trended? Specifically FMT, curious how that trended each month, and that just seems
to be the laggard here. It's, obviously, an important segment to the story.

William K. Grogan
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. I would say, Andy referred to it. We saw improvement across all 3 segments. Obviously, FMT is
lagging a little bit relative to the end market exposures. But the pickup we saw on a month-to-month
basis was pretty close linearly to how we performed overall.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to
turn the call back over to Andrew Silvernail for closing comments.

Andrew K. Silvernail
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thank you very much. Look, I do have a few closing comments: one, just around the business as
a whole; and two, just a few thank yous that I'd like to say out, and then I'll turn it over to Eric for -- to
wrap it up.

So look, as I exit this company, you got to appreciate the position that we're in and the quality of this
business. It is an awesome business. And as I answered Allison's question and I walked through those
4 things, quality of business matters an awful lot and mission matters an awful lot, and we're in a great
spot. Second, we've got positive momentum. Frankly, I would never have made the decision to leave IDEX
if we were in the spot we had been in at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter. And it gives
me great confidence. And as long as I'm alive, my name is going to be associated with IDEX, and I want
this company to absolutely blow the doors off it, and we have really good momentum.

And then the last thing is, there's a great team. Oftentimes, the investment community focuses on a
singular person, and it's just never so. And under my time as a leader of this company, we've been
successful because we've had a great team, and Eric has a great team as we go forward. So I have a lot of
confidence in where this business is going.

And just a few thank yous. First, I want to thank everybody at IDEX. As I mentioned before, this has just
been a privilege and the highlight of my professional career to work with all of you. I can't tell you how
many days I've gone home and had conversations with my wife and conversations with my kids about the
joy to work with the people at IDEX. You're just first rate. There's nobody in the world that holds a candle
to you guys. And you brought me just incredible joy, and I just want to thank you very much.

To the investor and the analyst community, everybody on the phone here today and those who might
listen, sometimes there's a bad rap, that between a company, management and the investment
community that somehow is this negative beast that exists. And for me, anyway, it just isn't true. There
are a lot of you guys on the phone today. You guys are my friends. And you have helped me get better.
You have pushed us to get better. You've asked the difficult questions, and difficult questions are how you
get better. And it's one of the things we do at IDEX all the time. We ask the difficult question, and part of
that comes because you guys ask the difficult question, and it's just been a privilege to work with you.

And then just to my friend, Eric, we have worked together for 12 years, and people think of a professional
relationship, and we obviously have that. But he is also my dear friend. And as much as I am glad that

I've made him better as a leader, he has made me equally, if not more, better as a leader. And there is not
a better executive in the world that I've ever worked with than Eric, and this company is in great hands.

Eric D. Ashleman
President & COO

Well, thank you very much for that. Thanks very much for that. As we often do, we end on a lot of the
same summary points. I think this business is really, really well positioned. I couldn't be more excited
about where it is now and where it's going to go. This transition is smooth and seamless. We're going to
execute this. Everybody is leaning forward here, and our priorities are constant. That's right. I feel really,
really good here. And the first question, I think, is the right one. I mean we know what's important. We've
worked on it together, and we're going to continue the legacy and the work that you've done, Andy.

Few people I'd like to thank as well. I'd certainly like to thank all the hard-working folks across IDEX.
I'm excited to be continuing the journey with them. I'd like to thank our Board for their confidence and
support. And then I absolutely would like to thank my friend, Andy. It has been an amazing run from that
very first day he came to my business in 2009 and introduced himself. And so after a long time, we're
transitioning from boss and partner to mentor and continued friends. Thank you very much.

Operator
This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your
participation.
