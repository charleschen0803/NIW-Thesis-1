I will now turn the call over to Ken.

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Peter, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call to review our outstanding second quarter
2021 results.

Billings increased 35% to $961 million driven by solid execution and was the best it has been since 2015.
Secure SD-WAN accounts for 14% of second quarter billings. Total revenue grew 30% to $801 million with
product revenue up 41%. Product revenue growth was the highest for nearly 10 years. Free cash flow was
$395 million, a quarterly record level. With strong business momentum, we remain focused on growth.

Today, we announced expansion of our FortiCare and FortiGuard security services, adding a new security
service called FortiTrust. FortiTrust security service offer user-based licensing that follow the user across
the operations entire security platform. This enable organizations to easily manage and secure across all
networks, endpoint and cloud, which traditionally has been sideloaded.

Initial service level are being offered for Zero Trust Network Access and identity verification. We enhance
the current FortiCare security services, which cover all Fortinet Security Fabric product with 3 level of
services, so including 24/7 technical support and timely issue resolution. Additionally, FortiTrust security

service has been fine-tuned for different segments with added individual services for enterprise, bundled
for commercial and the packages for SMB, leveraging industry-leading threat intelligence from FortiGuard
Lab. FortiCare secure service offer market-leading AI-enabled secured capability that regularly adjust
protection across the Fortinet Security Fabric.

Today, we announced a new FortiGate 3500F, the industry's first high-performance next-generation
firewall, with integrated Zero Trust Network Access and ransomware protection powered by the Fortinet
NP7 ASIC's SPU, the 3500F offers an average 6x more performance than other competitive products
based on our security compute reading. This makes the 3500F the best protection for high-speed internal
network [ on-base ] centers.

We continue to see the momentum and adoption of our SD-WAN Zero Trust Network Access and cloud
solutions among the world's largest service providers. In May, Fortinet was recognized as the winner of the
Microsoft Security Customer Impact Award. Last week, Fortinet was named Google Cloud's 2020 Security
Partner of the Year, recognized for innovative thinking, outstanding customer service and best-in-class use
of our cloud products and services.

Before turning the call over to Keith, I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners
worldwide for their continued support and hard work.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you, Ken. And to add to your comments, we should note that as in the prior quarter, billings growth,
product revenue growth and total revenue growth, all accelerated sequentially. In fact, all 3 growth rates
were at 5-year Fortinet highs and product revenue growth was at its highest in over 9 years.

Okay. Let's start with a more detailed Q2 discussion with revenue. Total revenue of $801 million was up
30%, driven by industry-leading product revenue growth of 41%. The product revenue growth was broad-
based across geographies, FortiGate and non-FortiGate products and across use cases illustrating market
acceptance and customer demand for our integrated single platform Security Fabric strategy across
customer infrastructures.

Our financial strategy includes a Rule of 40 target. We target the total of the revenue growth percentage
and operating margin to be at least 40. In the second quarter, strong demand and execution drove this
actual total to be a Rule of 55.

FortiGate product revenue growth was 40%. While we continue to see robust growth from our secure SD-
WAN functionality. The majority of the growth was driven by FortiGate revenue from other capabilities,
which are embedded in the FortiGate operating system. Non-FortiGate product revenue growth was over
40% for the second consecutive quarter and was driven by strong growth from our integrated Security
Fabric products.

One additional comment on our product revenue growth. The product revenue growth was a reflection of
our continued strong organic growth and not the result of a few large deals, drawing down backlog nor an
unusual number of delayed transactions from the prior quarter or pulled in from future periods.

Service revenue of $503 million was up 24%. Support and related services revenue of $230 million was up
26%, while security subscription services revenue of $273 million was up 23%.

Moving to the mix of FortiGate and non-FortiGate platform revenue. FortiGate product and services
revenue increased 26% driven by very strong demand for both branch and high-end FortiGate products.
High-end products included 10 NP7-powered FortiGate models, representing approximately 25% of high-
end FortiGate shipments.

Our ASIC-driven FortiGates give customers 5x to 10x more computing power than firewalls running on
common CPUs. The advanced computing power creates additional speed and capacity to continue to add
functionality to our operating system, further driving our price for performance advantage.

FORTINET, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

The combination of the ASIC Advantage and the common operating system across products, can enable
vendor consolidation, lowering total cost of ownership and increasing automation. Non-FortiGate product
and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for approximately 30% of total revenue, up over 2
percentage points.

The integrated Security Fabric consists of a complete range -- would you close that door? Bit of a rehearsal
for our all hands meeting later on today. So you've got an inside scoop on what Patrice is going to say.

Let me start again, if I may. Non-FortiGate products and services revenue grew 39% and accounted for
approximately 30% of total revenue, up over 2 percentage points. The integrated Security Fabric consists
of a complete range of form factors and delivery methods, including physical and virtual appliances, cloud,
SaaS and perpetual software as well as hosted and non-hosted solutions. Together, they provide a range
of security solutions and form factors, enabling integrated protection for the hybrid environments and the
expanding digital attack surface from network data centers, to endpoints, to the cloud.

Let's turn to revenue by geo. The summary is on Slide 5. Revenue in EMEA increased 34%. The Americas
revenue increased 29% and APAC posted revenue growth of 24%. Product revenue growth for both the
Americas and EMEA regions was over 40%.

Moving to billings. Second quarter billings were $961 million, up 35%. We saw strong growth in both the
FortiGate and non-FortiGate segment of the Security Fabric platform. The FortiGate segment delivered
billings growth of over 30%, accounting for 71% of total billings.

As shown on Slide 6, branch and high-end FortiGates posted very strong billings growth. The non-
FortiGate segment accounted for over 29% of total billings and delivered billings growth of over
45%, driving a 2-point mix shift to non-FortiGate products and services. Given the continued strong
performance, we believe our non-FortiGate platform is on a pace to be a $1 billion business this year.

Secure SD-WAN billings represented 14% of total billings and is a key functionality for an integrated SASE
solution. In terms of billings by geo, EMEA outperformed all geos, followed by the Americas and APAC.
Europe had a very good quarter, and growth in the Americas was driven by the United States, which was
up sequentially by more than 30 percentage points.

Latin America continued to recover from the pandemic-induced slowdown, closing billings growth in the
mid-20s for the second consecutive quarter. The average contract term was approximately 28 months,
up 2 months from the second quarter of 2020 and 1 month in the first quarter of 2021. Deals over $1
million increased from 59 to 79, and the pipeline for deals over $1 million continues to look good for the
remainder of the year. Secure SD-WAN deals over $1 million increased from 13 to 19.

Moving to worldwide billings by industry verticals. Billings by vertical illustrate the diversification in our
business model and importantly, suggest the current threat landscape is driving security investments in
industries that may have historically shown lower investment levels.

For example, the verticals that have historically not been in our top 5 combined for billings growth of over
75%. Service providers accounted for 14% of total billings and were up 25%.

Moving back to the income statement. Product revenue growth of 41% drove a 3-point shift in the product
and services revenue mix. And along with it, a gross margin decrease of 160 basis points to 77.5%.
Product gross margin improved 70 basis points to 61.7%. Services gross margin decreased 160 basis
points to 86.9% with data center investments in FX accounting for about 100 basis points of the impact.

Operating margin of 25.4% was at the top end of the guidance range despite a 350 basis point headwind
from the gross margin decline, a weaker U.S. dollar and increased travel and marketing event cost. We
ended the quarter with a total headcount of 9,043, an increase of 17%.

Moving to the statement of cash flow summarized on Slide 7 and 8. Free cash flow for the second quarter
came in at a quarterly record of $395 million, benefiting from strong revenue growth, good month one
linearity and lower capital expenditures. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 455,000 shares of
common stock for a total cost of $92 million at an average share price of approximately $201.

FORTINET, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

The remaining share repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter was $921 million with the
authorization set to expire at the end of February 2022. We ended the first half of the year with total cash
and investments of $3.4 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion. The increase includes the proceeds from our $1
billion investment-grade debt issuance during the first quarter of 2021.

DSOs returned to pre-pandemic levels, decreasing 7 days year-over-year and 15 days quarter-over-
quarter to 66 days. Inventory turns increased to 2.7x from 2.2x, reflecting strong product sales in the
quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24 million, and we have started to move into the new
Sunnyvale building.

We estimate third quarter capital expenditures to be between $65 million and $75 million, which includes
a $30 million payment for the new campus building. We estimate 2021 capital expenditures to be between
$175 million and $200 million.

With the acceleration of the growth and a little more understanding of the post-pandemic work patterns,
we're turning our attention to reviewing our facilities footprint and the needed office and warehouse
capacity in the U.S. and Canada. As we work through this process, it is possible that our estimated capital
expenditures over the next few quarters will increase as we prepare for the next phase of our growth.

Looking forward, our goal remains to balance growth and profitability. And given the growth opportunities
that we believe lie ahead, we continue to expect to tilt our bias within this framework more towards
growth for at least the next several quarters.

The opportunities we see are supported by a strong pipeline, increased sales effectiveness, the growing
success with a single integrated security platform strategy and the convergence of security and
networking, the response to the current threat environment and our development efforts, which include
continuing to invest in our ASIC advantage, which enables a shared operating system across the Security
Fabric platform, drives our price for performance advantage, increase the capacity to add features and
functions while maintaining price points.

And now I can review our outlook for the third quarter, summarized on Slide 9, which is subject to
disclaimers regarding forward-looking information that Peter provided at the beginning of the call. For the
third quarter, we expect billings in the range of $940 million to $960 million; revenue in the range of $800
million to $815 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 77.5% to 78.5%; non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5%
to 25.5%, which includes an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased
travel and marketing cost. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95, which assumes a share count
of between 169 million and 171 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%.

With that, we are raising our 2021 guidance and expect billings in the range of $3.87 billion to $3.92
billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 26%. Revenue in the range of $3.210
billion to $3.250 billion, which at the midpoint represents growth of approximately 24.5%. Total service
revenue in the range of $2.045 billion, $2.075 billion, which represents growth of approximately 23% and
it implies full year of product revenue growth of approximately 28%.

Non-GAAP gross margin of 77% to 79%. Non-GAAP operating margins of 25% to 27%, which includes
an estimated 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange and increased travel and marketing costs.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.90, which assumes a share count of between 168 million and
170 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21%. We expect cash taxes to be approximately $90
million.

Along with Ken, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and the Fortinet team for all their hard work,
execution and outstanding success in the first half of 2021. I'll now hand the call back over to Peter for the
Q&A session.

Peter M. Salkowski
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Keith. Operator, Catherine, we're ready to open the call for questions, please.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs.

Brian Lee Essex
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. Congratulations on the results. Really nice set of results this quarter. Maybe to start off, Ken, I
know you've talked for years about not having exposure to firewall refresh cycles within your business.
Could you maybe unpack a little bit the product revenue performance?

Are you starting to see, perhaps, some exposure to the refresh cycles of others? Is this more rip
and replace infrastructure upgrades or expansions? Maybe if you can maybe give us a little bit of an
understanding of what's going on behind the product revenue growth this quarter.

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Brian. Great question. I think the industry, whether during the pandemic or after the
pandemic probably in some kind of a structured changing, it's no longer the traditional border kind of
firewall will be enough. You have to expand into the WAN side like Secure SD-WAN or 5G and also internal
have to do like the internal segmentation, replacing the switch with secure switch and the WiFi to prevent
all this kind of ransomware or kind of internal attack.

So that's where -- and also a consolidation also going on and also need to have an integrated like a
different part of infrastructure that could integrate together to protect the whole attack from multi kind of
attack service protection there. So that's where we see it's a big change for the whole architecture of how
to architect the new protection architecture to protect the whole infrastructure security there.

So that's probably different than just refresh the traditional firewall, but it's the new expanded
infrastructure need to be -- have all protection there. So that's what we see like the product we
announced today 3500F is more go inside the high-speed network environment to do all this kind of
internal segmentation, within data center protection and all these kind of things.

And then also, we see very strong growth, whether the Secure SD-WAN and also the 5G growth. That's
driven a lot of brand trial face work-on-home solution there. That's where the unit growth probably even
much faster there. So we see the whole infrastructure being changed all because the secure-driven
networking started kind of more adopt by both enterprise and also a different kind of vertical.

Brian Lee Essex
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful. Maybe to follow up, service provider was slightly lower as a percentage of
revenue this quarter. I understand that on the product revenue side, in the high end, you saw a lot better
growth.

But is that -- should we think about that segment, particularly to the extent that they might be selling
through for SASE or you might be getting better traction with OPAQ. How should we think about growth
of the service provider market? Is that still to come? Or is that a more stable kind of mid-20s grower
segment for you?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I think we've seen a ramp-up stage, still in the early stage of ramp-up, compared to last quarter, probably
like down about 15%. This quarter grew about 25%. So starting ramp up, like I mentioned, they are kind

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

FORTINET, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

of building infrastructure, whether for the 5G, SD-WAN, or SASE, which we have a different strategy. Our
SASE strategy actually quite a different -- probably very differentiated from other player.

So we have a dual strategy. We are probably the only one working with service provider to building their
SASE. And at the same time, like the service revenue, we kind of lower the margin that will be there, also
investing some of our own infrastructure. If some customer don't have a service provider or want to work
with that directly, we also have a kind of SASE solution there, which also integrate with the FortiDDoS.

Inside FortiDDoS, they have a -- building SASE. Their trust network access and some other parts, it's also
kind of a different than the competitor. And eventually, we also hope we can use an ASIC or [ salary ] to
add additional computing power to our kind of on-site solution there.

So that's where we feel it's a long-term investment. But once we have it, we have a huge advantage
compared to other competitors.

Operator

Our next question from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley.

Hamza Fodderwala
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I had a follow-up regarding the prior question on some of the drivers of product revenue growth. So
Ken, as your customers start coming back into the office or as we move into this more hybrid work
environment, you talked a lot about these larger network transformation deals. I was wondering, what
do you see the pipeline looking like for those larger deals heading into the back half and beyond? And do
you think that some of the things that we saw in the past 12 to 18 months is going to be an accelerant for
those more larger infrastructure-type deals?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes, we see the pipeline very strong for the larger multiple product deal, which like approach -- I mean
that cover multiple part of infrastructure. And also, the product revenue growth like 41% is also where we
strongly feel that our product is really different than the traditional or some of our competitors are using
the CPU only. So we have the latest CPU for our industry, but also we developed ASIC in the last 21 years.

Just like the product we announced today, the 3500F, based on our calculation, we call it security
computing region basis, for the same cost, what's the function performance compared to other
competitors or industry average. So we'll have a 6x better performance basically like -- because the
computing power advantage is huge from our own ASIC. So that's where changing the landscape of
like the product or whether the network security product or some other leveraged ASIC. This huge
computing power gave us much more function and a better performance that can easily replace a lot of
our competitors.

At the same time, we did see the expansion, total addressable market, whether you work-from-home or
kind of a secure internal network inside the company, inside data center, which also drives a lot of high-
end product growth. So the high-end product percentage also we see probably pretty high, maybe the
highest in the last few quarters or even last few years.

Hamza Fodderwala
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up question for Keith or Ken. Keith, you mentioned
the operating margin in the back half having about over 200 basis points impact from FX. I was just
wondering, just on your spending plans around hiring, what you're seeing there? So obviously, a very
competitive market for talent these days. And I'm wondering if that's been factored at all into your guide?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

FORTINET, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. I think -- you obviously pay attention to our recruiting and to our attrition rates. I think the metric
that we gave was that our overall headcount increased 17%. I would offer that the sales headcount
actually grew significantly more than that. So I don't -- I think that we're in a bit of a sweet spot and it
kind of relates to what Ken was saying in just a moment ago, in terms of the success that we're having.

I think you could read through to the high end FortiGate is probably being data center deployments and
probably taking advantage of some competitors that are going through a refresh cycle. And at the same
time, some of the branch FortiGates, maybe reflective of digital transformation. And I think the audience
or salespeople understand that and they see the opportunities there.

Operator

And our next question from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.

Sterling Auty
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

For my one question, I just wanted to dive into, Keith, in your prepared remarks, you made the comment
that the majority of growth was driven by FortiGate -- or driven by FortiGate revenue from other
capabilities embedded in the operating system.

I wondered if you could kind of peel back the onion there. What does that mean? And what capabilities
were you referring to that were in particular demand in the quarter?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think that we tried to make the point in the past that the -- some people think about the firewall
somewhat simplistically, we probably track close to 12 to 15 different firewall use cases whether you want
to talk about micro segmentation, IPS, et cetera. All of those -- the totality of those -- the growth there
was contributed more, if you will, than SD-WAN.

SD-WAN itself still, obviously, contributed very nicely at 14% of our total billings, which probably puts us
close to about 35% or probably 55% growth. So I think there's a long list of things that a firewall is used
for, and we were very pleased with the success that we saw throughout that suite of offerings.

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Also, especially the FortiOS 7.0, we are building a real trust network access and building SASE there. We
see very strong interest in this area, both from the service provider, from enterprise and from work-from-
home solution there.

Operator

Our next question from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler.

Robbie David Owens
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And following the lead of Mr. Auty, I'd like to ask one question. Could you elaborate a little bit on your
commentary around some of these nontraditional verticals that are starting to tick up meaningfully in
spend? Is this more onetime in nature or these verticals are just starting to wake up to some of the
security issues that we're reading about in the media every day? And to that and maybe you could
comment a little bit around your OT success and your strategy there.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

10

FORTINET, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Yes. And Rob, I think you did a very good job of laying all the dots to connect there. We talked -- we're
looking at industries or verticals such as manufacturing, transportation, energy, utilities or what have you,
and to see the dramatic growth that we saw in that segment of the business.

We've historically talked about our top 5 financial services, government, service provider, tech and retail.
And they've been very consistent about that 65%, 66%. But we saw a significant shift this quarter to
those others, and it was just the sheer growth that we saw on those others. And the point that you alluded
to, OT. OT performed very, very strongly in the quarter. And I think that's consistent with what we saw
with that vertical growth and those other verticals that I just mentioned.

Operator

Our next question is from Shaul Eyal of Cowen and Company.

Shaul Eyal
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Also a single question on my end. When we look at the building upside, revenue upside that you printed,
can you impact for us the mix between new logos and the current installed base? Any qualitative color and
discussion will be appreciated.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Shaul, it's Keith. New logos were very strong in the quarter, probably up about 50% year-over-year.
And I've given numbers in the past to kind of suggest that 5,000 customers that we had in the quarter,
obviously, a very strong quarter is going to be north of that, first part of the response.

Second part of the response, you would not normally expect to see that the new customers in the initial
quarter would be significant contributors to revenue but rather contributors to revenue growth over the
longer period of time. But there was a very strong performance from the new logo segment in terms of
customers that signed up with us in the quarter.

Our next question from Saket Kalia of Barclays.

Saket Kalia
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. Ken, maybe for you. You touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but can you
just talk a little bit about the new pricing options that you announced recently? Specifically, do you feel
like there is demand for that per user pricing for kind of access to the broader FortiCare and FortiGuard
portfolio? And what was sort of some of the early feedback as you maybe tested those options?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

We do see, going forward, especially like work from home or remotely, the producer lessens, which can
cover multiple devices, including the mobile bring-your-own-device work-from-home and also internal
inside enterprise company there like a cover multiple like not just the FortiGate as they go through to the
Zero Trust Network Access, but also some other like a web or mail, or some other application or kind of
part of infrastructure data center, they need access.

So that's per user license will make it much easier for the user, for the customer to really using all these
security service in the multiple part infrastructure model -- cover multiple product there. So that's where
we feel this is also very important. And on top of the current FortiCare, which cover all the products we
have and also the FortiGuard cover the product need a real-time update on the subscription, all these kind
of things there.

So we feel that FortiTrust is probably the trend in the future, but still needs some time to ramp up,
especially we see the Zero Trust Network Access starting to have a pretty quick growth opportunity, which
we -- the FortiGate have all this building. And also the identity, how to like kind of make sure the identity
across multiple infrastructure can easily kind of manage by user, we do all this to service also kind of
[ get ] very important.

Assuming some time to ramp up, but we do see there's a huge increase in demand from the customer.
That's also the reason we launched this new FortiTrust service.

Our next questions are from Michael Turits of KeyBanc.

Michael Turits
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Huge quarter, of course. I think we're both -- for Ken. I love people have been circling around and trying
to understand the strength and the upside. But I guess I'd like to just try to compare where the demand
was last year during 2020 to where it is this year and why it seems so much stronger? Has there been
a shift, say, from remote access focus to more breach? Or what has changed both qualitatively and
quantitatively that we're seeing this acceleration?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

I think last year, they're probably more like rush supporting whatever can make it working remotely. But
this year, they definitely see the infrastructure need to be operating to be changed to more supporting this
long term. So that's where you see a lot of new infrastructure design and how to support not just work
remotely, but also secure the whole infrastructure different part of infrastructure from the WAN access to
the internal segmentation and also even the 5G or SD-WAN or internal WiFi.

So there is a lot of new secure architecture covering multiple parts of our product. It's a very, very strong
interest. And also Keith mentioned the OT some others is because of whether the 5G IoT/OT, also that part
also rather strong.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, Michael, I think I would agree with Ken completely and maybe just to add if you think back about Q2
2020 specifically, at least for us, it was a quarter that was characterized probably by a lot of software. We
did very well with our software in the second quarter last year.

But on the flip side, anything that requires somebody to be on-premises in a data center or taking on a
large deployment or phase deployment or something like that. Q2 of last year, there really wasn't much of
that. Obviously, today, I think it's a year later, it's a very, very different environment in that regard. And
I do think you're also seeing the threat environment and things like the OT part of the business do very,
very well.

FORTINET, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Jonathan, I'd love to say that we're completely immune to chip shortages and such, but I can't say that.
Yes, I do think that as we talked about last quarter, the fact that our inventory turns of around 2 are
suggested that we have 6 months of inventory on hand. We do and some of the chip manufacturers were
pretty focused on a 52-week lead time. I think I feel very, very good about how the manufacturing and
operations team executed in the second quarter and how they're going about things for the third quarter
and for the rest of this year.

I would offer that as part of the forecasting process and the guidance setting process, that has become a
more significant input, if you will, into that process and making sure that we've accounted for it in terms
of our estimates of any challenges that we may have as we move through the rest of the year.

Our next question is from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research.

Benjamin James Bollin
Cleveland Research Company

Ken, historically, when there are periods like this where you see accelerated purchase behavior and a little
bit of a run on supply, if you will. Inevitably, there's a bit of a digestion period after the fact as customers
learn how to deploy and consume what they just purchased. Could you talk a little bit about how fabric in
the broader organization, either in sales or the channel is addressing or thinking about that potential risk
into the future?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes, we definitely see more and more customers see the benefit of the fabric -- Fortinet Fabric, which
come in multiple product and they could automate together. So that's also making the non-FortiGate grow
faster than the FortiGate and will be over $1 billion -- will reach over $1 billion this year.

So it's when a customer buy this multiple product, most of them are already like whether they are a
customer or already test them on the part and then just keep expanding beyond what the initial purchase
there. So we do see the interest as stronger and the non-FortiGate also keeping growth much faster
than the FortiGate, which keeping expanding from whatever the current installation base within the big
enterprise.

That's also the Gartner forecast see the integration, the consolidation starting kind of more and more
important for this big enterprise because to manage multiple products from different vendors is a much
higher cost compared to like the platform approach, which can multiple products cover different part
infrastructure, also integrate automate together with the Fortinet Fabric product that we have.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Ben, it's Keith. And to kind of build on Ken's comment, I think the -- that is the business strategy, right?
If we look at our installed base with customers and see how their adoption progresses in terms of the
number of fabric products that they had, over what period of time, we would certainly expect that to
continue on.

And then if you look in the current quarter, the new customers that we added, those are largely -- those
are buying firewalls, if you will, and maybe 1 or 2 things, if you will, from the fabric suite. But as we would
expect them, because I understand they have to digest and install the firewalls, but as we get -- as they
get to know and understand our product and our integration strategy more and more, that we'll have the
opportunity to come back in and sell them additional products and services as we go forward.

BTIG, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. Yes. So I'd like to stick with the topic of non-FortiGate and fabric and cloud and just sort
of the strength that you've been seeing there. Within fabric and cloud, what are like the biggest product
components that have the most momentum? And then how should we think about just the sustainability of
that demand longer term?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

The non-FortiGate, we have almost 30 products, most of those are developed internally and it's certainly
not gave up any individual product because it's up and down quarterly and also pretty much all contribute
kind of to the growth. We don't see any one or 2 too much kind of compared to the others. So that's
probably maybe sometime later, we can start get certain things out.

But at this stage, we do see -- it's also dependent on the customer environment, depending on the sales
supporting like some of them like to have an e-mail working with FortiGate, some is a website, some is
endpoint, some is like a network access control or some kind of sandboxing or cloud product.

It's quite a wide coverage of kind of even coverage all these like 20, 30 products. So that's where it's
very difficult to break out and then try to see the trend. While we do see the common message, really, to
consolidate, integrate, automate approach definitely has a huge benefit compared to our separate product
coming from different vendors.

[Operator Instructions] And our next question from Adam Tindle of Raymond James.

Adam Tyler Tindle
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to ask a strategic question to Ken. You had record quarterly free cash flow, so Keith's doing a
poor job at managing that more efficient balance sheet you talked about at the Analyst Day. But all joking
aside, Ken, you've got significant liquidity available, both on the balance sheet and can imagine lenders
beating down your door.

So if you could double click on the key tech areas that you would consider to enhance the value
proposition. I would just imagine that SASE is accelerating. You're the SD-WAN leader. For example,
some of those secure web gateway players in the private markets are more mature and would that be
an area of consideration or any other key areas that you would consider enhancing the value proposition
inorganically?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

We're definitely keeping -- closely watching out of the change in the industry and also new technology
ever since. But also, we want to keep the innovation and the culture we have in the last 21 years and also
keep the organic growth very strong. And probably the cash level and the investment strategy to Keith to
cover that.

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I think for us, I mean, we look at our R&D spending as a source of investment, not a traditional
capital allocation, but we are -- have historically been a buy versus -- pardon me, a build versus buy a
company, and that is to -- we feel strongly about the importance of having the platform to be integrated.

You do see us doing tuck-in acquisitions. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer to bring to market perhaps
because the technologies are things that we want to work with a little bit more before we bring them out.
So I don't think that's a surprise. I don't know that, that precludes us from doing something larger in the
future, but we'll look at those opportunities as they come up.

The continuing focus will be finding the opportunities to rebalance the balance sheet with a little bit of
[ debt ] and deploying some of the cash that we raised with from the debt offering, perhaps to repurchase
some share buyback, if you will. And at the same time, also, as we look out for the next 3 to 5 years, and
we anticipate continued growth, perhaps a little more investment, if you will, in our facilities footprint.

Our next question from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI.

Jyhhaw Liu
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And I would also like to add my congratulations on the great quarter. I had a question on SD-WAN. I was
wondering if you can perhaps unpack some of the drivers behind the continued momentum here. Whether
the current hybrid work environment has been a contributor behind this strength? And can you help us
understand what workers gradually returning to offices means for you?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Irvin, good question. The SD-WAN, we still see very, very strong demand and also a huge potential.
The approach we have is integrated security from our beginning and leverage the FortiGate has a
huge computing power part of FortiOS, FortiGate. We see a huge advantage compared to some other
competitor, whether using the universal CPE or some other approach, which is difficult to add any function
because the computing power limitation from a low-cost CPU.

So that's where we do believe we will be the leader, the #1 leader in SD-WAN space. If not now, definitely
will be soon. And SD-WAN offer kind of huge advantage like availability, the cost saving compared to the
traditional networking protocol NPLs or some other part. And also a lot of service provider also starting
kind of more focused on the SD-WAN or 5G, some other part, which also kind of fit in our kind of long-
term bigger picture we call secure-driven networking, which will be compared to today, all the networking
just through the connection and the speed and then the secure-driven networking also need to look in
application, the content, the device behind the user, behind an even different kind of location there.

So that's where we see how the kind of security function. And on top of networking has huge potential
and which SD-WAN, the Secure SD-WAN also just one part of it, but also the secure 5G and also
internal secure switch and secure WiFi, we do see a lot of potential to keeping security cover the whole
infrastructure.

I have a question on the attach of supported subscription to your partners this quarter because it looks
like you had strong momentum in product, got strong billings momentum also. It looks like the upside in
product didn't lead to maybe sort of similar upside in billings. Was there a difference in product mix, which
led to a difference in attach rate between subscription and support this quarter?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

No. I think we track our attach rates and our renewal rates, if you will, within those bands. You've seen in
it at the Analyst Day of plus or minus 2%. And I think that we were comfortably inside those bands. So

there was nothing unusual in that regard. I think that the services billings in total were probably -- and if
we go back and check, the best quarter that we've had in 4 years. So I feel -- I think we feel good about
both the services and the product performance in the quarter.

Imtiaz Ahmed Koujalgi
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just one follow-up. You gave us the mix of billings between FortiGate and non-FortiGate that's
-- is that the same kind of mix you have in the product line also? The 70-30, roughly, is that the mix of
non-FortiGate and FortiGate in the product line? Or is that mix different per product?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I don't have that number in front of me, but I don't have a reason -- I don't recall them being
significantly different when we looked at them, and I'm trying to recall what we made in the script just a
month ago in terms of product revenue.

Yes. I think we've offered FortiGate product revenue growth in the script as well as non-FortiGate product
growth. And we said they were both -- FortiGate was 40% and non-FortiGate was over 40%.

Peter M. Salkowski
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes. Those are growth rates. We haven't given a breakdown by mix for the 2 -- per product. We haven't
given FortiGate product and non-FortiGate product. As a mix, we haven't given that.

Operator

Our next question is from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank.

Patrick Edwin Ronald Colville
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I mean 41% product growth is extremely impressive. I guess the question is we're fielding from investors
around the cyclicality or kind of, I guess, whether it's secular growth. And so could you just help us
understand where the onetime benefits because of recent hacks or cause some recent events or post
coronavirus that led to this kind of very strong number? Or are you feeling that the following market,
there are some secular dynamics that we should be aware of?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes, we do see a lot of products starting to go into the -- a lot of the new part of our infrastructure or
kind of a new area. And that's also, like Keith mentioned, besides the top 5 vertical, we do see the other
vertical grow faster, much faster than the top 5 vertical is the government service provider, finance
service, education, high-tech, something like that.

But it's -- but also like among infrastructure, we do see like whether deploy on the WAN side, on the
whatever the smart city or some other kind of internal infrastructure within data center or even work-
from-home. There's a quite a broad kind of like a buying pattern compared to before. And that's also we
do believe we eventually will drive the additional service because once the product revenue go up and the
user service revenue will come in later.

And also plus the introduction of the new FortiTrust a few weeks out also add additional layer of potential
self-service for the future. It's definitely not -- definitely the secular -- like I mentioned earlier, we see
the change of the security infrastructure. It's not kind of a refresh or replace the traditional firewall,
which also, from time to time, need to be upgraded because the network has faster and faster, but also
expanding into the new infrastructure part and also kind of a new area will be seen or kind of grow faster
than the traditional medical finance service or some other part.

FORTINET, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I'd just add to Ken's comments. I think it was a quarter and it has been for a while now that we just
saw a lot of tailwinds. The tailwinds included whether it was SD-WAN or OT, as an example. The refresh
opportunity, if you will, is really an opportunity for us to -- we view as an opportunity to displace the
incumbents as compared to Fortinet that has 500,000 customers and 70 different firewall models. And we,
even today, we announced a new firewall in our press release.

It's not as if historically, you've seen blips with us in terms of spikes from refresh. But on the flip side,
some of the competitors, the legacy players have a shorter list of customers and a shorter list of products
and maybe you're not doing as well in Gartner Magic Quadrants as we are. So we view that as an
opportunity.

I do think that other tailwinds that came into the quarter, we talked about the verticals, Ken mentioned
it again. And also when I look at our customer sizes, whether SMB all the way to the Global 2000 did
very, very well. I think one thing that stood out for us was the mid-enterprise or the commercial part of
the business. That came on very, very strong in the quarter as well. So I think there was a long list of
tailwinds for us that worked in our favor on that product revenue growth number.

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Also, there were few, the introduction of the new product, the competing part advantage come from ASIC
is getting bigger and bigger compared to other competitor, which not only helping like replacing some of
their installation base, but also expanding the new area the internal network in high-speed environment,
but also has a much more function beyond the traditional network security like VPN.

Like we mentioned, whether from the Zero Trust Network Access or some other like a SASE or other part
like SD-WAN and the 5G security, which none of the traditional firewall have. And that's also what drives
additional like sales on the product and also the future service, which is not refresh compared to the
traditional firewall, which they don't have that function or don't have the computing power to keeping out
additional functionality that current performance is demanding.

So that's where we feel the strategy we have leveraged ASIC, our competing power advantage and give us
additional function and additional performance, much lower cost and starting working quite well.

Our next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. I want to talk about gross margin. If I'm correct, and if I'm not, it's not going to be the first time.
But if I'm correct, your gross margin had gone down about 140 bps sequentially. And I also checked it
versus consensus. It's lower -- 100 bps lower than consensus this quarter, next quarter and 200 bps below
consensus for the year, for the guidance.

So do I have any -- do I have a mistake in my calculation? Or if not, can you elaborate on gross margin?
Why is it lower sequentially in the guidance?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, I think what you're seeing, Tal, is the mix shift, right, the product mix shift versus the services mix
shift. You can do some pretty simple math in the second quarter, and you can get to -- when you have
41% product revenue growth, that's 61%, 62% gross margin versus the services that's fairly constant at
23% and 88% gross margin. That 25% swing in gross margin, when you take that back and you look at

a 20-point or 25-point overperformance in product, it works out to be just about one point, maybe just a
little bit north of one point on the gross margin line.

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. Also, you can look at the product gross margin, we actually improved year-over-year. Even the cost
kind of increase, but we do improve the product gross margin. And also, we do believe with the product
growth of 41%, we can have a lot of future growth in the service. That's also the reason we enhance the
FortiCare and the FortiGuard -- and the FortiTrust, which we do believe we're keeping -- making the future
-- I mean, the service starting to grow faster going forward.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

Is there any change in the pricing environment?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

There's no change in the discounting. Discounting for the quarter was neutral for us, if you will. We have
taken certain steps as we look forward to some of the changes in the cost structure that we're seeing from
our suppliers. And we've taken certain steps in terms of our own pricing going -- have not actually hit yet,
but they will hit in time for when we actually see those costs in our income statement.

Tal Liani
BofA Securities, Research Division

Can you elaborate on the last point? What does it mean? So do you expect the margins to decline? Or do
you expect to increase prices in anticipation?

Keith F. Jensen
CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I don't expect -- I do not expect margins to decline, no, beyond what will happen with the mix shift, if you
will. Between products and services, right, to the extent we continue to overperform in the product line
the way we just did, it's going to put pressure on the gross margin line.

But keep in mind, the operating margin came in right at the high end of the range. So I think we
successfully managed that. And it's certainly very consistent with what we foreshadowed earlier in the
year where we said within our framework, this was a year in which we would tilt towards growth. We
obviously did that putting up 35% billings growth and 41% product growth, and at the same time,
delivering 25% operating margin plus, right?

Ken Xie
Founder, Chairman & CEO

We also did more investment on the infrastructure, which is kind of making the service revenue gross
margin lower a little bit, but also will help in the future additional service come in.

from the ASIC chip, which we started to build 21 years ago or starting building other part of fabric
product, which integrate automate from Day 1 compared to competitor more come from acquisition makes
it very difficult to do the integration and automation and maintenance and organic growth there.

But on the other side, we do see there are certain market shifts are changing. We also want to take the
time like our SASE strategy. We have probably the only vendor working with a service provider to seed
their SASE need long-term good product for them at the same time, building some infrastructure as
some other things integrate within the FortiGate, FortiOS as a single product can cover both the SASE
virtual network access or some other [ fabric tier 1 ] security, making the product kind of more easy for
customers to deploy and seeding the big environment, faster environment, much, much better.
