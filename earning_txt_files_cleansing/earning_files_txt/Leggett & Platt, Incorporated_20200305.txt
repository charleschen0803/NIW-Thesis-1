LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

As announced on April 2, we suspended our full year 2020 guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding
the full year impact of COVID-19. Our first priority is the health and safety of our employees and their
families along with our customers and suppliers and the communities we serve around the world. Given
the unprecedented times, we have taken early and decisive action to protect our employees and ensure
a safe work environment as we possibly can. We have executed on several proactive measures to protect
the company and preserve capital, that Mitch and Jeff will discuss. While the environment continues to be
uncertain, we are committed to taking the proper steps to protect our employees and the financial well-
being of our company. I'll now turn the call over to Mitch.

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. The impact to our operations from COVID-19 developed in
China by January and across all geographies by mid-March. Throughout most of the first quarter, weekly
sales averaged approximately $90 million, consistent with 2019. However, in the final 2 weeks of the
quarter, we saw a steep and rapid sales decline across the company, with sales down roughly 40% and
50% versus the weekly average. Sales reached a low point in the first week of the second quarter, down
60% versus the weekly average, and have been recovering since then. Sales in the third week of the
quarter were down approximately 45% versus the weekly average. We continued to see gains in the
fourth week of the quarter in our Bedding operations but do not yet have full visibility across all of our
businesses. We quickly implemented cost savings measures across the company, aligning our variable cost
structure to current demand levels. About 3/4 of our operations have remained open to service customers
but with very limited production and staffing. As demand improves and production ramps back up, we
will begin to return our employees to work on a measured basis. We also moved quickly to reduce our
fixed costs, which historically have been approximately 25% of our total costs. We eliminated nonessential
spending across the company. We postponed the investments we spoke about on the last earnings call,
including network upgrades and enhancing our human resources organization and related technology. We
implemented a 50% salary reduction for our senior executive officers and a 50% cut in the cash portion
of our Board retainers. We expect these actions to reduce our fixed costs this year by approximately
$130 million to $150 million, with a benefit in the second quarter of nearly $50 million. We deeply regret
the impact of these measures on our employees affected by temporary layoffs, and we look forward to
bringing them back to work as soon as we can.

We also are closely monitoring all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. Our primary
focus is on customer collections. We also have taken steps to tightly control inventory. We dramatically
reduced purchases and production levels, and in most cases, we have been fulfilling customer orders out
of inventory. As demand has improved, we are in the process of increasing production in some of our
businesses. Our Bedding products segment initially suffered the most rapid and steep decline in demand.
Through mid-March, weekly average sales were approximately $45 million. In the final 2 weeks of the
quarter, sales decreased by over 40% and 60% versus the weekly average. By the third week of the
second quarter, sales were over 50% of the weekly average. Demand continued to improve last week. I
anticipate that sales were roughly 65% to 70% of the average last week. The U.S. bedding industry has
been severely impacted by widespread closures of traditional retailers as government shutdown orders
went into place. E-commerce channels have fared somewhat better.

In our Specialized Products segment, weekly sales averaged $20 million through mid-March. In the final
2 weeks of the first quarter, sales decreased roughly 50% as the pandemic spread across Europe and
North America. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down over 60% as automotive OEM
plants remain idle. Our Asian Automotive business was the first to experience declines as the Chinese
government ordered shutdowns in late January. We restored most of our China production by the end of
February but then faced a global decline in demand across all regions. Currently, all of our European and
North American Automotive operations are idle, and our Asian facilities are operating at a reduced rate.
In response, we significantly reduced fixed cost and variable costs across the business. In the European
and North American automotive markets, we see several OEMs planning to restart production in mid-May.
Regardless of when production resumes, we expect the supply chain restart to be complex and take time
to ramp up.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

In the Furniture, Flooring and Textile Products segment, average weekly sales were slightly over
$25 million throughout the first quarter. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down
approximately 30% versus the weekly average.

Looking forward, our strategic priorities for the second quarter are optimizing cash flow, understanding
changes in demand and corresponding opportunities, and planning for expanded production across our
operations as markets reopen and demand improves.

In early March, we formed a cross-functional crisis response team that meets daily. We help our business
leaders manage items such as responding to workplace health and safety issues, establishing protocols,
interpreting government orders and securing personal protective equipment. The team developed a
comprehensive handbook to document new work procedures and changes to production necessary to
facilitate proper social distancing. Our business leaders are actively implementing training and change
management initiatives to drive and maintain new ways of operating. I am incredibly proud of our
business leaders and the crisis response team. They have done a terrific job. They are collaborating,
adapting and rising to the challenge. Their efforts will help all of our employees feel safe and be safe both
today and as we ramp up production. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Mitch, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to address the dividend. In keeping with
their regular practice, our Board of Directors expect to make a decision on our second quarter dividend
during the Board meeting later this month. The decision will take the evolving economic conditions into
consideration. Next, as Mitch discussed in his comments, our primary financial focus since mid-March has
been on generating cash, disciplined uses of cash and retaining liquidity in response to COVID-19 impacts.

Commercial paper is our primary source of short-term liquidity. Our commercial paper program is backed
by a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of leading banks. The credit facility's
financial covenant is a debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. Prior to March 31, the covenant required
debt to remain below 4.25x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. As of March 31, the covenant stepped down to
3.5x. This was a planned onetime stepdown when we increased the size of the credit facility in connection
with our January 2019 acquisition of ECS. The stepdown effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under
the credit facility. The maximum that we can draw is now 3.5x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. At March 31,
our debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility, equated to a maximum
borrowing capacity of $650 million. On March 31, our total liquidity was $734 million, comprised of $506
million in cash on hand and $228 million in available capacity under the commercial paper program. This
past Friday, May 1, we had $372 million in remaining capacity under the revolver, with $278 million in
commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average maturity of approximately 48 days and a weighted
average interest rate of 2.53%. Because we do not know how long the significant demand decreases
across our markets will continue, we are currently working with our bank group to amend covenants in
our revolving credit facility. In addition, we have taken several steps to reduce our uses of cash for the
remainder of the year. As Mitch discussed, we cut nonessential spending and reduced fixed costs by an
estimated range of $130 million to $150 million, the large majority of which will benefit cash. We reduced
our capital expenditure budget by over 60% to approximately $60 million for the year. We are halting
acquisitions and our scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year totaled $37.5 million.
Importantly, we have no significant debt maturities until August 2022. We also expect a 2020 cash flow
benefit of approximately $15 million from the payroll tax deferral provision of the Cares Act based on our
latest estimates. This provision allows payment deferral of the employer portion of Social Security taxes
for the remainder of 2020. These employer taxes will be paid over the following 2 years: half in 2021 and
the other half in 2022.

Concerning our credit exposure and risk, we increased our accounts receivable reserve in the first quarter.
We recognized $12 million in bad debt expense, primarily from COVID-19 impacts on our customers and
risk across our account portfolio, particularly among our bedding customers. If this situation persists, our
credit exposure could continue to deteriorate. In summary, we remain committed to our balance sheet and

are being proactive to maximize our liquidity as well as our flexibility through this uniquely uncertain time.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Karl for closing remarks.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Jeff. We are extremely proud of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our employees and how
they have pulled together to support each other and their communities. Our employees are providing
components for hospital beds and medical mattresses, helping solve supply chain issues and ventilator
production, providing wire and fabric for face mask producers, and in some cases, converting our internal
resources to face mask production.

Finally, our Specialty Foam chemicals team has found a way to produce hand sanitizer to provide to our
own facilities.

To our employees, thank you for your dedication and resilience in these uncertain times. As Mitch and Jeff
explained, and like so many of you in communities around the world, we are facing significant business
challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These unprecedented circumstances have forced us
to make very difficult decisions as we take steps to reduce costs during this period of drastic decreases
in demand. The decisions to temporarily lay off a large number of our employees around the world was
one of the most difficult of my career, as our strength has always been and will continue to be our people.
Please know we are focused on doing everything we can to return our employees to work. Leggett has
successfully navigated several challenging business and economic conditions in its storied 137-year
history. Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets,
focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be
successful. Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity
of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow, and we
remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our
long-term vision for the company and are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused
on the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Wendy.

Wendy M. Watson
Director of Investor Relations
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention, and we will be glad to answer your
questions. Karl will direct our question-and-answer session as the group answers your questions. In order
to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we request that you ask only 1 question and then yield to
the next participant. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue and we will
answer those questions as well. Sherri, we're ready to begin the Q&A session.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Baugh with Stifel.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I was wondering particularly, I guess, about Auto and Airlines. And I'm thinking a little longer-term here
and just curious as to your thoughts, these are high-margin businesses. There's a lot of damage going
on to these end markets and how you think about the recovery of those businesses post virus? And
whether or not there may be some permanent cost structure changes that are needed to get to previous
profitability levels and how easy that would be to achieve?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

First off, John, thank you for your kind comments. Our teams are working really well together, and I'm
proud to work with this dedicated group of people, and I appreciate your sensitivity.

We're going to throw Steve Henderson right into it. Steve, if you don't mind, please take a swing at John's
Auto and Aero questions. And Mitch, certainly, if you have any additional details you want to layer on,
please do so.

Steven K. Henderson
EVP and President of Specialized Products Segment, Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products Segment

Thanks, Karl. John, well, there's a lot in there in your question. But as Mitch mentioned in his comments,
it's a very complicated supply chain, and it's going to take some time to work through here in the short
term. So North America and Europe stopped very quickly and that left not much opportunity to build
ahead any kind of inventory or critical components. So restarting the supply chain, which is starting this
week, to some extent, will take pretty significant effort. There will be intermittent stoppages due to the
interdependence of the supply chain, countries, states, all of the different restrictions that are out there
right now hamper that from operating as effectively as it could. We believe we'll see it starting out with
single shifts, shorter shifts, probably slower line rates and shifting content towards stuffed vehicles that
are easier to build. We know our customers are going to have to proceed very carefully like us. They're
going to have to monitor their employees, have PPE there for them, implement new processes. So we
think it's going to start off slow, as these are kind of trial runs of the social distancing. A little further out,
it will probably push model changeovers out a bit. So typically, there is a model change coming up here.
EPA can't certify vehicles, costumers haven't been able to do the engineering and certification validations.
So we can see those kinds of things push out 2 to 3 months. Longer term, we see that some of the macros
of the industry of connected, autonomous and shared, are definitely going to be impacted in the short
term, particularly around autonomous and shared vehicles. The return on autonomous is out too far, and
shared just because of the COVID element of it. So we'll see many of those developments get pushed out
a little further. Our belief is, though, the areas that we play in, in comfort and convenience, will matter
more in the future regardless of where the market's headed, and we'll continue to be a pretty relevant
supplier in the future. And this can take probably a few years to work its way through. So that's it for
Automotive.

In Aerospace, we held up pretty well in the first quarter. We were less impacted at the end of the first
quarter, but we started to feel that a little bit going into Q2. Extreme disruptions to air travel, we expect
that long-term aircraft production will be reduced because of passenger demand and also the airlines'
financial condition. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced production cuts as a result, but we don't really
know what that means at this time. But we are expecting that, again, this will take some time to work its
way out.

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Our next question is from Bobby Griffin with Raymond James.

Robert Kenneth Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

First, I guess I want to talk a little bit about the health of the Bedding and Furniture Distribution Networks
here in the U.S. A large part of the retail outlets that Leggett's components end up in are by small and
medium-sized businesses. So can you maybe share any commentary or color on what you're hearing
about how those businesses and customers and those retail outlets, how they made it through this crisis
here in April and kind of what their health is going forward because I think that will be very dependent on
how the recovery trends for Bedding in 2020 and 2021?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Bobby, I'll take a swing at it. Mitch, certainly join in at any time. But what we're hearing is the small
independents, Bobby, are actually faring reasonably well. They tend to be in smaller communities that
are less impacted and the sales through those channels have actually been stronger than average. So
rural brick-and-mortar is doing fine. The larger, more heavily leveraged chains that had been impacted by
private equity over the last few years are not faring as well because they're more highly levered. But long
term, I think that there'll be a continued mix to e-commerce. We're certainly seeing that in e-commerce
distribution being stronger than brick-and-mortar. But to your point and to your -- our shared concern is
long-term post recovery, the goodness, the ability for product to be distributed through a supply chain
ultimately to Mrs. Consumer in a way that is -- fits her preferences and her desires to experiencing the
product and/or buy from -- in an omnichannel environment is important. But we haven't really seen a
lot of negative impact. The fact that stores are starting to come back to live -- life, we've seen some
early -- just in the last few days, a little bit of recovery in Home Furniture. The governor of California's
announcement last night that he was going to start to open some retail distribution, certainly is positive. It
depends on how that's all phased. But -- I rambled a whole lot, but Mitch is always more substantive than
I am. But Mitch, do you have anything to add?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Well, just a little bit. I don't agree that I'm more substantive. But I think you're right that it sort of
accelerated the shift towards the omnichannel environment that we've seen coming. And I think that,
for sure, the smaller rural retailers are hanging in there. But I think we're seeing everyone get creative,
right? And even the, some of the larger brick-and-mortar retailers focusing on online channels and having
innovative ways to have people feel safe in the stores. So I think that it's just accelerated the dynamic
that was happening previously.

Robert Kenneth Griffin
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess, secondly, this one is for Jeff, I just want to maybe ask around
the working capital opportunity. Trying to get a sense of just how much of a working capital opportunity
is there in the second quarter to work through some of the inventory that was already made? And then
in particular, just without asking for or looking for actual guidance, but is there -- can that create an
opportunity where 2Q can just be a better cash flow generation quarter than 3Q, I mean, as 1Q '20 as you
work through that?

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Bobby, and thanks for the question. Your synopsis of it is, I would say, very accurate in terms of
the dynamics we're expecting between first quarter and second quarter. And obviously, we're not giving
any guidance, but when you look at directionally, what we're expecting in terms of working our way
through the inventory, as Mitch mentioned in his remarks, that's one of the critical components. And the
other is that we are intently, intently focused around continue customer collections in terms of reducing

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

our accounts receivable. So the combination of those, in our opinion, will lend itself to an improvement
from a directional trend perspective from 1Q to 2Q as we think about working capital and, i.e., cash flow
improvement.

Operator

Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

My first question is just can you talk a little bit to what you're seeing on the input cost side of things.
We've obviously seen a lot of significant deflation coming through in some key commodities. Can you talk
to how we should be thinking of that rolling through over the next few quarters?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Boy -- Susan, that's a great question. That -- the question's better than the answer, that what we saw or
what the industry saw is from a -- purely from a steel perspective -- scrap trade down pretty significantly
in April. It looks like it's going to trade up in May because of the lack of availability of scrap. There's not
a lot of scrap being collected at these low prices, and it's not being produced because of really no North
American automotive production. And to Steve's point, that will start slowly. So it -- I would expect it's
-- steel is always a supply and demand issue, and there's not a whole lot of demand. I would expect that
steel cost will continue to stay somewhat muted but if demand picks up before supply, remembering
there's a lot of productive capacity that's idled right now, we may see a couple of months of blip where
costs do accelerate. On the input cost for Foam Chemicals, we're seeing deflation. But to be real honest
with you, in that whole sector, there's not a whole lot of demand. So -- not everybody is able to make
use of these lower input costs. So it's a great question. I'm not sure that we're confident that we're going
to have the benefit from input cost deflation going into the back end of the year as people might think,
purely because of supply and demand dynamics.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. My next question is just kind of building on Bobby's question. If we go back, 2009
was a record year in terms of Leggett's ability to generate cash. As you think about what was going on in
that downturn and in that environment and compare and contrast that to what you're seeing today, can
you talk to Leggett's overall ability to generate cash? How we should be thinking about that relative to
what we've seen in past downturns? And what it could mean for the business? And maybe especially as we
think about things like the dividend and some of those things that have always been really important and
kind of core to Leggett.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's a good question. Again, it's so different. You'll remember in the 2008, 2009 time frame, I was
the Chief Operating Officer. So I've been through this. And it was very different in that the decline was
slow and gradual, and we were -- we didn't have the kind of instantaneous cliff. We didn't have -- we had
layoffs but not mass layoffs. We didn't have -- as a macro economy, we didn't have 30 million people file
for unemployment in a 3-week period. So much of the demand that we experience is based on consumer
confidence, and we have a consumer that doesn't know, frankly, what to think. So they're just completely
different dynamics. What we don't know today is depth or duration. The company's ability to generate
cash is significant. Jeff's answer was spot on, in that cash generation in 2Q should be really pretty good,
but it all depends on demand in Q3 and 4 from a sales perspective and to be able to get that operating
income married by cash generation, which is what we really experienced in 2008 and '09. So it's distinctly
different. I will tell you that the portfolio is much healthier today than it was in that time frame. Big cash
generation -- generators in the bedding supply chain in Automotive once it restarts. So we're in a better
spot in a admittedly more difficult environment that's much more difficult to predict and is very uncertain

with volatility. That's the -- it's maybe embarrassing for us not to be able to guide, but heck, we don't
know if there's going to be a second wave. We just don't know. We're appreciative of the trends that we're
experiencing in April. But I mean, heck, that doesn't mean that they'll continue. It always feels like we're 1
day away from bad news.

Operator

Our next question is from Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

I guess, 2 questions. First, on production. Are you at the point now where you can run production in
parallel with demand? Or is this still -- does production need to run below demand to bring down inventory
as we stand today?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Mitch?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Keith, so I think it varies by BU. We see, depending upon the demand levels. As we mentioned, in
Automotive, we're running production in Asia at around 60%, 65% level, but idle in North America and
Europe. In our domestic Bedding assets, we've seen demand pick up in April, and we're restarting some
facilities. So it really varies by business unit. But I think in most cases, we're pivoting towards increasing
production levels.

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And I guess, second question is on the dividend. I know you're going to let us know, the board
meeting on the dividend. I guess, why are we not seeing an announcement today, what's going to happen
in the next 1.5, 2 weeks that's going to sway the decision one way or the other?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Keith, this is Karl. Historically, you would have not seen an announcement today. The dividend is
always considered at the May Board meeting. The May Board meeting is scheduled for a week from Friday,
so the 15th. And really what we were -- we knew that we were going to be asked the question. And the
answer is based on, as is our typical course, the Board will make a decision. It will make a decision based
on the evolving economic conditions. As Jeff said in his prepared remarks, we're working with the banks
on some covenant relief and all of those things will be considered. Contemporary sales trends. Every week
of data is helpful. So continued cash generation. So everything is being considered, but nothing's changed.
I mean the Board considers dividend in May every year. It just happens that the May Board Meeting is
a little later based on board members' availability. It hasn't changed. It's been scheduled for May 15 for
probably 3 years.

Our next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.

Robert Adam Friedner
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

It's actually Bobby Friedner on for Peter. I just wanted to ask about near-term sales trends. So it's good
to see that there was some stabilization in mid-April. This lines up with the timing of government stimulus
checks going out, and we've heard other Bedding and Furniture companies talk about acceleration

mid-April. So my question is, do you think growth has bottomed out here near term? Or is there a
consideration that trends could slow again once stimulus check benefits wane?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Bobby, that is a question that, frankly, the answer -- potential answer, haunts Mitch and I, we don't
know. We have that concern that we're -- yes, we just don't know. That's why we can't give guidance.
It's so difficult to forecast. When you look at the significant number of people that are unemployed in this
country, many of them are making more money on unemployment than they were working. And then
you augment that with the stimulus check. And is that what's driven recent demand? We just don't know.
Typically, Bobby, as you know, this would be the season when normal Bedding and Furniture starts to pick
up some acceleration moving into Memorial Day. But there's nothing normal about this year. So, a great
question we don't know the answer to.

Robert Adam Friedner
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

All right, fair enough. And maybe separately, just curious, as you look at different countries reopening
economies in the Asia area. Are there any interesting insights or learnings you could share with us?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Mitch, why don't you take a swing at that one? You and Steve?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

All right. I'll take a shot at it. And Steve, you can help clean it up. I don't think anything that's really
uniquely insightful, unfortunately. As our China production went down in January in Automotive, and of
course, we learned a lot of lessons. The team did a great job in establishing protocols and figuring out
how to just handle that situation. And pretty quickly got back up to 85%, 95% of our productive capacity
by the end of February, and then the global demand just wasn't there. And so we haven't really seen the
impact yet of the Asian or European loosening that's taken place from a demand perspective. I think that's
still to come. Steve, anything that you would add or change?

Steven K. Henderson
EVP and President of Specialized Products Segment, Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products Segment

No, I'd just say, in terms of the market, it's returning slowly in most of the areas in China. And that's
probably because domestic consumption has increased quite a bit in recent years. And now people are
just slowly returning back to normal. And as the stores are opening, automotive dealerships are opening,
they're now able to go back in, but they are doing so cautiously.

Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

There's 2 more questions that I just want to touch on. The first is, can you give us some sense of the
decremental margins in the business? And then either by segment or on a consolidated level, I'm not
sure how to think about that, and especially given some of the work that you've done over the last, call
it, 18 months or so in divesting some of those segments and things like that, what does that mean as the
volume comes down? And then how should we think about the incremental margin as well, as things do
slowly start to come back?

LEGGETT & PLATT, INCORPORATED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Mitch, you want to take a swing at that?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

Yes, Karl, happy to. Susan, yes, I think that our incremental or decremental margins are somewhere
averaging in the 25% to 35% range, and they vary by business. I think that you're right, the measures
that we've done last year on the restructuring and again, by moving swiftly and deeply to take cost out
as this occurred, will help us. So I think our goal would be able to maintain that kind of margin range and
reduce our fixed costs. So we will have to adapt to the new demand level, whatever that turns out to be.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And is it safe to think, Mitch, that your specialty businesses are probably at the higher end of that
range, while something like Furniture Bedding is maybe a little lower?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

I think it's right to think that those are generally at the higher end of the range, but there's not a really
wide spread.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up question, is a bit more strategic in that one of the
outcomes of this whole situation could be that we just generally see consumers shopping more online and
especially perhaps for Bedding, just given what we've been seeing in that industry. And I know that you
had more recently, kind of, gotten deeper into that side of the industry, working with some of the more e-
commerce aligned businesses there. Has your strategy around that changed at all? Or is it changing given
what we're seeing? And how do we think about your ability to service that demand, if we really do see it
staying higher even as things do kind of normalize or stabilize in the retail environment?

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Susan, it's -- Mitch and I were talking about this very subject early this morning. Thank goodness
that we own ECS. That ECS's ability to make specialized products that are kind of heavy weighted to
an omnichannel environment is -- was a good move, and in hindsight, is proving that the hypotheses
that we developed over omni-channel a few years ago is being accelerated by this unfortunate set of
circumstances. But don't think that just the digital native players are the recipients of that, that the
traditional OEM mattress manufacturers and the traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are doing a
tremendous amount of online business. So it's getting blurry. So I don't think we have any constraints.
There's learnings that we've developed since the ECS acquisition that will prove to be extremely valuable
going forward. But Mitch, do you want to add anything?

J. Mitchell Dolloff
President, COO, President of Bedding Products Segment & Director

No, Karl, I think you are right on target. I think it confirms the strategy, the path that we were headed
down, and we're seeing it play out across, as you said, both the direct-to-consumer channels as well as
other e-comm players.

Our next question is from John Baugh with Stifel.

As a follow-up, I wanted to jump into the AR. And I guess 2-part question. Did you see losses increasing
or was the adjustment you made in the reserve just sort of a conservative forecast? And secondly, what
does focus on collections mean? Are you requiring cash on delivery? I mean, at the time when presumably
some of your customers are looking to push out their payments, it sounds like you're trying to make the
opposite happen.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

Yes, I'll take part of it. And Jeff and Mitch will, probably, all have comments on this. There was an attempt
a little bit from some of our customers to push out and we have pushed that back. We have an obligation
to pay our suppliers, and we believe our customers have an obligation to pay us. So we have taken a
pretty rigid position that we expect our customers to pay us. We feel it's an obligation, it's a commitment
that they have to us. We have not seen a deterioration. Actually, we've seen somewhat of an improvement
in AR. The answer to your first question, John, is no, we didn't really see -- didn't at all see an increase in
losses. But Jeff, why don't you walk through the FASB guidance and why the reserve was enhanced?

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. John, yes, from our perspective, John, one of the things that we implemented in the first quarter
was the CECL, current expected credit losses. And as part of that, we went through and looked at the risk
profile of our customer base across all of our markets in anticipation of what potential expected losses
could be, especially in this pandemic type of environment. And we felt it was prudent to increase the
reserve, based on that assessment.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

And I assume the AR balance will come down partly -- largely because revenues are going -- are falling?
Or is there something else in terms of days of receivables that's going to change as well, Jeff?

Jeffrey L. Tate
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, John. No, we do not expect our DSO. In fact, our DSO, as Karl mentioned, has actually been
improving at this point here. So from our perspective, we're going to continue to maintain that discipline
as we move forward into 2Q.

Karl G. Glassman
Chairman & CEO

And that monetization of AR and the inventories is really what drives the answer to Bobby's question of
second quarter cash generation.

Operator

There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Watson for
closing comments.

Wendy M. Watson
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, everybody, for participating today, and we will talk to you again next quarter.

Operator
Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank
you for your participation.
