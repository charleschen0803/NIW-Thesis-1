UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings
Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a
reminder, this call is being recorded.

Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S.
federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations.

A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and
periodic filings.

This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts
is available on the financial reports and SEC filings section of the company's investors page at
www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we
issued this morning in our Form 8-K dated January 15, 2020, which may be accessed from the Investors
page of the company's website.

I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann.
Please go ahead.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Six weeks ago, we had the privilege of spending the day
with many of you at our annual Investor Conference, providing an in-depth look at the accelerating
opportunities we see to serve more people more deeply and to grow strongly into 2020 and well beyond.

As we conclude 2019 and step into the new year, the performance of our business strengthens our
confidence in the themes, opportunities and outlooks of that day, as evidenced by today's results. We
remain highly focused on driving affordability, innovating with consumer and customer responsive
products and services, improving operating performance and advancing NPS.

Full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share were stronger than our Investor Conference outlook, growing
17% for the year to $15.11 per share. Full year revenues exceeded $242 billion, growing $16 billion over
2018 with notable gains in our Medicare, care delivery and pharmacy care services businesses. Full year
cash flows were $18.5 billion or 1.3x net income.

We finished the year encouraged by continued performance improvement in Medicaid, early market
interest in our new innovative line of employer-sponsored benefit offerings and 2020 individual Medicare
Advantage annual enrollment results, which were our strongest ever. Within our Medicare Advantage
offerings, including dual eligible growth, we expect to serve nearly 700,000 more people in 2020, the
upper end of the range of performance offered at our Investor Conference.

Our fourth quarter medical and operating cost positions continued to improve meaningfully enterprise-
wide with ample opportunity for further progress on both of these fronts. And our NPS improved nicely in
2019 across our businesses, particularly within network care providers, enrollees in Medicare Advantage
and Dual Special Needs Plans as well as patients served by our OptumCare and pharmacy care services
businesses.

Improved costs and higher satisfaction propelled by meaningful innovation allow us to contribute more
comprehensively to the development and deployment of the kind of next-generation health system needed
in the U.S. and globally: a more forward-looking, modern health system built around the people we serve,
seamlessly woven into their lives; simple, convenient, transparent and compassionate. A health system

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

that is more affordable creates a better experience for both patients and physicians and improves health
outcomes.

The health system we are helping to build will better meet the personalized needs of people. It leverages
the next-generation data analytics, such as the individual health record, to empower patients and their
doctors with actionable intelligence that drives next-best actions to improve decision-making in real time.

We are committed to a future where every person has access to high-quality, affordable health care
that meets their unique health care needs and financial means. We're employing specific actions to help
achieve this, driving better health outcomes and aiming ultimately to reduce the health care cost trend to
general inflation levels, even with an aging, more chronically ill population.

Notably, the bipartisan repeal of the ACA taxes in December was a strong step towards improving
affordability for Americans. It will greatly assist those who have been most affected by the cost of those
taxes, especially seniors, small employers and those who are individually insured.

As we continue to do better for those we serve, we will grow, helping improve the health system one
person at a time, intensely focused on driving improved consumer and physician experiences.

Looking to the years ahead, our strengthening capabilities and diversified complementary businesses
operating in a large growing health care market position us well to achieve our long-term adjusted
earnings per share growth rate objective of 13% to 16% while we continue, as always, to invest in the
future for sustainable market-leading performance and advancing shareholder returns.

With that, let me turn it to UnitedHealth Group President and Optum Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Witty,
to discuss Optum's results and momentum heading into the new year.

Andrew Philip Witty
Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Dave. At Optum, we're encouraged and humbled by the expanding opportunities to grow and
serve more people more deeply. There's a distinct energy and eagerness across our businesses as we
enter 2020.

In 2019, Optum revenues reached $113 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Total operating earnings
grew 14% to $9.4 billion.

OptumHealth revenues reached $30.3 billion in 2019, up 26%, led by OptumCare, our care delivery
business. We're steadily expanding into new geographies and expanding the depth and breadth of services
in existing regions to better provide patients with the highest quality, convenient and affordable health
services.

One measure that helps illustrate how we are serving people more comprehensively is revenue per
consumer served, which grew 26% in the quarter. This measure will continue strongly advancing as we
further build out our integrated care delivery network.

Turning to OptumRx. Revenues of $74.3 billion grew 7%, even with the previously discussed impact of
a single large customer transition. The 2020 selling season for core pharmacy benefit services has now
mostly concluded, and it was our strongest ever.

Through our other pharmacy care and specialty drug businesses, given our current positions, we see
significant opportunity to more fully serve patients' pharmacy needs in their communities and drive better
adherence and clinical outcome.

At OptumInsight, revenues of $10 billion grew 11%, and the revenue backlog was up 14% to $19.3 billion.
OptumInsight, perhaps more than any of our other businesses, has a dual role. It has both unmatched
capability to help distinguish our other businesses and serves as a profitable, growing, externally facing
business on its own.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

I'd like to spend a few extra minutes this morning on how we view OptumInsight and why we're
encouraged by its potential. I'll start with the foundations: first, deep data and advanced analytics are at
the core, supporting modern technologies and platforms to make the health system more interoperable,
transparent and efficient; second, research, consulting and large-scale managed services enabled by data
analytics and digital and operational innovations make the consumer experience simpler, smarter and
more compassionate; and third, clinical expertise, combined with rich data and analytics, drive measurably
better patient care and outcomes, reduces friction while lowering the total cost of care.

We're connecting the health system to deliver better outcomes, lower cost and an improved experience
for patients and their clinicians. This includes developing the connective infrastructure that integrates
clinical systems, revenue management platform and administrative claims transactions to enable critical
bidirectional data exchange. Our solutions are harmonizing and organizing billions of transactions while
applying considerable intelligence through our advanced technologies, clinical oncology and data analytics
capabilities. We want to ensure critical decision support information gets to the right people at the right
time with rigorous protocols to protect patient privacy, all while offering full transparency of health system
performance on both quality and cost.

Our Optum360 business helps health systems and hospitals improve revenue performance and patient
experience. We deploy natural language processing for computer-assisted coding and documentation and
provide data interchange and information exchange solutions as well as patient access services. Optum360
now manages about $70 billion in annual billings for unaffiliated customers.

More than 5 billion pages of clinical documents are processed annually by our natural language processing
engines. These are used in a variety of other applications and customer bases to help inform clinical
actions and create administrative efficiencies from the more than 80% of the clinical record that is
essentially free text, such as physician notes and discharge summaries.

Payment Integrity is among OptumInsight's strongest growing businesses. We provide compliance and
cost-containment solutions, both prior to and following the payment of a claim. We offer a comprehensive
portfolio of services for data mining and predictive modeling to help over 250 national, state and local
health plans and others ensure appropriate payment for services, saving billions annually.

Within the OptumInsight technology businesses, we apply advanced analytics and deep learning models to
health care data covering nearly 240 million people to help optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the cost
of care. Key offerings include population health, risk analytics and technology support.

And our research and consulting businesses provide thought leadership and expertise that reaches more
than 200,000 leaders across the sector. Importantly, this business keeps us at the forefront of how health
systems and providers are thinking about and approaching the future, and drives deeper, more integrated
customer relationships across the broader Optum businesses.

As we turn into the new decade, we stand at a potentially transformative moment where the application of
leading 21st century technologies and machine-powered analytical protocols will open up for the first time
the opportunity to create ever more precise predictions of individual and system health status and risk.
This will accelerate a much more focused set of interventions to improve outcomes. I have no doubt this
will be an increasingly critical element of our Optum-wide goal of improving clinical outcomes, quality and
affordability.

Now I'll turn the call over to Dirk McMahon, UnitedHealthcare Chief Executive Officer.

Dirk C. McMahon
Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Andrew.

UnitedHealthcare is deeply embedded in every aspect of the health system, from how to finance and pay
for health care, to engaging people and aligning incentives to promote healthier behaviors and better
medicine to improve overall health at lower costs.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

UnitedHealthcare revenues grew by more than $10 billion to $194 billion in 2019. Operating earnings
increased by 13% or $1.2 billion to $10.3 billion, led by the strength in our Medicare and Dual Special
Needs businesses. As Dave noted, we're off to a strong start in Medicare Advantage this year.

I'd like to quickly share how we are helping to build a better health system: first, improving affordability;
second, engaging and serving people; third, advancing product innovation; and fourth, serving through
hands-on, data-driven clinical care.

Let's start with affordability because that is the gating factor for greater access to care and improving the
consumer experience. One of our goals is to engage more deeply with the highest-performing physicians
and other clinicians to advance both quality and affordability. We know these high-performing providers
achieve considerably better health outcomes while lowering the total cost of care.

Our medical cost trend over the last 5 years has strongly outperformed the national average. We are
committed to driving significantly lower rates of health care spending growth than the industry. We see
billions of additional dollars in potential savings for consumers and customers from areas such as our site
of service initiatives and more deeply embedding digital tools to reduce the administrative burden for
physicians.

We are also using digital and physical strategies to engage consumers in new ways to simplify their
experience, reduce their financial burden and lower the total cost of care. For example, for the nearly
0.5 million people enrolled in our Motion program, we offer incentives for increased individual mobility.
People can earn more than $1,000 a year when they achieve defined walking frequency and intensity
targets. People enrolled in Motion are achieving better health at a meaningfully lower cost. That is why
we're expanding this program and extending product designs that reward stronger consumer engagement
and align incentives with their doctor.

A third area is product innovation. We are seeing early signs of customer interest in our innovative new
offerings and consumer-centric products that better align to the unique needs and financial means of
people, while engaging them in managing their health. Some examples are: Harmony, a new collaboration
with OptumCare providers, unites high-quality care and coverage, creating a more integrated and effective
consumer experience with as much as 20% savings for our fully insured customers; All Savers offers small
employers with highly flexible, affordable health plans and reduces employee out-of-pocket costs with low
or no preventative and primary care coverage; NexusACO, enables large employers to offer a single ACO-
based plan nationwide, incentivizing employees to choose high-performing providers and driving better
outcomes through care coordination; Bind provides first-dollar coverage and allows people to add coverage
on demand for planned procedures offered by high-value providers following rigorous care pathways based
on best-known science while costing approximately 15% less than comparable plans; and finally, our
Virtual First product is attractive to the digital-first generation. This new product offers $0 copay, 24/7
virtual care support at a lower price than traditional products.

These are some examples of our innovation focus in health benefits, and you should expect more as
we redouble our efforts to engage consumers in more impactful ways and accelerate our growth in this
category.

Lastly, we are deploying relevant information at the point-of-care to improve the way care is received and
managed. Point of Care Assist is a tool that puts real-time patient information at the fingertips of doctors
and their EMRs, providing a seamless clinical workflow experience. This improves adherence to clinical
protocols, facilitates real-time authorization approvals and helps refer the patient to premium designated
specialists. Utility of this tool is significant for all, as doctors save time and money, consumers avoid cost
surprises and, most importantly, health outcomes are improved.

As we look to 2020 and beyond, there is a $900 billion untapped Managed Care market opportunity in
health benefits, much of it in government programs where we have grown strongly, and we look to serve
more people more deeply across the system.

Now I'll turn it over to John Rex, CFO of UnitedHealth Group.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Office of the Chief Executive

Thank you, Dirk.

This morning we reported revenues of $242 billion, up $15.9 billion or 7% year-over-year, driven by
double-digit revenue growth in Medicare and across Optum. Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of $3.90
per share grew 19% and brought full year earnings to $15.11, growth of 17%. Cash flows from operations
of $18.5 billion grew 18% over 2018 to 1.3x net income, better than anticipated partly due to timing
factors.

Our balance sheet and return metrics remain strong with return on equity of almost 26%. We ended the
year with a debt-to-capital ratio of around 40%, even with over $10 billion of deployment for business
combinations and CapEx, $5.5 billion in share repurchases and a 20% dividend increase.

Medical reserves developed favorably in the fourth quarter by $270 million, including $150 million from
2019. Overall, medical costs were well-managed, resulting in an 82.5% medical care ratio for full year
2019.

We continue to be highly attentive to operating costs as part of our overall affordability agenda. In 2019,
our operating cost ratio of 14.5% improved 50 basis points, reflecting 60 basis points of operating cost
productivity and the deferral of the health insurance tax, partially offset by the effect of business mix
changes and continued investments in innovation, service and growth.

We enter 2020 with diversified growth momentum, balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. On
earnings progression, we continue to expect 47% to 48% of full year earnings per share to be realized in
the first half of the year.

A point to keep in mind on the quarterly progression. 2019's first quarter has 1 fewer workday than
2018's, resulting in a higher earnings level. This year, the first quarter has a more normal mix, but then
adds an extra day due to leap year. Taken together, the day count shifting has a year-over-year impact
on the medical care ratio of about 80 basis points. This will result in the first quarter 2020 MCR running
higher than the second quarter and earnings per share progressing accordingly, with just under 55% of
the first half earnings expected to be realized in the second quarter. These impacts, of course, were fully
contemplated in the 2020 outlook we provided at the beginning of December.

For full year 2020, we continue to expect revenues to approach $262 billion and adjusted net earnings per
share in a range of $16.25 to $16.55. Consistent with our prior practices, we will more formally address
these and other expectations after the first quarter.

With that, I'll turn it back to Dave.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Thank you, John.

As you can tell, we are confident in the outlook for our diversified and growing enterprise for 2020 and
beyond. Our businesses remain strong and well-positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering
even higher levels of societal value. We remain committed to our mission and an intense focus on serving
one person at a time at increasing levels of value: more affordable, better outcomes and improved
experiences while generating strong returns for you, our shareholders.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Wanted to ask about the quarter in terms of medical cost. Looks like it came in better than you expected
versus the update at the Investor Day. Any color there? Specifically, if you can expand on what's -- how
you're seeing kind of Medicaid progress from a cost and risk pool rate perspective as you kind of come into
2020, that would be really helpful as well.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

John Rex?

John F. Rex
CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Office of the Chief Executive

Yes. I think I'd point out a few things. You're correct. It did come in just a little bit better than guidance
at the Investor Conference. And a few things I'd note. First, I'd call it broadly across the businesses as we
continue to see the impact of the affordability initiatives that we've been very focused on having traction
and having impact, so broadly across that. I think it's fair to say also that we certainly did see some
continued improvement in our Medicaid businesses. That's a place that we've been focused on for a while
here, and that was also a contributor. But broadly, I would say, across our businesses as we saw those
affordability initiatives having traction.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Thank you, Justin.

Operator

Our next question from A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. Just it sounds like on the call today, you're reaffirming your expectations around Medicare Advantage
enrollment. Obviously, CMS has come out with their January numbers. It looks like in terms of the
percentage enrolled in January, you're a little bit lighter than you were a year ago. I don't know if that's a
fair comparison. But I wondered, is there anything in the data that -- I don't know if you've looked at what
they put out, that is missing from your perspective. I know it shows you down in group MA and maybe
you're going to pick up in group MA. But just flesh out a little further what group MA over the course of
the year would -- anything to reassure us about your expectations around MA for this year.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Thanks, A.J. We're very pleased with our AEP results. And I'd say, by far, it's our strongest year ever in
individual Medicare. We did reaffirm the guidance but nearer to the upper end of that guidance today, so
we feel pretty strongly on -- with respect to our overall performance.

Tim Noel, can you add some color on some of the other questions?

Timothy John Noel

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement

Yes. A.J., thanks for the question. And first off, some of that CMS partial AEP reporting can be a little
bit misleading. And Dave said, first and foremost, we want to reiterate the confidence in our full year
enrollment growth that we shared at Investor Conference for MA. And just to revisit that briefly, we said
500,000 to 550,000 Medicare Advantage growth in the M&R business, which includes both group and
individual MA. And we also said that we'd be up to 700,000 in MA growth, including duals within our
Community & State business.

So when AEP completes, we'll have grown by 370,000 in individual MA, including the duals that are
in CMS. And that's up 140% over last year's AEP and is our strongest performance ever in the annual
enrollment period. We expect this to drive full year results, about 700,000 member growth in individual
MA. And that split on January net growth versus the rest of the year is roughly 50-50, and that's
consistent with historical pacing and also full year supported by the momentum that we've seen in AEP.

With respect to Group, you're right, group MA contracted modestly in the CMS reporting. When January
all settles out, we expect that to be down about 65, but that will strengthen to flat to down 25 as the year
closes out. And finally, all told, really great start to the year, a strong signal of confidence for the full year
and our growth guidance shared at Investor Conference.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Thank you, A.J.

Operator

We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Maybe just sticking on the membership updates for 2020, and obviously, you just gave some good detail
on Medicare. Just interested if there's anything to call out in terms of on either the commercial business
or the Medicaid business, in terms of expectations on membership relative to the ranges that you had
provided at Investor Day?

Then also just specifically within that, just interested in how you're sort of approaching the North Carolina
Medicaid situation just given the budget situation there in terms of what you're assuming for timing
implementation of that and how many lives you have factored in around North Carolina?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Good question, Scott. Thank you. Dirk McMahon will start and then Heather Cianfrocco can discuss
Medicaid.

Dirk C. McMahon
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. On the -- thanks for the question, Scott. So we'll be down a little bit in enrollment for the 1/1/20
in both the fully insured and ASO areas. But as the -- throughout the course of the year, we expect to
gain membership in both areas, as we previously guided in December. As we look at 2020, we're going to
continue with the pricing discipline that I previously talked about as we balance enrollment growth with
our margin expectations. We remain focused on delivering a unique value proposition for our customers
and the consumer.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

Hard to tell you where I'm optimistic for next year. In fully insured, expect strength in individual products
and their middle market, as I look at our ASO block, I look at our All Savers and I look at our middle
market as well. And with that, turn it over to Heather on Medicaid.

Heather Rachelle Cianfrocco
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Thanks. Yes. So good question with respect to -- I'll start with membership and then talk a little bit about
North Carolina. So in our membership for this year, we do expect growth in Medicaid this year and that's
coming from a couple of places. North Carolina is in our 2020 guidance right now. We've got some other
things in there. We've got some increases from some markets like our Washington win last year, Texas
win, recent Texas win. We're going to see some Nebraska expansion. And then we see another strong year
of D-SNP as Tim just talked about for 2020. We think we're really well positioned there with new county
expansion, service area expansion and our AEP is off to a really, really strong start, so really excited about
that.

Pressure is obviously North Carolina. So it's in our 2020 membership outlook and our revenue outlook,
and we assume it right now to come in about midyear. We're really honored we were selected. We're ready
for implementation, and we're eager to start serving North Carolinians. Despite the budget situation there,
there is strong support for the program and for Managed Care there. So we're continuing to monitor the
implementation date. We'll keep you posted on that, and you'll watch that as well. In the meantime, we've
got -- we're excited about the opportunity. It's in our outlook, and we look forward to hopefully getting
that on track here as close to midyear as possible.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

And just to add on to that a little bit, Scott, we won -- also in Kentucky, we were pleased to win.
Obviously, that's being rebid now, but we'll hopefully prevail in the end there as well. And it's a strong
RFP season for Medicaid broadly, and I see the business having come around to being positioned with
its turnaround just in time to compete ferociously for that business. So we're pretty bullish about the
opportunity that exists in Medicaid, and I think we're well positioned to grow. Thanks for the question,
Scott.

Operator

And we'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.

Peter Heinz Costa
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Nice quarter. I'd like to take it up a little bit in terms of looking at sort of the longer-term picture for
Medicare. There's a couple of changes in the Medicare program. I'm curious what you think of as being
the biggest risks to you in terms of your business. And those are paying for social determinants of health,
which is something new for this year; allowing ESRD patients to join next year; and Medicare fee-for-
service direct contracting by providers is starting. Can you talk about those 3 items and if they are risks to
you?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Sure. We'd be happy to discuss all 3 of those. Tim?

Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement

Yes. Thanks, Peter. So I think I'll take ESRD first, but also want to caution the long-term outlook,
especially with respect to 2021 and really any year, it's a little bit premature to get into some of the
nuts and bolts of how we see the landscape shaping out. But on ESRD, we're very supportive of the
change that goes into effect on 2021 and encouraged by the opportunity to serve more people. We're not

concerned with some of the unknown elements around the reimbursement in payment models. We'll learn
those details very soon. We remain confident and expectant that those models will be fair, adequate. And
importantly, we believe that these people will be better served in Medicare Advantage.

Also important to keep mind, we serve 40,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees with ESRD today that
develop a disease post enrollment, and our focus with these members is both on prevention and also on
treatment. So we're pleased to have the opportunity to expand our reach and impact with patients that
have the disease at the time of enrollment.

And with respect to social determinants, we continue to have that be a key focus of our business,
consistently referring folks inside of programs where appropriate. And some of the additional flexibility
to apply social determinants and plan design are elements that we're leveraging in some of our
demonstration projects in 2020. We're excited to learn a little bit more about this as the year progresses
and look for more opportunities to do things in this area in 2021.

What was your last one [indiscernible]?

Timothy John Noel
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement

Pardon me?

Peter Heinz Costa
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

The last one was physician direct contracting, so fee-for-service Medicare.

Brian Robert Thompson
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Government Programs

Peter, Brian Thompson here. Yes, we're encouraged by that as well. I think similar to what we've done
with the bundled payment program, it's a good opportunity to work on advancing traditional Medicare, and
we're encouraged by that thinking and creativity and look forward to participating.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

And I might add, overall, Peter, that we're bullish, obviously, overall on the outlook for both Medicare
Advantage, but also the dual special needs marketplace as well. They're both very large today and
growing end markets.

MA is clearly outperforming fee-for-service in terms of overall benefit coverages and the quality of
outcomes and the returns that people are getting in terms of their overall satisfaction. And so it's no
surprise that it is performing as well and seems to be gaining some momentum. So we look forward to
continuing to compete, hopefully growing at these levels, if not higher, going forward.

And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

A question around the sort of broad space that's growing around physician enablement. And I'm curious, it
seems like there's been a lot of interest, a lot of new competitors that are kind of focused on that. I know
Optum's been very early. Do you think of Optum as sort of the market leader? And is this broad movement
of physicians taking more risk, is this positive for UnitedHealth Group?

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

Chief Executive Officer

Josh, thanks so much for the question. It's Andrew. Yes, we absolutely see physicians very much as a
central element of improving care delivery, quality and cost. It's what's really driving OptumCare, which is
clearly the central part of OptumHealth.

As with the physicians' move toward taking more risk, we see improvements across the board in terms
of resource allocation, prevention focus, ensuring clinical outcome is maximized. We're very encouraged
by that trend. This year alone, we'd expect about 150,000 more patients to go into our physician risk
managed programs across OptumCare. We continue to see that trend accelerate.

It's very much something that we then anchor the build-out of the rest of our OptumHealth portfolio
around. So in a sense, it's that thoughtfulness around how can we then create services, insight, data
analytics, which help the physician make the best possible judgment to manage that overall risk profile of
the patient. You see that then reflected in the relentless growth of the revenue per patient served across
OptumHealth. That's really been driven by this shift.

And so you're absolutely right, very important element for us, and it essentially becomes the core around
which we then envision and build our support services, our interventions and our analytics to empower the
physicians to make the best possible decision on behalf of the patient. Thank you.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

And I might just add to that just slightly, Josh, that UnitedHealthcare is working on physician enablement
as well. This is what the core of Dirk's commentary this morning was around Point of Care Assist. This is
why we built and deployed the IHR, and this is why we focus essentially in our Investor Conference around
the way in which we engage both the digital and physical realms to AI-enable people to be able to operate
much more effectively and serve their patients. So thanks for the question.

Operator

And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just want to go back to Medicaid for a minute. Can you talk a little bit about -- I think you mentioned
that during Q4, maybe you saw some improvement on Medicaid. But can you talk about the expectation
for the year? I guess, in particular, 2 things. One is the implication of redeterminations and the rate base
you'll get relative to that, how are the rate updates going, and do you -- are you modeling additional
redeterminations as the year goes on?

And then second, just quickly going back to North Carolina. If North Carolina got delayed into 2021, would
that impact your EPS guidance? Or is it really more just the revenue number at this point?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

I think we're making progress on -- across all dimensions of Medicaid right now on rate, cost and quality.
Heather, do you want to take the question?

Heather Rachelle Cianfrocco
Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealthcare Community & State

Sure. Sure. So -- and I'll start with Medicaid performance. So yes, we did -- we're pleased with Q4 results.
And when I say that, I really mean there -- it's marching on right within expectations, with what we've
really executed on, our affordability agenda; we see strong partnerships with our states to address what
was, for a period of time, due to redeterminations or other underfunding issues, just acuity-related
underfunding. So as we look into 2020, I feel good about the progress made through all of '19, and
particularly in the second half of '19 with respect to rates and with respect to affordability.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

And so as we come into 2020, we've got a view into our Q1 rate renewals. They're right in line with our
expectations. They're up above what they were at the same time in '19. We've got -- we've delivered on
our clinical programs. We're seeing strong NPS, customer service scores and quality. So I feel good about
that.

As I say that, you still expect us -- our target margin by the end of the year, so that just gives us renewed
confidence in what was committed to you already. So expect our Medicaid business to continue to perform
along that track, and we'll be hard at work on it.

With respect to North Carolina, yes, and I guess I'll just say, again, we're monitoring it every day right
now. I'm going to say that we're continuing to push. And it is a big component of our opportunity in
2020 from a revenue and a membership perspective. But that being said, there's a lot of other growth
opportunities that we're measuring, too. We didn't have Kentucky in our guidance, but we also didn't --
and that got pushed, but we also didn't have the Massachusetts lung care bid that we just won. So we're
going to be monitoring all those things, and right now, we're going to kind of work for a midyear or close
thereto implementation, and we'll keep you posted.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

So Kevin, Dave again, if I could just add. So if North Carolina were to get pushed to 2021, it would not
affect our expectations for the year. Our guidance would stay the same. It is -- as it comes out of the
chute, it's a relatively modest margin product -- or market as is often the case. So we wouldn't expect any
material impact on our expectations for the year. Thank you.

Operator

And we'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.

Lance Arthur Wilkes
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes. Could you talk a little bit about PBM margin for the quarter? I'm interested in the improvement there.
How much of that is driven by just the mix shift from the transition of a large client? And how much is
other initiatives like cross-sales or sourcing initiatives?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

John Prince?

John Prince
Chief Executive Officer

Lance, John Prince. Thanks for the question. As you looked at the fourth quarter, the margin was elevated
as expected. So when we gave our guidance at Investor Day, we were expecting an operating earnings
margin around 6.3%, 6.4%. So it was exactly what we expected. Why it was elevated is exactly what
you mentioned, was the loss of a large client where we lost the revenue, but we didn't really impact our
operating earnings.

The second driver was the supply chain strength in terms of our -- continue to negotiate with pharma
manufacturers as well as the supply chain to get value to pass on to our clients. And so that was the other
key driver for it.

As we look to 2020 guidance, you should expect our operating earnings margin to fall back to where
we've guided at Investor Day, with 5.1% to 5.2%, so that should be your expectation. It was more of an
anomaly what happened in Q4 as expected.

And we will go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So you reiterated guidance this morning for 2020. Just want to clarify if the guidance already includes any
impact from HIT repeal and midyear renewals and also the benefit from the Diplomat acquisition.

And then another follow-up on the dual growth. I mean obviously, 15% to 20% is what is the implied
growth, which is strong and above market. But when we think about that, can you just kind of like help
us think through the Part D dynamics and how that would flow through the P&L, if it's going to have any
impact on OptumRx throughout the year?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

We'll have John Rex start and then shift to Tim Wicks or John Prince.

John F. Rex
CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Office of the Chief Executive

Ricky, John Rex here. So in terms of those elements you mentioned, I'd say both are immaterial in the
scope of our company. You're correct, yes, when we guided to 2020 initially, the repeal of the HIT was --
the health insurance tax, had not yet occurred, but I would call that immaterial to us. Yes, there's some
impact, but not material in terms of modest headwinds in the scheme of our company, not something that
we would call out.

Also in terms of the Diplomat, the pending Diplomat acquisition, also, I would call that immaterial, really
no impact, really neutral in terms of our 2020 outlook.

And John Prince?

John Prince
Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Ricky. John Prince. In terms of the other pieces around Part D components, that's as expected. So
I think we're not changing our guidance for 2020. What we expected in terms of Part D and Diplomat is
built into our guidance, and so we're comfortable with our expectations.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Ricky.

We'll go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.

Stephen Vartan Tanal
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I guess, at this stage, I was just wondering if you could kind of give us a sense of what -- the HIT repeal,
how we should be sort of thinking about modeling that in, whether you'd commit to sort of at least the
nontax deductibility of it going away kind of falling to the bottom line or if it's still too early?

And then maybe just if you could comment on OptumHealth. Just given the risk-taking nature of what you
guys are doing, I thought it would be interesting to hear from you all how the flu impacted the economics
of that business in Q4, thinking sort of revenue, earnings, margin.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Great. I'll touch on the HIT and then Wyatt Decker will comment on OptumHealth. So overall, the HIT,
we're -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we're pleased that this would weigh. Obviously, it's great for
seniors, families of small businesses and individual insurers as well. On average, for a couple, a senior
couple, it's $500 to $600. It pretty much carries out the same for a family of 4 that's sponsored by a small
business. And so obviously, this has a strong economic impact on these families and individuals, so it's
terrific to see it get repealed.

The other thing about it is it removes the excessive volatility. I'm sure you're as fatigued with it as we
are. It's in. It's out. And -- but more important in all of that is that it affects the volatility of pricing in the
marketplace as well. So hopefully, we'll see that stabilize as we get through 2020 and into 2021 as well.

At this instance, we're not going to discuss 2021 and what our strategies may be with respect to how we
handle this. Obviously, it's important that the tax value gets back into the hands of people. That's what it
was intended to do, and that's what we intend to accomplish overall. And as John already indicated, while
it has a drag on earnings for 2020, we're not changing our outlook as a result of that. That is a small item
in the broad scheme of things.

And I think Wyatt to discuss flu at OptumHealth.

Wyatt W. Decker
Chief Executive Officer of OptumHealth

Yes. Stephen, thank you for the question. At OptumHealth and OptumCare, we follow the usual flu
modeling, and we have not seen a material impact deviating from that in Q4, and we do not anticipate
significant impact in Q1. As you may know, it's been a reasonably robust flu season, but it's mostly of the
B strain, which is not as severe. So we also have a fee-for-service MedExpress practice which tends to
offset any hit we might take on the risk side. Thank you.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Thank you, Wyatt. Just I want to clarify one thing that Ricky asked, and I'm not so sure we answered
it correctly. It was really about whether or not Diplomat, the proposed transaction, is in our numbers
for 2021 and -- our 2020. And the answer to that is no. It would not be in there. We don't include a
transaction in our forecast until they close. So that is not included in there. And as soon as it does close,
the quarter following, we'll update our forecast accordingly.

This is one of the reasons why we talked about the impact of capital deployment on our growth rate and
how it can advance during the year because of transactions. In this case, it will be very, very modest. But
nonetheless, I just wanted to make sure we have that clarification. Thank you.

Operator

We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays.

Steven James Valiquette
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Actually, not to beat the Diplomat pharmacy acquisition topic to death, but I know it's not a huge
acquisition for you financially. But despite that, I do have to believe there would just almost immediately
be a ton of operational synergies when folding that book of business into your existing PBM and specialty
pharmacy operations, probably in reimbursement and also in pharmacy network contracts. So I guess I
was hoping to hear more color around what you see is the biggest area of synergy at this stage. And then
just conceptually, could this deal move the needle for UNH overall in 2021? Obviously, you're making it
sound like probably in 2020 not much, but could it move the needle for the company overall in 2021?

It will be nicely accretive to us. Unfortunately, it also comes with a great deal of integration costs, most of
which will hit 2020 as well. Would you like to touch on that, John?

John Prince
Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Steven, it's John Prince. Just maybe talk a little bit more why we're doing the deal because I think
that's really at the core of it, which is to better serve individuals that have complex diseases like oncology,
immunology and specialized infusion therapy.

When you look at the capabilities of Diplomat around specialty pharmacy and infusion, it fits well with the
strategy of OptumRx focused on these unique populations that need better volume, helping improve their
drug costs, improving their health outcomes and overall value of care and doing it in a compassionate way.
So we think there's a good fit of our 2 businesses that come together to better serve the key needs in the
market. And so as we've talked about before, strategically, especially drug cost is a key focus of the future
as well as polyclinics, and I think that strategically fits very well.

We're, obviously, still a little ways away from closing the transaction. We're actively doing our planning for
that, and we'll be ready to start that as we conclude the transaction in the first quarter.

Maybe just going back to the flu. I just wanted to confirm that those earlier comments also apply to the
UnitedHealthcare side as well. Are you -- you're seeing high outpatient activity, but the severity and
hospitalizations just don't appear to be that high, at least published yet?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Jeff Putnam?

Jeff Putnam
Chief Financial Officer of UnitedHealthcare

Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, on UnitedHealthcare side, similar dynamics. The flu season, the C --
and the CDC data started early, and we are having elevated incident levels on the outpatient side. But
overall severity, as was mentioned, is lower there and inpatient admits have been close to normal, so a
very modest impact in the fourth quarter.

sense of what proportion of the ASO book has adopted these initiatives maybe for 2020 and/or how we
should think about sort of the uptake over time?

I don't think we'll talk about adoption rates in the large national accounts business. But Dirk, do you want
to talk a little bit about your overall efforts around containing medical costs?

Dirk C. McMahon
Chief Executive Officer

Yes. As we think about medical costs, you mentioned very effectively site of service and we rolled that out
to a lot more codes in November, knees and procedures like that. We're also very focused on our network
negotiations to try to drive unit costs lower in many areas. As we look at our trend, 2/3 of unit costs in
network is at the start of that.

We're doing a lot of work in terms of increasing consumer engagement, providing them with effective
decision tools through Rally and our other app portals and other digital properties to drive the right
movement.

And I also got to thank Optum. A lot of work with our clinical models driving savings as well as payment
integrity, as Andrew mentioned in his remarks. So we really have a full-court press on affordability. We
think that is a primary driver of our ability to price effectively in market and actually provide access for
consumers and employers and everyone. So a lot of work on the affordability front.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Dirk and team at UnitedHealthcare are doing a wonderful job on affordability broadly in medical cost.
Obviously, they're interested in getting health care to be much more affordable. And the collaboration
between Optum and UnitedHealthcare has never been stronger on that front. Optum has really stepped in,
as they do with all their third-party health plans as well, to really assist in driving this broad-based agenda
across the company.

We have time for 2 more questions.

And we'll go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

My one question is, I do appreciate the earnings cadence commentary given leap year. But thinking since
reported MLR is such an outsized impact on the near-term stock volatility, wondering if you'd be willing to
give us a first quarter MLR range? I mean there are a few other moving parts in the quarter besides leap
year. There's pretty high March seasonality with the extra Monday, Tuesday. And then obviously, there's
the dilutive impact of the HIT reinstatement.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

John Rex, if you would maybe just -- I know that was pretty complex in terms of the quarterly progression
and we expected that. So John, you just want to make sure that everybody understands that well.

John F. Rex
CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Office of the Chief Executive

Sure, Gary. Let me give you a little more color in terms of the impact that occurred as we go into that. So
I described kind of the sum of the impacts with workday, content and how that flows. And just in terms of
thinking about that, so one values different days with different medical costs, weekends versus weekdays,
even versus different days of the week. In terms of what I was describing there, it actually comes out to
-- it's a little -- it's not 2 days, it's more than 1 day. It's about 1.3 days of impact in terms of the workday
content is what falls into when you flow into a leap year like this. And that pattern, typically, of course,
repeats. So that's kind of the element that flows into that.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 15, 2020

Then if you consider the other elements we talked about at -- when we talked to our full year MCR
progression and year-over-year progression. We talked about the impact of the health insurance tax,
about 140 basis points and that impact; and then we talked about mix impacts also that occur over the
course of the year. So those are kind of the cores that are -- as we consider -- as we consider where we'd
expect the medical care ratio to be lining up here as we look at the first half of the year. I hope that gives
you a little extra color.

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

But you don't want to give us a 1Q range today?

John F. Rex
CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Office of the Chief Executive

Sorry, what's that, Gary?

Gary Paul Taylor
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

You don't -- you don't want to give us a first quarter MLR range today?

John F. Rex
CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Office of the Chief Executive

First quarter, a first quarter pick, a first quarter pick, I think I kind of just described it actually pretty --
hopefully, fairly clearly there in terms of the roll forward and how you would approach that. So if you take
the components of the math that I just gave you, I think that should get you to a first quarter pick.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

So there's no change to full year guidance. John tried to lay out for you what first half, last half would be
and then within the first half, what the proportions would be as well. So you should be able to get a pretty
good sense of things from all of that, recognizing, oftentimes things don't shoot quite that straight. So
plus or minus would probably be a worthwhile range to put around whatever point estimate you come up
with.

Now that there's some bipartisan support for spread pricing, though, can you talk about the exposure? In
'19, you said it was about 25% of the book. So did that needle move for '20? What does the mix look like
in your commercial book of spread versus pass-through? And does this bill impact the value proposition
that you see for OptumRx at all?

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

John?

John Prince
Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Thanks for the question. As you know, we're committed to driving to a strategy around negotiating
with the clients of a transparent model where more and more of our services are coming from
administrative fees and value-based arrangements. Our clients decide how they want to pay for our
services. So when we bid on a deal for a client, we give them an opportunity to either pay through

administrative fee or with spread or traditional. So it's a client choice. So as you look at it, we don't have
a preference about where we want to go from the business model. We're indifferent around how a client
wants to choose their product -- choose it.

In terms of the commercial market, the trend in the market hasn't changed in the last couple of years.
So actually, the client -- so it's not going to move one way or the other in terms of spread versus
administrative fee. As you look at the Medicaid market, there has been a trend over the last 3 years where
more and more of the state organizations have been moving to administrative fees. So if you looked at our
client base 3 years ago, the majority would have been spread. If you look at it today, less than 1/4 is in
spread. And actually, we expect that to almost disappear as you look out next year or 2 years. So from us
and when they actually impact our financials, I won't speculate about what will happen in Washington, but
we're well positioned from a business standpoint.

David Scott Wichmann
CEO & Director

Great question, Sarah. Thank you so much. I'll go ahead and close now, but I thank you all for your
questions. Sorry, we can't get to everyone today.
