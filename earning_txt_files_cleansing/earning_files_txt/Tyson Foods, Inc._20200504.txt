Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Tyson Foods Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.

Jon Kathol
VP of Investor Relations & Assistant Secretary

Good morning, and welcome to the Tyson Foods, Inc. Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of
Fiscal 2020. On today's call are Noel White, Chief Executive Officer; Dean Banks, President; and Stewart
Glendinning, our Chief Financial Officer. Slides accompanying today's prepared remarks are available as a
supplemental report in the resource center of the Tyson Investor website at ir.tyson.com.

Tyson Foods issued an earnings release this morning, which has been furnished to the SEC on Form 8-
K and is available on our website at ir.tyson.com. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements
as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect current views
with respect to future events such as Tyson's outlook for future performance on sales, margin, earnings
growth and various other aspects of its business. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you
to read the release issued earlier this morning and our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks
that can affect our business, including those listed in our 10-Q filed this morning, our most recent annual
report on Form 10-K and our current report on Form 8-K filed March 13, 2020.

Please note that our references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in today's
remarks are on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. For reconciliations to our GAAP results, please
refer to this morning's press release.

I'll now turn the call over to Noel White.

Noel White
CEO & Director

Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover today, but I want to start by saying
how proud I am of our team members and the work they're doing to help feed America during this difficult
time. I'll then touch briefly on our operations and results. Dean will go into further detail about our current
operations, and Stewart will handle the financial update from this quarter.

Day in and day out, in the midst of the challenges so many families are facing during this pandemic, our
team members are going above and beyond to help us maintain a healthy and stable food supply to our
nation and the world. From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to all of them. They're truly
central to everything we're doing right now. Our #1 priority is ensuring their health and safety. The only
way we can operate this business is for our team members to feel safe, protected and not fearful coming
to work.

It's why we've put in places a host of safeguards and guidelines at all of our facilities to protect our teams.
And as we've shown in the recent days, we will not hesitate to idle any plant for deep cleaning when the
need arises. Simply put, we will not send anyone into our plants to work unless we are confident that it's
safe. And to do that, we have transformed how we operate.

TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Today, if you visit our facilities, you'll see state-of-the-art health checkpoints at the entrance. And inside,
you'll see team members wearing proper personal protective equipment, including face masks. You'll also
see tools to help with social distancing. We've installed partitions on production lines and in break rooms.
And we've stepped up our efforts to clean and sterilize everything we can. Education is an important part
of this effort, and we're doing our best to ensure our team members understand how they can stay safe at
work and at home. Soon, team members will have on-site access to COVID-19 testing and other medical
care through our new partnership with Matrix Medical Network, a leading provider of mobile health clinics.

We also continue to work closely with federal, state and local health and safety authorities. Last week, as
you know, the U.S. government recognizes the essential work our team members do by reaffirming meat
and poultry processors as a critical part of America's infrastructure. The President's executive order under
the Defense Production Act establishes clear lines of authority and consistent standards that will help us
continue to provide American families with reliable supply of beef, pork and poultry.

I'd now like to briefly talk about the state of our operations. Over the last several weeks, we've had to
idle several facilities temporarily for deep cleaning, and others are not operating at full capacity due to
worker shortages. Despite our slower lines and lower volumes resulting from this pandemic, we believe
our core business and financial strength position us well to deliver market share and earnings growth over
the long term. And while COVID-19 has been disruptive, we do not believe it changes the outlook for a
strong future for Tyson Foods.

Now a quick summary of the quarterly results. Second quarter sales increased to a record $10.9 billion.
That's an increase of more than 4% over last year. This growth was driven by volume increases of 2.6%
and price increases of 1.6%. Our adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share were driven by typical seasonality,
soft chicken pricing and the impacts of COVID-19. In addition, we experienced $115 million in negative
derivative mark-to-market adjustments that Dean will discuss in further detail. Important to note that we
expect to benefit from the physical offsets associated with these transactions in future periods.

From a global perspective, exports to many parts of the world performed well throughout the period.
During the second quarter, we saw particular strength in exports to Japan and Mexico with double-
digit increases in our market share. Recent data indicates that China is reopening its economy, which is
encouraging signal of domestic protein disappearance. Lower levels of supply caused by African swine
fever continue to present opportunities to fulfill international demand.

Now let's talk about the current operating environment. The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has
had a significant impact on our channel mix with increased retail and plummeting foodservice demand.
From a supply chain perspective, where possible, our facilities have adapted to new product mixes, which
has enabled us to ship millions of pounds per week between channels and has set us apart from many of
our competitors.

Foodservice customers have also reacted with high levels of innovation and adaptation focusing on takeout
and delivery. In fact, some have only seen minimal volume loss. Supermarkets and club stores have
been trying to meet heavy demand, and we've been able to convert a number of production lines from
foodservice to retail to help meet those consumer needs.

The direct impacts of the virus have created operational challenges, including absenteeism, reduced
production speeds and selected idling of plants. The scope of our operations continue to provide us with
flexibility and redundancy. This is a clear benefit to our company's scale.

COVID-19-related pressure has affected parts of the industry supply chain, especially pork. However, our
diversity of protein provides our customers with options. In addition, our geographic diversity provided
important lessons from China where we first encountered COVID-19-related issues. This includes ways
to maintain health and safety of our people, opportunities to pivot to retail and potential pathways for
recovery. We expect current conditions to continue during our third quarter with a gradual recovery
beginning in the fourth quarter. However, all this depends on the extent to which businesses and schools
are able to reopen. We're well positioned to operate during this period and to take advantage of increasing
demand during the recovery.

TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Our balance sheet is sound, and our liquidity position was strong going into the crisis. It's been further
bolstered by the term loan we closed at the end of Q2 and by focusing on continuing operations and
managing costs. Stewart will give you more details. We committed $13 million to support critical needs
in our local communities. This includes $2 million in community grants and more than $11 million worth
of food and meals donated by the company since March 11. Over the coming days, we'll make product
donations equal to an additional 100 million meals.

Despite the immediate challenges from COVID-19 and its associated impacts, we're maintaining a
clear focus on the long term. This includes our strategy to grow, deliver and sustain. Global population
and income growth will continue to drive an increased need for protein. And our size, diversity of
portfolio and broad geographic presence will give us an advantage. In addition, there are changes
which will undoubtedly remain with us after the crisis. For example, we expect continued higher levels
of e-commerce for both grocery and foodservice. Our early investments in this space have allowed
us to capitalize on the growth, and we expect to benefit further in the future. Our industry is heavily
dependent on people, but our company is investing aggressively in automating the most difficult jobs in
our processing plants. Our balance sheet, liquidity and scale as well as our diverse product portfolio of
products and distribution channels position Tyson to benefit from long-term industry dynamics.

Now I'd like Dean to give us a recap of our business segments.

Samuel Dean Banks
Executive President & Non-Independent Director

Thanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by discussing our response to the pandemic,
but I'll spend the majority of my time discussing channel dynamics, current operating environment and
the long-term outlook for each segment.

As Noel discussed, we've experienced multiple challenges during our second quarter related to COVID-19.
The response by our team members has been nothing short of heroic, and it makes me incredibly proud to
be part of this great company. I personally visited many of our impacted facilities and witnessed firsthand
the steps we are taking to protect our team. Local health departments and the CDC have also toured our
facilities and have been extremely complimentary of the measures we've put in place to protect our team
members and community.

The health and safety of our team members remains our top priority. We took early decisive action to
provide workspace distancing, PPE and other protective measures. We've had no layoffs or furloughs and
have extended $120 million of bonuses and improved benefits to our frontline team members. This will
also allow us to quickly recover once we move past the effects of COVID-19.

Now let's discuss some channel dynamics we've observed in the wake of COVID-19. Each of our
businesses has witnessed a profound shift from foodservice to retail. Our retail business remains strong,
and our core retail lines posted gains of more than 20% in the last 13 weeks, outpacing total food and
beverage as well as the top 10 food manufacturers. While panic buying has subsided from extreme levels,
we continue to see 15% to 40% volume increases versus last year, depending on the category. As a result
of these trends, we have successfully increased volume, margin and share within retail.

Historically, approximately 45% of our total company sales were to retail, 40% foodservice and 15%
international. During early Q3, we saw our retail sales move to approximately 2/3 of our total company
sales. While we were successful in shifting some of our production from foodservice to retail, not all of our
facilities are able to do so. The volume increases in retail have not been sufficient to offset the losses in
foodservice. And as a result, we expect negative year-over-year volumes in the second half of fiscal 2020.

Operationally, we have faced 2 meaningful challenges: slowdown resulting from team member shortages
or choices we made to ensure operational safety and temporary closures related to COVID-19 infections.
We have continued to pay team members during these slowdowns and closures since maintaining health
and continued employment of our team members is important for our longer-term success. As a result,
we've experienced lower levels of productivity and higher cost of production. This will likely continue in the
short term until local infection rates begin to decrease.

TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Within the e-commerce channel, we've witnessed significant sales growth, including a more than 140%
month-to-month growth rate in our core business lines sold to a major e-commerce customer. We expect
this trend to continue. Going forward, we expect sustained retail sales growth and a slow recovery in our
foodservice channel.

Now let's take a look at our segments. During the second quarter, our Prepared Foods segment produced
an operating margin of 9.2%. Top line growth continued with the seventh straight quarter of volume and
dollar share growth. Sales were up 2.6% for the quarter, and pricing was up 2.7%. Within the last 13
weeks, total volume, sales, household penetration and share increased across the core business lines.
Historically, 60% of our prepared food sales have been to the retail channel and 40% to foodservice.

During Q3, we've seen greater than 20% growth in our retail sales. This channel, driven by our strong
brands and innovation capabilities, provides our highest growth potential and margin opportunity across
our portfolio. In the current environment, our retail-centric products continue to show strength, although
the current reduction in raw material availability may cause short-term outages. Our ability to flex our
production footprint between the foodservice and retail channels is limited. Consequently, we currently
believe the full effect of these new consumption patterns will result in a net reduction in volume. Looking
forward, our market insights, channel flexibility, access to raw materials and growing demand give us
long-term optimism. We are responding to the changes in consumer demand by pivoting our brand
investments and innovation to more value-oriented offerings and to formats and sizes relevant for rapidly
evolving channel dynamics, such as e-commerce acceleration, our retail businesses and brands are well
positioned to deliver sustained growth even if we enter into a recessionary environment.

Our Beef segment produced an operating margin of 2.7% in the second quarter. Commodity volatility
during the quarter resulted in a negative impact of $55 million in derivative mark-to-market adjustments.
As Noel mentioned, it's important to note, this amount does not include physical offsets, which may be
recognized in future periods. Our Beef business has done an excellent job of pivoting from foodservice
to retail and continuing to drive innovation. We found new retail applications for products that have
traditionally supplied the foodservice channel, which we believe could generate continued demand even in
the post-COVID-19 environment.

Beef exports remained strong, posting double-digit increases compared to the same quarter last year,
which have exceeded industry growth rates. Export markets are an important outlet for us now and in
the future. In the current environment, we see strong demand and ample supply of cattle, but reduced
industry processing capacity due to COVID-19 has pressured the supply chain and has reduced overall
profitability. Temporary plant closings dramatically increase operating costs and weaken what would
otherwise be a strong margin environment. As a result of the shutdowns, cattle producers are met
with much lower processing demand for their fed cattle. We recognize how this impacts our producer
community and are anxious to safely resume operations at our facilities to provide them with an outlet for
their cattle.

Looking forward, we expect plentiful supplies of cattle, coupled with strong demand for beef, both
domestically and via export. Our relationships with producers, industry-leading production capabilities and
customer-centric solutions gives us confidence in the long-term outlook for this business.

Moving to our Pork segment. Strong demand, solid operational execution and ample hog supplies led to a
7.3% operating margin in Q2. As we've transitioned to a ractopamine-free hog supply, our ability to sell
pork to the global markets has expanded. This new capability has been met with increasing global demand
as African swine fever continues to reduce pork supplies in Asia. Year-over-year increases of pork to China
were up significantly for the quarter, and we expect strong demand to continue as China recovers from
this COVID-19 lockdown.

In the current environment, we see strong demand and ample supply of hogs. But reduced industry
processing capacity of nearly 50% due to COVID-19 has pressured the supply chain and dramatically
reduced overall profitability. As pork plants across the country have continued to shut down, hog
producers are met with much lower processor demand for their market-ready hogs. We recognize how this
impacts our producer community and are anxious to safely resume operations at our facilities to provide
them with an outlet for their hogs.

TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Looking ahead, we see large supplies of livestock and strong demand driven by a global shortage of pork.
We continue to believe the impact of African swine fever in Asia could generate significant future margin
potential.

Our Chicken segment produced an operating margin of 2.9% in the second quarter. Operating income was
negatively affected by a $40 million increase in net feed ingredient costs and negative derivative mark-
to-market adjustments. This, along with weaker pricing from increased domestic availability of chicken,
has offset the benefits of our operational improvement initiatives. Weaker pricing dynamics have persisted
into the third quarter. Our Chicken segment has higher foodservice exposure than Beef, Pork and Prepared
Foods. We've responded to demand shifts caused by COVID-19 by adjusting parts of our production
capacity from foodservice to retail, but higher retail volumes have not entirely offset the lost volumes
from foodservice. Additionally, this channel shift has resulted in lower-margin realization as volumes have
moved to lower-margin products. Also, worker shortages have reduced overall plant efficiency, resulting in
higher production costs. Due to large domestic supplies, coupled with reduced foodservice consumption,
we believe our chicken operations are likely to incur losses in the back half of the year. Profit trends will
improve as foodservice activity recovers.

Turning to our International business. Our China operations were impacted by COVID-19 more than
any other region during the second quarter. Despite this, our China team produced record sales and
operating income as production was shifted to meet rising retail demand. While China is recovering, other
geographies where we produce or sell are being impacted negatively by COVID-19, especially since our
International business has historically had a high level of exposure to the foodservice channel. We expect
to see a slow recovery across each of our geographies as demand patterns normalize, but profitability will
be impacted negatively in the short term.

In closing, our businesses across the enterprise are adapting to the dramatic changes brought about
by COVID-19, and the response of our team has provided consumers continued access to a safe and
affordable food supply. Short-term challenges do not diminish our belief in the company's long-term
outlook. Our unique business model, diverse portfolio and industry-leading scale will make us stronger and
more resilient.

Before I hand over to Stewart to take us through the financials, I'd like to thank our 141,000 team
members who continue to support our mission of feeding the world. Their health and safety are critical to
that mission. Over to you, Stewart.

Stewart F. Glendinning
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Dean, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe.
I'll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter. As
Noel mentioned, our second quarter results included earnings of $0.77 per share and operating income
of $501 million. Our adjusted results excluded $110 million nonoperating gain or $0.23 per share as we
executed the termination of 2 frozen pension plans by purchasing annuities for the participants. Due to
the assets held in the plans, this did not result in a significant cash outflow. We have now exited 4 pension
plans in the last 2 years as we continue to minimize volatility and cash flow risks associated with pension
plans.

Sales in Q2 were up over 4% to nearly $10.9 billion with a 4.6% return on sales. Average sales price for
the quarter was up 1.6%. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $1.3 billion. As Noel mentioned earlier,
our balance sheet is sound, and our liquidity position was strong going into the crisis.

On March 27, we successfully entered into a term loan agreement for $1.5 billion, and we borrowed
these funds in the first week of our third quarter. This loan ensures financial flexibility and enables us to
navigate potential uncertainties in the capital markets while alleviating our reliance on the commercial
paper market that typically serves as our primary means of short-term liquidity. Our liquidity on March 28,
including the undrawn term loan, was $2.5 billion and was higher still as of the end of April.

TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

During the quarter, we continued to experience some operational effects from our recent ERP system
implementation, which impacted margins by roughly $30 million in the quarter. About half of this was
discounted sales with the remainder related to inventory write-downs and donations. We believe that
we have turned the corner on this issue and expect the incremental cost to ramp down throughout Q3
before returning to historical run rates in Q4. Because of the shift from foodservice to retail, we are closely
managing our foodservice-related inventories to minimize any losses. And of course, we are working to
ensure that our outstanding accounts receivables are collected in this higher risk environment. Including
cash of $437 million, net debt was $11.7 billion, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.9x for the 12
months ending March 28.

Net interest expense was $116 million for the quarter, and capital expenditures were $312 million. We
continue to target an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital.

In the second quarter, we repurchased 700,000 shares for $64 million. Weighted average shares
outstanding were approximately $365 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.8% in the
second quarter. Depreciation and amortization was $293 million.

Dean has articulated the qualitative aspects of our outlook, which should give you some indication of
how we expect our businesses to perform for the balance of the fiscal year. Due to the uncertainty of the
COVID-19 impacts, the degree of absenteeism and the temporary closure of some of our facilities, we are
currently unable to provide segment operating margin guidance.

Now I'd like to provide some additional commentary on our outlook. Keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a 53-
week year. However, we have adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks. Net interest expense
should approximate $470 million. We project CapEx spending of approximately $1.2 billion for the fiscal
year as we progress with building additional processing capacity for case-ready fresh chicken, beef and
pork. This is a reduction of more than $100 million from our previous guidance. We may elect to slow
down parts of our CapEx spending where appropriate to ensure adequate liquidity. Having said that, we
expect liquidity in the back half of the year to remain well above our minimum liquidity target of $1 billion
especially after the issuance of the $1.5 billion term loan.

Our capital allocation will continue to prioritize debt reduction. This includes approximately $1 billion of
senior note maturities during Q3 and Q4. We do not expect to repurchase shares in the back half of the
year except for minor repurchases related to an employee stock ownership plan. We currently expect
our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 23%. We expect to deliver profit in the back half of the year
assuming that we can continue to operate and supply our plants.

Q3 has begun with higher levels of volatility. Early in the quarter, we saw huge volume pulls in our retail
channel. This demand partially offset declines in our foodservice channel. In recent weeks, we've seen
a leveling off followed by another surge in retail demand. But as Dean has said, the volume shift from
foodservice to retail is likely to be a net negative. The major challenge facing us currently is the degree to
which our plants are able to operate. All plants are experiencing varying levels of crewing. We will continue
to operate our plants with team member health and safety as a top priority.

As you can imagine, the slowdowns and temporary closures related to the pandemic drive higher
production costs, and we expect to see those until we resume under more normal conditions. Also, our
COVID-19 risk mitigation activities have added costs on the broad range of safety measures we have
implemented and continued to support. Despite this, we've continued to focus on financial fitness, and
that has partially offset some of these impacts. We will continue to seek out opportunities to remove
unnecessary costs from our business.

Sum it up, our long-term outlook remains positive. Our diversified business model allows us to react to
changes created by major events like COVID-19 and African swine fever. Our balance sheet, liquidity,
scale and diversified portfolio of businesses remain strong and should provide some level of protection as
we move through the year. We will continue to drive long-term growth in all parts of our business as we
execute against our strategic plan with a constant focus on maximizing long-term value for shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I hope you and your families are being safe.

Noel White
CEO & Director

Thank you, Ken.

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So let me just ask one question, and then I'll have a follow-up. One is, can you frame the status of your --
of Tyson's operations in each division and the associated costs? So which divisions are operating at what
levels? And how are you complying with getting people back to work, absenteeism? Can you give us a lot
of color on that? That's kind of one of the pressing questions.

Samuel Dean Banks
Executive President & Non-Independent Director

Sure, Ken. First thing I want to say, and I'm sure you know this, team member safety remains our top
priority, and we're sparing no expense to keep them safe. We are fully complying and been interacting
with the government authorities, including the USDA, the CDC, OSHA and even county and local
governments. And we've had intermittent outages from time to time as it's been necessary to make sure
that our team members are kept absolutely safe.

The expense is related to these closures. I'll start with PPE. We've invested substantially in our protective
equipment for our team members, including things like chartering planes to supply masks even before
they were mandated by the CDC. We bought some quite expensive thermal scanners to make sure that we
can check temperatures for our team members coming in and out of our plants. Another expense is the
inefficiency of the plants driven by the slowing or idling of the plants while they're being checked and while
our team members are being tested.

Another priority of ours is to keep food on the table of our consumers. And so that includes running and
recovering plants at slower capacities from the time being but also running them with overtime and
additional costs to make sure that whenever we can run them in control, we can put food on the American
tables.

One expense I can quantify for you is the $120 million in thank you bonuses we provided to our team
members during this time for the hard work. And again, team member safety being our top priority, it is
hard to predict the extent of these costs over time.

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

But can you talk about the utilization? I mean what plants are coming back online, which plants are off?
What percentage of your plants are off, kind of giving us kind of a status of the progression of where you
are on your operations on that side?

TYSON FOODS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 04, 2020

Yes, Ken, it's Noel. It's very dynamic. I would say that on the pork side of our business, we did take down
our Logansport pork plant. We took down our Waterloo plant. Perry was closed for a short period of time.
And each one of those plants are in the process of either coming back up or finishing the testing of all of
our team members.

On the beef side of our business, we took down Dakota City, which is a large facility for us, this past
weekend. We're working with local county, state and federal officials to bring it back up. We took down
our Pasco, Washington plant 2 weeks ago to go through the entire testing protocol. Those test results, we
were receiving back through the weekend.

So there's been various impacts, Ken. We will take the plant down for a period of time, and the period of
time has varied anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. That give you a sense?

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes, it does. And then my follow-up question is, you guys wrote in the press release that you think chicken
prices will not go up. Let me just frame this and help me understand where I'm wrong. We have less
chicken production. We have less beef production. We have less pork production. We potentially will have
less hogs. We potentially might have less cattle. And we do still have a shortage of protein globally. How
do you expect chicken prices to not go up in that scenario? What am I missing? And I get the demand
shift, but I think that's more fluid.

Noel White
CEO & Director

It -- Ken, it really depends on the assumptions. And our assumptions is that the plants will come back
up as we go through Q3 and Q4. And it's really the impact of each one of those, the poultry plant, pork
plants, beef plants. Total animals available, as you know, is up year-over-year, 4-plus percent. So we're
assuming that these plants, not only ours but others, will, in fact, go down for a period of time and then
reopen. So we are actually looking at an increase in total protein available as we go through the balance of
Q3, Q4.

Samuel Dean Banks
Executive President & Non-Independent Director

And Ken, I would just add that mix plays a really strong role in this. As you probably know, a substantial
portion of our business has been in foodservice, which is down, and our retail business is up. But as we
mentioned in the call, those do not perfectly counterbalance. And so that will also have an impact on our
long-term blended sales price.

Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays.

Benjamin M. Theurer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Hope you're all safe and sound. So I'd like to actually follow up on the chicken situation. So in the past,
we've always seen, in your case, a little less volatility just because of the way you price through. And I
understand that foodservice is substantially under pressure, and you can't offset that for retail. But could
you walk us a little through your relationship with the different customers, be it in retail and foodservice,
what you're seeing on the featuring side and how you think of pricing those products towards back half of
your fiscal year?

Samuel Dean Banks
Executive President & Non-Independent Director

Sure. Our retail customers have been phenomenally supportive, and we continue to work with them
as we always would, and we're not planning to take a price increase there. As it relates to foodservice

specifically, we have seen some of our customers really get decimated due to the COVID crisis and
closure of restaurants, limited supply in delis and that sort of thing. We have seen some of our customers,
specifically QSRs, recover very well. Their model of having takeout food and drive-throughs have really
allowed them to be resilient and continue to thrive in the market.

Benjamin M. Theurer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then my follow-up is more of a medium, long-term question. So clearly, and you've mentioned
it in your prepared remarks, there's currently a significant decrease in demand from a processing point
of view on pork and beef, which obviously causes all the farmers to basically stick with the animals. What
is your expectation in terms of cattle, hog supply looking out couple of years from now and in terms of
potential reaction from farmers on the loss making? And how are you actually paying your suppliers, the
farmers, when you buy off? Do you really get the benefit of the low-cost live cattle and live hog prices
right now? Or do you not see that much of a benefit coming through because you'd rather look long term
and want to support the farmers in the short term to basically secure supply in the medium, long term?

Noel White
CEO & Director

Yes, Ben. Let me say, first of all, we believe it's critically important that our livestock suppliers thrive and
continue to be profitable. So we are doing everything possible to process as many animals as possible to
make sure that there is a market for those animals.

Longer-term outlook, Ben, is truly dependent on the closures of plants over the course of the next 60
to 90 days. There has been a backlog of inventory that's developed with both hogs and cattle, and that
will continue if plant closures continue at the pace that we're at right now. Longer term, I would say that
on pork, it really depends on the degree of liquidation that we see over the course of the next 90 days.
So if, as an example, the weaned or baby pigs are, in fact, euthanized, that'll have an impact sometime
later this calendar year. If the sows, if the mothers are liquidated, then that has longer-term implications
that goes out over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. We've not seen the same thing happen on --
with cattle yet. A lot of the cattle are still in pasture or been on feed for a number of days. The weight is
increasing, but it's not at the critical point that pork is at this point.

Our next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America.

Peter Thomas Galbo
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just wanted to follow up actually on Ken's initial question just around the cost. Obviously, it's helpful to
have the detail on the $120 million in bonuses. And Dean, you outlined a number of other costs in terms
of medical equipment or PPE masks. I mean is there any way, at least at this point, to quantify that? And
to the extent that you're willing to say, on a go-forward basis, I mean some of these costs are going to
be recurring. I mean is it fair to assume that there's now just structurally higher costs in the business,
and we've kind of changed from a paradigm standpoint in terms of the equipment we need in plants for
employees?

Samuel Dean Banks
Executive President & Non-Independent Director

So I'll just mention a few things here, is that as this disease has progressed, as we've learned more,
anything that we can find or discover that can improve safety in our facilities, we are doing. And when it
comes to the long-term structural costs of the business, there are some things that we're installing now,
for example, these thermal scanners that will -- we will leave installed. And they'll provide even benefit
whenever we move into the next flu season to just help our team members better understand, they're
starting to develop sickness early and that sort of thing.

But no, it's not possible to really quantify or put a number on what those costs are going to look like
related to COVID-19.

Peter Thomas Galbo
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it, okay. And one of the other things you guys spoke about was automation, moving to put as much
automation into plants as much as you can, as quickly as you can. Can you maybe just rank-order for us
among the 4 kind of top segments, from top to bottom, most automated to least automated? And to that
extent, is it 25% of the operations are automated, 50% of the operations are automated? Any color there
would be helpful.

Samuel Dean Banks
Executive President & Non-Independent Director

I think it's difficult to describe in a lot of ways because some of our plants have expensive scaled
equipment for things like producing ground beef and sausage and that sort of thing. We do have some
robotic automation in things like palletizing and that sort of thing.

The thing that I would stress is that automation provides really a lot of things. But one of the things that I
would stress is flexibility. Where we had installed some multi-vacuum packaging systems for products like
beef and pork, what we've seen is that those businesses' ability to very quickly shift those products from
retail -- or from foodservice to retail, which has been really, really beneficial to those businesses. But it's
difficult to really put a percentage on automation across each of the business units.

Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

So I guess my first question goes on, in the prepared remarks, I believe the comment was the expectation
that the chicken business would be operating at losses for the balance of the fiscal year. And I'm just
trying to maybe break that apart a little bit, and it ties into some of Ken's questioning. Just can we help
think about that from a kind of commodity price outlook versus volume versus mix versus operating costs?
Just help us think about how we're going from where we've been on margins to losses and just think
about the drivers that we can watch the market evolve and assess your performance against.

Noel White
CEO & Director

Sure, Adam. The -- that -- you're accurate. That was in the prepared remarks. Based on what we see
right now in the marketplace, as I mentioned on an earlier question, that we are, in fact, expecting an
increase in protein supplies through the balance of this at least fiscal year, likely calendar year. And with
that, there will likely be, as there has been in the last few months, an oversupply of poultry in the market.
Total number of animals available has not changed at this point. So whether it's beef, pork or chicken,
we're looking at increased supply. So most recently, in the market, over the course of the last couple of
weeks, there have been some shortages in some specific categories. However, in total, as we go into Q4,
we expect supplies to be increasing and therefore not any pricing recovery.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then I guess my follow-up is it's more broad across the business. In the face of some pretty
unprecedented kind of volume and throughput issues that you're facing around labor availability, can
you just help frame in the businesses kind of the percent of costs that are fixed? I mean in this period,
I presume labor is going to be the single biggest fixed cost. Just to help us think about the volume
decrementals that you'd be experiencing in the face of the throughput challenges that you have.

I mean each plant is a little different, so it's hard to give you a precise number. I can tell you it's
significant in the millions of dollars per week in some of our larger facilities, such as some of our beef and
pork operations, poultry not to the same extent but still expensive. And then we have a number of plants
that we operate in our prepared food space. It's -- we've not seen a big impact, and we certainly hope
that, that continues. So each plant is a little bit different depending on which plant we need to take down
and how long.

Our next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC.

Heather Lynn Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

I wanted to follow up on the chicken pricing comment. So is that a Tyson-specific comment? And also, you
mentioned mix. But is there also an element of you guys have cost-plus contracts, and clearly, fee costs
are down, so is that a component in -- for that comment as well?

Noel White
CEO & Director

Well, anytime we make any comments, Heather, it is specific to Tyson. Obviously, we don't know what
others in the industry are going to do. All we can do is look at industry data. So yes, the outlook is specific
to us. And we can look at egg sets. We can -- placements. We can look at a lot of different numbers, and
we have no sense what others are going to do. That's purely our outlook at this point in time.

Heather Lynn Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

To my question, does that include some effect to cost-plus contracts given lower feed?

Noel White
CEO & Director

Cost plus, lower -- that would be passed through in the cost-plus contracts, yes. Alternatively, if costs go
up, price goes up. Cost inputs go down, price goes down.

Heather Lynn Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

Okay. My follow-up question is on the production side or volume side, I should say. I realize on the beef
and pork side is going to be a function of how soon you guys are able to get those up and fully running.
But on the chicken side, how should we be thinking about volumes on that front for the back half?

Noel White
CEO & Director

Different plants have been impacted to different extents. I would say, Heather, that so far, we have had
some disruption at a couple of our facilities that we've taken them down for a relatively short period of
time, days or week. And we don't know obviously what the effect is going to be in the future. We are
and will continue to work with all the local county, state and federal officials to make sure that our team
members are safe. So at this point, we've not seen a tremendous impact on our poultry business. And
obviously, we don't know what that's going to look like over the course of the next 3 to 6 months.

Heather Lynn Jones
Heather Jones Research LLC

So you aren't able to ballpark what your chicken volumes will be up or down year-on-year in the back
half?

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. So I guess my first -- well, my question is, are you able to go segment by segment and tell us
roughly what the mix is between foodservice and retail and then give us an idea of how much the retail
is down at the moment post the panic buying period, so I guess April, versus obviously foodservice, how
much you're back down and retail, how much is that part across beef and chicken and prepared foods as
well? And then I have a follow-up.

Noel White
CEO & Director

Okay. Alexia, I don't have the numbers at hand by specific poultry group. However, as Dean said in his
remarks, retail is up. It's up sharply, and it depends on the week, it depends on the month, but think in
terms of 30% to 40% up. Foodservice is recovering, I would say. And each -- within foodservice itself,
each sector is down varying degrees. So down in rough numbers, 25% to 30% on foodservice in total, but
it does vary substantially depending on the type of the foodservice establishment.

Stewart F. Glendinning
Executive VP & CFO

And if you take a look at our segment data in the Q, you get some sense of what our historic numbers
have looked like by channel. So that doesn't give it to you by segment, but it'll give you a good sense of
what the various volumes are and the exposure to foodservice. If you apply some of the percentages that
Noel has suggested to that, I think it'll give you a sense that bear in mind that when you look at that, one
of those channels is industrial, and part of that is going to be foodservice. So we sell onto somebody else,
but then our process is for foodservice. But I think that's the best place to look.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Great. That's very helpful. And then the follow-up, obviously, you can't give guidance for the next quarter,
but you're 1/3 of the way into it. And you mentioned that chicken profits are likely to be, I think, negative
in the back half of the year. Can you give us any sort of idea of how things are looking so far in the third
quarter?

Noel White
CEO & Director

Alexia, I'd say it's too early for us to do that. And like I said, it is very fluid. So a given day, a given week,
it can change substantially. So I'm not comfortable in making any comment today.

Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I wanted to dig in on the comment that you expect chicken production to be up in the back half of your
fiscal year. I think that's a critical point here because we're already seeing egg sets way down. We're
seeing chicks placed numbers -- chick placement numbers down even more. So there's eggs being
cracked. There are some at least rumors about some in the industry ordering fewer pullets and maybe

killing off heavy hens at a faster rate. If the -- if that's already happening, and I'm asking if it is as far
as you can tell, and if the industry is margin negative, why would the industry increase production in the
back half of the year? I understand part of it is because plants are coming back online. I do get that. But
I don't quite get why we would assume that given all that's -- what's happening already, that industry
production wouldn't be a little bit less than what we thought previously. Maybe I could just pause there
and hear what you say about that.

Noel White
CEO & Director

Yes. Ken, that very well could be the case. We look at the public data just like you do. We're starting to
see indications that there have been some cutbacks. We don't know what others are doing. But given the
profit structure right now, I'd say that, that certainly could be the case. We don't know. So I think that, as
you know, in poultry business, it can change much quicker than what it would be -- or would in both pork
and beef. So I think that the premise that you're proposing could, in fact, play out that way.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then my follow-up is on a little bit about the nature of the industry, whereby labor is such a big
part of the cost basis. And when you think about other production facilities, like if I walk around a Hershey
plant or a Kellogg plant, I mean there's nobody that you can see except a couple of people making sure
that the boxes aren't falling off the lines. If you look right at a chicken plant, it's wall-to-wall people. And
I know you guys are doing everything you can to prevent this from being a problem in your plant. But as
we think about going forward, how do we potentially reduce the number of people in your plants? Is there
a way -- I know the industry has tried for years to get better at automation. Is it more of a priority now
for you and for the industry to automate some of these production factors? Or is it just something that the
nature of meat is that you can't do it, it's more specialized part by part? So hoping that makes sense. I'm
just curious for what your thoughts there and what the opportunity is.

Noel White
CEO & Director

Well, Ken, as I mentioned, probably close to a year ago that we started investing fairly heavily in
technology, automation. And that hasn't changed. We continue to invest. In that segment, I do think
that over the course of time, that the amount of automation will, in fact, continue to increase particularly
in some of the more difficult jobs and positions. I can tell you that we as an example, we've invested a
significant amount of money, I would say, in our attempt to minimize any foreign objects where we're
using vision technologies to try and identify any -- we're working in the debone area within poultry. We
have a number of initiatives within beef and pork. So I believe not only us as a company, I think the
industry will continue to look for solves through automation. So I think it will probably -- it will likely
accelerate from this point.

some of that landscape looks like?

Samuel Dean Banks
Executive President & Non-Independent Director

All right. This is Dean. We're not going to be able to comment on a customer-by-customer basis. What

will be really beneficial to the small business owner, restaurants and distributors. We'd love to see their
business really start to recover in the coming quarters especially if states start to open up.

As it relates to who's faring best, as I said before, our QSR customers are really those that are
outperforming because of the flexibility of their model in both historical ability to either deliver through
click and collect, take out, drive-through, et cetera.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, back on chicken, just curious maybe how much visibility
you have and specifically things like, what amount of the pressure on margins is onetime, say, the worker
bonuses, for example? And just should we expect losses in both quarters? I know you're talking about it in
aggregate. Just any sense of maybe -- given at least what you know now, how you think that plays out.

Stewart F. Glendinning
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Look, I mean we're not going to give you quarter-by-quarter. We wanted to make sure that we
highlighted the back half of the year. And I think look, if you stand back and look at chicken for a second
and just say, first of all, there's a net negative in volume. Second, there's a margin impact as a result
of switching from foodservice. And third, you've got some incremental costs, which relate both to
some of the onetime worker costs and also more inefficiency in the plants as we try to run them in this
environment. Those last 2 are big numbers, and I do not think that those are with us permanently.

Our next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.

Michael Leith Piken
Cleveland Research Company

I just wanted to get your sense in terms of -- I know you mentioned that you -- that some of the hogs
are being backed up or whatever. But by the time, let's say, all the workers came back, with all the social
distancing and things needed to maintain worker safety, I mean what do you think is either an industry or
your capacity utilization rate that we could expect in pork and at the beef plants relative to maybe where it
was pre-COVID-19? Can you get back to kind of those same daily kill rates that we saw 3 months ago?

Noel White
CEO & Director

Assuming that the plants continue to operate, Michael? Yes.

Michael Leith Piken
Cleveland Research Company

Yes, assuming the plants are operating, let's say, the workers were willing to show up due to the safety.
Like could we get back to we're -- I mean, could we be doing 2.8 million hogs a week?

Noel White
CEO & Director

The answer would be yes, that over the course of last number of years, the pork industry has been
growing between 2% and 4% per year. The industry infrastructure is set up to deal with that number of
hogs. So yes, we can certainly get back to those type of numbers.

Michael Leith Piken
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. And then I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that beef has the potential to be quite
profitable in the back half of the year, but you didn't really comment too much on pork. Is it just because

the operating rates are lower in pork that you were less confident on that side of the business? Or was I
reading the remarks wrong or the lack of commentary?

Noel White
CEO & Director

No, there was nothing intended by the lack of commentary, Michael. That -- if the plants get back up and
running as we expect them to be, we would expect the margin structure within pork to continue at fairly
healthy numbers. Year-to-date, we're just short of 11% return on sales. For Q2, it was a little over 7%. So
I think that it's certainly possible that we'd be able to maintain those type of numbers as we look forward.

Our next question comes from Rob Moskow of Crédit Suisse.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

A couple of questions. I think, Noel, you just said that you think the industry could get back to 2.8 million
pigs per week if attendance improves. But you're also implementing more social restrictions in the plants
and more safety precautions. And I got to imagine that, that slows down facilities as well. So is it possible
to break down your incremental costs and your utilization rates based on what you're seeing in terms
of attendance right now and then also in terms of just the safety measures you need to put in place?
Because I kind of imagine the safety measures are going to be with us for a while.

Noel White
CEO & Director

Yes, I think that's a fair assumption, Rob. I think that the slowdown in speeds and production throughput,
Robert, it -- we've done everything possible to protect all of our team members, all of our employees,
including social distancing. And I'd say it's too soon to tell at this point if, in fact, that's a permanent
structural change where we would have to slow down our line to have the social distancing that's needed.
So we can't quantify specifically what that might mean going forward. We're still working through with all
the -- both the state and federal officials as to what that might look like going forward.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

But well, you're doing it right now, aren't you? I mean you're saying that you're taking all these
precautions right now. It's obviously the right thing to do. Have you made any estimates as to the degree
to which that slows down the facilities and reduces utilization?

Noel White
CEO & Director

We know specifically what that means right now, Rob. But we're a company that continuously innovates
and works on better processes, and that continues to be the case. So I don't think it's accurate to think
that what we're doing today necessarily has to be the case 6 or 12 months from now.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then a follow-up. You said that chicken margins are likely to be negative in the back half. Is it
possible there to kind of isolate the degree to which that has to do with just excess supplies on the market
versus incremental operating costs at the plants for safety and also the absenteeism?

Stewart F. Glendinning
Executive VP & CFO

Rob, it's Stewart here. So first of all, we didn't say that margins would be negative. We said that chicken
would likely be unprofitable in the back half of the year. And I think just a couple of questions ago, I sort

of framed that. There's a combination of factors. And the only one that I didn't point to just because it's
ongoing is weaker pricing. But if you go back and just look at those factors, the ongoing weaker pricing
that we've seen, the negative impact of loss of volume, the mix shift between foodservice and retail and
then, of course, just the efficiency levels in the plant, which have been impacted by worker availability, by
some of the measures that we've taken and then, of course, the bonuses, I mean that sort of frames out
the picture in chicken. I can't give you any more detail than that.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Stewart, can you help me understand what you meant by unprofitable then? If it's not negative margins,
what does it mean?

Stewart F. Glendinning
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I mean I've assumed when you said margin that you were thinking about gross margin. But if you
think about operating margin, then that's true. I was saying it's going to be unprofitable at the operating
income level.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

In that case, we're both in line. That's what I meant. Okay.

Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens.

Benjamin Shelton Bienvenu
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I want to ask about the executive order. I think it was helpful in standardizing the processes and
procedures around which you guys would open across various states and counties and facilities across the
industry. I'm wondering what else it does. I think there's been some reference to potentially defraying
PPE costs and liabilities. If you could elaborate on kind of the benefits of what that executive order
brings to you guys and the rest of the industry from a cost perspective as well as clarifying the operating
procedures.

Samuel Dean Banks
Executive President & Non-Independent Director

This is Dean. I'll stress your first point is really -- cannot be understated. So -- it cannot be overstated.
The uniformity with which our plants are governed really being dictated by the experts, the CDC, OSHA,
the USDA, is critical for us to both maintain industry standards high. We've actually had a few of our
plants visited by folks like state government health officials and the CDC. And they've actually asked to
work with not only food industry, food industry is coming back online, but also other industries to show
them how we've taken care of our team members.

The second point about PPE, we moved very, very quickly early in the process to secure PPE for our team
members, but those go quickly in our business. And so the other benefit of the executive order is really to
make sure that we have long-term abundant supplies depending upon how long this pandemic ultimately
lasts. Things like masks, hairnets, et cetera, we've gone so far and sometimes just gave out masks to
team members so that they can operate in their community where they know that there may be some
latent disease so that they can operate safely in the community and not bring that back into the plant.

Okay. And you made some allusions to exports and how those have fared year-to-date and kind of your
outlook a bit. But I'm curious, I know it varies by protein segment. But do we need to see higher crude
oil prices and a weaker relative dollar and more stable global environment in the context of COVID to see
exports improve? Or do you think that we can see significant improvement in exports exclusive of those
factors?

I think we can see them exclusive of those factors, Ben, that exports year-to-date have been strong.
Interest continues to be strong despite very low oil prices. So the global fundamentals that we were
looking at 6 to 12 months ago haven't changed, that global protein demand still continues to grow at
about a 2% rate. Production volume is not increasing at the same level. United States historically has been
a low-cost supplier of protein beef, pork and chicken to global markets. So we don't see that changing.
And the demand that we've seen over the course of the last 30 to 60 days, I think, just reinforces that.
And that's why we're encouraged on a long-term basis of the outlook. That hasn't changed. We have the
headwinds and challenges in front of us right now that we deal with. And as long as we make sure that
our team members are safe in our plants, that's priority #1. Priority #2 is making sure that this company
is positioned for the long term over the course of the next 10, 20, 50 years to continue to be successful.
So we're not only dealing with the short term, but we also are deeply -- we're deeply -- we view the long
term on a -- take it very, very seriously.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Noel
White for any closing remarks.

Noel White
CEO & Director

Thank you for your time today. One of the hallmarks at Tyson is turning insights into actions. The current
environment presents significant opportunities for our company as we assess and react to changes in the
consumer landscape. We'll leverage our resources and infrastructure as we continue our role as a leader in
food production.

Let me conclude by saying the responsibility of feeding our nation goes beyond any one business. Working
together, we're confident we can mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our communities, help and keep
it away from our plants and help the food supply chain intact. Please stay safe, and we look forward to
talking to you soon.

Operator
The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now
