Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference facilitator this
afternoon. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2020
Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Griffin Whitney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr.
Whitney, you may begin your conference.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are
Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer.

We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation
G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website,
www.fortive.com, under the heading Investors Quarterly Results.

We completed the divestiture of the automation and specialty business on October 1, 2018, and
accordingly have included the results of the A&S business as discontinued operations for historical periods.
We completed the separation of our prior Industrial Technologies segment through the spin-off of Vontier
Corporation on October 9, 2020, and have accordingly included the results of the Industrial Technologies
segment as discontinued operations.

The results presented on this call are based on continuing operations. During the presentation, we will
describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. All references
to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing
operations basis.

During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws,
including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur
in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today.
Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-
looking statements is available in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2019, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume
any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are pleased to announce our fourth quarter
2020 results, which reflect a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted diluted net
earnings per share of $0.70, an increase of 19% year-over-year as well as total revenue growth of 4.9%,
which exceeded the high end of our guidance and included a return to positive core growth.

The quarter underlined the increased resilience of our portfolio and represented a continuation of the
sequential improvement in top line performance that we have seen since late in Q2. Despite the continued
challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, our disciplined application of the Fortive Business

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

System helped drive more than 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and a 39% increase
in free cash flow.

The better top line performance in Q4 reflected a combination of durability across the recurring revenue
portions of our portfolio and clear improvement at Fluke and Tektronix. The strength of our recurring
revenue, which now accounts for approximately 39% of our total revenue, provided an important source
of stability throughout 2020. In Q4, this was most notable among our SaaS offerings, which generated low
teens growth. The application of FBS customer success tools also continued to deliver improvements in net
revenue retention, which climbed greater than 101% for the full year. Our SaaS performance helped offset
the challenges the software businesses are having with customer site access for the provision of services
as well as extended time lines for contract renewals. The fourth quarter also saw Fluke and Tektronix
return to positive growth. Both have seen steady improvements since the middle of Q2, driven by better
point of sale trends across major geographies and continued successful new product launches.

On January 19, we disposed of our remaining 19.9% ownership stake in Vontier through a tax-efficient
debt-for-equity exchange. This transaction represents the final step in the Vontier separation. With a
combination of the Vontier spin proceeds, the debt-for-equity exchange and our continued strong free
cash flow, we have reduced our net debt by approximately $3 billion since the beginning of Q4. With a net
leverage ratio currently at approximately 1.3x, we have significant capacity to pursue key capital allocation
priorities.

With that, let's turn to the details of the quarter on Slide 4. Adjusted net earnings were $252.9 million, up
19.3% from the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.70. Total sales increased
4.9% to $1.3 billion, with core revenue up 0.7%, reflecting continued sequential improvement from the
prior quarter. Acquisitions contributed 260 basis points to growth, and favorable foreign exchange rates
increased growth by 160 basis points.

We are particularly pleased to deliver adjusted gross margins of 58.5%, representing a new high for
Fortive, which highlights the significant portfolio transformation accomplished over the last few years.
Gross margins also benefited from our ongoing investment in innovation, continued application of FBS
growth tools and another quarter of strong pricing.

Adjusted operating profit margin was 23.2% for the quarter. This reflected 130 basis points of core margin
-- operating margin expansion, including positive core OMX for each of the segments. This was the second
consecutive quarter with greater than 100 basis points of core OMX. The Q4 margin performance also
contributed to 50 basis points of positive core OMX for the full year 2020.

During the fourth quarter, we generated $313 million of free cash flow representing conversion of 124% of
adjusted net earnings and an increase of 39% year-over-year. Including this fourth quarter contribution,
our full year 2020 free cash flow was $902 million, representing conversion of 120% of adjusted net
earnings and an increase of 44% year-over-year. Our 2020 free cash flow performance, in particular,
showed the resilience of our portfolio and the power of the Fortive Business System to drive consistent,
strong increases in free cash flow.

On Slide 6 today -- of today's presentation, we show the region-by-region breakdown for the fourth
quarter, in which we continue to see sequential improvement across our major regions. In Asia, core
revenue increased by low single digits, highlighted by high single-digit growth in China and mid-single-
digit growth in India. Continued strength in China was broad-based, led by mid-20% growth in Sensing,
mid-teens growth at Fluke and high-teens growth at Advanced Sterilization Products. This strength in
China and India was offset by declines in most of the rest of Asia.

Western Europe core revenue increased by high single digits in the fourth quarter with high-teens growth
at Fluke Health Solutions, high single-digit growth at Tektronix and mid-single-digit growth in ASP.

North America core revenue was down slightly in the fourth quarter as low-teens growth in Tektronix and
high single-digit growth in Censis was primarily offset by declines in ASP and Industrial Scientific. Fluke
improved to flat core growth in North America driven by strong performance in Fluke Calibration and a
return to growth at Fluke Industrial.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Turning to our segments. Intelligent Operating Solutions posted a total revenue increase of 3.2% despite
a 0.3% decline in core revenue. Acquisitions increased growth by 170 basis points, while favorable foreign
exchange rates increased growth by 180 basis points. Core operating margin increased 280 basis points as
price realization, improved mix and higher volumes of Fluke resulted in segment-level adjusted operating
margin of 28.7%.

Fluke's core revenue returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter, increasing by low single digits.
Fluke saw another quarter of strong growth in China, which increased by mid-teens, in addition to seeing
continued improvements in North America and Western Europe, which were flat and down low single
digits, respectively. Point of sale showed improvement with North America still negative but better
sequentially, Western Europe turning positive and China continuing at a positive high single-digit rate.
Fluke saw strong performance in Fluke Calibration and Fluke Digital as well as solid growth at Fluke
Industrial. Fluke Digital was led by another strong quarter from eMaint, including low double-digit SaaS
growth. Fluke continues to see momentum from recent product launches, including its ii910 sonic imager,
which was launched in November.

Industrial Scientific core revenue declined by mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. iNet continued to see
good growth, which is more than offset by continued oil and gas-related pressure at ISC's instrumentation
and rental businesses. Separately, Intelex continued to perform well, with revenues increasing by low
double digits. The fourth quarter also represented a record bookings quarter for Intelex, which has seen
strong traction in its expansion into Western Europe. Intelex is benefiting from the implementation of FBS,
which contributed to the successful rollout of enhanced sales funnel management and digital marketing
lead generation tools.

In November, Intelex also completed the acquisition of ehsAI, a leading provider of artificial intelligence
and machine learning for the automation of permitting and regulatory compliance management. The
addition of ehsAI significantly enhances Intelex' ability to deliver applied intelligence and advanced
analytics to a broad range of customers.

At Accruent, we also saw significant sequential improvement, driven primarily by strong growth in its
SaaS offerings. While Accruent declined by low single digits for the quarter, its SaaS business increased
by mid-teens. Accruent also continued to apply FBS to drive improvement in churn in the quarter, bringing
net retention for the year to greater than 100%. Despite some continued pressure from customer site
access issues, Accruent is seeing good bookings for its Meridian engineering and information management
offering as we partner with customers on their digital transformations in highly regulated markets, such
as life science and pharma. We also continue to bring new offerings to market to address work -- return
to work requirements, including a recent win for Accruent's EMS space management software product for
Cushman & Wakefield.

Gordian declined by high single digits due to headwinds associated with budget challenges and uncertainty
across state and local government and higher education customers as well as continued site access issues.
Gordian's RSMeans business grew low single digits, driven by mid-teens growth for its SaaS offering,
supported by the successful implementation of virtual platforms for training and onboarding. Gordian also
saw signs of improvement in project activity in its job order contracting business towards the end of the
quarter.

Turning to our Precision Technologies segment. We posted a total revenue increase of 2.3% with a 0.7%
increase in core revenue. Favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 160 basis points. Core
operating margin increased 30 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of
22.2%.

Tektronix delivered mid single-digit core growth in the quarter with low-teens growth in North America and
high single-digit growth in Western Europe. Tektronix continued to benefit from better point of sale trends
in both regions with significant improvement from Q3. China saw a low single-digit decline due primarily to
the negative impact of the expansion of trade restrictions, partially offset by good year-over-year point of
sale growth and momentum from small and medium enterprise customers.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Looking across the product line, the improved top line performance in Q4 was driven by low double-
digit growth in both Keithley and the mainstream mixed-single oscilloscope -- mixed-signal oscilloscope
platforms. Growth in mainstream oscilloscopes continues to be led by the 6 Series line of scopes, which
has seen strong demand for the new 6- and 8-channel versions since they were introduced in Q3.

Sensing Technologies declined low single digits in the fourth quarter. Sensing performed well in China
with mid-20% growth driven by gains in critical environment applications, et cetera, and increased
OEM demand for Hengstler, Dynapar's factory automation offerings. North America revenue increased
slightly, while Western Europe declined low single digits, with both regions showing clear sequential
improvement. Sensing's improved top line performance was primarily due to continued strength in medical
and semiconductor end markets. Setra's recently launched AIIR Watch negative pressure machine for
isolation room applications has performed well, generating strong initial orders since its launch early in the
quarter with orders from a range of customers across medical offices, long-term care facilities and schools.

PacSci EMC declined low single digits as it continued to face COVID-19-related pressures across certain
elements of its supply chain. The company did see sequential -- clear sequential top line improvement
versus the third quarter as well as another quarter of strong bookings. EMC entered 2021 in a strong
backlog position as its leading technology and innovation capabilities continue to drive strong demand.

Moving to Advanced Health Care Solutions. Total revenue increased 12% with a 2.6% increase in core
revenue. Acquisitions added 830 basis points to growth, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased
growth by 110 basis points. Core operating margin increased 50 basis points, resulting in segment-level
adjusted operating margin of 24.1%, up significantly versus Q3 and driven by strong margin lift at ASP as
we continue to exit the transition service agreements.

ASP declined mid-single digits as pandemic-related pressure on elective procedure volumes remained
a headwind. Elective procedure volumes averaged approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels across the
company's major markets but were lower than anticipated and did not see slowing -- and did see slowing
towards the end of the quarter. ASP continued to perform well in Western Europe with mid-single-digit
growth in addition to high-teens growth in China. In the U.S., ASP declined low single digits as growth in
capital placements from improved sales execution and funnel management partially offset the weakness
in consumables revenue. ASP's service business continues to perform well with the ongoing deployment of
FBS tools helping to drive service sales and optimize service delivery processes. With additional [ day 2 ]
closings in Q4 and early 2021, approximately 99% of ASP's global revenue is now fully under our control
and off of transition service agreements.

Censis grew by high single digits in the quarter. Site access at hospitals improved early in the quarter,
only to then reverse as the quarter progressed. Censis top line performance was led by its SaaS-based
CensiTrac offering, which grew low double digits driven by a combination of new customer acquisitions and
successful upselling of existing customers. This growth was partially offset by a high single-digit decline in
professional services revenue tied directly to the ongoing challenges with customer site access.

Fluke Health Solutions generated mid single-digit growth in Q4. FHS grew slightly in North America against
a challenging comparison. This growth was led by strong performance across both Fluke biomed and
the Landauer radiation monitoring business. FHS continues to see good initial momentum across the 2
software platforms introduced over the past 12 months. OneQA, which enhances workflow efficiency and
test automation for biomedical customers; and OPTIMIZE, which provides tracking and optimization of
radiation dose management for radiology departments, both platforms reflect FHS' focus on bringing
forward software and AI-enabled revenue models to build on its strong existing recurring revenue base.

Invetech had another strong quarter with greater than 50% growth. The company saw significant sales
and order momentum throughout the year, including a strong finish in December. This growth was led
by Invetech's design and engineering offering, which more than doubled on a year-over-year basis in
Q4. The company saw strong growth in the diagnostics market driven by near-term projects to develop
rapid testing capabilities for COVID-19 as well as strong demand from the cell therapy market tied to the
production of next-generation therapeutics.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

On Slide 11, we highlight the progress made in 2020 with respect to our corporate social responsibility
efforts, which is one of our key strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, we enhanced the rigor and
integrity of our data collection by transitioning our EH&S sustainability and risk assessment processes to
the Intelex platform. Our enhanced data analytics improve insights to accelerate our sustainability efforts
and give greater transparency to key stakeholders. To support inclusion and diversity, our Employee &
Friends Resource Group focused on improving employee connections across the organization while utilizing
FBS to enhance their impact.

We also expanded our commitment to the CEO in Action (sic) [ CEO Action ] pledge by participating in
a 2021 racial equity fellowship aimed at promoting corporate best practices to address systemic racism
and social injustice. We are using FBS tools to develop standard work for greenhouse gas accounting and
reporting and scaling energy kaizen efforts more broadly across the portfolio. This has resulted in making
substantial progress towards our greenhouse gas reduction goals, which we expect to achieve ahead of
schedule.

Finally, Fortive employees around the world continue to support our local communities through our efforts
in our annual Day of Caring with over 35,000 hours of service in 60 worldwide communities. We are living
our values to achieve our CRS -- CSR goals, and we're excited to continue driving progress in the years
ahead.

Turning to guidance on Slide 12. We're instituting formal earnings guidance for the full year and the
first quarter of 2021. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.40
to $2.55, representing year-over-year growth of 15% to 22% on a continuing operations basis. The
annual guidance assumes core revenue growth of 4% to 7%, and an adjusted operating profit margin of
22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. We also expect free cash conversion to be
approximately 105% of adjusted net income. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net
earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 30%. This
includes assumptions of 5% to 8% core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to
22.5% and an effective tax rate of 14%. We also expect free cash conversion to be approximately 75% of
adjusted net income.

Before we wrap up, I'd like to thank the Fortive team for their efforts in 2020. I'm tremendously proud
of how our team rose to meet the many challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. With a focus on
keeping our employees safe, helping frontline workers combat the virus and continuing to provide our
customers with our essential technologies. Despite these challenges, we made substantial progress across
a range of strategic imperatives over the course of the year.

The focus and dedication of our team around the world enabled us to significantly transform the portfolio
while transitioning to a work-from-home environment and ensuring continued execution across the
portfolio to deliver strong margin performance and consistent free cash flow growth. As a result of that
hard work and the significant progress it enabled, we're in a strong position as we turn our focus to 2021
while navigating some of the continued challenges in the near term.

With a portfolio comprised of leading businesses that are well positioned in attractive markets,
considerable opportunity to accelerate our growth through continued investments in organic innovation
and acquisitions and the support of a strong culture rooted in the Fortive Business System, we're very
excited about the road ahead.

With that, I'd like to turn it back to Griffin.

Griffin Whitney
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Jason, we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

[ I'm sure glad for ] 2020 in the books. So just maybe for Chuck, the margin framework looks reasonable,
obviously, very strong execution in 4Q. Just sort of level set us in terms of what we should expect through
the year? Are we still sort of adding back costs in a gradual way to manage to an incremental margin of
35%? Or are we pushing to the higher incrementals?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Nigel. We're still thinking for the year the 35%, but maybe if I -- if it will help you to understand
it, we're really thinking about some of our temporary costs coming, springing back more impactfully in Q2.
So that will probably be 25% but, if you look at the other quarters, likely to be 40% in Qs 1, 3 and 4. And
maybe that's a better margin profile for us going forward. Is that helpful for what you're looking for?

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Absolutely, yes. That's great. And then just homing in on AHS, 3% to 6% in both 1Q in 2021, I'd have
thought that maybe the growth rate might accelerate beyond 1Q, especially as ASP maybe normalizes
against easier comps. So just curious on sort of [ the thinking around the framework ] there.

And then maybe Invetech, sounds like that's got some real life sciences and biopharma applications. Just
wondering, what sort of revenue base we have Invetech right now?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's interesting because we don't really talk about Invetech now that it's in a smaller segment.
Obviously, a little bit more material, but I think the more important thing is, given the strength of the
business and the work they did, a little bit of an opportunity to talk about the good work they're doing.
That business that we were talking about in the prepared remarks, Nigel, is really focused on really design
and engineering resources for diagnostic companies as an example. So just think of it as outsourced
engineering capability and, as we said in the prepared remarks, a number of opportunities around testing
companies that were looking at COVID-19 and also, maybe more broadly and more longer-term, in cell
therapeutics. So a number of opportunities.

The business is a little bit lumpy because of the nature of the business model. We're working to change
that over time. The leadership team has done a nice job of that, but I think, first and foremost, they've
done a nice job of growing the business. They were up -- I think, for the year, up over 20%. So a good --
roughly, think of it as an under-$100 million business, so that kind of number.

Relative to ASP, I think your question was around AHS and the growth rate at AHS if I had it right. But I'll
talk about AHS and ASP in terms of the growth rate. We certainly have good growth. If we were to think
about the guide we've got out there, AHS will probably be one of our better growers. They'll run into a
couple of comp issues at FHS, an example in Invetech in the second half. But I think if we were to look on
a 2-year stack basis, you would see progressively better growth through the year at AHS, and that's on
the backs of, really, ASP continuing to be good.

There is an assumption there that we get vaccinated here, that hospitals get elective procedures back on
track by the second half. I think that's a comfortable assumption at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Thanks for giving all of that detail in the slides. Maybe a first question around the free cash flow guidance.
So you clearly had an exceptional 2020 with that 120% adjusted conversion. It's guided to moderate
maybe to 105%, I think, this year, so maybe in absolute dollars growing low or mid-single digits
versus that high-teens earnings increase. Maybe help us understand how much of that is just kind of
conservatism. Or is something happening with working capital or those prepaid expenses or CapEx coming
back or something?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Julian, this is Chuck. Thanks for the question. Yes, there's a couple of things I want to point out on the
free cash flow. We're very proud of how we managed through the year in 2020. Going forward, though,
keep in mind there's some tailwinds that came in through the year relative to the CARES Act. And not only
did we get a moratorium on some of those taxes that we have to pay back over the next 2 years, but we
also have to reinstate that. So we need to -- we're a little overstated in -- not overstated. 2020 came in
stronger because of that, but that's about a $50 million headwind in 2021.

And then the second part would be around working capital. As we start to reengage and see growth here,
we think it's prudent to put to say that our turns may not go down, but it will probably be a little bit of use
of cash as we grow those businesses. So we've got another $50 million for that. Those are the 2 biggest
things that's going on there.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then my second question really on that revenue guidance for the PT segment. So you're starting out
in Q1 with low double-digit even core growth perhaps. The year's guided mid-single digit. Second quarter
should have an easy comp. So it looks like you're dialing in a fairly steep slowdown in the back half of the
year. Is that based on sort of the experience of prior upturns and how quickly you can get that surge and
then a fade again? I'm just trying to understand some of the main assumptions in that core sales guide at
PT.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure. So you really got -- you got to a couple of pieces there. You got Sensing business and Tek are
the 2 big pieces there, Julian. I think #1 is, if you look on a 2-year stack, we'd see the business continuing
to do pretty well. So some of it has a little bit just to do with the comps. The growth rates will look a little
bit lower in the second half, but fundamentally, if we look over a 2-year period, we'll see those business
kind of continue. I don't think we have a plan for it to jump, though, either. So I think -- right now, I think,
with the visibility, particularly on the sensing side, we're probably a little bit more prudent just to dial in
what we think will happen without any extensive situation.

So as I mentioned before on the question, as we look at the guide, we see AHS probably being -- if
we think about it on a 2-year stack basis, AHS probably being better -- IOS being better and then PT
being maybe a little bit less than other 2. So I think that's the right way to be. But again, strength of the
business, and we'll see how the remaining part of the year plays out relative to some of the economic
situations that we obviously were tracking.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Jim and Chuck, just relative to the full year guide here, 4% to 7%, obviously has some easy comps along
the way and a few aches and pains in terms of site access for some of the businesses, but is there any
reason to believe that this is not with the new portfolio kind of the -- within the steady-state growth
algorithm for the business as it stands today given all the changes?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I certainly think it's reasonable. We wouldn't have put an unreasonable guide out there. And I think
it's based on a couple of things: #1 is, I would say -- again, this is where the -- a lot going on in 2020, as
you mentioned, region -- different regional comps and things like that. But I think as we looked at on a 2-
year stack, we continue to improve sequentially through the year without any unreasonable need for the
economy to come back.

But on the same token, we're still in a level of uncertainty here. We're still at -- we really don't know the
exact date at which COVID will open up offices and get customers back up and fully running. So I think
when we look at it, continuing to get better through the year, we make a bunch of our own luck like we
did in 2020 where, as you know, we were basically over 1% overall in the year. So I think we'll continue
to make our own luck. And if things play out a little bit better economically, then certainly, fundamentally,
you'd probably see a bigger number. But I think for now, with the level of uncertainty out there and the
trajectory that we ended on, I think this is a strong guide.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe if you wouldn't mind spending a moment on the M&A
environment. Obviously, it's SPAC city out there. Multiples are high. I think a lot of the things that maybe
some of these emerging folks in the market are going off to look an awful lot like what could be a Fortive
business maybe at the right multiple. How do you view the competition for assets or scarcity value for
that matter given that there still may be some reluctance to sell for better businesses who are still feeling
COVID effects?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Great question. Very timely, obviously. We're -- I think we've been very busy in the last 6 months, if
I were to characterize our efforts. We certainly, I think, continue to believe in the strength of our funnels.
We've been active and looked at some things that, quite frankly, we feel very disciplined and responsible
relative to the environment.

But I -- so I think the real question is, are there opportunities out there for us? And we think that we
definitely think there are. We think there are great businesses that can become part of Fortive. We are
active in the cultivation despite the virtual nature of that. As you may have noted, we hired a new VP of
Strategy that we announced on Monday. So we're resourcing our capability. There's hardware and software
opportunities.

So I think the breadth of opportunities out there -- but you have to -- you're right. We have to be
selective. We have to understand our markets. We have to be able to be in a position to understand to be
where we can win and not have to pay unreasonable prices. And quite frankly, we've seen some things
transacted, things we wouldn't do. But fundamentally, I think if we think over the next 12 to 18 months,
while M&A is unpredictable, I feel pretty confident we could put some cash to work that will bring in great
businesses for Fortive.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Just a couple of quick questions. Just first of all, when I look at the full year '21 adjusted op profit margin
guide, the 22% to 23%, if I look at it and break it down by business groups, it looks like maybe at the
midpoint of some of these numbers that maybe we're looking for a 50 basis point improvement at IOS
and 50 at PT. The AHS business has about a 2 -- if I'm doing this -- the math right here, about 200 basis
points of margin improvement year-over-year. Is that mix or exiting the TSA? Or what's -- is that just pure
leverage if procedures come back?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Rick, this is Chuck. I'll take that. The biggest issue is really exiting the TSAs as we get into 2021. You get
quite a step up there. Obviously, there's a lot of things going on in that business, with good position on
margin. But I think what you're seeing is the TSAs rolling off.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. And just as that business recovers, is that likely to be the highest adjusted operating profit margin
business within Fortive -- or business group within Fortive if you go out a year or 2?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

I think that there's room certainly to grow as elective procedures are down, and that's some high-margin
business that we're missing right now. So we'll see it, but as you can see, we've got a -- I think there's
a 3-horse race here. So I won't bet against any one of our groups, but I do think there's good margin
expansion at health, for sure.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

And Rick, I would just add on the margin front. One of the things that's really important and maybe
gets missed, isn't seen is, as we continue to add innovation and technology capability into the software
businesses, part of that move to SaaS is a move of less services, and we're able to do installations at a
lower cost. So if you look over the long term, the margin profile on the software businesses, we get real
leverage through the technology [ we work ]. And that's not just something you'll necessarily maybe see
in 2021. You'll see it in some of the businesses. But I think over a long period of time -- IOS is obviously
an incredibly profitable segment, but the opportunity there to continue to do the work, apply FBS into our
services business to make our applications easier for customers to install fundamentally is a big margin
opportunity as well.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then just maybe my last question, just around pricing. How do you view pricing as we roll --
or for '21? And maybe what kind of net price capture do you suspect you'll get relative to some of the
inflation we're seeing in electronics and other things?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, we had a very good year in price as we noted on the call or in the prepared remarks. I think we had
a good fourth quarter. We had a good year on price. We expect to have another good year on price. So I
would say, first and foremost, we're probably -- for sure, probably close to 100 basis points.

We do not have a lot of -- one of the things about the sort of inflation is -- maybe something just to
level set. Now with 40% recurring revenue in the portfolio and most of that being software or very little
material costs, we now have a big portion of our revenue profile that really isn't -- doesn't have supply

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

chain cost inflation pressure. So the portfolio has really shifted in that regard. So while we see some
of the supply chain stuff, maybe a little bit on the freight side, but I think fundamentally, we've done a
great job over the years of really pushing on that and then while, at the same time, really looking for
the price opportunities for what we call price realization from an FBS perspective through a combination
of innovation and better commercial practices. So on the back of a very good 2020, we expect to have
another good year in '21.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just to pick up a little bit on the M&A topic and kind of leverage it, I guess, no pun intended, over to --
thinking about the balance sheet. Do you adjust in any way your view of kind of comfort level on financial
leverage here? Where are you comfortable to go in this environment? And any other perspective there
would be interesting.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Jeff, this is Chuck. Yes, I don't think our view on leverage has changed. I think that what we've been
talking about is that we deploy our free cash flow as you go through times. But like, we -- you saw us
do in 2019, we'll stretch, take it up even up over 3.5%, but then we'll work to bring it back down. We
feel very comfortable with anything under 2x net leverage. But I think that what you'll see is what you've
seen over the last few years. There'll be periods where we will elevate, but then you'll see us take steps to
delever.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And unrelated, just kind of channel dynamics, I think, on Fluke, you said, I think, mid-teens growth in
China but high single-digit POS. Are you seeing kind of significant channel fill, refill in other businesses or
other markets? Was that a significant part of the top line equation here in the fourth quarter?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Jeff. No, it was not. I think, as you know, we do a good job where we have our principal channel
businesses, being Fluke and Tek. We had good sales [ going ] in most regions of the world. We get good
inventory levels. No precipitous change really on the inventory side. Inventories have been low and really
nothing from a macro perspective that would suggest we've seen any inventory build of any magnitude.
Some of the China dynamic is on the point of sale side versus the revenue side.

There is a little bit -- you typically see a little bit of a difference in China in the fourth quarter as people
sort of get prepared for the Chinese New Year, and so it isn't unusual for us to outgain a few basis points
a point of sale in the fourth quarter. That's not an unusual situation. But I think as we look at where we're
at right now, as we sit, sort of the end of January, we're in pretty good shape relative -- on a global basis
relative to channel inventory.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Great. I'm sorry. Can I sneak one more in? Just on advanced healthcare. It almost doesn't seem
mathematically possible that core OMX would only be up 50 bps if ASP was up 300 bps. Is there just some
oddity in the way you're kind of accounting for the TSAs or something there in that description?

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Yes. So we had really strong margin performance at ASP, but it was offset by -- as I mentioned,
Invetech grew 50% in the quarter, and they're a lower-margin business. As I mentioned, the design and
engineering part of that is more of a people business so it doesn't have the same margin profile. So it's
really a mix issue. If we really look at kind of the core ongoing margin profile of the business, which is
made up of mostly ASP and Fluke Health, we are in very good shape in the fourth quarter, and we're going
to exit well, as Chuck mentioned, some of the TSA falloff plus a lot of the good integration work we've
done at ASP. We'll have a good 2021 in AHS. But a 50% growth rate in one quarter in a business does
tend to mix it down a little bit.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

You mentioned -- can you guys hear me, okay?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we can.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay, good. Sorry. Jim, you mentioned the new hire. I think his name is Read Simmons. Can you just -- it
seems like kind of a -- he has a pretty darn good resume, but what's the mandate? What are you looking
for? And why weren't you able to fill that seat internally?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think a couple of things. We had filled the seat internally for a while, and we decided that, I think
as we continue -- Scott, I sort of think of it this way, and we have a 10-year plan. We just updated
the Board over the next 5 years. We've got a lot of skills around the things we've done over the last 5
years, but as we think forward, having somebody with Read's resume, who understands software, who
understands the continuous improvement tools of software as well as private equity, that's a combination
of skills, quite frankly, that is really a great opportunity. And from time to time, we're going to look outside
to supplement and complement the great team we have, and this was a very unique situation where we
have an opportunity to do that.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Yes, it seems so. In kind of that spirit, I mean, is there any meaningful change to R&D spend, CapEx,
anything growth related that now that we're kind of on our way to being post COVID, at least, you can
play a little bit more offense?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I would say -- Chuck can talk about the CapEx side. I think in general, the answer is, yes, we're --
I mean our R&D spend has gone up a little bit as we've -- as we come -- have more software businesses,
which tend to have a little bit more R&D. We're investing a lot more into The Fort.

We actually invested a lot last year, but we're doubling down in that -- in our data analytics and machine
learning, as we noted in the commentary. We talked about the ehsAI acquisition, which is really an acqui-
hire, very little revenue but really just a really smart group of data scientists who can help accelerate our
EH&S work. So I think those are good -- that's a situation where we're really just hiring a big R&D team
and a great capability and leadership. So I think those -- a number of those investments -- we talked

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

about our Pioneers Square Labs. We've doubled down in that. So yes, there's a number of places where
we are playing offense.

You saw some of that -- you heard some of that in the fourth quarter, right, some of the hardware,
sonic imager, the [ scopes of Tek ], but also things like -- at Accruent, we had -- we launched our latest
analytics product with Maintenance Connection at Accruent. So a number of places where we're in playing
offense, and we feel pretty good about how we can drive that in 2021, as you said, as we start to see sort
of COVID start to slow down here, hopefully.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

And Scott, I'd just add that, with post separation of Vontier, 2 things: One is we'll be pushing 7% R&D
from maybe more closer to 6%. So that's reflecting with Jim's comments as well. And then on CapEx, I
think we've always been pretty CapEx light, but as the -- our software businesses become 10% of the
total, you're going to expect to see that, the CapEx, certainly not go up here, and we'll maintain -- remain
CapEx light going forward and maybe even start to trend down a little bit.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kasowitz from Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Jim, maybe you could give us a little more color on how you're thinking about the rate of recovery at
Gordian and Accruent. You've talked for a couple of quarters now about constrained state and local spend
but also that these businesses should be relatively solid going forward given the focus on workplace
space, buildings management. So how much visibility do you have in these kinds of businesses for better
performance in '21?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, yes, we -- I mean we definitely think the businesses are going to get better in '21. We saw a couple
of good evidence points in Q4. I mentioned the SaaS growth of double digits. That was a good sign. We
won twice as many logos in Q4 as we did in Q3, so I think those are really good signs for how we enter
the year.

We do need customer access to do some things, but we do have some wonderful opportunities, as
you mentioned. We talked about the EMS space planning win. We're thinking -- we have a number of
applications that we'll be launching around employee experience. So a number -- as companies start to
think about bringing teams back to the office for periods of time. So I think we've got a number of things
that will help us make our own luck, but we do need to see some of that office access. So I think you'll see
the business progressively get better through the year.

On Gordian, Gordian has been in great shape. They were growing double-digit before COVID, really been
a really strong performer for us. We have some visibility into how things are changing at this point, as
I mentioned, in the prepared remarks around job order contracting. We start to see the projects get
loaded even though they might not be purchasing through the system yet. So that's starting to improve.
I suspect we see that improve, and as state and local budgets start to get approved into the second half
of the year, we would expect to see things continuing. We know hire -- if you think about the second half
of the year, it's logical to think that state and local offices are going to start to want to bring people back,
and they're going to need -- they're going to need to change the workplace.

And that's -- we're not about new buildings. We're about changing the buildings you have, changing
the structures you have. And that -- I think a number of those things are going to start to characterize
themselves as we get further into the year. So I think that's the visibility we have, and we feel good about
the work the teams -- our teams are doing to put them in place for success.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then I'm curious about your semiconductor business within Sensing. There's obviously a lot of [ cross-
cuts ] still out there, geopolitical, global semiconductor shortage. It looks like you're still seeing good
growth there. So maybe talk about that business for 2021, if you could.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's pretty much with OEM -- we call it semiconductor, but it's mostly semiconductor equipment
manufacturers. And that business has turned pretty well. So we still -- we think it's good for at least
another quarter or 2. So right now, that's about the visibility we have. So I think that's probably where we
stand right now. You didn't ask it, but we saw good growth at Keithley on the semiconductor side as well
in Tektronix. I think some of that was pent-up demand that we saw, but it would be logical to think that if
supply chain issues occur and some more money may get spent there, that would be some benefit. But we
haven't dialed that into our forecast at this point.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

So just a question on Tektronix. You highlighted, I think, some sort of trade-related issues in China. And I
just want to understand, what are the trade restrictions for Tektronix in China? And do you expect them to
be a drag for the rest of the year? And then just given what's happened, given your exposure to the tech
segment in China, how do you grow in China from sort of the [ reset-based ] demand?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think, first of all, we had about $2 million worth of Huawei in there. So I think, first, if you step
back, the -- we call that out because it's an impact to Tektronix in China, but in the big scheme of things
relative to Fortive, these aren't big impacts. I think the last of the Huawei impact, as an example, is a
couple of million dollars to Tek in the quarter. We do have some additional restrictions around military end
use that we're seeing but -- again, maybe a little bit of a headwind for Tek but not a major issue for the
rest of the company, not impactful relative to the overall Fortive.

But in terms of transparency and to give you color on what we're seeing, the good news, as we said in
the prepared remarks, is we continue to see point of sale in a good place, and we also saw good demand
among medium -- small and medium customers. So Chuck and I did China reviews a couple of weeks
ago, and we're really pleased with the work the China team -- the Tek China team has done to extend
themselves more with digital. And they're just doing a great job of really doing -- expanding into new
customer sets, which I think is going to bode well for us in the future.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

And just a question on software and also a question on SaaS. What was overall software growth all in for
2020? And what's your SaaS ARR at this point?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

So I'm thinking here. Our SaaS growth in the year was probably close to high single digits, probably,
maybe -- yes. So I think that's probably right. I don't have an ARR number for the year. So we can get
back to you on that. I think what we saw relative to overall software was probably a little down because

16

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

of the -- in the low- to mid-single digits, if we were to look through the year, just based on the soft -- the
services issues.

In terms of performance, Censis and Intelex led the way in terms of growth. They grew through the year
as well as eMaint. So we have good growth in those places. The places where we saw maybe a little bit
greater impact relative to some of the services was at Gordian and Accruent. So hopefully, that gives you
a little color, and we can get back to you on the overall ARR number.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

But in Accruent, just to follow-up on Andy's question, I mean, it's just you sort of cite budget in education
and state budget. I mean the funding for, I think, education, state budget's in good shape. So that
actually, given what has already happened into 2021, that should actually improve, right?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, for sure. I think when you look at the situation of what educational -- this is mostly higher education,
by the way, higher education and state and local buildings, inevitably, when they bring people back to
the office, they're fundamentally going to have to change with social distancing and make changes to the
facilities. And fundamentally, that's the core part of what we see in Gordian. So in that case -- and then
from a facilities management space planning, that's also in the wheelhouse of Accruent. So we should see
those things come back for sure. Again, don't -- can't pick a particular date, but I think if I were to make a
bet, it's going to get better through every quarter of the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I'd like to stay right on that topic where Andrew left off. On the software side, where you've had site
access issues and not being able to provide on-site services, is -- will there be a catch-up? Or will any of
those services be lost?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

This is a -- it's a very temporary -- or I think it's a temporary situation. So by nature of that, we'll
probably see a catch-up, whether that's a catch-up in the year and if people -- there's also -- part of this
is people reevaluating budgets a little bit. So we sort of classify all of that as a delay, but I think we're
practical in the sense that maybe some of that is customers reassessing how many seats they want, how
many licenses they want on the licensed software side, but we've seen a little bit of that compression. So I
would expect there'll be a little bit of that, but to the broader question, Deane, I would expect there will be
a catch-up at some point in the year maybe as things get back, what I would call back to normal.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And what's the mix look like now? Is it like 2/3 SaaS, 1/3 transactional? And how do you expect
that to evolve?

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Got it. Okay. And then just a quick question or a clarification on ASP. So the high-teens growth in China,
I would imagine that there was a benefit there where more elective procedures have started. But is that
93% elective procedure you cite, is that a global number? And what does that look like in China?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a global number. It's probably -- it's not at 100% yet in China as we think about the fourth
quarter, but it's moving up. I would say part of our China growth as well was equipment. We've been doing
well on the equipment side. So I think as we look across -- and quite frankly, across the board, maybe
stepping back, at ASP, we did an excellent job in equipment sales in the year. We're going to start with a
bigger installed base than we did a year ago. And obviously, that bodes well for when consumables come
back.

So to your specific question, it was a combination of -- it was also a big improvement in services. One of
the things that we've really been doing, Deane, in China was that, when we first bought the business, we
were lucky that this was a business that we took control of early. One of the things we noticed was that
the service revenue was a lower percentage of our sales in China than it was anywhere else in the world.
So we applied a number of FBS tools, including policy deployment, to make service revenue a big push for
us in the business. And we really, really increased the percent -- the stickiness or the connection rate with
our equipment and increased service contracts with current customers. So the growth was very much a
story of not only electives coming back but also equipment, and the big story was service.

Your next question comes from the line from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I have 2 as well. I guess, first off, on the M&A discussion, and I'd love to understand, given the Vontier
sale and the addition to your core dev team, is the focus going to be just to bolster the software, the
recurring business across the 3 segments? Or is there a desire to sort of add a fourth leg to the stool? And
I don't know if the stool has 4 legs but a fourth leg to the Fortive portfolio, if you may. How do you kind of
think about those dynamics?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

I think we're incredibly [ glad ] right now to be in an area where all 3 segments, I think, have incredible
opportunities. I mentioned the $30-plus billion [ worth of served ] market. We've just completed our
next 5-year -- or our update to our 10-year plan that we did 5 years ago with the Board, and we feel
very excited. And really, I think I would say -- if I were a betting person, I would say most of our capital
deployed in the current segments is probably the winning bet. We have a lot of opportunity. We see the
breadth and depth within both hardware, software and services, within all 3. So I think when I really think
about -- I'd never say never because you never know when an opportunity becomes available, but I think
the focus -- we're blessed with the focus that we have, and I think we're going to take advantage of that
as we move forward.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And then if I could just ask you, when you've talked about the impact from COVID through calendar
'20, you've talked about the revenue impact kind of being on elective surgery and site access side, and we
also have operational impact from there. Is there a way to think about how much revenues you may have
left on the table this year and how much costs you have to borrow -- or take on because of COVID? And
then how do those 2 numbers stack up in calendar '21?

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2021

Well, I don't know if I could put a revenue number to it. But if I think about us being -- maybe the easy
thing to do would be to say, if we were down 6% core in the year, and we should be -- this portfolio can
grow mid-single digits, you can apply that number to our total portfolio and say, over a 12- to 24-month
period, you'd think that, that would come back over time. That's a big number, but I would expect that
some of it is that. So I think that's first and foremost. I'll let Chuck talk about some of the costs coming
back.

But I think maybe the point too is there's also -- COVID has been a challenge for the year for all of us,
everybody on this call, but it's also created a number of opportunities. We -- particularly in our -- whether
it's the focus more on EH&S at every company in the world, and we have an outstanding portfolio of EH&S
businesses. And now the continued increase and people wanting to focus on sustainability or the facilities
management challenges that come with bring people back to the office and to manufacturing sites and
the importance of data as it relates to workers and those things, all of those speak to all the solutions that
we've made part of Fortive over the last 4 years. So I think we also have to think about when we get into
what I'll call a normal environment, that fundamentally, there's going to be tremendous opportunity for us
to harness around a number of these new challenges that we're all going to have to deal with as business
leaders, and we have the solutions to ultimately deal with -- help them deal with those challenges.

So I think -- and that doesn't even talk about the sterilization and infection control challenges that
hospitals are thinking about as well and the solutions we have on the EH&S side. So I think when you add
that in, you'll come up with some pretty big numbers of opportunity.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And really quick on the cost. I think what we saw last year, so we took some cost out, and it's coming
back in, and we've rebalanced it and we're operating to a margin idea. But in the COVID environment
going forward, there's going to be some incremental cost associated with that. But I think what we've
seen in 2021 are more opportunities to be more efficient, not having to go be on site all the time and
things around travel. And I think there's more opportunity for us to create more leverage that way in total,
but there'll be puts and takes there as we go forward.

Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So maybe going back to the SaaS business. Curious if you've seen any discernible change in kind of the
growth that's coming from the retention and churn side of the equation versus maybe the upselling and
normal kind of price escalators you have there. Any change in what's driving the growth?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think -- this has been -- I mean we don't talk a lot about it, but to have net retention over 100%
when customers are reevaluating things and looking for cost reductions, I think, is an outstanding effort
on the part of our commercial teams. We have -- so we've seen -- we've not seen customer churn, but
we may have seen maybe people wanting to reduce their spend or something like that. But we've been
able to maintain a lot of that, keep that net retention number over 100%, and I think that's -- we have a
number of FBS tools that are -- and quite frankly, data analytics solutions that we apply to those types of
things to predict what are the characteristics of a customer that might potentially churn. So I think, John,
we've done good work to mitigate some of that.

I think, in a normal year, you'd think that our net retention might be a little -- would be higher than that
number. So I think that's a little bit of a little bit less upselling and maybe, in this environment, maybe a
slight little bit of churn. It depends on the business. Several of our businesses have actually decreased

churn, Accruent as an example. So I think that's the environment we come into this year. And from here, I
think we're definitely through the toughest days in that regard.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got you. And then maybe just one on the tax rate and kind of the sustainability of that going forward.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, John. What we put in here is the tax rate of 14% going forward, and that reflects our
businesses as it is and the tax rules as we understand them going forward. What we haven't done is try to
factor in any potential changes around the Biden administration might do. I would expect that those would
-- changes if and when they come, would be 2022, but if they do something interim, we'll, of course,
react to that. So right now, we think if nothing changed, which never happens, by the way, but this would
be the right rate. So we're going to watch very carefully about what gets proposed and understand the
impact. Keep in mind, with the acquisitions we've done, we've got a really global footprint, which gives us
maybe more opportunities for maintaining an advantage in tax going forward, but we'll have to see what
they do.

Operator

Your final question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

You kind of steal -- stole my question on tax there. But hopefully, you're accruing a nice bonus for your
tax team. They're doing a heck of a job. But do you feel like there's almost like some sort of a target on
the new administration for a company like set up this way, like a large U.S. company that has significant
declines in tax rate? Or is it something that you feel like is pretty defensible?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Well, we think it's very defensible, and what we are doing is interpreting the tax laws as written. And what
gives us maybe an advantage over some other companies is, one, post separation, we've got a high R&D
tax investment -- or R&D investment, and that gives us an advantage in the R&D tax credit; and also,
as you do acquisitions, in foreign countries, it just creates a fact pattern that we're just following the tax
line as it's written. So -- but those are kind of 2 big factors. Especially the ASP acquisition in Europe a few
years back, that helps us out quite a bit.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And then last for me, the core OMX in the quarter, stronger [indiscernible] on the [ lightest ] revenue
there. So like, is there some kind of like one-offs there that allowed that kind of magnitude on -- is it a
comp thing mostly? Or how do we think about that?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

It's continued -- it's the volume coming back. So I think that's first and foremost. We see a business
like Fluke coming back. That's the high-margin business. You saw 280 basis points of core OMX at IOS.
It's the strength of the SaaS growth in the software businesses, but it was across the board. So IOS
certainly led the pack, as you know, on a quarterly basis. There's always one segment that leads the pack
a little bit more than the others. But I think what we saw was the breadth of OMX. And I think, as we
sit here looking into 2021, the 50 basis points that we grew OMX despite all the issues in 2020, gives us
tremendous confidence that we can continue to do that in '21.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

And the only thing, Joe, I'd add to that is the -- this is what can happen. When you beat the top end of
your range with high 50s gross margins, it's a happy problem now.

Operator

That concludes Q&A. I'll turn the call back to management for closing remarks.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, thanks, everyone, for today. We appreciate your time. We went a little over, but we knew we had a
few -- a little bit longer prepared remarks. So glad we could get to everyone. Thanks so much for your
support this year in 2020 and certainly into '21. We're all hoping you're safe and healthy and look forward
to hopefully seeing everybody in person sometime this year.

Until then, we'll take all your questions by phone and virtually. We look forward to seeing you there, and
have a great day. And obviously, Griffin and team are available for questions. Thanks, everyone. Have a
great night.

Operator
That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
